The study, published in the March 2024 issue of Menopause, tracked 15 years of data from nearly 2,000 women who were 18 to 30 years old at the study's start. Participants who reported having migraines and persistent ""vasomotor symptoms"" — the medical term describing hot flashes and night sweats — earlier in adulthood were 51% more likely to develop cardiovascular disease over the next 15 years when compared with women who seldom or never experienced the same problems. Stroke risk was even higher — 70% — among women with migraines and persistent vasomotor symptoms over the study period. Women who experience both migraines and early, persistent hot flashes and night sweats can offset the risks for heart disease and stroke by quitting smoking and promptly treating conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, the study authors said.

https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20230619/cm/west-nile-virus-cases-rising-nationwide,West Nile Virus Cases Rising Nationwide Amid Mosquito Season,1,"June 19, 2023 – State and local health officials around the country are reporting the first cases of West Nile virus of the season in humans and urging people to take action to protect themselves from the mosquito-borne disease. In the past 2 weeks, new cases have been reported in Iowa and Nebraska, adding to previous 2023 reports from Arizona, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming. A mosquito at a monitoring site near Houston tested positive last week for the potentially fatal virus, prompting local health officials to begin evening spray operations in the area where the mosquito was found, according to an announcement from Harris County Public Health. According to the CDC, which compiles local reports, there have been 13 human cases of West Nile virus in 2023. In 2022, there were 1,126 cases, including 90 deaths. Among this year’s 13 cases reported to the CDC so far, eight people add severe neuroinvasive disease, which means the disease spread to the nervous system. Such severe symptoms typically occur in 1 in every 150 cases of West Nile virus, and can include encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, which is inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Three of the neuroinvasive cases occurred earlier this year amid an outbreak in Maricopa County, AZ, where the disease is considered endemic, according to an April 28 report from the CDC. The CDC says West Nile virus is the most common disease spread by mosquitoes in the continental U.S. Local health officials sample mosquitoes to guide mosquito control strategies. So far this year, the CDC has received 28 reports of mosquitoes testing positive. Those mosquito testing reports came from Arizona, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, and Texas. West Nile virus is transmitted to people by the bite of an infected mosquito, but it can also be spread to humans if they handle a dead bird that is infected. The CDC says there are no medications to treat the virus in people. Most people who are infected do not feel sick, and 1 in 5 people infected develop a fever and other symptoms like headache, body ache, or a rash. Prevention strategies are to wear insect repellent and to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants to avoid mosquito bites.",7,-0.23368418,-0.22169954

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/harvard-study-even-weekend-warriors-achieve-heart-benefits,Harvard study: Even weekend warriors achieve heart benefits,1,"We're all supposed to exercise for at least 150 minutes per week. But if daily activity is a challenge, maybe you can squeeze a week's worth of exercise into one or two days per week. This ""weekend warrior"" approach is linked to the same heart-healthy benefits as daily exercise, according to a Harvard study published July 18, 2023, in JAMA. Researchers analyzed the health data and physical activity of almost 90,000 people (average age 62) who fit into one of three categories: they exercised throughout the week, jammed all exercise into one or two days a week, or didn't exercise at all. Participants wore fitness trackers for a week and were then followed for about six years. Compared with people who didn't exercise, weekend warriors had a 27% lower risk for heart attacks, a 38% lower risk for heart failure, a 22% lower risk for atrial fibrillation, and a 21% lower risk for stroke. The numbers were similar for people who exercised throughout the week. The study was observational and doesn't prove that the weekend warrior pattern is as good for the heart as daily exercise. But if you're pressed for time, the concentrated approach might help you reach your weekly exercise goals until you can get back to a daily routine. Just don't overdo it if you're not used to a lot of activity. Build up your minutes gradually. Image: © Alistair Berg/Getty Images",6,0.20523956,-0.27340144

""We are getting destroyed and it's very recent,"" Dr. Means told Rogan and his audience. ""And it's accelerating."" As of this writing, about 74 percent of, or one in four, Americans is either overweight or obese – and that figure seems to be rising all the time. Young adults are also developing cancer at a rate of 79 percent higher compared to 10 years ago. ""Twenty-five percent of men under 40 now have erectile dysfunction,"" Dr. Means added.

""The American food supply is literally poison"" Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been saying many of the same things while campaigning, both as an independent candidate for president and as a top pick for Donald Trump's cabinet should the former president win a second term. Like Kennedy, Dr. Means understands that something is very, very wrong with public health in America today, especially compared to not that long in the past when most people were generally considered to be healthy. ""Alzheimer's, dementia are going through the roof,"" Dr. Means warned. ""Young adult dementias have increased, like, three times since 2012. So, early onset dementias."" Even more disturbing is the risk of developing cancer, which is higher than ever. Today, one out of every two people, or 50 percent of the population, will develop cancer at some point in life, while another one in 36 will develop autism. ""That was one in 150 in the year 2000,"" Dr. Means explained about how autism was relatively rare even as recently as the turn of the century. ""In California where I live, [autism rates are] one in 22. One in 22 with a lifetime neurodevelopmental disorder."" Every year, infertility rates increase by another percentage point, she continued, while 77 percent of young Americans are no longer even eligible to serve in the military because of obesity and / or drug use. Then there is the autoimmune disease crisis, which is increasing by a whopping 13 percent year over year.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-genetically-modified-crops-growing-threat-health-environment.html,Genetically modified crops: A growing threat to health and the environment,0,"Bioengineered foods and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are commonly confused with each other, but they have different meanings. ""Bioengineered"" describes food and products that are enhanced with scientific techniques to add particular traits. In contrast, ""GMOs"" involve changing the genetic makeup of animals, plants or microbes in ways that do not occur naturally using methods like genetic engineering. Health risks posed by GM foods Some notable issues related to the consumption of GM foods and products include the following: Allergic reactions Genetic modifications can transfer allergens from one food to another. For instance, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) revealed that soybeans engineered with a Brazil nut gene caused allergic reactions in people who are nut-sensitive. This led to the withdrawal of some products due to this serious risk. Without proper labeling, people with allergies can unknowingly consume these harmful ingredients. New allergens GM food and products might also introduce new allergens. The genetic changes can create novel proteins not previously in the human diet, potentially triggering allergic responses . Despite warnings from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists about this risk, mandatory long-term testing for new allergens is not required, leaving many consumers, especially children, at risk of severe allergic reactions. Antibiotic resistance GM foods and products could potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance, making it harder to treat infections. According to the Food Standards Agency , most GM foods contain ""antibiotic resistance markers ,"" which help identify successful genetic modifications. However, introducing these markers into the food supply might render essential antibiotics, like ampicillin, ineffective against bacterial infections. This concern led several European countries, including Britain, to ban certain GM crops for fear of the spread of antibiotic resistance. Despite warnings from scientists, the FDA has continued to allow these markers in GM foods even though public health experts view them as a significant threat. Cancer risk In 1993, the FDA approved the use of genetically engineered recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH ) to boost milk production in cows, assuring consumers of its safety. However, Canada and Europe later banned the treatment due to concerns about animal and human health. Research has shown that dairy from rBGH-treated cows has higher levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone linked to breast, colon and prostate cancers . While the FDA overlooked studies showing that IGF-1 can survive digestion and enter the bloodstream – increasing cancer risk – the American Cancer Society states there is no current evidence linking GMOs to cancer and more long-term research is needed. Immunosuppression A study published in The Lancet by Dr. Arpad Pusztai and Stanley W.B. Ewen, funded by the Scottish government, investigated the effects of GM potatoes containing the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) on rats. The research found that rats consuming these potatoes experienced negative impacts on their immune function, metabolism and organ development . Although the biotechnology industry criticized Pusztai's work, they haven't provided any studies to disprove his findings. Additionally, 22 leading scientists have supported the validity of animal tests linking GM foods to immuno-suppression. Loss of nutrition Genetic engineering can reduce the nutritional value of food. In 1992, FDA scientists warned that altering foods genetically might lead to ""undesirable changes in nutrient levels."" They highlighted the risk that these changes could go unnoticed without specific testing. Despite these concerns, the FDA chose not to require mandatory testing for nutritional content in GM foods. Toxicity GM foods are unstable by nature. The process of inserting new genes into food is unpredictable, with no way to ensure the added genetic material doesn't create harmful effects. This randomness means that each gene insertion could potentially turn safe food into something toxic . FDA scientists were aware of this risk before setting their policy of no mandatory testing. They warned that genetic engineering could increase known toxins, introduce new ones, or cause foods to absorb more environmental toxins, like heavy metals and pesticides. Despite these warnings, the FDA chose to ignore the potential dangers and didn’t require toxicological testing for GM foods, prioritizing industry interests over food safety. GMOs and their environmental impact GMOs pose several environmental risks , including: Gene transfer outcrossing. There is a risk that genes from GMO crops could spread to wild plants and other crops, potentially creating unintended hybrids that could disrupt ecosystems. Impact on wildlife. Introducing GMOs into the environment can harm insects and other species. For example, dominant GMO species may outcompete and displace native species, upsetting the natural balance. Loss of biodiversity. The use of GM seeds, like Monsanto's Roundup-resistant crops , can lead to reduced plant diversity. These GM seeds are designed to survive glyphosate, a pesticide that kills weeds but spares the crops. While this innovation saves farmers time and money by reducing the need for multiple pesticides, it also forces them to buy new seeds every year due to Monsanto's patent rather than reusing seeds from previous harvests. (Related: GMOs linked to increased pesticide use and loss of biodiversity .) Introduction of GM organisms. Releasing GM animals, organisms or plants into the wild can further threaten biodiversity by allowing new, more dominant species to take over . This could lead to the decline or extinction of native species. Tips to reduce GMO exposure Examine labels. While the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (NBFDS) mandates labels for many GMO products, certain items, like GM animal products and refined ingredients (such as oils and sugars) are not required to be labeled. Instead of relying solely on these labels, look for the Non-GMO Project Verified seal , which ensures that the product has been certified GMO-free. Go organic. Opt for organic produce as organic farming regulations strictly ban the use of GMOs in animal feeds, crops and seeds. Choosing organic is a reliable way to avoid GMOs in your diet. Cook your meals. Preparing meals at home with organic ingredients allows you to reduce your exposure to GMOs, which are common in processed and restaurant foods. Support local farmers. Shopping at local farmers' markets can help you avoid GMOs, as many small-scale farmers use traditional, non-GMO seeds. However, it is a good idea to ask farmers directly about their farming practices to ensure you're buying GMO-free produce. Limit consumption of processed foods. Processed and ultra-processed foods often contain GMO-derived ingredients, like emulsifiers, oils and sweeteners. To minimize GMO intake, reduce your consumption of these foods which may not disclose their GMO content. Stay informed. Refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture' s (USDA) bioengineered food list to identify foods that are likely to contain GMOs. This can help you to make informed choices at the grocery store or supermarket. Visit GMO.news for more stories like this.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-01-american-dental-association-pledges-push-fluoridated-water.html,"American Dental Association DOUBLES DOWN, pledges to push fluoridated water despite courts revealing fluoride causes brain damage to children",0,"A landmark federal court ruling recently determined that fluoride levels in U.S. drinking water pose unnecessary risks to children's IQ and cognitive development, validating what conspiracy theorists have warned about for decades. Generations of people have been poisoned through the water supply without their consent. This toxic byproduct – hexafluorosilicic acid – has been dripped into most municipal water supplies for decades. The institutions that thought they knew what was best for everyone’s dental health have instead dumbed down entire generations of people, harming their IQ and cognitive development. This widespread dumbing down of human populations helps explain the lack of critical thinking skills in the 21st century. None of these serious matters of public health seem important to institutions like the American Dental Association , however. In fact, the ADA immediately issued a statement, doubling down and defending water fluoridation. Biased and stubborn American Dental Association defends fluoridated water Some institutions, like the American Dental Association, are pushing back against the science and dismissing this federal court ruling, demanding that fluoride be considered safe for everyone , against all available evidence. The ADA, representing some 159,000 dentists across the country, posits itself as “the premier source of oral health information.” The ADA claims that they have “promoted the art and science of dentistry since 1859” while advocating for the public’s health. But the ADA aren’t thinking about the big picture with fluoride and how it is destroying the cognitive abilities of those exposed on a daily basis. Immediately after the court’s ruling, the ADA hastily wrote: The American Dental Association (ADA) remains staunchly in support of community water fluoridation at optimal levels to help prevent tooth decay. The district court ruling against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides no scientific basis for the ADA to change its endorsement of community water fluoridation as safe and beneficial to oral health. The ADA called the ruling and the barrage of social media posts that followed “pseudo-scientific information.” The ADA claims that social media users are spreading information that “is not always based on research conducted according to impartial and evidence based scientific methodology.” The ADA contends that “conclusions drawn from research are not always scientifically justifiable or without bias.” One might point out that the ADA is drawing their own biased conclusions from research that was validated in court. By ignoring the latest evidence on fluoride’s damage to children’s brains , the ADA might be guilty of spreading “pseudo-scientific information.” Will the court’s decision reduce water fluoridation practices across the U.S.? The ADA wrote that the District Court Judge did “not conclude with certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health.” However, the ruling does require the EPA to take regulatory actions to protect future children and populations from this toxic byproduct. The EPA and CDC’s current recommendation of .7 parts per million fluoride in drinking water is now outdated and not consistent with the latest science. The ADA fails to acknowledge this reality and is therefore acting against the best interest of communities that want to protect future generations. The court’s recent decision should effectively undo the longstanding fluoride recommendations of the Environmental Protections Agency (EPA), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). These corrupt agencies contend that fluoridated water is “one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.” The CDC has historically recommended, and currently recommends, fluoride at a level that was found to be damaging to children’s brains. Public water systems have added fluoride to drinking water for more than 75 years. This was done in the name of “preventing tooth decay” although tooth decay still remains a serious health issue. This is because the ADA is too busy poisoning children's brains instead of working to eliminate added sugars from food. The real question is: Will municipal water systems across the nation begin to phase out fluoride use , in the face of opposition from American institutions that have misled the public for decades?

https://food.news/2023-04-03-fruit-from-invasive-weed-prevents-skin-aging.html,STUDY: Fruit from invasive weed found to prevent skin aging,0,"Advertisement Gardeners may balk at the sight of weeds in their garden, but researchers have discovered that an invasive weed common in American backyards can help prevent signs of skin aging. According to one study, cocklebur plant (Xanthium strumarium) fruits can help reduce damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays and hasten up wound healing in lab studies on human cells. Extracts from cocklebur fruit can also help boost the production of collagen, a protein found in many high-end skincare products that promise to “preserve skin elasticity and prevent wrinkles.” Cocklebur is a weed native to parts of Asia, Europe and North America. It can be found in moist places such as river banks in agricultural land and other areas. Cocklebur is commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Native American Medicine to treat different health issues, from minor complaints like a stuffy nose and headaches to arthritis and tuberculosis. Native Americans used to brew cocklebur leaves to make tea for different conditions, such as kidney diseases, arthritis and tuberculosis. The weed was also used to treat health issues like leprosy, malaria and rabies. The seeds of cocklebur fruit contain carboxyatractyloside, a potent chemical. It can poison and even kill livestock when consumed. For humans, eating cocklebur can cause mild symptoms like an unpleasant taste and nausea. Eating prickly cocklebur can also cause serious symptoms, such as: Even though ingesting parts of the plant causes mild and severe side effects, cocklebur fruit and leaves are often used in traditional medicine. According to researchers from Myongji University in South Korea, extracts from cocklebur fruit can be used as an ingredient for topical skin creams and other cosmetics. Eunsu Song, one of the researchers and a doctoral candidate at Myongji University, explained that “cocklebur fruit has the potential to protect the skin and help enhance production of collagen.” Song added that the fruit may have a synergistic effect when combined with other effective compounds, such as hyaluronic acid or retinoic acid, against aging. (Related: Top 6 anti-aging superfoods you can add to your diet.) For the study, the researchers analyzed the molecular properties of cocklebur fruit extracts and isolated compounds that may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. They also conducted experiments using cells and a 3D tissue model with properties similar to human skin to learn more about how these compounds affect collagen production, wound healing and damage from UVB radiation, particularly the type that causes skin aging, sunburns and skin cancers. According to the study findings, cocklebur fruits grown in South Korea have slightly more potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and greater wound-healing activity compared to fruits grown in China. Cocklebur shows promise as a cosmetic agent by increasing collagen synthesis. The researchers added that cocklebur showed negative results with higher concentrations. While cocklebur fruit isn’t recommended for human consumption, there are superfoods that you can eat to promote skin health. Here are some great anti-aging superfoods to add to your diet: Avocado Avocados are a good source of inflammation-fighting fatty acids that can help keep your skin smooth and supple. Avocados also contain essential nutrients that may prevent skin aging, such as potassium, B vitamins and vitamins A, C, E and K. Avocados are rich in vitamin A that can help you shed dead skin cells, which leaves you with healthy, glowing skin. Carotenoids in avocados can also help block toxins and damage from the sun’s rays, at the same time offering protection against skin cancers. To eat more avocadoes, add them to a salad or your morning smoothie. Blueberries Sweet and tangy blueberries are full of vitamins A and C, along with anthocyanins, which are age-defying antioxidants. Anthocyanins give blueberries their beautiful blue color. These powerful antioxidants may help protect your skin from damage caused by sun exposure, stress and pollution by moderating the inflammatory response and preventing collagen loss. Blueberries are a low-sugar fruit that you can add to your breakfast smoothie or fruit bowl. Red bell pepper Red bell peppers are full of beneficial anti-aging antioxidants. They are rich in vitamin C, which is good for collagen production, and powerful antioxidants called carotenoids. Carotenoids have many anti-inflammatory properties and may help protect your skin from sun damage, pollution and environmental toxins. Slice bell peppers and dip them in hummus as a healthy snack. You can also add bell peppers to a raw salad, or you can add them to a veggie stir-fry. Papaya Papaya is full of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals that may help improve skin elasticity and minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Papaya contains: The antioxidants in papaya can help protect against free radical damage and may delay signs of aging. Papaya also contains papain, an enzyme that offers additional anti-aging benefits by working as one of nature’s best anti-inflammatory agents. Papain is also found in many exfoliating products. Drizzle fresh lime juice over a plate of papaya as part of a healthy breakfast. Watercress Watercress is full of the following vitamins and minerals: Watercress acts as an internal skin antiseptic. It helps boost blood circulation and the delivery of minerals to cells, which can boost oxygenation of the skin. Watercress is full of vitamins A and C, which can neutralize harmful free radicals and help prevent fine lines and wrinkles. Add watercress to your salad for glowing skin and better overall health.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-new-zealand-court-fluoride-drinking-water-toxic.html,New Zealand court rules that even lower-level 0.7 mg/L fluoride in drinking water presents “unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment”,0,"A federal court judge in New Zealand has ruled that water fluoridation at a decreased level of 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of water is still toxic to people and the environment, creating an ""unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment."" Following a long, drawn-out legal battle, plaintiffs in a case against water fluoridation successfully argued that it simply does not make sense to continue lacing public water supplies with fluoride chemicals. ""Plaintiffs have proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that water fluoridation at the level of 0.7 mg/L – the prescribed optimal level of fluoridation in the United States – presents an 'unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,'"" the judge ruled in the case. Across New Zealand, most fluoridated water supplies fluoridate at a level of 0.85 mg/L, with some councils fluoridating even higher at the top-end amount of one part per million (1 ppm) of fluoride. (Related: Did you know that fluoride does absolutely nothing to protect teeth from cavities, despite what public health authorities claim?) Drinking fluoridated water lowers one's IQ Drawing from a pool benchmark dose analysis carried out by renowned toxicologist Prof. Philipe Grandjean, who is famous for his work on mercury neurotoxicity, the judge highlighted the fact that drinking fluoridated water causes a child's IQ to drop. ""The pooled benchmark dose analysis concluded that a 1-point drop in IQ of a child is to be expected for each 0.28 mg/L of fluoride in a pregnant mother’s urine,"" the judge explained. ""This is highly concerning, because maternal urinary fluoride levels for pregnant mothers in the United States range from 0.8 mg/L at the median and 1.89 mg/L depending upon the degree of exposure."" ""Not only is there an insufficient margin between the hazard level and these exposure levels, for many, the exposure levels exceed the hazard level of 0.28 mg/L."" Other research confirmed that people who drink fluoridated water show noteworthy levels of fluoride in their urine. In New Zealand's Palmerston North, which is fully fluoridated, test subjects showed levels of fluoride in their urine at 0/82 mg/L. Mothers who drink fluoridated water while pregnant were shown to give birth to children with sustained central nervous system damage that likewise results in lowered IQ and symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and / or depression. Dr. Diana Sarfati, New Zealand's Director-General of Health, now has the option to completely call off all water fluoridation efforts across the country in order to protect the nation's citizens, and especially its children. The question remains: will she do it ? Fluoride Free New Zealand has created a petition that it is urging people to sign calling for an end to all water fluoridation in New Zealand. Be sure to check it out and sign! ""It's a good sign, but it needs to go to the top supreme court to be valid and implemented,"" tweeted someone on social media in response to the news. Others here in the United States shared Fluoride Free NZ's tweet about the court ruling with their own politicians – one this writer saw shared it with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his consideration – so perhaps they, too, will take similar action. ""They're still poisoning us with the death shots, so they're not going to stop poisoning our water,"" tweeted another with a more skeptical take on the situation. ""All those of us that stood against fluoridation were called all kinds of nasty crap,"" added Counterspin Media NZ to the conversation. ""It may have been because those that targeted us, were themselves affected by lower IQ?""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/harvard-study-ditching-sugary-drinks-tied-to-reduced-diabetes-complications,Harvard study: Ditching sugary drinks tied to reduced diabetes complications,1,"People with diabetes are generally advised to avoid sugary drinks to help control their blood sugar. A Harvard study published online April 19, 2023, by The BMJ shows that avoiding sugary drinks also is linked to dramatically lower risks for cardiovascular disease and early death. Researchers evaluated an average of 18.5 years of health data from more than 15,000 middle-age and older adults with diabetes who reported what they drank. Compared with people who drank coffee, tea, low-fat milk, or water, people who drank sugary drinks — like sugary soda, fruit punch, or lemonade — had much higher health risks: up to 20% higher for early death, 25% higher for developing cardiovascular disease, and 29% higher for cardiovascular-related death. Fortunately, replacing just one daily sugar-sweetened drink with a non-sugary one was tied to as much as an 18% reduced risk of early death and 24% reduced risk of cardiovascular-related death. Even drinking artificially sweetened beverages (like zero-sugar sodas) in lieu of sugary drinks was associated with an 8% lower risk of death from all causes and a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular-related death. This study was observational and therefore can't prove conclusively that avoiding sugary drinks will bring these health benefits in people with diabetes. But it builds on extensive evidence linking sugary drink consumption to chronic disease and early death in people without diabetes, so it's plausible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/how-to-release-a-frozen-shoulder,How to release a frozen shoulder: 5 stretches to use,1,"Frozen shoulder (also called adhesive capsulitis) is a common disorder that causes pain, stiffness, and loss of normal range of motion in the shoulder. The resulting disability can be serious, and the condition tends to get worse with time if it's not treated. It affects mainly people ages 40 to 60 with women affected more often than men. Frozen shoulder symptoms With frozen shoulder, the shoulder feels stiff, painful, and has limited motion in all directions. Symptoms of a frozen shoulder include stiffness that worsens at first, but gradually begins to improve over time dull, aching pain that increases as the disease progresses, and may worsen when you move your arm. A frozen shoulder may take two to nine months to develop. Although the pain may slowly improve, stiffness continues, and range of motion remains limited. Anatomy of a frozen shoulder The shoulder has a wider and more varied range of motion than any other part of the body. It pivots mainly on a ball-and-socket arrangement called the glenohumeral joint, which joins the top of the humerus (upper arm bone) to a scooped-out part of the scapula (shoulder blade) called the glenoid cavity (see the illustration below). The glenohumeral joint helps move the shoulder forward and backward and allows the arm to rotate and extend outward from the body. A flexible capsule filled with a lubricant called synovial fluid protects the joint and helps keep it moving smoothly. The capsule is surrounded by ligaments that connect bones to bones, tendons that fasten muscles to bones, and fluid-filled sacs called bursae that cushion tendons and bones during motion. The band of muscles and tendons that stabilizes the shoulder and controls its movements is called the rotator cuff. This elaborate architecture of soft tissues accounts for the shoulder's marvelous flexibility, but also makes it vulnerable to trauma as well as chronic wear and tear. Normally, the head of the humerus moves smoothly in the glenoid cavity, a depression in the scapula. A shoulder is ""frozen"" when the capsule protecting the glenohumeral joint contracts and stiffens. Scar tissue (adhesions) may also form between the joint capsule and the head of the humerus. Frozen shoulder causes We don't fully understand what causes a frozen shoulder, but an inflammatory process is probably involved. Sometimes freezing occurs because the shoulder has been immobilized for a long time by injury, surgery, or illness. In many cases the cause is obscure. Fortunately, the shoulder can usually be unfrozen, though full recovery takes time — and lots of self-help. The process usually begins with an injury (such as a fracture) or inflammation of the soft tissues, typically due to overuse injuries such as bursitis or tendinitis of the rotator cuff. Inflammation causes pain that is worse with movement and limits the shoulder's range of motion. When the shoulder becomes immobilized in this way, the connective tissue surrounding the glenohumeral joint — the joint capsule — thickens and contracts, losing its normal capacity to stretch. Trying to avoid the pain caused by moving the shoulder leads to further contraction of the capsule. The humerus has less space to move in, and the joint may lose its lubricating synovial fluid. In advanced cases, bands of scar tissue (adhesions) form between the joint capsule and the head of the humerus. Who gets frozen shoulder? The frozen shoulder risk is increased by the following factors: lack of exercise therapy after tendinitis or an injury wearing a sling for more than a few days without intermittent stretching rotator cuff disorders (about 10% of people with these rotator cuff disorders develop frozen shoulder) enforced immobility resulting from a stroke, heart condition, or surgery other conditions such as thyroid disorders or Parkinson's disease Frozen shoulder treatment If you think you have a frozen shoulder or are already developing one, see your clinician or a shoulder expert for a physical exam. To assess your shoulder's range of motion, the clinician will ask you to perform various movements with your arm. These movements may include reaching across your chest to touch the opposite shoulder or down your back to touch the opposite shoulder blade (the Apley scratch test). Your healthcare provider may take x-rays to make sure there's no other underlying problem, such as arthritic changes or a dislocation. An MRI may be ordered to check for a rotator cuff tear. The treatment for a frozen shoulder is focused on relieving pain and restoring the shoulder's normal range of motion. Your clinical will develop your treatment plan. Treatment for frozen shoulder may include the following: anti-inflammatory medication such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, Anaprox) an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables applied to the shoulder for 10 to 15 minutes several times a day can also help with pain corticosteroid injection into the shoulder joint or soft tissues physical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment, especially concentrating first on exercises that stretch the joint capsule, and later, on strengthening exercises. A physical therapist can show you how far to push yourself and can teach you the appropriate exercises. Once you've learned your limitations, you can practice most of your exercises on your own at home. As you work to stretch the shoulder capsule, you should avoid any activities that require overhead reaching, lifting, or anything else that aggravates your pain. If you diligently follow your regimen of frozen shoulder exercises, it's likely that you'll be able to resume your usual level of activity (more than 90% of people improve with these nonsurgical measures). But full recovery from a frozen shoulder takes time — from several months to two or three years. If you don't improve steadily or if you reach a plateau, go back to your clinician or consult a shoulder expert. Rarely, recalcitrant cases require surgery. 5 frozen shoulder exercises Always warm up your shoulder before performing your exercises. The best way to do that is to take a warm shower or bath for 10 to 15 minutes. You can also use a moist heating pad or damp towel heated in the microwave, but it may not be as effective. In performing the following exercises, stretch to the point of tension but not pain. Pendulum stretch (Perform this exercise first.) Relax your shoulders. Stand and lean over slightly, allowing your affected arm to hang down. Swing the arm in a small circle — about a foot in diameter. Perform 10 revolutions in each direction, once a day. As your symptoms improve, increase the diameter of your swing, but never force it. When you're ready for more, increase the stretch by holding a light weight (three to five pounds) in the swinging arm. Towel stretch Grasp a three-foot-long towel with both hands behind your back, and hold it in a horizontal position. Use your good arm to pull the affected arm upward to stretch it. You can also perform an advanced version of this exercise with the towel draped over your good shoulder. Grasp the bottom of the towel with the affected arm and pull it toward the lower back with the unaffected arm. Do this stretch 10 to 20 times a day. Finger walk Face a wall three-quarters of an arm's length away. Reach out and touch the wall at waist level with the fingertips of the affected arm. With your elbow slightly bent, slowly walk your fingers up the wall, spider-like, until you've raised your arm to shoulder level, or as far as you comfortably can. Your fingers should be doing the work, not your shoulder muscles. Slowly lower the arm (with the help of the good arm, if necessary) and repeat. Perform this exercise 10 to 20 times a day. Cross-body reach Sit or stand. Use your good arm to lift your affected arm at the elbow, and bring it up and across your body, exerting gentle pressure to stretch the shoulder. Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds. Do this stretch 10 to 20 times per day. Armpit stretch Using your good arm, lift the affected arm onto a shelf about breast-high. Gently bend your knees, opening up the armpit. Deepen your knee bend slightly, gently stretching the armpit, and then straighten. With each knee bend, stretch a little further, but don't force it. Do this stretch 10 to 20 times each day. Strengthening the rotator cuff After your range of motion improves, you can add rotator cuff–strengthening exercises. Be sure to warm up your shoulder and do your stretching exercises before you perform strengthening Outward rotation Hold a rubber exercise band between your hands with your elbows at a 90-degree angle close to your sides. Rotate the lower part of the affected arm outward two or three inches and hold for five seconds. Repeat 10 to 15 times, once a day. Inward rotation Stand next to a closed door, and hook one end of a rubber exercise band around the doorknob. Grasp the other end with the hand of the affected arm, holding the elbow at a 90-degree angle. Pull the band toward your body two or three inches and hold for five seconds. Repeat 10 to 15 times, once a day.",9,0.08294883,-0.19338295

In the beginning, CNN pushed the notion that Covid jabs would save people's lives, but now the network is admitting that the shots are killing people – oh, but that ""doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective,"" reads a recent CNN headline. On Feb. 26, 2021, at the height of the ""pandemic,"" CNN covered a study out of the United Kingdom claiming that a single dose of Pfizer's mRNA (modRNA) injection is enough to provide ""strong protection for those who've had Covid-19."" A few months later, CNN claimed that people who got jabbed could safely go indoors without wearing a face mask. A couple months after that, CNN ran the following headline counteracting its earlier story to the contrary: ""CDC updates guidance, recommends vaccinated people wear masks indoors in certain areas"" After that, CNN was informing its readers that if they listened to the earlier guidance about getting jabbed for protection, well, that protection does not exactly last like was initially claimed. According to CNN as of Dec. 23, 2021: ""Vaccine protection against Covid-19 wanes over time, especially for older people, CDC says"" Reminder: The unvaccinated were right! CNN's coverage of the vax started with how effective it is and ending with: ""Why vaccinated people dying from Covid-19 doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective"" pic.twitter.com/Yt22pg1wtG — Eddie (@Eddies_X) September 23, 2024 (Related: Earlier this year, CNN published a piece calling for the government to restrict how much Americans are allowed to travel abroad: ""carbon passports may be the answer."") Keep getting jabbed until you die – that's how you know it's working, says CNN Concerning the Johnson & Johnson injection, which differs from what Pfizer and Moderna offered, CNN told its readers and viewers who took it that the one-and-done format initially recommended by the manufacturer was no longer enough, as of Oct. 16, 2021: J&J jab recipients would now need a second dose as soon as possible. After that, Tony Fauci came out to recommend a third dose of whatever Covid injection you want, assuming you only got two jabs. And CNN parroted Fauci's recommendations as scientific fact. Then, not long after that, CNN was pushing people to take a fourth dose of Covid shot, this time claiming that the CDC said to do this. In other words, if Fauci and / or the CDC say to do it, then CNN wants you to do it. All of this culminated with an Oct. 19, 2021, article from CNN bearing the following bizarre headline: ""Why vaccinated people dying from Covid-19 doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective"" It is difficult to ascertain how CNN got away with pushing all this contradictory content all around the same time to its followers. Are CNN supporters schizophrenic just like the network's editorial team apparently is? Keep in mind that around the time CNN was publishing all these schizophrenic headlines, the federal government of the United States was busy changing the definition of terms like ""vaccine"" and ""immunization"" to fit the emerging narrative. ""They changed the scientific and medical definition of vaccine and immunization in late 2021,"" someone wrote on X about this. ""MSM changes any definition to fit their narrative like the definition of a woman etc.,"" wrote another. Another person joked about what CNN is actually saying with all of its contradictory content about Covid jabs: ""It went from 'safe and effective' to 'well, you'll die, but you'll go to heaven' at warp speed."" ""Four of my family members died from the vaccine,"" added another. ""Autopsy showed strange, horrible blood clots throughout their bodies. They were all previously healthy and under 40.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-25-fda-approves-monkeypox-vaccine-despite-acknowledging-dangerous.html,FDA approves monkeypox vaccine despite acknowledging that it is DANGEROUS,0,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a vaccine for people deemed to be at ""high risk"" for monkeypox, despite acknowledging that the injection itself is dangerous . The regulator approved the ACAM2000 vaccine on Aug. 29. The Defender 's Suzanne Burdick said in a report that the vaccine was made by Emergent BioSolutions, a company specializing in vaccines for biochemical warfare threats such as anthrax and smallpox. While ACAM2000 was initially approved for smallpox in 2007, the FDA's recent expanded supplemental approval allows it to be injected into those at ""high risk"" for monkeypox, such as members of the LGBT community. According to an FDA press release at the time of its approval , ""ACAM2000 is a ""live replicating vaccinia virus vaccine."" Even the regulator's medication guide for the injection admits that it may cause more harm than good. (Related: South African group challenges WHO's mpox emergency declaration, warns public about vaccine dangers. ) InfoWars reported that the first page of ACAM2000's medication guide provided by the FDA lists numerous side effects. According to the guide, the live vaccinia virus in the injection ""can be spread to individuals who have close contact with the vaccinated individual."" To make matters worse, ACAM2000 ""can cause serious complications in vaccinated individuals and in their close contacts to whom the vaccine virus has spread."" ACAM2000 does more harm than good Children's Health Defense senior research scientist Karl Jablonowski denounced the FDA's approval of ACAM2000 as a ""public hazard, not the practice of public health."" He told the Defender : ""You can call ACAM2000 a 'vaccine,' but its impact on the U.S. will be as a 'disease.'"" ""The spread of vaccinia virus is an infliction and an assault, as an unsuspecting person cannot possibly consent. For good reasons, you would not consent to this vaccine – even if you believed your benefits outweigh your risks – as you become a potential vector of a disease that is damaging to the heart and fatal to both fetus and infant."" Jablonowski continued that ACAM2000's package insert reveals that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) found roughly 520 per million vaccine recipients who contracted post-vaccination cardiac inflammation – about one in 2,000. But elsewhere in the package insert, the FDA acknowledges that the risk is 5.7 per 1,000 vaccinations – about one in every 175 people. ""If the 262 million adults in the U.S. received this vaccine, an estimated 1.493 million would contract the serious adverse reaction of myopericarditis [i.e. heart lining and/or muscle inflammation],"" he remarked. Internist and biological warfare expert Dr. Meryl Nass said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also acknowledged the risk of cardiac inflammation in 5.7 per 1,00 primary ACAM2000 vaccinations during a June 2022 meeting. ""It's a huge number. The fact that the FDA and CDC are acknowledging it means no one should get the vaccine,"" she shared. ""Myopericarditis is a life-threatening condition; it lowers your life expectancy. This risk, 1 in 175, is higher than all other licensed vaccines for which the CDC acknowledges side effects. This is the worst."" Cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough recounted that HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra declared a monkeypox public health emergency in 2022, but let the declaration expire early in 2023. ""The crisis conjured up little fear for the average American as it was learned that the infection was largely a pustular rash that occurred with intense sexual contact among gay/bisexual men with the skin blisters around the anus and buttocks or mouth,"" he wrote in an Aug. 18 post on his Substack.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-24-decline-of-mortality-attributed-to-vaccination-highly-questionable.html,"The decline of mortality attributed to vaccination rates is HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE according to graphs of Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria and Smallpox",0,"Nearly all pro-vaccination humans have one thing in common: They believe that the relative diseases and virus rates of infection for each vaccination significantly dropped after mass vaccination began, along with the chance of death from infectious diseases, and that vaccines have saved humanity from the worst infections on earth; however, they have all been duped. Real data and statistics, that the CDC, WHO, FDA and the Vaccine Industrial Complex do not want anyone to see, have been published and reveal that all the major infectious disease mortality rates were greatly diminishing and on a consistent downward trend BEFORE those vaccines were invented and mass administered. Several whistleblowers then and now have proof, but a few billion vaccine zealots still won’t be able to wrap their jabbed heads around it. This requires careful consideration and a total rethinking of everything we know about vaccine efficacy, infectious disease rates, and the entire concept of the so-called “holy grail” of medicine. Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Smallpox death rates all on massive declines prior to the introduction and mass-administration of those vaccines Take a good look at the graphs of these documented mortality rates in England and Wales from 1838 to 1978, well into the years that these ever-popular vaccinations were invented and mass administered to the populace. We see now, in plain sight, the mass illusion that was perpetrated on the public that vaccines were the saving grace for humankind, and saved billions of injected people from dying from the world’s scariest infectious diseases. In fact, vaccines and their efficacy were so overblown, that Big Pharma and governments around the world had to make them compulsory so the majority of the populace would comply. In other words, the brainwashing propaganda and faked science wasn’t enough to convince them all. The graphs even look similar for infectious diseases where there never was a vaccine created. That’s even more “proof in the pudding” that vaccines aren’t helping decrease mortality rates much, if any at all. It was really all about improvements in hygiene, plumbing, sanitation, use of clean water, and hospitals and doctors learning how to disinfect everything, including surgical instruments. Every human being on earth should be questioning the contribution of vaccinations to the decline of mortality in the world. We already know that nearly all prescription medications only “manage” the symptoms of disease and disorder, rather than address the root cause and actually cure the illnesses. Plus, prescription medications create a host of side effects and adverse events that bring with them new health horrors, only to be addressed with MORE crooked medicine. It’s a vicious cycle and a cash cow for Big Pharma, just like with vaccines. Pro-vaccine zealots love to scream “science!” when referring to why they believe so wholeheartedly in vaccination, but they should all take a look at the statistics of mortality from that science, based on infectious diseases and the relative vaccines that are supposed to prevent infection, prevent transmission, prevent death. It’s all been a huge farce. Folks need to look at what really contributed to the decline of mortality over the past century and a half, and they will see it’s really about the rising standards of living. Vaccines may have contributed to this decline of mortality, but only in a miniscule amount compared to the propaganda and disinformation that’s been spread about them, around the globe, for decades.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-18-bill-gates-urging-people-avoid-vaccines-inciting-violence.html,Bill Gates says urging people to avoid vaccines is “inciting violence” and he wants “antivaxxers” censored by AI,0,"Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and former friend to Jeffrey Epstein, was recently interviewed by CNBC to discuss how to handle “vaccine hesitancy” using real-time censorship imposed by artificial intelligence (AI). Bill Gates said those who urge people to avoid vaccines are “inciting violence” and are therefore a threat to public health. He proposes a totalitarian approach, calling for speech “boundaries” that weed out “vaccine misinformation” in real time. Bill Gates wants to control minds and rewrite history on vaccines Gates’ “philanthropic” organizations are heavily invested in vaccines, from the traditional antigen-based biologics to the experimental mRNA jabs, which are linked to excess mortality worldwide. He recently announced plans to turn all vaccines into mRNA and expand the realm of vaccination to include hundreds more diseases and potentially thousands more boosters. Gates’ resume includes the mass injury of teenage girls via HPV vaccine programs in India and the spread of vaccine-derived polio strains through polio vaccine campaigns in third world countries. During the covid-19 scandal, Gates frequently appeared on the mainstream media networks, urging every person in the world to stay home, lock down and get vaccinated. He has proposed that individuals submit to his climate change proposals, too, which include: blocking out the sun using chemtrails , controlling global farming and ridding the world of cow farts, forcibly releasing millions of genetically modified mosquitoes , and getting populations to eat bugs and switch to fake meat . Now the prominent philanthropist wants to use artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time censorship of vaccine-related “misinformation.” Gates’ comments, made in a recent CNBC interview, have sparked a heated debate about free speech rights, mind control and the rewriting of history by the elite. Gates, who is deeply and psychotically invested in vaccines through the Gates Foundation, GAVI, and the World Health Organization , has increasingly focused on combating vaccine ""misinformation"" -- which is really just the suppression of vaccine injury testimonials and the abolition of informed consent. In his latest interview, he expressed a desire to impose “boundaries” on speech, particularly when it pertains to vaccines. Gates argued that while free speech is important, there should be limitations, especially if such speech incites violence or deters individuals from getting vaccinated. “We should have free speech, but if you’re inciting violence or causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries?” Gates said. He suggested that the U.S. might need new rules to address these issues, indicating a preference for AI-driven systems that could swiftly identify and suppress harmful content before it has a chance to spread. Ironically, everyone knows that the true purveyor of “vaccine misinformation” has always been Bill Gates, as he looks for ways to exploit populations with propaganda and force vaccine programs down people's throats to advance his ""philanthropic"" mission of transhumanism and population control. Gates’ totalitarian approach to AI is a threat to humanity Gates’ totalitarian approach could lead to excessive censorship and a suppression of legitimate debate, eroding informed consent in medicine and making a mockery of healthcare systems globally. Using AI to enforce Gates’ vision for the world will set a dangerous precedent, leading to broader restrictions on free speech, the uncontested implementation of vaccine passports, and further restrictions to the scientific method and the progress of human civilization. Gates’ AI censorship will prioritize thought control over public discourse at the expense of transparency, informed consent, and free will. Dr. Emily Carter, a free speech advocate, warned that Gates' proposals could undermine democratic values and erode the principles of our Constitutional Republic. “The idea of AI-driven censorship is fraught with challenges. It risks stifling important discussions and could lead to a situation where only sanctioned viewpoints are allowed,” Carter said. “This approach could erode the principles of open dialogue and informed consent, which are essential for a functioning democracy.” Gates’ psychopathic attempt to control people and bury vaccine injuries and deaths using AI continues a pattern of malicious behavior. Over the past five years, he has repeatedly called for social media companies to remove what he believes is “vaccine misinformation.” The so-called “ vaccine misinformation” and “conspiracy theories” that Bill Gates complains about ultimately turn out to be the TRUTH. His actions have negatively affected millions of lives in the U.S. and hundreds of millions of lives globally. People have been injured and killed all to push forth Gates’ false promises of vaccine safety and efficacy. Meanwhile, Gates continues to cash in on his investments, pushing narratives that have led to mass deception, injury, and death . His collaboration with OpenAI is apparent, as the vaccine propaganda stemming from their large language model is sinister and appalling.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-foods-that-fight-high-cholesterol,5 foods that fight high cholesterol,1,"Your diet clearly plays a role in determining your cho­lesterol levels. In fact, changing what you eat can lower your cholesterol and improve the composition of the armada of fats floating through your bloodstream. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and ""good fats"" are all part of a heart-healthy diet. But some foods are particularly good at helping bring down cholesterol. How? Some cholesterol-lowering foods deliver a good dose of soluble fiber, which binds cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drags them out of the body before they get into circulation. Others provide polyunsaturated fats, which directly lower LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. And those with plant sterols and stanols keep the body from absorbing cholesterol. Here are five of those foods: Oats. An easy way to start lowering cholesterol is to choose oatmeal or an oat-based cold cereal like Cheerios for breakfast. It gives you one to two grams of soluble fiber. Add a banana or some strawberries for another half-gram. Beans. Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight. Nuts. Studies show that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts is good for the heart. Eating two ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%. Nuts also have additional nutrients that protect the heart in other ways. Foods fortified with sterols and stanols. Sterols and stanols extracted from plants interfere with the body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Companies are now adding them to a wide variety of foods. They're also available as supplements. Getting two grams of plant sterols or stanols a day can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%. Fatty fish. Eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL in two ways: by replacing meat, which has LDL-boosting saturated fats, and by delivering LDL-lowering omega-3 fats. Omega-3s reduce triglycerides in the bloodstream and protect the heart by helping prevent the onset of abnormal heart rhythms.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-15-kamala-supports-taxpayer-funded-transition-prisoners-migrants.html,CONFIRMED: Kamala Harris supports taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained migrants,0,"A resurfaced 2019 American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) questionnaire with answers from Vice President Kamala Harris has revealed her support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants and federal prisoners . Harris completed the ACLU questionnaire while she was running to win the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election. The questionnaire started making the rounds in August as Harris' campaign for the 2024 election took off. In the questionnaire, Harris was asked if, as president, she would use executive authority to ensure transgender and nonbinary people under state care, including those in prisons and immigration detention centers, have access to comprehensive medical treatments associated with gender transition. (Related: Kamala Harris to reduce illegal immigration by LEGALIZING it, not stopping it .) Harris affirmed her support, stating, ""Yes."" ""It is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition. That’s why, as Attorney General, I pushed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide gender transition surgery to state inmates,"" she explained in a detailed follow-up. ""Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment."" 2019 ACLU questionnaire reveals Harris' stance on other left-wing issues The 2019 ACLU questionnaire also revealed Harris' stance on several left-wing issues . Besides endorsing surgeries for transgender detainees, Harris also voiced support for decriminalizing federal drug possession for personal use and substantial cuts to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding, including a pledge to ""end"" immigration detention. In that same questionnaire, Harris advocated for ending immigration detention facilities and private prisons, reducing funding for ICE and halting ICE detainers. Harris described the U.S. immigrant detention system as ""out of control"" and called for an end to the ""unfair incarceration"" of thousands of individuals, families and children. Harris also cited her early opposition to increased ICE funding following the election of former President Donald Trump in 2017. In 2018, Harris introduced the Detention Oversight, Not Expansion (DONE) Act, which seeks to increase oversight of ICE detention facilities, reduce detention by at least 50 percent and prevent the construction or expansion of new facilities. She also pledged to end the use of ICE detainers at the time. ""As president, I will focus enforcement on increasing public safety, not tearing apart immigrant families. This includes requiring ICE to obtain a warrant where probable cause exists as to end the use of detainers,"" she wrote. The questionnaire also revealed Harris' progressive stance on drug policy reform. She called for the decriminalization of all drug possession for personal use and co-sponsored the Marijuana Justice Act to legalize marijuana federally. In her response to the ACLU, Harris stressed treating drug addiction as a public health issue rather than a criminal one. ""Throughout my career, I have supported treating drug addiction as a public health issue, focusing on rehabilitation over incarceration for drug-related offenses,"" she wrote.

More than 1.7 million activity logs including psychological profiles and therapy sessions for thousands of patients, including ""telehealth"" audio and video files, were included in the leak, as were patient driver's licenses. Since first getting off the ground in 2018, Confidant has been promising to build ""the next-generation of virtual care"" for mental health patients seeking treatment for addictions and behavioral problems. Instead, Confidant botched the security of its confidential patient files by storing them in a ""non-password-protected database."" Confidant currently offers clinical services to patients in Connecticut, Florida, New Hampshire, Virginia and Texas. The Confidant Health app is available on both the iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) platforms, having been downloaded some 10,000 times in the Google Play Store. (Related: Did you know that ""nearly all"" AT&T customers were hacked in a data breach earlier this summer?) People's deepest, darkest secrets shared with the world Cybersecurity expert Jeremiah Fowler is credited with discovering the leak. He commented that the patient audio and video files contain ""some heartbreaking, really painful family trauma, personal trauma."" ""It's almost like having your deepest, darkest secrets that you've told your diary revealed,"" he added. ""It's things that you never want to get out."" As a show of respect for professional ethics, Fowler chose not to download any of the private medical information. He also did not attempt to access the password-protected databases, though he did say that a dedicated hacker could easily break in if he or she was so inclined. ""Cyber criminals have a range of tools at their disposal including brute force attacks and social engineering attempts that could potentially result in unauthorized access to those protected files and documents,"" Fowler further said. What Fowler did observe as part of his investigation was a trove of publicly visible patient documents that are clearly labeled as things like psychotherapy intake notes and professional assessments on individual patient health. There are also documents outlining patient histories of mental health, substance abuse, family issues, psychiatric history and other problems. There were also many other files included in the leak such as administrative documents and verification records, i.e., state-issued identification and insurance cards. Other files include drug tests, some with Personally Identifiable Information (PII), that show positive results for substances like cannabis and alcohol. Much of the leaked data had been collected by Confidant's proprietary chatbots and artificial intelligence (AI), meaning robots rather than humans were in charge of it. Confidant has long bragged about its advanced chatbots and AI programs, which the company claims are pros rather than cons. ""A data-centric environment like the one we are constructing lends itself to leveraging AI to make predictive suggestions,"" said Confidant's co-founder Sam Arsenault Wilson in a 2022 interview. ""That's where we're headed once the data reaches proper scale."" In a report he compiled for the security website vpnMentor, Fowler noted that in a random sampling of data he reviewed, the open and publicly accessible files ""contained what could be considered a very serious potential risk to the personal privacy and PII of those individuals."" Of the approximately 1,000 files he personally reviewed to better understand how the data breach occurred in the first place, Fowler revealed that he ""was able to view using only a web browser,"" meaning anyone can access the leaked files without any understanding of hacking. Fowler made note of the fact that maintaining an exposed database of documents without password protection like Confidant has been doing is highly unusual, especially in the healthcare industry.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart",1,"The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection? Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease. The gut-heart connection The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects. ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse. One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque. Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO. In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less. The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat. Fiber at work Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels. But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health. Other supporting foods It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health. The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw. ""And if your gut is healthy, there is a greater chance your heart is healthy, too."" Image: © CareyHope/Getty Images",3,0.34324154,-0.019962277
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dont-count-on-a-supplement-to-fix-high-cholesterol,Don't count on a supplement to fix high cholesterol,1,"Six types of supplements touted to reduce high cholesterol don't do the job, according to a randomized trial published online Oct. 19, 2022, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Researchers (including Harvard experts) randomly assigned 190 people (ages 40 to 75) with high levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol to take either 5 milligrams of the cholesterol-lowering statin drug rosuvastatin; a supplement containing fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice; or a placebo (inactive pill). After four weeks, people in the statin group showed a 37% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 24% drop in total cholesterol, and a 19% drop in blood triglycerides. Meanwhile, people in the supplement and placebo groups didn't have any significant decreases in these measures. In fact, there were some adverse effects: LDL cholesterol went up for people taking the garlic supplement, and ""good"" HDL cholesterol dropped for people taking the plant sterols, compared with people taking a placebo. The study was brief, and researchers say it's possible it wasn't long enough to give some supplements a chance to work. But they also point out that the contents of dietary supplements vary and don't produce consistent results. They warn that supplements that are marketed for cholesterol or heart health are unlikely to be effective. Image: © Grace Cary/Getty Images",3,0.27451593,0.05641251
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/what-should-be-my-cholesterol-goal-with-a-family-history-of-heart-disease,What should be my cholesterol goal with a family history of heart disease?,1,"Q. I'm a 70-year-old man with a family history of coronary artery disease. I currently take a low-dose statin. My recent LDL number is 105. Should I aim for a lower number? A. My situation is similar to yours. I have some family members who died young secondary to coronary heart disease, and I run a high total and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. I exercise regularly and try to follow a Mediterranean-style diet. About 15 years ago, my doctor recommended starting a statin. Even at a low dose, I experienced more aches and pains than I had previously. I stopped the statin, but in retrospect, I now doubt that the muscle aches were related to the drug. Eight years ago, I had a chest CT scan unrelated to any heart issues. My lungs were fine, but the scan showed calcium deposits in my arteries, including the coronary arteries that feed oxygen and nutrients to the heart. That was a game changer. Calcium gets deposited into fatty plaques that accumulate in the arteries. I knew this indicated that my risks of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke were significantly elevated. I immediately began taking the maximum dose of rosuvastatin (Crestor). Interestingly, I had no muscle aches, even with the high dose. In general, the lower your LDL cholesterol number, the lower your risk of developing heart disease. My high risk and need for a high-dose statin became apparent after the CT scan. But what about you and the millions of men with a similar family history or a somewhat elevated LDL level? Here's the discussion I would have with a man like you, who has a higher-than-ideal LDL level and is asking about increasing his statin dose or might not be on a statin yet. If you desire to maximally reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, aim for an LDL level of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). This means lifestyle changes, including a healthier diet and more physical activity. But you might also want to talk with your doctor about starting a low-dose statin or raising the dose if you already take one. An alternative is to have a coronary artery CT scan to get your coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. The test calculates the amount of calcium deposited in your coronary arteries. A zero score means a very low risk of trouble, and a high score means you might aim for an LDL level of 55 mg/dL or lower (the European Society of Cardiology recommendation for people at very high risk).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/a-three-pronged-approach-to-exercise,A three-pronged approach to exercise,1,"There's no question that getting regular exercise ranks as one of the leading strategies — if not the best one — for preventing heart disease. All forms of physical activity, even in small doses, can make a difference. But if you're looking to optimize your cardiovascular health, a regimen that includes three types of movement may be the way to go, according to a 2024 review article in Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine. The foundation of this exercise triad is moderate-intensity aerobic (cardio) exercise like brisk walking, one of the go-to options for meeting the federal activity guidelines (see ""Exercise recommendations and examples""). Moderate activity benefits your heart by burning calories and boosting metabolism, which helps control weight. But you can reap additional benefits by adding vigorous aerobic activity (the type that really gets your heart pumping) along with muscle-strengthening exercises. Exercise recommendations and examples Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity (or an equivalent combination of the two). Do strength training at least two days per week — even 10 to 15 minutes per session can be effective. Your age, baseline fitness level, and health conditions all affect what workout is best for you. Ask your doctor for help creating a safe three-part workout to optimize your heart health. Moderate-intensity exercise Vigorous-intensity exercise Walking, level surface, 2.5–4.5 mph Walking, level surface, 4.5 mph or faster, or walking briskly uphill Hiking, level surface Jogging or running, or hiking uphill Bicycling, level terrain, 5–10 mph Bicycling, 10 mph or faster, or up hills Stationary bike (indoor), moderate pace Spinning class (indoor cycling) Tennis, doubles Tennis, singles Swimming, recreational Swimming, steady laps Muscle-building exercise (also called strength, weight, or resistance training) Weight training using dumbbells, medicine balls, kettlebells, weighted ropes, or specialized machines at home or in gyms and fitness centers Exercises with resistance bands Body-weight exercises (such as push-ups, sit-ups, and squats) Heavy gardening or yard work (such as digging and shoveling) Certain forms of yoga (such as Ashtanga, Vinyasa, and Iyengar) How aerobic exercise helps ""People who run or do similar types of vigorous exercise may have experienced a 'runner's high' either during or after their workout,"" says Dr. Tim Churchill, a cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. That's because your body releases feel-good chemicals known as endorphins and endocannabinoids in response to intense exercise. Any kind of aerobic exercise, whether moderate or vigorous, also helps dampen the body's ""fight or flight"" response, which plays a role in chronic stress and anxiety. Aerobic exercise also spurs the release of adrenalin and related hormones that stimulate receptors in the heart to beat more frequently and forcefully. Over time, the heart becomes more efficient, requiring less effort to send blood through the body. And as more blood circulates through the body, blood vessels expand slightly and become more flexible. Why muscle-building matters Including muscle-building exercises in your weekly routine has a synergistic effect with aerobic exercise that can further enhance your heart health. Strength training can make your body more efficient at burning fat for energy. It also helps improve how your body responds to insulin, the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels, Dr. Churchill says. That can help prevent or improve diabetes, a potent risk factor for heart disease. Strength training also promotes the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels. ""Your arteries are then better able to relax, which helps to maintain normal blood pressure,"" says Dr. Churchill. As the review article notes, combining strength with moderate-intensity and some vigorous aerobic exercise leads to greater reductions in resting heart rate, blood pressure, body weight, and body fat percentage than doing single forms of exercise. ""Exercise clearly improves a lot of specific markers related to cardiovascular disease. But when you add up all those individual effects, it still only accounts for about 50% of the overall health benefit related to doing regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Churchill. The elusive remaining 50% is why the decades-long quest to create ""exercise in a pill"" will probably never materialize, he adds. Image: © Pyataeva Irina/Getty Images",6,0.3890982,-0.22482464

Researchers surveyed nearly 1,300 people twice over a 10-year span, inquiring about their job schedules and physical activity levels while at work. They also asked about participants' sleep habits, identifying three sleep health categories: good sleepers, catch-up sleepers, and insomnia-like sleepers. Compared with active work, sedentary work was 37% likelier to lead to a variety of insomnia symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep, interrupted sleep, and frequent daytime tiredness. The findings also indicated that workers who fall into a pattern of poor sleep due to their job design can end up stuck in such unhealthy patterns for many years. Insomnia-like sleepers, for example, reported their symptoms persisted 10 years later, at the end of the study. People with sedentary jobs who move their bodies during the workday can help protect themselves against developing longstanding sleep problems, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/will-diverticulitis-heal-on-its-own,Will diverticulitis heal on its own?,1,"Your doctor spotted diverticula in a previous colonoscopy, but you never thought the little pouches in your large intestine (colon) would turn into little devils. Now pain in your gut is telling you something is wrong. Do you have diverticulitis, and will it get better without medical care? How it happens Diverticula develop when weak spots in the colon lining bulge outward, creating little pouches or potholes. They more often form in the sigmoid colon, which runs down the left side of the pelvis and then joins the rectum. ""Most people never have a problem with them. They're extremely common: they are present in about 70% of us by age 80,"" says Dr. Alexander Goldowsky, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. But sometimes diverticula bleed, or they become inflamed or infected, a condition called diverticulitis. Recognizing diverticulitis Diverticulitis tends to cause pain in the lower left part of your abdomen. ""It's not typical tummy trouble. It's a different kind of pain that can be significant and severe,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. Although diverticula rarely cause symptoms, diverticulitis can cause bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool. If a diverticulum is infected, you might have a fever, chills, or vomiting in addition to pain. ""If it's the first time you've had this kind of pain, reach out to your doctor right away,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you have a history of diverticulitis and you develop mild symptoms, let your doctor know. He or she may just recommend temporary dietary changes and taking it easy. But if things aren't improving, call your doctor again."" Don't put off calling; an infected diverticulum can form an abscess (pus-filled pocket) that can extend to other tissue in the body and become life-threatening. In rare cases, that new colon pain may indicate cancer. Diagnosis After you've alerted your doctor about gut pain, you'll need to go in for a physical exam. This exam can involve checking your abdomen for tenderness and the rectum for signs of blood. You might need blood and stool tests. But the main way to diagnose diverticulitis is with a CT scan, typically after a special type of contrast dye is injected into your vein. ""If we see inflammation surrounding one or more diverticula, we can determine that you have diverticulitis,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. Treatment Can diverticulitis heal on its own? ""Yes, it can, and for that reason, we don't always prescribe antibiotics. We reserve them for diverticulitis in people with an abscess, a significant amount of inflammation, symptoms that aren't improving, a suppressed immune system, frailty, or other health problems — such as liver or kidney disease,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. Care at home, with or without an antibiotic, includes rest, a clear liquid diet (see ""A liquid diet for diverticulitis""), and acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain. You might want to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), which can add to gastrointestinal discomfort. For severe diverticulitis, you might need to be hospitalized for a few days, getting antibiotics directly into a vein. If you have an abscess, you might need surgery to clean out the infection. A liquid diet for diverticulitis When you have diverticulitis, you might need a clear liquid diet, to give your colon a break from digesting solid foods. A liquid diet can include clear drinks and foods, such as water, broth or bouillon, black coffee, plain tea, clear juice (apple, white grape), clear soft drinks or sports drinks, Jell-O, or popsicles. There's no need to stay on a liquid diet for more than 48 hours unless recommended by your doctor. Getting better Healing from diverticulitis requires commitment. If you're taking an oral antibiotic, make sure you stick to the medication schedule. If you're on a liquid diet, avoid cheating. Once symptoms begin improving, you can move to a low-fiber diet. It includes animal protein (eggs, cheese, fish, poultry); certain cooked vegetables (carrots, green beans, potatoes, pumpkin, yams, or squash); low-fiber fruits (bananas, peaches, pears); and (if your doctor says it's okay) low-fiber breads such as white, sourdough, or refined wheat breads. Stay away from spicy, fatty foods and alcohol. If you feel up to it, it's okay to exercise, but go easy on yourself. ""Avoid abdominal exercise. Go for a walk or do some arm exercises with small dumbbells,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you feel uncomfortable, take a break."" And buckle in: it could be 10 days before your symptoms go away completely. Image: © milorad kravic/Getty Images",9,0.15083368,-0.03266653
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-stress-busters-to-help-your-heart,5 stress busters to help your heart,1,"Easing stress is one key to a healthier heart Stress that persists day in and day out — whether from a traffic-choked daily commute, unhappy relationship, or heavy workload — has been linked to a wide range of health issues. Many people know first-hand that chronic stress can negatively affect mood, sleep, and appetite. But you may not know that chronic stress can harm your heart –– or understand what you can do to counter its effects. How does long-term stress harm the heart? Chronic stress leads to persistent low-grade inflammation in the body, which increases the risk of heart disease. Mood, sleep, and appetite changes brought on by the constant hum of stress can do so, too. And stress may influence your risk of heart attack and other heart conditions in more subtle ways. For example, when under stress, some of us eat unhealthy food or lack the energy or time to exercise. Stress can also trigger heart-damaging behaviors such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol. 5 great ways to destress Breaking the connection between chronic stress and heart disease requires finding tools that can help you cope with stress and aim for healthier habits. These five simple tips can help you do just that. Tap into laughter. Laughter has been found to lower levels of stress hormones and reduce inflammation in the arteries. Silly shows, corny jokes, and funny animal videos all count! Meditate. Finding time for a simple combination of inward-focused thought and deep breathing reduces heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure. Meditative practices like yoga, tai chi, mindfulness, and prayer can also relax the mind and body. Try activity. Every time you are physically active, whether you take a walk or play tennis, your brain releases mood-boosting chemicals called endorphins. Short bursts of exercise can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. And exercising regularly not only helps you ease stress, it also protects against heart disease by lowering your blood pressure, strengthening your heart muscle, and helping you maintain a healthy weight. Unplug. It's impossible to escape stress when it follows you everywhere. Cut the cord. Avoid emails and TV news. Take time each day — even if it's for just 10 or 15 minutes — to escape from the world. Find ways to destress. Simple things, like a relaxing bath, listening to music, spending time in nature or on a favorite hobby, can give you a much-needed break from the stressors in your life.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-to-leverage-neuroplasticity-to-maintain-cognitive-fitness-as-you-age,Tips to leverage neuroplasticity to maintain cognitive fitness as you age,1,"As we age, maintaining cognitive fitness becomes increasingly important. The brain's ability to adapt and rewire itself — known as neuroplasticity — plays a crucial role in keeping our minds sharp. While aging can bring natural changes to the brain, engaging in specific activities and lifestyle choices can help preserve and even enhance cognitive function. Understanding neuroplasticity and incorporating brain-boosting habits into daily life can support mental agility and overall brain health. What is neuroplasticity and what's the connection to cognitive fitness? Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt throughout life by modifying its structure, functions, or neural pathways. Dr. Andrew E. Budson, Chief of Cognitive & Behavioral Neurology at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System and chair of the Science of Learning Innovation Group at Harvard Medical School, explains, ""Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to learn, remember, and change when it is appropriate for the circumstances."" This adaptability allows the brain to reorganize itself in response to learning, experiences, and environmental influences. Cognitive fitness — the ability to think, learn, and remember effectively — depends on a healthy and adaptable brain. By actively engaging in behaviors that support neuroplasticity, you can strengthen cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of age-related decline. Keys to cognitive fitness Maintaining cognitive fitness involves a combination of mental, physical, and social activities. Each of these factors plays a role in supporting neuroplasticity and promoting lifelong brain health. A healthy body supports a healthy brain. This means it is important to manage your health conditions. Lifestyle choices are also crucial. Maintaining cognitive fitness as you age is best achieved by combining these key approaches: Eat a brain-healthy diet. Engage in regular physical activity. Prioritize quality sleep. Challenge your brain. Nurture social connections. Manage stress. How physical activity supports cognitive health Exercise is not just beneficial for the body — it also has a powerful impact on the brain. Neuroplasticity is closely linked to the production of neurotrophins, a group of proteins that play a vital role in brain cell growth and function. Among the key neurotrophins involved in neuroplasticity is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research suggests that lower levels of BDNF may contribute to cognitive decline, affecting memory, concentration, and learning ability. Dr. Budson highlights that aerobic exercise plays a critical role in promoting neuroplasticity, as it triggers the release of brain growth factors. He states, ""From the perspective of the body, we know that brain growth factors are released when we engage in aerobic exercise, so that is critically important."" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Greater cognitive health benefits are seen at higher levels. Physical activity — both aerobic exercise and strength training — also increases blood flow to the brain and reduces stress and inflammation. Together, these changes improve mood, memory, focus, and processing speed, helping to preserve cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of dementia, particularly in older adults. Nutrition and brain health A nutritious diet plays a significant role in maintaining cognitive function. Although the brain makes up only 2% of body weight, it utilizes 20% of the body's energy. The Mediterranean diet has been associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. This diet emphasizes fruits, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fish, legumes, nuts, and healthy fats like extra virgin olive oil. Another diet — the MIND diet — incorporates elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets. According to a study published in the journal Neurology, it may slow cognitive decline compared to other eating patterns. The MIND diet emphasizes plant-based foods and limits consumption of animal products and saturated fats. It highlights green leafy vegetables, nuts, berries, poultry, and fish. On the flip side, high-fat, high-refined-sugar diets have been linked to decreased BDNF and neuroplasticity. Avoiding excessive sugar and processed foods can also help maintain mental clarity and prevent inflammation that may contribute to poor brain health. Challenge your brain to boost neuroplasticity Just as physical exercise strengthens muscles, mental challenges help keep the brain sharp. Research shows that engaging in diverse, stimulating activities supports brain health by promoting neuroplasticity. Lifelong learning plays a key role in cognitive fitness by strengthening neural connections and enhancing cognitive reserve — the brain's ability to maintain function despite aging or disease. This reserve builds over time through education, career experiences, and mentally engaging activities, acting as a defense against cognitive decline. Dr. Budson suggests engaging in learning-based activities such as taking an adult education course, picking up a new hobby, or even reading books that introduce new concepts. ""Meeting new people and learning about them is a great way to enhance neuroplasticity, as is traveling to a new place,"" he adds. By regularly challenging your mind, you can strengthen neural pathways and support long-term brain health. Here are some additional ways to keep your brain active: Try something new. Learning a new language, instrument, or skill (like painting or cooking) forms fresh neural connections. Challenge yourself. Increase the difficulty of puzzles, games, or reading material to continuously build cognitive reserve. Mix up mental workouts. Avoid routine by incorporating different activities like strategy games, creative hobbies, and problem-solving exercises. Engage in cultural and social activities. Attending concerts, museums, or plays stimulates the brain and encourages deeper learning. Travel and explore. Visiting new places, even locally, enhances brain plasticity by exposing you to novel experiences. Enjoy music and movement. Playing an instrument, dancing, or even listening to music supports cognitive and emotional well-being. Prioritize sleep for brain health Quality sleep is essential for cognitive function and memory consolidation. During sleep, the brain processes and stores information, clears out toxins, and repairs neural pathways. Dr. Budson explains, ""There is now a tremendous body of evidence that memories are consolidated during sleep. Memory consolidation is the process of short-term memories turning into long-term memories."" He highlights that sleep not only strengthens important memories, but also helps regulate emotions and integrate new knowledge with prior experiences, making it crucial for neuroplasticity. Despite common belief, your sleep needs don't decrease as you age. Adults in their 70s and beyond still require seven to nine hours per night. However, changes in sleep patterns can make it more challenging. As you get older, you may fall asleep and wake up earlier, struggle to drift off, or experience more frequent awakenings during the night. It's fine to take a short nap during the day, which counts toward your total sleep. Try these sleep-improving strategies: Stick to a schedule. Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, even on weekends. Get morning sunlight. Exposure to natural light early in the day helps regulate sleep cycles. Exercise regularly. Physical activity improves sleep quality, but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime. Watch your diet. Eat a light dinner and avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, and nicotine before bed. Limit screen time. Turn off electronics at least an hour before bed to reduce blue light exposure. Create a sleep-friendly environment. Keep your bedroom cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable. Establish a bedtime routine. Engage in calming activities like reading, stretching, meditation, or deep breathing. Chronic sleep deprivation can impair concentration, decision-making, and long-term brain health. If you regularly struggle to fall or stay asleep, talk to your doctor to identify the cause and explore the best treatment options. Reduce stress for a brain boost Chronic stress can take a toll on brain function by increasing levels of cortisol, a hormone that can damage neurons and inhibit neuroplasticity. However, practicing effective stress management techniques can help protect cognitive health and support long-term brain function. One particularly effective approach is mindfulness meditation. Research suggests that regular meditation promotes structural and functional changes in brain regions responsible for attention, emotional regulation, and memory. While research is ongoing, meditation is believed to support neuroplasticity by fostering the growth of new brain cells and connections, potentially mitigating the harmful effects of stress. In addition to meditation, other stress-reducing strategies include deep breathing exercises, listening to music, and spending time in nature. By incorporating these techniques into daily life, you can help reduce stress while supporting overall brain health and cognitive function. Social engagement and mental sharpness Staying socially connected is essential for preserving memory and cognitive function as you age. Research shows that those with active social lives are less likely to experience cognitive decline compared to individuals who are more isolated. Engaging in conversations and interactive activities stimulates key mental processes like attention and memory. Regular social interaction helps reinforce neural connections, slowing age-related decline and potentially delaying dementia by strengthening cognitive reserve. To support brain health, consider these engaging ways to stay socially active: traveling to new places attending cultural events such as theater, concerts, or art exhibitions joining social or retirement groups spending quality time with family and friends. By making social engagement a priority, you can help protect cognitive function while enjoying meaningful connections and experiences.",6,0.25685787,-0.15866219

The effect was thought to be short-lived, but a study published online Dec. 10, 2024, by the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity suggests it may last a full day. Scientists gathered data from 76 men and women, ages 50 to 83, who wore activity trackers for eight days and took cognitive tests each day. On average, people did about an hour of moderate-to-vigorous exercise, five hours of light activity, and nine hours of sedentary time each day. Moderate-to-vigorous exercise included activities that raised the heart rate, such as brisk walking, dancing, or walking up and down stairs. When comparing activity levels with memory test results, the researchers found that any amount of moder-ate-to-vigorous physical activity was associated with higher scores on memory tests on the following day regardless of time spent in sedentary behavior or light activity. In particular, participants showed better working memory and episodic memory (memory of events). Exercise increases blood flow to the brain and stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine, which help a range of cognitive functions, according to the researchers. These neurochemical changes have been understood to last up to a few hours after exercise, but the new findings suggest they may last longer. Image: © Deagreez/Getty Images",6,0.3912287,-0.26481065

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/exercises-that-go-easy-on-the-bladder,Exercises that go easy on the bladder,1,"The high-impact exercise you once loved no longer seems to be a good fit, now that stress incontinence has crept into your life. Maybe you leak urine if you swing your tennis racket with force or do any high-spirited jumping in an aerobics class. The discomfort, hassle, and embarrassment might make you want to give up on your routine. But simple solutions can keep you in action. Exercise and incontinence Stress incontinence is characterized by the leakage of small amounts of urine when you do anything that puts pressure on the bladder, whether that's coughing, laughing, or exercising. The leaks are the result of weakened pelvic floor muscles. These muscles normally help you hold in urine, bowel movements, and gas. ""Ideally, the muscles would respond to increased pressure by contracting to prevent leakage. But with stress incontinence, the muscles don't respond properly,"" says Emily Walsh, a pelvic floor physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Weak pelvic floor muscles can result from aging, pregnancy, childbirth, certain surgeries, medication side effects, garbled messages between the muscles and the brain, weak abdominal or hip muscles (which work with the pelvic floor muscles), or conditions that cause you to strain the pelvic floor muscles (such as constipation). Try these exercises You need aerobic exercise (the kind that works your heart and lungs) for good cardiovascular health. Since high-impact aerobic exercise is demanding on pelvic floor muscles, consider low-impact aerobics with gentler moves. For example, instead of playing tennis, play pickleball (avoid lunging for the ball or running across the court); instead of going for a run, go for a brisk walk; instead of taking Zumba classes, take ballroom dance lessons. Other types of low-impact exercise that won't overload pelvic muscles include swimming; cycling; and seated aerobics, boxing, or dance. Physical therapy ""If your goal is returning to high-impact activity, consider working with a pelvic floor physical therapist. We can tailor treatment to the symptoms you're having and the activities you want to do,"" Walsh says. Treatment might include any of the following. Kegel exercises. Your therapist can help you identify your pelvic floor muscles and strengthen them. One way to do this is called a Kegel exercise. All it involves is squeezing like you're trying to stop the flow of urine or hold back gas, holding the contraction for about 10 seconds, relaxing, and repeating. Abdominal and hip exercises. ""By strengthening abdominal and hip muscles, you're also strengthening the pelvic floor, since there's overlap among the muscles,"" Walsh says. Examples include bridges, planks (see ""Move of the month""), and clamshells (lying on your side with your knees bent and raising and lowering only your top knee while keeping your feet together). Breathing exercises. ""A lot of people hold their breath while exercising, but that puts increased pressure on pelvic floor muscles and weakens them,"" Walsh says. ""A helpful cue is exhaling with exertion. Breathe out at the hardest part of the exercise, which will give you more intense contractions of the abdominal and pelvic floor muscles."" Move of the month: Modified plank Doing a modified plank can strengthen abdominal and pelvic floor muscles. Place your forearms on a table or counter with your hands clasped and your shoulders aligned over your elbows. Step back so your body is straight, like a plank. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Hold for 15 to 60 seconds, take a break, then repeat. Exercise photo by Thomas MacDonald Other tips to help Practicing the following strategies can also help you cope with stress incontinence during exercise. Prepare for leaks. Wear absorbent ""bladder leak"" underwear or an absorbent pad. You'll stay comfortable and will be able to keep exercising. Empty your bladder just before exercising. This is easy to do at home. If you're exercising elsewhere, it helps to locate bathrooms in advance. Squeeze during exertion. Walsh suggests doing a Kegel-style contraction as you exert yourself with force — as you swing a racket, for example. Stay hydrated throughout the day. You might be inclined to avoid drinking a lot of fluids, hoping to reduce urine leaks. But that can lead to dehydration, which can cause confusion, fatigue, and falls — problems you always want to avoid, especially during exercise. Talk to your doctor. If you continue to leak during exercise, consult your doctor about other incontinence treatments, such as medication or surgery. Image: © kali9/Getty Images",9,0.2598188,-0.17765267
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-stop-stressing-over-minor-memory-lapses,How to stop stressing over minor memory lapses,1,"Everybody knows about ""senior moments"" — episodes of momentary forgetfulness about things like someone's name or where you parked the car. You might not fret about these cognitive hiccups if they're infrequent. But what if you're constantly forgetting little details? The stress of worrying about memory loss can be taxing and make your thinking skills even fuzzier. ""When you're stressed, your focus is pulled off of the tasks you're working on and you may begin thinking or worrying about the stressor. This can decrease mental clarity and make it harder to focus, making mild memory lapses more prominent,"" says Dr. Stephanie Buss, a cognitive neurologist and director of the Memory Disorders A2Z Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Is it warranted? It's natural to be concerned about memory loss. ""This can stem from seeing family members or friends who've received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, or it might come from noticing cognitive changes over time,"" Dr. Buss says. That doesn't mean your thinking skills are faltering. Small memory lapses can be normal with aging. This includes things like forgetting someone's name briefly (feeling that it's on the tip of your tongue) or walking into a room and momentarily forgetting why you walked in.

Crucial steps to cope A healthy lifestyle is essential for handling stress of any kind and for maintaining brain health as we age. What does a healthy lifestyle involve? ""Physical activity is one of the most important factors. It promotes healthy cognitive aging, reduces stress, and helps with sleep and mood,"" Dr. Buss says. ""We also strongly recommend that you stay socially engaged, connecting with friends and family regularly. Cognitive activities such as reading, puzzles, games, or listening to music are also vital for maintaining brain health, and are especially powerful when paired with social activities."" Sleep is also key to brain health. You need a full night's sleep (at least seven to nine hours a night) to help the brain cement information into memories and flush away waste associated with Alzheimer's disease.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/fasting-before-lipid-test-usually-unnecessary,Fasting before lipid test usually unnecessary,1,"Q. Do I need to fast before my cholesterol test? A. For most people, the answer is no. Here's the backstory: For decades, we've told people not to eat or drink (except for water and medications) for eight to 12 hours before a cholesterol test. This was based on the thought that a measurement done after fasting would provide a more accurate assessment of all the lipids (fats) in the blood, including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, studies show that the differences between fasting and non-fasting values for cholesterol are usually negligible. An analysis using data from a clinical trial of 4,100 people compared the results from lipid tests done with and without fasting. The LDL (bad) cholesterol values were only about 4 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) higher when people weren't fasting. Because the cholesterol guidelines focus on LDL, whether you are fasting won't matter for determining whether your LDL is at goal. So if people come to my clinic and they've had breakfast or lunch, we go ahead and take a blood sample. But triglycerides are another story. After you eat, your body immediately converts any excess calories from food into triglycerides, which are then stored in fat cells. In addition, any saturated fat you eat is broken down into smaller fatty particles called chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream and further contribute to a temporary rise in triglycerides. Some people have high triglyceride levels, which is more common among those who are overweight or have diabetes or prediabetes (and some people have inherited a tendency for this problem). For these people, not fasting can often lead to very high triglyceride levels. So anyone who has ever had a high triglyceride level should always fast before a lipid test. This will provide a more accurate assessment of their triglyceride value, which is then used to inform treatment recommendations. If a person's triglycerides are higher than 150 mg/dl on a fasting lipid test, that is linked to a higher risk of heart attack or related cardiovascular issues. Treatment starts with diet and exercise but may include medications, although the latter are usually reserved for people who have heart disease or are at high risk for it, including those with diabetes. When I see a new patient, I look back at their earlier lipid test results. If most of their triglycerides are within the normal range (below 150 mg/dL), I tell them they don't need to fast before their blood test. But if some of their values are high, I ask them to fast. Because fasting can be challenging if you can't schedule a morning blood test, ask your doctor if not fasting is an option for you. Image: © StefaNikolic/Getty Images",3,0.29790783,-0.015676245
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-white-noise-really-help-you-sleep-better,Can white noise really help you sleep better?,1,"Some people find that the neutral sound of white noise helps them sleep better. But is there evidence to support this? And what about other noise colors? What is white noise? White noise has been compared to the static from a radio that isn't tuned to a specific station. Technically, the term ""white noise"" refers to noise that contains all frequencies of the sounds that people can hear, in equal parts. (Frequency is the rate at which sound waves vibrate.) Can white noise help you sleep better? Studies on the benefits of white noise for sleep have yielded mixed results. Some studies have found it helped people sleep better, possibly by masking outside noises and serving as a cue to fall asleep. ""A study in infants and children showed that white noise may reduce heart rate and respiratory rate, effectively lulling an individual to sleep,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and physician in the division of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. However, a systematic review published in Sleep Medicine Reviews found white noise had little beneficial effect on sleep. What's more, according to Dr. Javaheri, white noise may interrupt important stages of sleep, such as REM sleep or deep sleep, and affect hearing if it is too loud. If you use a white noise machine for sleep, try moving it to a corner of your bedroom and keep the noise level no louder than that of a background conversation. Turn on your white noise machine just before getting into bed. If your machine has a timer, experiment with having it play only as you fall asleep rather than all night long. Other noise colors for better sleep: Pink noise and brown noise While white noise is the best known, it's not the only ""color"" noise that's been used to enhance sleep. Pink noise has more intense, lower frequencies that make it sound deeper than white noise. Examples of pink noise are the sounds of rain or a waterfall. Some studies have found that pink noise can enhance deep sleep in older adults and improve cognitive performance. In addition, research suggests that pink noise may decrease time to fall asleep and improve sleep quality. However, these results were achieved under experimental conditions in which researchers adjusted pink noise timing during the night. Another color noise — brown noise — reduces higher sound frequencies even more than pink noise and is described as grainier or rougher. For example, brown noise can be compared to ocean waves crashing, while pink noise is more like a gentle rain. ""More data is needed to determine what role pink and brown noise may play in sleep, such as what volume and duration would be of most benefit,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""For now, I would not recommend pink or brown noise continuously, but rather use it for a set time if it helps you fall asleep more quickly.""",6,0.13471605,-0.14251845

Their posts provide tips and tricks to get longer, better, and more restorative sleep. And why not? Sleep is considered a pillar of good health and is related to everything from brain health to cardiovascular health, and even diabetes. But what exactly is sleepmaxxing? And how likely is it to deliver on claims of amped-up energy, a boost to the immune system, reducing stress levels, and improving your mood? What is sleepmaxxing? Depending on which social media platform you happen to be looking at, the recommended strategies for maximizing sleep differ. Tips include: taping your mouth shut while sleeping not drinking anything during the two hours before bedtime a cold room temperature a dark bedroom using a white noise machine not setting a morning alarm showering one hour before bedtime eliminating caffeine eating kiwis before going to bed taking magnesium and melatonin using weighted blankets getting 30 minutes of sunlight every day meditating daily for 30 minutes. Does any research support sleepmaxxing? A thorough search through PubMed, PsycNet, and Google Scholar reveals zero results for the terms ""sleepmaxx"" and ""sleepmaxxing."" But wait — this certainly doesn't mean that some influencer-recommended strategies are not evidence-based, just that the concept of sleepmaxxing, as a defined package, has not been scientifically studied. But yes, some of the strategies — including one uncomfortable, though popular, choice — lack evidence. Can mouth-taping improve your sleep? TikTok users have claimed that taping your mouth while you sleep has benefits, such as reducing snoring and improving bad breath. A team from the department of otolaryngology at George Washington University was prompted by all of the social media buzz on the topic to review research on the impact of nocturnal mouth taping. Spoiler alert: the authors note that most TikTok mouth-taping claims aren't supported by research. If you do snore, it's important to discuss this with your medical team. Even if taping your mouth reduces your snoring, it can't effectively treat a potential underlying cause of the snoring, such as allergies, asthma, or sleep apnea. Sleepmaxxing or basic sleep hygiene? Many strategies recommended by sleepmaxxers are essentially what sleep experts prescribe as good sleep hygiene, which has plenty of research backing its value. Common components of sleep hygiene are decreasing caffeine and alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, sleep timing, reducing evening light exposure, limiting daytime naps, and having a cool bedroom. While tips like these help many people enjoy restful sleep, those who have an insomnia disorder will need more help, as described below. Melatonin, early bedtime, weighted blankets, and — kiwi fruit? Other strategies suggested by sleepmaxxers are based on limited scientific data. For example: Taking melatonin is recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to treat circadian rhythm disorders such as jet lag. But it's not recommended for insufficient sleep, poor sleep quality, or difficulty with falling asleep or staying asleep. Is it healthier to be asleep by 10 p.m.? One video that garnered more than a million views claims it is. While it is important to maximize morning sunlight exposure and minimize evening light exposure to regulate circadian rhythms, there is such variability in how much sleep someone requires and individual chronotypes (not to mention varying personal and professional responsibilities!) that it is difficult to state there is an ideal bedtime for everyone. While intriguing research has been done on weighted blankets, there is no convincing evidence that they are truly effective for the general adult population. Overall, it's important to be cautious about the impact of the placebo effect on how someone sleeps. An analysis of more than 30 studies showed that roughly 64% of the drug response for a sleep medication in insomnia patients could be due to the placebo effect. A key takeaway is that studies that are not randomized controlled trials — such as this small study on 24 people suggesting that kiwi fruit may improve sleep — should be interpreted with a grain of salt. Could you have orthosomnia? The expectation of flawless sleep, night in and night out, is an unrealistic goal. Orthosomnia is a term that describes an unhealthy pursuit of perfect sleep. The pressure to get perfect sleep is embedded in the sleepmaxxing culture. With more and more people able to access daily data about their sleep and other health metrics through consumer wearables, even a person who is objectively sleeping well can become unnecessarily concerned with optimizing their sleep. While prioritizing restful sleep is commendable, setting perfection as your goal is problematic. Even good sleepers vary from night to night, experiencing less than desirable sleep a couple of times per week. It is also noteworthy that some of the most widely viewed recommendations on TikTok are not supported by scientific evidence. Do you really need to fix your sleep? A good first step is to understand whether or not there is anything that you need to fix! Consider tracking your sleep for a few weeks using a sleep diary, and pair this data with a consumer wearable (such as a Fitbit or Apple Watch). Both imperfectly capture sleep data when compared to the gold-standard tool sleep experts use (polysomnography, or a sleep study). However, combining the information can give you a reasonable assessment of your sleep status. Regularly getting restful sleep can indeed boost health and mood. And all of us can benefit from following basic sleep hygiene tips. But if it takes you 30 minutes or more to fall asleep, or if you are up for 30 minutes or more in the middle of the night, and this happens three or more times per week, then consider reaching out to your health care team to seek further evaluation. There are effective, nonmedication treatments that are proven to help you sleep better. One example is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which can dramatically improve insomnia symptoms in a matter of weeks. Want to learn more about cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/investigating-memory-loss,Investigating memory loss,1,"It can be scary not knowing if sudden memory lapses or other cognitive changes are just a natural aspect of aging or an early sign of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI falls between the cognitive decline associated with aging and the more serious signs of dementia. With MCI, some changes are noticeable but usually do not impede the ability to carry out daily functions. ""It's not unusual to be forgetful at times as you age, but if memory issues are more noticeable, it's always best to get checked out and undergo a cognitive test,"" says Sara Weisenbach, a neuropsychologist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""There are ways to slow the progression of cognitive decline or treat issues that could be causing memory lapses, but the sooner you can identify a problem, the better the outcome."" See your doctor Your first step is to see your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms, review your overall health and concerns, and assess any family history of dementia. An ideal time for this may be at an annual wellness visit. (Don't rely on results of online cognitive tests, as many are unreliable and may not offer an accurate evaluation, says Weisenbach.) Before your visit, make a list of your specific cognitive concerns to share with your doctor. Also, bring a family member or friend to your appointment. Their support can help ease your nerves, and they can provide their own observations. An in-office cognitive screening test lasts from five to 15 minutes. The test might include repeating a list of words immediately and then again after a short delay recalling personal information like addresses or birthdays naming objects in a picture answering questions about recent events drawing a clock to assess spatial orientation. ""The results might indicate a potential problem, but they usually are not sufficient for a formal MCI diagnosis,"" says Weisenbach. Senior moments or red flags? It can be difficult to gauge when memory issues need medical attention. But you probably should consult your doctor if you experience any of the following: frequent episodes of forgetfulness, like not recalling a recent conversation or missing appointments frequent trouble retaining new information, like a phone number or address errors in paying bills or taking medications difficulty finding your parked car, trouble finding your way in familiar areas, or minor car accidents. Additional testing Based on your test results and your doctor's assessment, you may be advised to undergo further testing and evaluation. If the results hint at memory loss or another cognitive issue, or if your doctor needs more information, the next step might be blood tests, which can help to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment, such as low vitamin B12, iron deficiency, or an underactive thyroid. The doctor may also recommend one or more brain imaging studies. An MRI scan can look for structural changes in the brain, like loss of volume and changes in blood flow. A PET scan can look for amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, one of the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's disease. Your doctor also may recommend a neuropsychological evaluation with a specialist like a neurologist or neuro-psychologist. This sit-down visit can last a few hours and explores your cognitive issues in more detail, such as when they began and the circumstances around them. For example, are you having trouble finding the right words when speaking? Do you regularly misplace your keys and phone? Can you not recall a conversation from the previous day? ""All this information can help determine if the issues are a sudden phenomenon or have worsened over time,"" says Weisenbach. ""A neuropsychologist can also help determine which cognitive skills are strong and which ones are more challenging."" Other factors are also considered when evaluating the test results. For instance, lower-than-expected scores can be influenced by medication side effects or mental health issues like depression, anxiety, or grief. Even if the neuropsychological examination does not suggest MCI, your doctor or neuropsychologist can help address any issues that may be related to your mental lapses. ""This initial screening also provides a baseline for future reference in case other memory issues arise or your situation worsens over time,"" says Weisenbach. ""If the results from the tests are inconclusive, you might be monitored for 12 to 18 months and then re-evaluated."" Image: © RUNSTUDIO/Getty Images",1,0.15208572,-0.29046395

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/is-it-time-for-a-cpap-checkup,Is it time for a CPAP checkup?,1,"Ever since your obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis, you've tried to use your continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine faithfully each night. Hopefully, it has restored your ability to sleep without snoring, coughing, choking, or suffering dozens of pauses in breathing per hour. And perhaps it helps you feel more alert, awake, and productive, and has begun to lower the risk of dangerous consequences related to sleep apnea, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and depression. But the gentle hum of the CPAP device doesn't guarantee that the therapy is working effectively; like a sensitive medication regimen, it needs to be assessed and monitored regularly. What is CPAP therapy? CPAP therapy prevents your upper airways from being blocked by throat muscles that relax too much during sleep. The therapy involves a small bedside compressor that pumps a forceful stream of air through a tube and into your nose via a mask you wear all night. A standard CPAP machine delivers a fixed air pressure, while an auto-CPAP machine automatically adjusts pressure based on your varying needs throughout the night, such as when you change position or shift into a new sleep stage. Your health care provider must prescribe the therapy. You then obtain the system through a medical equipment supplier. A technician from the supplier will work with you to find the right mask, set the specified air pressure settings to keep your airways open without disturbing your sleep, and answer ongoing questions about using the system. You can control the temperature and humidity of the air entering the mask. Additionally, you can choose how fast the air pressure increases: ""You can set it to ramp up over five minutes or 45 minutes, or select the 'auto-ramp' setting and have the machine adjust the pace automatically based on your breathing,"" explains Dr. Karen Lee, a neurologist and sleep medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Initial check-ups For CPAP therapy to be covered by insurance, you're required to see your health care provider 30 to 90 days after you start using the system. ""The clinician always needs to ensure that the CPAP has improved and hopefully resolved your sleep issues,"" Dr. Lee says, ""and what can be complicated is that you may not be aware of some of your sleep issues. For example, sleep apnea often increases the frequency of nighttime urinations, grinding or clenching your teeth, and night sweats. The clinician needs to ask appropriate questions to understand if your sleep is optimized while using CPAP."" At your first check-up, your provider will review data that the machine has been collecting. ""The machine tells us when you're using the device and estimates how many apnea episodes you're having per hour, when you're struggling to breathe, and whether air is leaking out your mouth or around the mask unintentionally,"" Dr. Lee says. Based on that information and your own observations, your clinician might prescribe a higher or lower air pressure. You might need to go back for additional visits and adjustments until the kinks are ironed out, which can take a few months. You may even require an overnight study in the sleep lab while using CPAP to help clarify any issues. All PAP therapies need regular evaluation Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is just one type of positive airway pressure (PAP). Other types include auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP), which provides a range of preset pressures throughout the night bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides two different preset pressures — a more powerful one when you inhale and a less powerful one when you exhale adaptive servo ventilation (ASV), an advanced device that provides pressure based on breathing patterns throughout the night. All these therapies need periodic assessment to determine how well they're working and whether the settings need adjustment. Additional check-ups Once the CPAP system is working for you, you'll need to have it re-evaluated at least once a year to see if the air pressure needs to be adjusted. These continuing follow-up appointments are important for many reasons. Data updates. Dr. Lee says that CPAP machines provide only estimated information, which sometimes is inaccurate. She needs to compare it with insights from a patient visit to determine if the CPAP really is helping. Worsening sleep apnea. Everything sags as we get older, even the airway, which causes the disease to advance over time. Weight loss or gain. Gaining weight can make sleep apnea worse; losing weight can make it better or even make it disappear. Either could potentially affect the pressure settings. Treatment side effects. Dr. Lee says that the brain sometimes reacts to CPAP in a way that creates another type of apnea. In that case, the settings or the actual device would need to be changed. Other sleep issues. ""We need to make sure all of your sleep needs are being addressed,"" Dr. Lee says, ""especially if you have other sleep disorders such as insomnia, restless legs syndrome, or sleepiness, despite effective CPAP treatment."" Missed check-ups Unfortunately, many people don't get regular CPAP check-ups. If you're among them, it could be that your clinician never told you that you need periodic assessments. ""While any health care provider can prescribe the therapy, they don't all know how to adjust it optimally or that they should evaluate it regularly,"" Dr. Lee says. Or you might not be getting CPAP check-ups because you feel better and don't think you need additional assessments you don't think the therapy is effective and have given up on it your schedule is too hectic you assume (mistakenly) that the medical equipment supplier is monitoring your health. When to call the expert If you've never had your CPAP use evaluated or haven't done so in a long time, Dr. Lee advises making an appointment with a sleep specialist or with the expert who prescribed the therapy. Dr. Lee also recommends calling your clinician any time new health problems or symptoms affect sleep. ""Come see me if you start snoring again or you're tired despite using the machine,"" she says. ""If you have questions, they need to be asked."" For more information, check out the Harvard Special Health Report Snoring and Sleep Apnea.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/lipoproteina-an-update-on-testing-and-treatment,Lipoprotein(a): An update on testing and treatment,1,"A fatty particle that circulates in the bloodstream, lipoprotein(a) is similar to LDL cholesterol but more dangerous. High levels of Lp(a), as it is commonly called, can double or even triple a person's risk of a heart attack. It's considered a common culprit in heart disease that occurs at a young age. So why do so few people know about it? Until recently, most guidelines didn't recommend testing for Lp(a) — but with good reason. Your genes determine your Lp(a) value. Eating and exercise habits have virtually no effect on the levels in your bloodstream. Plus, there were no effective treatments to lower Lp(a), which also elevates the risk of stroke and aortic stenosis (a thickened, stiff aortic valve). Now, with five promising therapies to lower Lp(a) in development, the landscape is changing. Here's the latest advice and information about Lp(a). Lp(a) testing trends International consensus groups recommend one-time Lp(a) testing for everyone. In Europe, such testing is routine. But in the United States, the first official endorsement for Lp(a) testing didn't appear until 2024, from the National Lipid Association. ""Recent data show that only 0.3% of people received Lp(a) screening between 2012 and 2019,"" says Harvard Medical School associate professor Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Also, about half of those tests were ordered by a very small number of health care providers, she adds. But Lp(a) testing should soon become more widespread, for several reasons. First, the tests are now covered by most insurers in most states. Second, even though targeted therapies to lower Lp(a) are not yet on the market, people with high levels (see ""Lp(a) readings: Check the units"") may benefit from more intensive treatment to manage their overall risk of heart disease, says Dr. O'Donoghue. ""This may include taking cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins, even if your LDL cholesterol is normal,"" she says. Low-dose aspirin is also being investigated as a possible therapy for preventing heart attacks in people with high Lp(a). Lp(a) readings: Check the units Labs report lipoprotein(a) values in two different units. The preferred method is nanomoles per liter (nmol/L), but many labs still use milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Currently, there's no universal consensus on what constitutes an abnormal Lp(a) level, but the thresholds shown below are commonly used. Lp(a) nmol/L mg/dL Normal Below 75 Below 30 High 125 and above 50 and above A one-time test? Unlike LDL, which rises with age and is influenced by diet and exercise, Lp(a) remains largely constant over a person's lifetime, so a one-time test suffices for screening. However, researchers are working to better understand changes that may occur in Lp(a) in women around the time of menopause and for men and women with certain medical conditions. The following groups of people are specifically recommended for testing: people with premature cardiovascular disease, defined as those who've had a heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or aortic stenosis before age 55 (for men) or 65 (for women) people who have a father, mother, sister, or brother with premature cardiovascular disease people with very high LDL cholesterol (190 mg/dL or higher) close relatives (siblings, children, and parents) of anyone with an elevated Lp(a) level. Therapies to lower Lp(a) Most of the drugs in development for lowering Lp(a) work by interfering with RNA, the molecule that copies and transfers genetic instructions from DNA, the cell's genetic blueprint. Currently, there are four RNA-based drugs that effectively silence the gene that makes Lp(a) in liver cells: lepodisiran, olpasiran, pelacarsen, and zerlasiran. All are administered by injection every one to six months and have been shown to lower Lp(a) levels 80% and 100%. The side effects appear to be limited to mild, short-lived pain at the injection site. Larger, longer trials looking at whether these drugs will help prevent heart-related problems are currently under way, with results expected within the next one to two years, says Dr. O'Donoghue, who is a lead investigator on the clinical trials of olpasiran. Preliminary results also look promising for another experimental drug called muvalapin, which works by preventing the assembly of the Lp(a) particle. Like the RNA-based drugs, muvalapin also leads to dramatic drops in Lp(a), but it is taken as a daily pill. Side effects include headache, back pain, and fatigue. While some people prefer pills over shots, injectable drugs have the advantage of much less frequent dosing, Dr. O'Donoghue notes. Image: © Md Babul Hosen/Getty Images",3,0.31416696,-0.21667789
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-simple-ways-to-improve-gut-health,5 simple ways to improve gut health,1,"Gut health is an easy thing to take for granted — or to ignore completely, if everything is generally functioning well. But poor gut health can impact your overall health in a variety of ways, from the obvious (stomach discomfort) to less obvious effects on mood and immune function. Why gut health matters People are talking about gut health and their microbiome more than they used to, but if it's not something that comes up around your dinner table, here are some basics. When people talk about their gut microbiome, they're referring to all the microorganisms (both good and bad) living in your gastrointestinal tract (primarily your large intestine). Most people have hundreds — or even thousands — of different species of bacteria, viruses, and fungi living in their gut. Gut diversity is important because different microorganisms may help support health in a variety of ways, including: improved digestion and nutrient absorption immune-system regulation protection against harmful bacteria reduced inflammation better brain health. Plus, a healthy and diverse gut microbiome may help reduce your risk of conditions including diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, some cancers, GI disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Five keys to a happy gut The good news is that you can take steps to support a healthy gut microbiome. 1. Add more fiber to your diet Fiber serves as a prebiotic, or food for the good bacteria that live in your gut. Eating plenty of fiber is associated with increased microbial diversity and a reduced risk of gastrointestinal issues like constipation and Crohn's disease. Fiber helps keep the colon healthy by reducing inflammation; it also helps keep you regular. However, most of us don't get enough fiber. Aim to get 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is found in a variety of foods including legumes, whole grains, avocados, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, tofu, berries, leafy greens, and nuts and seeds. 2. Stay hydrated Water is critical for healthy digestion. It helps your body absorb and transport nutrients; it helps with keeping your core body temperature steady; it aids in the production of mucus to protect your digestive tract; and it helps prevent constipation. When you become constipated, your gut microbiota changes, becoming less abundant. If you become dehydrated, your body will let you know, as not drinking enough can manifest as thirst, headache, dry mouth, less frequent urination, dizziness, and tiredness. So drink up — around four to six cups per day for most people. 3. Manage stress Increased stress often manifests itself in digestive discomfort. Stress causes hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to spike, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. This gut-brain connection is powerful; it's why we get butterflies before a big presentation, or feel nauseous when we're in a high-stakes situation. And while we can't avoid stressful situations entirely, it's possible to learn to manage stress through techniques like belly breathing, relaxation therapy, and meditation. 4. Get enough sleep Healthier gut, better sleep? Perhaps, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology, which found that certain bacteria in your gut may impact your sleep in a variety of ways, from your likelihood of experiencing insomnia, to how frequently you need to nap, to how long you stay asleep at night. Most people should aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. If you're struggling to hit that goal, try improving your sleep hygiene, getting plenty of daytime exercise, and trying some of the stress management tips above. 5. Stay physically active It's not hard to find good reasons tostay active, but here's one more: According to a systematic review published in Nutrients, participating in 150 to 270 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity exercise per week for at least six weeks has a positive effect on your gut microbiota, particularly if you combine aerobic exercise with resistance training. We already know that people who are sedentary have different gut microbiota characteristics than active people; this research suggests that you might be able to improve your gut health through exercise even if you're not currently active.",3,0.31450108,0.07138057
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-products-that-claim-to-stop-snoring-actually-work,Do products that claim to stop snoring actually work?,1,"Snoring is more than an annoying nighttime quirk; it's an issue that can affect your relationships, sleep quality, and health. Fortunately, certain lifestyle changes and products can help you manage this common problem. What causes snoring? Snoring occurs when airflow through the mouth and nose is partially blocked during sleep. The blockage causes the surrounding tissues to vibrate and produce sound — snoring. Various factors can narrow the airway and cause snoring, including relaxed throat muscles or a backward-slipping tongue. Here are some common factors that make snoring more likely: being overweight, which adds extra tissue around the neck that compresses the airways nasal issues like a deviated septum nasal polyps congestion from colds or allergies structural features, such as a long soft palate or uvula (the back part of the roof of your mouth), or swollen tonsils or adenoids poor muscle tone due to aging alcohol and certain medications that allow the airway to collapse more easily. In some cases, snoring may indicate sleep apnea, a serious condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. You can read more about sleep apnea below. Anti-snoring products Anti-snoring products, such as oral appliances or positional aids, can reduce snoring when used correctly. These devices most often work by helping to keep your airway open during sleep. This reduces the vibrations that cause snoring. Anti-snoring devices are often self-administered. If a device doesn't alleviate your snoring, your doctor can help you explore other treatment options and address any underlying causes. Positional aids Research shows that sleeping on your side (rather than on your back) can significantly reduce both the intensity and duration of snoring in many individuals without sleep apnea. For some people, positional aids that encourage side sleeping are a practical and low-cost way to reduce snoring. Positional aids can range from tennis balls sewn into the back of sleepwear to specialized devices that prompt your body to change position. Specialized vests, pillows, and alarms are examples of positional aids that can help snorers who struggle to maintain a side-sleeping posture. A literature review published in Sleep & Breathing found the effectiveness of positional aids varies from product to product. For example, vests with inflatable chambers were found to reduce snoring rates by more than half in positional-dependent snorers. Wedge pillows also significantly decreased snoring. On the other hand, wearable alarm devices that alerted snorers if they were sleeping on their back did not lead to significant improvement in snoring frequency. Researchers found that some users did not use the devices long-term because of issues with discomfort. Despite mixed findings, positional aids remain a low-risk option worth trying for snorers, especially those who notice improvements when sleeping on their side. Oral appliances Oral appliances work by keeping the airway open during sleep. These appliances fit over the teeth like retainers, and work by repositioning the jaw or holding the tongue forward to prevent airway obstruction. Oral appliances can improve sleep quality for both the user and their bed partner. When prescribed by a doctor and fitted by a dentist, these devices can be a comfortable and effective solution to address chronic snoring. (You can also purchase over-the-counter ""boil and bite"" oral appliances that you mold yourself.) While oral appliances can be effective, they are not without potential drawbacks. Some users experience temporary side effects such as drooling or jaw discomfort. And long-term use may lead to issues like changes in bite alignment. However, many people adjust to these devices with minimal discomfort, especially when they are properly fitted and regularly monitored by a dentist. Devices A relatively new device, called eXciteOSA, was approved by the FDA to reduce snoring and mild sleep apnea. The device is worn in the mouth and used while awake. It helps snoring by strengthening tongue muscles to prevent airway obstruction during sleep. It works by delivering gentle electrical stimulation through a mouthpiece with electrodes positioned above and below the tongue. In a clinical trial, users completed daily 20-minute sessions for six weeks, followed by weekly maintenance sessions. The trial showed improvements in the severity of sleep apnea as well as the percent of time spent snoring loudly. Side effects included excessive salivation, gagging, and tongue discomfort. Lifestyle changes to reduce snoring Reducing snoring frequency and intensity does not necessarily require spending money on a device. Some (free) lifestyle changes may help you reduce snoring. Avoid alcohol. Refrain from drinking alcohol within three hours of bedtime to prevent airway muscles from relaxing excessively during sleep. Maintain a healthy weight. Losing weight can decrease the amount of tissue in the neck and throat, reducing airway obstruction. Address nasal issues. Use saline rinses for a stuffy nose, minimize allergens in your bedroom, and consider a humidifier or medication for swollen nasal tissues. Quit smoking. Smoking irritates and inflames the upper airway, increasing the likelihood of snoring. Even exposure to secondhand smoke can contribute to the problem. Adjust sleeping position. Sleep on your side to prevent your tongue from blocking your airway. Try a body pillow, or sew a tennis ball to the back of your sleepwear to stay off your back. Elevate your head. Use extra pillows, a wedge pillow, or elevate the head of your bed to improve airflow. These strategies can help with simple snoring. But if symptoms like gasping, nighttime awakenings, or daytime sleepiness persist, consult a doctor to check for sleep apnea. Could your snoring be a sign of sleep apnea? Snoring can sometimes be a warning sign of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a sleep disorder that causes people to repeatedly stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea include excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, morning headaches, or waking up feeling unrefreshed. It's important to see a doctor if you (or your bed partner) suspect you have sleep apnea. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to high blood pressure, putting a strain on the cardiovascular system, and other health concerns. To determine if snoring is a sign of sleep apnea, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. They may check for physical factors like a narrowed airway, a large neck circumference, or elevated blood pressure, all of which can indicate a higher risk of OSA. When doctors suspect sleep apnea, they typically recommended a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis. While sleep studies were once conducted exclusively in overnight labs, home-based sleep studies are now widely available and can provide sufficient data for diagnosis in many cases.",9,0.24104522,-0.20995785
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-25-government-report-fluoride-intake-lowered-iq-children.html,Government report links fluoride intake to lowered IQ in children,0,"The United States government has once again found that consuming fluoride is really dangerous, especially for children. A new report from the National Toxicology Program (NTP), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), reveals that exposure to fluoridated water at levels twice the recommended limit of 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of water is linked to lower IQ. Keep in mind that prior to 2015, the government-recommended fluoride level for drinking water was 1.5 mg/l. For many decades – and still in some U.S. cities today that have not adjusted their fluoride levels to the new 0.7 mg/l standard – children across the U.S. have been forced to consume and bathe in water that was fluoridated at levels of 1.5 mg/l, which the NTP now admits causes brain damage and lowers IQ in children. The new study, which includes data and analyses from previously published research, marks the first time that a U.S. federal agency has determined ""with moderate confidence"" that fluoride damages children's brains. ""While the report was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoride in drinking water alone, it is a striking acknowledgment of a potential neurological risk from high levels of fluoride,"" The Associated Press (AP) reported. (Related: Harvard University researchers identified a link between fluoride and ADHD and mental disorders some 10 years ago, but fluoridated water keeps on flowing through taps across the U.S.) Drinking, bathing in any amount of fluoride isn't safe The CDC still claims that fluoride consumption at lower levels is safe, helping to re-mineralize teeth and prevent dental caries (cavities). How is a person supposed to regulate this, though, when people are exposed to fluoridated water at unknown levels each and every day? If a person lives in a fluoridated area and consumes food and beverages made with fluoridated water, not to mention brushing one's teeth with fluoridated toothpaste, the amount of fluoride that ends up being ingested has the potential to be very high. Even if fluoride does the things that public health officials continue to claim it does for the benefit of health, the drug needs to be regulated and controlled at specific levels in actual drug products, not laced into the water supply. ""I think this (report) is crucial in our understanding,"" commented Ashley Malin, a researcher at the University of Florida who has been studying the effects of fluoride on pregnant women and their unborn children, calling the study the most rigorous of its kind. For their study, researchers at the NTP reviewed a cohort of studies from Canada, China, Iran, India, Pakistan and Mexico looking at fluoridated drinking water. Based on the results of all these studies, the NTP determined that consuming fluoridated water at levels greater than 1.5 mg/l results in lost IQ points. While the review itself did not determine exactly how many IQ points are lost due to drinking fluoridated water, several of the studies included as part of the review suggested that children not exposed to fluoridated drinking water have an IQ that is anywhere between two and five points higher than their fluoridated counterparts. The World Health Organization (WHO), by the way, still recommends that water supplies be fluoridated at a level of 1.5 mg/l, which is more than double the new recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 2015 that only 0.7 mg/l of fluoride be added to water supplies. Currently, about 0.6 percent of the total U.S. population, around 1.9 million people, are still exposed to drinking water fluoridated at levels of 1.5 mg/l or higher. ""The findings from this report raise the questions about how these people can be protected and what makes the most sense,"" Malin added.

It's our main task when we sit in the dentist's chair, and we might assume our dentist has one job, too — to assess the condition of our teeth. But looking for plaque, cavities, and gum disease is only part of the picture. Dentists have a prime vantage point to be the first line of defense in identifying problems all over the body. More than 100 conditions can produce signs in the mouth, according to the American Heart Association, and dental training enables these clinicians to spot telltale clues in the teeth, gums, tongue, palate, lips, jaw, face, and neck. ""I think individuals should view their dentists as an indispensable part of their health care team,"" says Dr. Christine Riedy, an associate professor in oral public health and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. ""Some people describe the mouth as the gateway to the body and oral health as the canary in the coal mine. It's true — dentists might see things that can indicate other things happening in the body."" A lengthy list of threats What conditions can dentists detect, and what signs are they looking for? Oral cancer. Rough spots, swelling, bumps, or unexplained bleeding in the mouth might signal head and neck cancers, as do irregularities in the face, lips, jaw, or neck. While head and neck malignancies account for only about 4% of all cancers in the United States, they're more prevalent in older adults. ""Patches of mucosa that are either red or white, as well as lumps or sores, are some of the things dentists would find suspicious,"" Dr. Riedy says. ""Seeing your dentist on a regular basis is really important to pick up those changes."" (See ""Anxiety-busting strategies for visiting the dentist."") Diabetes. About 9% of Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, but an estimated 23% of adults who have the condition don't know it, according to the National Institutes of Health. When sugar levels are elevated in the blood, they're also elevated in saliva. Bacteria in dental plaque feed on that, fueling inflamed and bleeding gums. Diabetes can also lead to dry mouth and infections in the mouth that take longer to heal. ""Some dentists have put HbA1c tests [which measure average blood sugar levels over the past three months] into their screening toolkit to better understand whether a patient has diabetes,"" Dr. Riedy says. Sleep apnea. More than a quarter of American adults are believed to have sleep apnea: a pattern of frequent lapses in breathing during sleep, often accompanied by heavy snoring. Untreated, the condition raises risk for serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Dentists might suspect sleep apnea if they notice enlargement of the tonsils, tongue, or jaw muscles; a red throat; or signs of teeth grinding. ""Because people with sleep apnea sleep with their mouth open, they can get dry mouth, which also creates an environment for oral disease,"" she says. Osteoporosis. Four times as common among older women than men, the progressive loss of bone density characterizing this condition might show up on x-rays of the teeth and jaw. Missing and loose teeth can also be a tip-off. ""With the loss of bone density, the jawbone becomes weaker, and teeth lose their stability,"" Dr. Riedy says. Acid reflux. Eroded enamel on back teeth is a major clue someone has acid reflux, and their teeth may also be discolored. ""People may experience heartburn and not realize that gastric acid has actually reached their mouth,"" she says. ""They think it's only centered in the chest."" Eating disorders. Surprisingly, Dr. Riedy says, dentists are often the first health care providers to recognize signs of eating disorders, particularly among people who purge by vomiting. Many people with eating disorders — which affect girls and women twice as often as males — engage in binge-purge cycles that don't substantially affect their weight or appearance. ""Outwardly, maybe they don't look like they have an eating disorder, but dentists can see deterioration of the back teeth and enamel erosion due to acid,"" she says. Anxiety-busting strategies for visiting the dentist Dentists can root out our health problems — whether in the mouth or elsewhere — only if we schedule an appointment. But while we're supposed to see our dentist every six months, many people view that recommendation as optional. Only two-thirds of American adults visited a dentist in the past year, according to the CDC. Why the low attendance? A big part of it is fear, says Dr. Christine Riedy, an associate professor in oral public health and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. An estimated 15% of people across the world report dental anxiety — women more often than men, according to an April 2023 study in Health Affairs. Whether it's pain, needles, or a loss of control, various aspects of dental care might contribute to reluctance to see a dentist. So can an unpleasant encounter in the past or embarrassment about oral health. Some people don't like when a dentist or hygienist leans close to their face. Some worry about how their breath smells. But there are ways you can reclaim a calmer frame of mind when you approach the dental chair. Dr. Riedy suggests these strategies: Distraction. Listen to music or a podcast through headphones. Some dentists also offer music or videos that help divert your attention. ""Try to focus on something other than what's happening in your mouth,"" she says. Relaxation techniques. Meditation can lower stress levels, and ""deep breathing can slow your heart rate and help you get yourself more in control,"" Dr. Riedy says. Sedation. Ask your dentist if she can administer medication that calms and relaxes you during treatment, such as nitrous oxide (laughing gas). Some dentists will provide a prescription for an oral sedative you can take at home before your visit, as long as you have someone to drive you. Bring a buddy. ""Having someone you trust come with you to the appointment can help reduce some of your anxiety,"" she says. Maximizing your dental check ups If your dentist notices signs of another health problem, she'll likely refer you to your primary care doctor or an appropriate specialist. But you can also make it easier for her to gather as much useful information as possible during dental check-ups. ""It may sound basic, but often your dentist will ask if you have any health updates,"" Dr. Riedy says. ""Sharing your health history and any updates can be really important, and asking questions is crucial."" It's also essential to voice any health concerns to your dentist, just as you would with your primary care doctor. You may believe a problem with another aspect of your health has nothing to do with your oral health, but you might be wrong. ""Be an advocate for your own care,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-winter-affects-chronic-conditions,How winter affects chronic conditions,1,"We all have triggers for some particular health condition. Eat spicy food, for example, and you might get heartburn. Lift something heavy, and it might set off chronic low-back pain. And if you're coping with cold weather, you might experience a flare-up of certain diseases. Here are four chronic ailments that seem to worsen in winter. Psoriasis Winter poses many risks for people with psoriasis, which causes raised red patches of skin covered in silvery or white scales. Flare-ups can result from dry skin due to being in heated indoor air or taking long, hot showers. Winter bugs such as viral infections or strep throat also can trigger a psoriasis flare, as can reduced exposure to sunlight. ""UVB radiation is actually a treatment for psoriasis, as it slows down the rapid skin growth that drives psoriasis,"" says Dr. Sally Tan, director of the Atopic Dermatitis Specialty Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Recommendations: ""Take shorter, lukewarm showers; use a humidifier around the house; and moisturize with bland, cream-based emollients liberally—at least once a day, right after showering—to keep the skin well-moisturized and the skin barrier intact during winter months,"" Dr. Tan advises. ""And try to get 10 to 15 minutes of natural sunlight exposure each day. Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even if you're just sitting indoors by a window."" Asthma Many things we breathe in — such as pollen or pollution — can set off an attack of asthma, a chronic lung condition caused by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. ""Triggers vary, but most people with asthma are bothered by breathing cold air, which cools and dehydrates the airways. That causes them to spasm and tighten, known as bronchoconstriction,"" explains Dr. Nicholas Nassikas, a pulmonologist with Beth Israel Deaconess. Recommendations: ""Avoiding triggers is easier said than done when you live in a cold climate,"" Dr. Nassikas says. ""Try to do outdoor activities during warmer parts of the day. Before going outside for more than a few minutes, take a puff of a rescue inhaler. When outdoors, wear a mask, which will help reduce symptoms by warming and humidifying air before it gets into the lungs. Also, continue prescribed asthma therapies; stay away from heavy pollution, such as smoke from firepits; and avoid viral illness by washing your hands and masking around people who are sick."" Raynaud's disease Raynaud's disease is a blood vessel disorder triggered by cold environments. Instead of the normal response to cold weather, with blood vessels narrowing slightly to direct more blood and warmth to the organs, the response is exaggerated (vasospasm). ""The vessels in the fingers and toes narrow excessively upon exposure to cold. This can compromise blood flow in the affected fingers and toes, which can be painful,"" says Dr. Vasileois Kyttaris, a rheumatologist at Beth Israel Deaconess. Recommendations: Avoid unnecessary exposure to cold, and make sure to dress warmly outside: a coat, hat, and mittens are a must, and hand and foot warmers are a big help. Put on cold-weather gear before you step outside, and leave your coat, mittens, and hat on while you're in the freezer section of a grocery store. At home, turn up the thermostat a few degrees, and block cold air coming in through drafty doors and windows. Your doctor might also recommend a vasodilator drug to open blood vessels. Arthritis Many people with arthritis (no matter which kind) say that cold weather worsens joint pain. Is it true? ""Some people tend to have more pain and stiffness during certain weather conditions, but research on the connection is inconclusive,"" Dr. Kyttaris says. It's not that doctors don't believe there's a link; they just don't have enough scientific evidence for one. Or the weather may affect just some people with arthritis. Recommendations: If you feel cold weather makes your arthritis symptoms worse, ramp up your pill-free arthritis regimen. Use heat therapy (such as a heating pad or warm shower or bath) or wear a joint brace (such as a knee sleeve) to help reduce inflammation. Most importantly, exercise. Daily physical activity can lower inflammation and enhance blood flow; both contribute to pain relief. For more information, check out the Harvard Online Learning course Joint Pain Relief Workout. Finally, talk to your doctor. You may need a prescription adjustment or a new medication. Or it could be that another condition is causing pain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-are-the-risks-from-taking-statins,What are the risks from taking statins?,1,"I'm listening to a book about a diet to reverse heart disease, and the physician author says there are ""documented dangers"" from statins. Just how risky are these drugs?Because statins have been on the market for so long, the side effects are well known. About 10% of people develop muscle aches, which disappear when they stop taking the drug. Depending on the dose, statins also increase the risk of developing diabetes by 10% to 35%, possibly by preventing your body's insulin from working well, which causes blood sugar to rise. This side effect is most common in people with obesity and prediabetes, who are already prone to developing diabetes. Regardless, the cardiovascular benefit of a statin for these high-risk patients outweighs the risk of diabetes.",3,0.17647158,-0.08782193
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-heartfelt-gift-ideas-for-valentines-day,5 heartfelt gift ideas for Valentine's Day,1,"On February 14 — a day symbolized by hearts and dedicated to love — give that special someone a present that shows you care. Or treat yourself to one (or more) of these five gift suggestions, all of which are designed to make it easier and more enjoyable to follow the cornerstones of a heart-healthy lifestyle: eating well, getting regular exercise, sleeping soundly, and managing stress. Dr. Beth Frates, a lifestyle medicine coach and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, explains why and how these gifts encourage habits that benefit the heart. 1. A cooking class Making home-cooked meals is one of the best things you can do for your cardiovascular health. Research suggests that people who eat more meals made at home tend to weigh less and have healthier cholesterol and blood sugar values compared with people who eat out frequently. ""You can control the amount of saturated fat, salt, and sugar in food you make yourself. You'll also avoid the preservatives, additives, and dyes found in convenience foods like frozen dinners and other processed foods,"" says Dr. Frates. For people who feel they don't have the time or skills to prepare healthy food, a cooking class can help. A great place to start is a single class or series of classes about Mediterranean cooking or a similar cuisine that highlights heart-healthy ingredients: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats like extra-virgin olive oil or canola oil, and plant-based proteins like nuts, seeds, legumes, and tofu (or fish or chicken for those who choose animal proteins). ""Taking cooking classes together is a wonderful way to bond, to have some fun, and to nourish your body,"" says Dr. Frates. Once you hone your skills and grow more comfortable making meals, cooking can also be a great way to express your creativity, she adds. Some restaurants, supermarkets, and cookware stores offer on-site cooking classes. Alternatively, you can check local community centers and colleges, or search online. 2. Strawberries dipped in dark chocolate Both strawberries and dark chocolate contain beneficial plant compounds called flavonoids, which are thought to improve cardiovascular health by relaxing blood vessels, improving blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and discouraging blood clots. Studies have linked diets rich in flavonoids to a lower risk of heart attacks and related problems. ""Chocolate-dipped strawberries are a classic Valentine's Day gift, and they're also delectable,"" says Dr. Frates. Look for those made with dark chocolate, which tends to have a higher flavonoid content than milk chocolate. Better yet, buy your own high-quality dark chocolate and berries and make them yourself — or maybe even together with your valentine, she suggests. 3. Custom-fit sneakers If people walk, jog, or hike in shoes that don't fit properly, they can run into problems, says Dr. Frates. For example, ill-fitting shoes can cause blisters, put pressure on bunions, or leave you vulnerable to plantar fasciitis (inflammation of the fibrous band of tissue on the bottom of the foot) and Achilles tendinitis (inflammation of the tendon connecting the calf muscle to the heel). Some experts recommend replacing your walking shoes at least every 300 to 500 miles, which translates to a new pair every six to 12 months if you regularly walk about three miles per day. Treat your valentine to an outing to your local specialty running store, where you'll find the best selection and expert advice about footwear options. Many running stores sell walking shoes, and you can even wear running shoes for walking. Outdoor equipment stores may be your best bet for hiking boots. It's well worth the investment of time (and the possibly higher price tag) to have a knowledgeable staff member help you select a well-fitting shoe to suit your needs. Be sure to try on several different brands and styles, and take them for a test walk or jog around the store. 4. Luxury sleep products Getting at least seven hours of sleep each night is vital for cardiovascular health, says Dr. Frates. Insufficient sleep can raise your risk for weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Creating a sleep sanctuary that's quiet, dark, and comfortable can make it easier to fall and stay asleep. A variety of accessories and products may help improve slumber. But it's important to know the preferences of your intended recipient, so ask questions or drop hints to gather clues. Some people might like a sleep machine that provides white noise or a recording of soothing sounds, such as falling rain, croaking frogs, or chirping crickets. Other might appreciate luxurious high-thread-count sheets, a silk pillowcase, or lavender-scented bath salts for a pre-slumber soak. If outside lights or early morning sunlight curtails sleep time, consider light-blocking curtains or shades. An eye mask made of soft, breathable material (such as cotton or silk) is another option. 5. A subscription to a meditation app Meditation and mindfulness have been shown to lower blood pressure, decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and increase heart rate variability (microsecond time differences from one heartbeat to the next), all of which are linked to better heart health. ""A regular meditation practice can help you to better manage stress, which is an unavoidable part of life,"" says Dr. Frates. Because meditation doesn't come naturally to most people, guidance and coaching from an in-person or online class really helps. A more convenient option is a subscription to a meditation app that you can listen to on your smartphone at your leisure. Popular meditation apps include Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, and Happier. Most offer a free trial period, so you could send sign-up links to a few that you think your valentine might enjoy, and then offer to treat them to a yearlong subscription.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/sleep-hygiene-simple-practices-for-better-rest,Sleep hygiene: Simple practices for better rest,1,"A good night's sleep is essential for good health and functioning. It revitalizes the mind and body, and prepares you to perform at your best the following day. Researchers define a good night's sleep in terms of quantity (not too little or too much) and quality (falling asleep quickly and staying asleep). But many people don't sleep the amount needed to function at their best, or they spend too much time awake during the night. According to the CDC, more than one-third of adults in the U.S. don't get enough sleep — 14.5% have trouble falling asleep and 17.8% have trouble staying asleep. Good sleep hygiene can help. What is sleep hygiene? Sleep hygiene is a set of practices and routines that help you get better sleep. Adequate, good quality sleep allows your body to experience the physical maintenance and repair, immune system boost, and emotional and cognitive renewal that sleep provides. Sleep hygiene encompasses: making your sleeping environment comfortable and conducive to uninterrupted sleep keeping a consistent sleep schedule of seven to nine hours per night for most adults following a bedtime routine that helps you fall asleep establishing daytime habits that optimize restful sleep at night tailoring these practices for your own best results. Expert recommendations have traditionally emphasized going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends. Although it is healthier to sleep consistently throughout the week, a 2023 consensus statement by the National Sleep Foundation suggests that after a week with insufficient sleep, it may be beneficial to get some catch-up sleep on weekends. The amount of sleep we need varies by age and can be affected by each individual's unique health circumstances. The CDC offers sleep duration recommendations across the lifespan. Keep in mind that these are suggestions, and every individual may not have the same needs. Tips for sounder sleep Retiring to a comfortable environment with minimal disruptions makes it easier to fall asleep and sleep soundly. What you consume during the day and before bedtime also plays an important role. Create a sleep sanctuary Reduce or mask noise. Heavy curtains and rugs can help absorb sound. A sleep machine that provides white noise, or a recording of soothing sounds such as falling rain, can mask outside noise. Minimize light. Consider light-blocking curtains or shades if outside lights shine into your bedroom. Replace your mattress and pillows if they're worn or uncomfortable. Most people sleep better in a room that's slightly cool. Keep room temperature around 65°F to 68° F at night. Only use the bedroom for sleep and intimacy. Have children and pets sleep elsewhere. Keep electronic devices and anything work-related in another room. Don't let food and substances interfere with a good night's sleep Consume evening meals at least three hours before bedtime. Avoid alcohol in the evenings. Although alcohol can make you sleepy, after a few hours it becomes stimulating and may cause you to awaken and have difficulty falling back to sleep. It can also worsen snoring and reduces REM sleep, an important stage of sleep for cognitive function and mental health. Avoid caffeine after lunch if it keeps you awake at night. Nicotine is a stimulant. Avoid smoking, which can interfere with nighttime sleep (among many other detrimental health effects). Create a relaxing bedtime routine Reserve an hour before bedtime to wind down away from stressful, stimulating activities. Relaxing steps and rituals like these make it easier to fall asleep: Put away electronic devices, except if used for calming music or a guided relaxation routine. Read for pleasure in soft light. Take a warm bath. Do some easy stretches, progressive muscle relaxation, or deep breathing. Overcoming common barriers to good sleep hygiene Your actions during the day can affect your sleep that night. You can adjust your behaviors to support, rather than interfere with, nighttime sleep. Schedule exercise and naps to support sound sleep For many people, exercising within two hours of bedtime interferes with falling asleep. For others, evening exercise is fine. Experiment to find the exercise timing that works best for you. Long or late afternoon naps may interfere with falling asleep at bedtime. Sleep experts recommend naps of half an hour or less, if needed, and not too late in the day. Keep a sleep diary to identify possible obstacles Track the following each day for at least two weeks: time you go to bed and wake up medications you take time and amount of caffeine or alcohol consumption time you eat dinner and anything after that when and how long you exercise what time you put down electronic devices and stop watching TV. In the morning, note length and quality of the previous night's sleep, whether you awakened during the night, and for how long. Look for any patterns between your behaviors and your sleep duration or quality that may help you identify factors that are interfering with your sleep. Work with a partner Making changes to your daily routine can be hard to do on your own. If you live with a partner or roommates, you can help each other adopt and stick to recommendations for healthy sleep.",6,0.15597755,-0.1829165
https://www.infowars.com/posts/rfk-special-what-are-ultra-processed-foods-and-why-are-they-so-bad-for-us,RFK Jr. Special: What Are Ultra-Processed Foods and Why Are They So Bad for Us?,0,"Editor’s note: Now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as President Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services, Infowars is republishing this definitive analysis on issues that will no doubt be addressed now that America is ready to be healthy again. Robert F. Kennedy Junior’s decision to retire and endorse Donald Trump has electrified a presidential race that was hardly lacking in excitement. Donald Trump had already come millimetres from having his head blown off, and Joe Biden was deposed in a carefully orchestrated palace coup, to make way for Kamala Harris. This has been a campaign of shocks and firsts, and now we can add another first to that list: a member of the Kennedy family supporting a Republican ticket. In his announcement on Friday, before he joined Trump on stage in Arizona, Kennedy said that he would work with the Trump administration to “make America healthy again.” He described watching a generation of children grow up “damaged” as a result of poor diet and environmental pollution, and said that four more years of Democratic rule will “complete the consolidation of corporate and neocon power, and our children will be the ones that suffer most.” “For 19 years I prayed, every morning, that God would put me in a position to end this calamity. The chronic-disease crisis was one of my primary reasons for running for president, along with ending the censorship and the Ukraine war.” Now Kennedy is in a position to do that, and Trump has confirmed that he will head a task-force to investigate, and hopefully solve, America’s unprecedented health crisis. The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, autism and AHDH, cancer, auto-immune conditions, infertility and reproductive issues, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s is exploding across the Western world, but especially in America, which leads the world, or once did, in virtually every single metric of ill health you could care to name. Over 40% of adults in the US are now classified as obese, and 1 in 36 American children have an autism-spectrum disorder. On Friday, Kennedy identified two major contributors to this health crisis: ultra-processed food and toxic endocrine-disrupting chemicals. These are things Kennedy has talked about, at length, for years—decades, actually—including in the 2022 Tucker Carlson documentary The End of Men, which I’m proud to say I featured in prominently, alongside him. The harmful effects of ultra-processed food and endocrine-disruptors are no longer fringe topics for discussion, but you may still be confused or unsure about what they are and why they’re bad. That’s where I come in. I’ve not been writing about these things for quite as long as RFK Jr. has, but I have been raising awareness about them for the last four years, including in my book The Eggs Benedict Option and my various media and podcast appearances. Today and on Monday, I’ll be telling you everything you need to know to get a handle on ultra-processed food and endocrine disruptors. These two primers can be shared with family and friends to help educate them and give them an incentive to improve their health by reducing their dependence on and exposure to ultra-processed foods and toxic chemicals. Today I’ll tell you about ultra-processed foods in particular. A BRIEF HISTORY OF FOOD PROCESSING Food has been processed since the dawn of human history, or at least as far back as we can see through the mists of time. Our distant ancestors used fire to cook meat and other foods, and they discovered how to grind wild grains to make flour for early forms of bread. They also discovered how to harness bacteria—not that they knew anything about microbes—to ferment foods, helping to preserve and increase their digestibility and nutritional value in the process. They learned other preservation techniques like drying, smoking and, where the weather was cold enough, freezing. Food prepared using any one or more of these techniques satisfies the common-sense definition of “processed food,” and for the longest span of human history, until the nineteenth century, this is how food was processed by human beings, if it was processed at all. We cooked at home. Bread was made at home or in a local bakery. The majority of ingredients were sourced locally, apart from luxury items obtained through long-distance trade like sugar and spices. In the last century or so, food began to be processed and sold to the public in new ways. Food started to be manufactured in factories owned by large-scale conglomerates, using new industrial processes and new ingredients like hydrogenated oils, seed and vegetable oils, refined sugars and refined grains. Special additives were created to alter the properties of the food produced—to alter its texture, color it or make it last longer—and new storage methods like canning and tinning also meant that the shelf-life of food could be extended, allowing these foods to reach new markets at home and overseas. The creation of the first factory-made foods heralded a major shift in Western dietary patterns, and these foods soon made their way outside the West, to every corner of the globe. The immediate effects of this dietary shift were nothing short of disastrous. The pioneering dentist Weston A. Price described the early effects in his classic book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration, from 1939, a book I consider to be the greatest book on nutrition ever written. Price noticed worrying changes in the physical health of his patients, especially the children, in his practice in Cleveland, Ohio. It wasn’t just that their teeth were getting worse—and they were: their mouths were suddenly full of cavities—it’s that the entire structure of their faces seemed to be collapsing. The teeth themselves, the jaw and the roof of the mouth weren’t forming properly, and nor were the cheeks or nasal passages. What’s more, these worrying physical changes were accompanied by behavioural changes, including learning difficulties, that had previously been unknown. One of the most amazing parts, and the most difficult for us to process as ""moderns"", of Weston Price's classic book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration (1939) is the fact that traditional peoples eating their ancestral diets rarely if ever suffered from diseases like cancer.… pic.twitter.com/hvq6Qz2EKu — RAW EGG NATIONALIST (@Babygravy9) July 30, 2023 Price knew that diet had to be to blame, and eventually he got the chance to test his hypothesis with rigor. He travelled the globe with his wife, visiting small-scale communities on every inhabited continent, from the Inuit in the Arctic to pastoralists like the Nuer and Masai in Africa, and even remote communities in Europe, like the crofters and fishermen of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and the high Alpine Swiss. Price found that, wherever the people in these communities cleaved to their ancestral diets—wherever they ate locally produced whole foods, and especially nutrient-dense animal foods like organ meat, fatty cuts of meat, dairy, seafood and shellfish, eggs, blood products and butter—the people displayed remarkable health and vigor, including resistance to infectious diseases. The symptoms of physical degeneration Price had seen back in Ohio were totally absent. But wherever these people deviated from their ancestral diets and started eating Western industrial foods—especially tinned foods high in sugar and refined wheat products—the symptoms of physical degeneration became apparent very quickly. Weston Price’s work provided an early warning against the abandonment of traditional diets for new factory-made foods. Sadly, it went unheeded. In the decades since, we have moved further and further away from our traditional diets in the West, and across the rest of the world, increasing our reliance on factory-made foodstuffs that contain ingredients and additives that humans have little or even no history of ever consuming. The manufacture of processed foods has become more and more sophisticated, employing new techniques and an ever-expanding list of ingredients. Importantly, processed-food manufacturers have employed powerful targeted advertising that focuses on their products’ convenience and irresistible moreishness. These are the true “ultra-processed foods.” PROCESSED FOOD TODAY Before we go any further, here’s a minimal working definition of ultra-processed food: food that’s produced in a factory, contains one or more ingredients you wouldn’t find in a normal home kitchen—emulsifiers, humectants, colourings, stabilisers, preservatives—and is sold to you wrapped in plastic. There’s a certain amount of quibbling about the definition of ultra-processed food, especially from scientists who happen to be funded by manufacturers of ultra-processed food, but it’s absolutely clear that there is a significant difference between the kind of processed food people are consuming in enormous quantities today and even the sort of foods Weston Price associated with physical degeneration back in the 1930s. In many Western countries, children now derive the majority of their daily calories from ultra-processed food. A study from 2021 showed that toddlers in the UK (children aged between two and five) derive an average of 61% of their daily calories from ultra-processed food. Toddlers in the US hardly fare much better, getting 58% of their daily calories from ultra-processed food. Scientific research has linked processed foods to virtually every single one of the prevailing chronic diseases of modernity I discussed at the beginning of this piece—to everything from autism to Alzheimer’s. The best way to illustrate the whole host of problems associated with massive processed-food consumption would be to point you in the direction of a BBC documentary that was made during the pandemic. In What Are We Feeding Our Kids? a British doctor called Chris Van Tulleken spent one month eating a diet comprising 80% ultra-processed food. At least one fifth of British adults now follow such a diet. The changes Dr Van Tulleken experienced were shocking. He gained a considerable amount of weight. He suffered from constipation and hemorrhoids. He couldn’t sleep, and began waking up in the middle of the night to raid the fridge for more sugary snacks, despite, by his own admission, not being hungry. His libido disappeared and he became paranoid and anxious. MRI scans taken before and after the experiment revealed that Van Tulleken’s brain had actually been rewired in the manner we’d expect of a drug addict. The scans showed significant increases in connections between areas linking reward and automatic behaviour, and these changes appeared to be permanent. Months after the experiment ended, the connections were still lighting up under the scanner. He had been hardwired to crave ultra-processed food. Manufacturers of ultra-processed foods are well aware their food is addictive. They make it that way deliberately. They call this addictiveness “hyperpalatability,” and they employ small armies of highly paid food scientists to exploit the complicated neurobiology of food pleasure—sensations like sweetness, saltiness, crunch and chew—to ensure that consumers reach the so-called “bliss point” and can’t stop eating. A 2019 study showed that we eat ultra-processed foods 30% faster than normal foods. As a result, our bodies’ natural hormone mechanisms to signal satiety don’t have time to respond. That means we overeat, and if all we eat is ultra-processed food, we overeat all the time. I’ve called ultra-processed food “weaponized food” with good reason. The companies that manufacture it know exactly what they’re doing and why. Of course, if you were a food manufacturer, you’d probably do that too: you’d want to maximize your profits as well. But that doesn’t make it right. Interestingly, recent research has shown that tobacco companies may have played a pivotal role in hooking consumers on new ultra-processed foods in the 1980s, deploying the same marketing tricks and techniques as they used to hook people on cigarettes decades earlier. RFK Jr. has mentioned this. WHAT’S WRONG WITH ULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD? It’s not simply that ultra-processed food is designed to be overeaten, and overeating anything will, at the very least, make you overweight. The individual ingredients that go into processed food are bad too. Processed food is full of cheap, low-quality ingredients, many of which are now genetically modified. Production of the base commodities that are turned into these ingredients—which means corn and soy, principally—is heavily subsidized by the US government. Processed food has been the main vehicle for corn and soy producers to get rid of the vast amounts of these crops they produce annually, whether in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, modified corn starch, soy protein or soybean oil. If you want to know more, in detail, about why American farmers produce so much corn and how it ends up in so much of the food Americans eat, I’d recommend you read Michael Pollan’s book The Omnivore’s Dilemma. One ingredient of particular concern in ultra-processed food is seed and vegetable oils, which RFK Jr. has singled out for their health effects on a number of occasions, including during his announcement on Friday night. Although seed and vegetable oils have been marketed as healthy alternatives to traditional animal fats for the last 70 years, the truth is that they are anything but healthy. A large body of scientific evidence now links these novel fats to chronic inflammation, which is the cause of many diseases, as well as obesity and genetic dysregulation in animals and humans. These fats are toxic by their very nature, and shouldn’t be consumed in the kind of quantities people are consuming them today, mainly via processed food. Take soybean oil, for example, consumption of which has increased a thousandfold over the last century. A study from 2020 showed that, as well as being obesogenic, soybean oil causes serious genetic dysregulation and neurological damage in mice. The genes affected included genes associated with inflammation, neuroendocrine and neurochemical processes, insulin signalling, and the production of oxytocin, the “love hormone,” which is responsible for social bonding. Other genes that were affected are linked to neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, and autism. The authors of the study conclude that, although the study was conducted on mice, the results are likely to hold for humans as well: “the [soybean-oil-rich] American diet may be not only contributing to increased rates of metabolic disease but also affecting neurological function.” But it’s not just the “food” ingredients that we should be worried about. In recent years, there’s been a growing focus on the harmful effects of the non-nutritional additives that are found in ultra-processed food. These are the kind of ingredients you won’t find in a standard home kitchen: things like emulsifiers, colourings, humectants, texturisers, preservatives and anti-fungals, anti-caking agents and so on. Artificial sweeteners, for example, have been linked to depression and gut dysbiosis—disruption of the digestive system—which is, in turn, linked to a whole host of other illnesses, from behavioural conditions like autism and ADHD, to neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s. The US system of food additives, under the management of the FDA, is a beacon of stupidity and corruption. I’ve described the FDA’s “Generally Recognised as Safe” (GRAS) system as “Generally Recognised as Insane” for the ridiculous attitude to novel ingredients it licenses. The system was first introduced in 1958, when the Food Additive Amendments were passed, to require that all non-standard food additives—the kind of things that aren’t typically found in a normal kitchen—should be tested adequately for safety in humans. When the new system was introduced, there were reckoned to be about 700 food additives in use, 400 of which were thought to be safe in the long term. The new system was supposed to guarantee additives that were already in the food supply were safe, but what happened instead was a process of “grandfathering,” where substances that were in use were simply assumed to be safe, for that very reason. That included substances like potassium bromate, which over 50 years’ worth of research has since shown to be linked to cancers such as thyroid and testicular cancer, kidney damage, gut dysbiosis and reproductive issues. The EU, Canada, China and India have now banned it. Even Nigeria has banned it. But not the US. Around 2,000 additives are licensed for use in the EU. In the US, the figure rises to 10,000—and that’s just an estimate. Nobody knows how many additives are in the food supply, not even the FDA, because companies are simply introducing additives without telling anybody. A company can produce a new food additive, decide it’s safe and then bring it to market without any scrutiny from the FDA at all. How did this happen? When companies began applying for GRAS designation, they were allowed to submit their own safety data for their novel ingredients, which the FDA could then choose to accept or reject. But as a huge backlog of applications started to build up at the FDA, companies chose to add novel ingredients to their products without consulting the FDA at all. The FDA could have asserted its authority, but it did what any poorly staffed, totally compromised institution like the FDA would do: It simply made the problem disappear by defining it out of existence. The FDA retrospectively normalised the situation, a process that was finally completed in 2016. And so a company can produce a new food additive, decide it’s safe and bring it to market without any scrutiny from the FDA at all. We are now at the corrupt heart of the American food supply today, at the center of a system that favors corporate producers at the expense of the people it claims to nourish. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is right. If we are ever going to make America healthy again, the corporations that produce its food must be brought into line. They must be made to serve the needs of the American people, and not the other way round.",5,-0.26636857,0.11273892
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-probiotics,How to get more probiotics,1,"Our gut does more than digest food — it's a powerhouse for overall health, from boosting immunity to supporting mental well-being. Probiotics, the ""good"" bacteria in our systems, play a key role in maintaining this balance and are essential for keeping your body and mind thriving. There are two ways to get more good bacteria into your gut: fermented foods and dietary supplements. Probiotic supplements, which are typically sold over the counter, are reserved to treat specific ailments as suggested by your doctor. They are not recommended for everyday use. Plus, supplements do not have the same FDA oversight as medications do. Fermented foods, on the other hand, are an excellent natural source of probiotics. Fermenting is one of the oldest techniques for food preservation. Foods that are fermented go through a process of lactofermentation in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid. This process creates an environment that preserves the food and promotes beneficial enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as various species of good bacteria. Another way to look at fermentation is that it takes one type of food and transforms it into another kind. For instance, cabbage becomes sauerkraut, cucumbers become pickles, soybeans turn into miso, and milk can be made into yogurt, cheeses, and sour cream. Not all fermented foods contain probiotics. Some foods undergo steps that remove the probiotics, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning. However, most fermented foods are probiotic foods as well. If there is a potential downside to fermented foods, it is that their taste and smell can be quite strong, which may be unpleasant for some people. The unique flavors and textures of fermented foods are due in part to the different species of bacteria used. On the upside, there are many types of fermented foods from which to choose, so there is a good chance you can find something you will enjoy. Good probiotic food choices The most common fermented foods that naturally contain probiotics, or have probiotics added to them, include yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, tempeh, kimchi, sourdough bread, and some cheeses. Yogurt is considered the go-to player of probiotic foods because it has a flavor and texture that are generally appealing to Western palates. The number and type of bacteria species can vary depending on the yogurt brand. The probiotic content of yogurt products can range from 90 billion to 500 billion CFU per serving. (CFU stands for colony-forming units, which is how many bacteria divide and form colonies.) Look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label. It's easy to add yogurt to your diet. Besides having it for breakfast or a midday snack, you can substitute yogurt whenever you use mayonnaise in egg salad or potato salad, or in almost any baking recipe. Yogurt also can be the basis for sauces, salad dressings, or marinades. How many probiotic foods do you need? That's not easy to answer, as there is no recommended daily intake for probiotics, so there is no way to know exactly which fermented foods or what quantity is best. Therefore, the general guideline is to just add as many fermented foods to your daily diet as possible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gum-disease-and-heart-health-probing-the-link,Gum disease and heart health: Probing the link,1,"About two-thirds of people over 65 have gum disease — more formally known as periodontal disease. It starts when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria and food, builds up around the teeth. In its earliest stage, gingivitis, irritated gums can bleed easily. Left untreated, periodontal disease can worsen and, in its most severe form, cause the teeth to loosen and fall out. Compared with people who have healthy gums, people with periodontal disease are about twice as likely to have a heart attack. Shared risk factors — including smoking, an unhealthy diet, or lack of access to health and dental care — may explain some of this association. However, some bacterial and viral infections also appear to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. And growing evidence suggests that bacteria and inflammation may underlie the link between the mouth and the heart. ""Your mouth is a gateway to the rest of your body, so it's not surprising that your oral health can affect your overall health and vice versa,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Hundreds of different types of bacteria occur naturally in the mouth. Some, fed by sugars, release acids that break down the outer layer of your teeth, causing cavities. Other types of bacteria form plaque that — if not removed by regular brushing and flossing — hardens into tartar, Dr. Jiang explains. Only a professional dental cleaning can remove these hard, calcified deposits. Signs of gum disease If you experience any of these signs, you may have periodontal disease: swollen, red, or tender gums gums that bleed easily pus between the teeth and gums bad breath buildup of hard yellow or brown deposits along the gum line teeth that are moving apart or loose dental appliances no longer fit well. Bacteria on the move? The bacteria responsible for periodontal disease can travel to blood vessels throughout the body. In fact, periodontal bacteria have been found in the fatty debris (atherosclerosis) that clogs arteries located far from the mouth — and in blood clots from people who have experienced heart attacks. ""In both gum disease and heart disease, we find bacteria in places where they're not supposed to be,"" says Dr. Jiang. The body's immune response to these misplaced bacteria triggers an outpouring of white blood cells. The resulting inflammation may lead to tiny clots and cause a heart attack or stroke. In addition, many factors linked to a higher risk of heart disease—diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity — are all more common in people with periodontal disease, according to a 2021 review article about oral health and cardiovascular disease in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology. One way to treat periodontal disease is for dentists and hygienists to use manual scalers or ultrasound devices to scrape away tartar above and below the gum line. Known as scaling and root planing, this deep cleaning is more extensive than the twice-yearly cleanings people typically get at the dentist. But while treating periodontal disease may help bring down levels of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, there's limited evidence it can reduce heart attacks or other cardiovascular problems. Preventing periodontal disease To prevent gum disease, daily brushing and flossing is essential — and can even reverse gingivitis before it worsens. If you've slacked off on your flossing, you may notice a little bleeding when you start up again, says Dr. Jiang. When that happens, some people get nervous and stop flossing. But don't worry; just get back into the habit and chances are the bleeding will improve within a few days, she advises. If it doesn't, and you notice other signs of gum disease (see box), schedule an appointment with your dentist. A healthy diet can also help, says Dr. Jiang. Most people know that hard or chewy candy and other sticky sweets promote cavities. But sugary drinks like sodas (especially if you sip them throughout the day) also feed the bacteria that cause cavities and gum disease. ""That's also true for refined carbohydrates that stick to your teeth, like crackers and breads made with white flour,"" says Dr. Jiang. What's more, a sugary diet is itself associated with higher heart disease risk.

A new blanket might help,1,"Weighted blankets have long been used for certain conditions. They may provide benefits for people with insomnia and anxiety, but research is scarce. Image: © Eyecandy Images/Getty Images Some people count sheep at night. You count worries. If you often find yourself lying awake at night, staring at the ceiling, you may be looking for solutions to help you get back to sleep. One approach that doesn't involve drugs or doctors is weighted blankets. These blankets look like regular blankets, but they're filled with plastic beads or pellets to make them heavier. They typically weigh from 3 pounds to upwards of 20 pounds. Companies are marketing them as a solution for insomnia as well as nighttime anxiety and stress reduction. And people are buying. Sales of the blankets have surged in the past two years. The use of weight in therapy The idea of using weight as a calming strategy does have some basis in current medical practice. You may be interested in... A Guide to Cognitive Fitness Harvard Health Publishing’s A Guide to Cognitive Fitness 7 Steps to optimizing brain function and improving brain health LEARN MORE Weighted blankets have been around for a long time, especially for kids with autism or behavioral disturbances. It is one of the sensory tools commonly used in psychiatric units. Patients who are in distress may choose different types of sensory activities — holding a cold object, smelling particular aromas, manipulating dough, building objects, doing arts and crafts — to try to calm down. The blankets are supposed to work much the same way tight swaddling helps newborns feel snug and secure so they can doze off more quickly. The blanket basically simulates a comforting hug, in theory helping to calm and settle the nervous system. Companies that sell the blankets typically recommend that you buy one that weighs approximately 10% of your body weight, which would mean a 15-pound blanket for a 150-pound person. Weighing down anxiety The question is, do they really work? While some people swear by these blankets, concrete evidence is unfortunately lacking. There are really no definitive scientific studies to back up the claims. A randomized clinical trial to test the blankets would be very difficult. A blind comparison is impossible because people can automatically tell if the blanket is heavy or not. And it's unlikely that somebody would sponsor such a study. Should you use a weighted blanket? While there is no robust evidence that weighted blankets are truly effective, for most healthy adults, there are likely few risks to trying one — other than price. Most weighted blankets cost at least $100 and often more than $200. There are certain people who should not use a weighted blanket or should check with their doctors before doing so, including people with sleep apnea certain other sleep disorders respiratory problems or other chronic medical conditions. Also, check in with your doctor or a trained therapist if you are interested in trying a weighted blanket for a child. If you do decide to try a weighted blanket, be realistic about your expectations and realize that results may vary. Blankets may be of help for anxiety or insomnia. But just as swaddling works for some babies and not others, weighted blankets won't be a miracle treatment for everyone. Is there a better option? In addition, keep in mind there may be better, evidence-based solutions out there for your sleep struggles, particularly when it comes to chronic insomnia, which is defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week for three months or more. For insomnia, a first-line recommendation is a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation techniques, practices that are supported by evidence from controlled trials. CBT is typically administered in a four- to 10-week program that helps you make lasting changes to your sleep habits, including limiting the amount of time you spend in bed. This helps to train you to avoid being in bed unless you are sleeping. CBT can be challenging and typically works best when performed by a professional.",6,0.19040084,-0.14142112
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/overcome-your-fear-factor,Overcome your fear factor,1,"Fear and worry got you down? Here's how to calm these feelings. Have you grown more worried and fearful about life over the years? You aren't alone. Research has shown that feelings of fear, general anxiety, and nervousness tend to rise with age. These negative feelings can manifest in many ways. You could be more concerned about your financial future, the risk of a new or returning health problem or injury, or as the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown, changes in world events. People become more fearful about daily life because they worry a setback will come at any time, and it's something they can't control. Tell worry to take a walk Need a mental break from fear or worry? Take a mindful walk during which you focus on your body awareness, movement, breathing, and surroundings. It is a simple way to refresh your mind and be more present. One study found that people who did 30 minutes of mindful walking twice a week for four weeks had less stress and better quality of life. A cumulative effect It's not clear what drives this mindset. Researchers speculate it could be a combination of biological changes in the aging brain along with the cumulative effects of unhappy life experiences, either your own or those of someone close to you. These ongoing feelings of fear and worry can have a deep impact on your health. You may become less active and less social, both of which can contribute to frailty, heart disease, and depression. If not addressed, constant fear and worry may progress to a specific disorder, such as social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia (fear of public places), or generalized anxiety disorder (chronic worrying that may lead to physical problems like chest pain and muscle fatigue). What to do There are many ways to address constant fear and worry so they do not consume your life. The first step is to identify your fear's source. The right treatment begins with recognition. Often, people cannot articulate why they are fearful or worry too much, and why it's happening. Consider meeting with a psychiatrist or therapist. A professional analysis can help pinpoint where your specific worries and fears may lie. After that, the two of you work together to create strategies that address those fears. These could include one-on-one or group therapy sessions, relaxation training exercises, or cognitive behavioral therapy (in which you learn to reframe your response to your fearful thoughts). Once you are aware of your specific fears and when they typically arise, you can take other means to manage them. For example: Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness trains your mind's attention to be more present without drifting into concerns about the past or future. This mindset helps you not to overreact to fearful thoughts and reduce any stress, depression, or anxiety that accompanies them. Meditation is a popular way to learn mindfulness. The goal of meditation is not to push aside or block fearful thinking, but rather to notice your thoughts and feelings and realize that you don't have to act on them. This could be as simple as closing your eyes and repeating a single phrase or word, or counting breaths. Consult a financial expert. If money issues worry you, meet with a financial planner or adviser. He or she can do a thorough review of your financials, create or adjust your budget, focus on specific concerns, and help set goals. This can help you feel more confident about your situation and address any issues that may trigger worry. Hire a personal trainer. If you avoid activity or exercise because you fear injury, hire a personal trainer who specializes in older adult conditioning. A trainer can assess your current fitness, identify strengths and weaknesses, and develop a program to help you improve. Because you will see and feel your physical improvements as you progress, this will help you overcome fear of injury and the worry that you can't exercise or be more active. You can realize that you are more than capable of being active than you think. Look for trainers with specialized certification from organizations like the American Council on Exercise or the National Academy of Sports Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/got-a-hangnail-heres-what-to-do,Got a hangnail? Here's what to do,1,"Hangnails are small, but they can be surprisingly annoying and even painful. They often appear when the skin around your nails becomes dry, cracked, or damaged. While most hangnails are harmless and can be treated at home, they can sometimes lead to infections if not properly cared for. What is a hangnail? A hangnail is a small, torn piece of skin that appears at the edge of a fingernail. Despite its name, a hangnail isn't part of the nail itself but instead a sliver of skin that can peel away from the nail's edge. Hangnails are common and can be painful, especially if they snag on something or get infected. Why do hangnails happen? Hangnails often form when the skin around your nails becomes dry and damaged. Common causes include cold weather, frequent hand washing, or exposure to harsh chemicals. People who bite their nails or pick at their skin may also be more likely to get hangnails. Hangnails can also happen if you have brittle nails or if your hands are in water a lot, as they might be when washing dishes. Treating hangnails at home Hangnails can often be managed simply at home. Here's how: Soak your fingers. Start by soaking your fingers in warm, soapy water for about 10 minutes to soften the skin. Trim carefully. Using sanitized nail clippers or small scissors, gently trim the hangnail close to the skin. You might be tempted to pull out the raised piece of skin, but that's something you should avoid. Tearing the skin can cause further damage at the base and increase your risk of developing an infection in the cuticle. Apply moisturizer. Use a fragrance-free moisturizing cream or a bit of petroleum jelly to keep the skin around your nails moisturized. Another option is to use a small amount of over-the-counter antibacterial ointment such as bacitracin. Bandage if needed. If the area is sore or bleeding, cover with a bandage to protect it from infection until it heals. How to prevent hangnails The best way to prevent hangnails is to keep the skin around your nails healthy and hydrated. These skin and nail care tips can help: Maintain clean, dry, and hydrated skin. Wash your hands and feet with gentle cleansers, ensuring they are thoroughly dried afterward. Use moisturizers daily and reapply them after each time you wash your hands. Use a fragrance-free hand cream or cuticle oil to keep your skin soft. Don't bite your nails. Biting your nails or picking at the skin around them can lead to tears and infection. Instead, trim your nails carefully with a clean tool and avoid cutting your cuticles. Protect your hands by wearing gloves. For activities like dishwashing, layer cotton gloves beneath waterproof gloves, such as vinyl ones. Use protective gloves while cleaning, gardening, or spending time outdoors in cold weather. Prioritize nail care. Trim your nails straight across using sharp nail clippers or scissors. Use an emery board to slightly round the tips and smooth out any rough edges or snags. Avoid using your nails as tools — for example, don't use a nail to pry open a soda can. When to see a doctor for a hangnail Most hangnails heal on their own with home care. However, when the protective barrier of skin around the nail is damaged, it can let in bacteria that can cause an infection. This is known as acute paronychia. Signs of infection include: Redness: The skin around the nail becomes red and inflamed. Swelling: The affected area may appear puffy or swollen. Pain or tenderness: The area around the nail may feel sore or painful, especially when touched. Warmth: The infected skin may feel warm to the touch. Pus: A pocket of yellow or white fluid (pus) may form near the nail if the infection progresses. If you notice these symptoms, it's a good idea to seek medical attention, especially if the infection doesn't improve or worsens. Infected hangnails can be painful. And left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of your finger.",9,0.14029737,-0.056685906
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ease-anxiety-and-stress-take-a-belly-breather-201904261861,Ease anxiety and stress: Take a (belly) breather,1,"Quick: think of three things that make you feel anxious or stressed. Most of us have no trouble reeling off answers. And people who suffer from anxiety disorders — such as social anxiety, phobias, or generalized anxiety — may have a variety of triggers that send anxiety soaring. While belly breathing alone can't fix deep-seated anxieties, it works well as a tool to help ease anxiety and garden-variety stress. Regularly engaging in belly breathing (or trying the mini strategy described below) can help you turn a fight-or-flight response into a relaxation response that's beneficial to your health. How should you breathe? You take up to 23,000 breaths per day, so make sure you do it right. How should you breathe? Like a sleeping child, says Dr. Katherine Rosa of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. ""If you ever watch children sleep, they all breathe from the belly and not the chest. This relaxed state is the more normal way to breathe."" Yet most people are chest breathers, which is how we react to stress. When we sense a threat, our fight-or-flight response automatically kicks in. We breathe at a rapid pace to suck in extra oxygen, to fuel our heart and muscles so we can flee the danger. Of course, we don't need our fight-or-flight response to escape predators anymore. Our threats now come from the stress of emails, personal confrontations, daily news, and traffic jams. ""Your fight-or-flight response is meant to be a short-term reaction that comes and goes,"" says Dr. Rosa. ""But today, we are surrounded by so many stressors that we constantly stay in this state of tension. It doesn't turn off, and we often don't even notice it."" The result: we have become a nation of chest breathers. Feel it in your belly One way to change our reaction to modern stress is to learn how to belly breathe instead of chest breathe. Belly breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, which runs from the head down the neck, through the chest, and to the colon. This activates your relaxation response, reducing your heart rate and blood pressure and lowering stress levels. If you are not familiar with belly breathing, try this exercise: sit in a chair, lean forward, and place your elbows on your knees. Then breathe naturally. ""This position forces you to breathe from the belly, so you know what the sensation feels like,"" says Dr. Rosa. A mini strategy to ease anxiety and stress A strategy to teach yourself mindful belly breathing is to practice what Dr. Rosa calls ""the mini."" Here's what you do: every time you feel stressed, simply take three slow and controlled deep belly breaths. ""It's a simple act, but this interrupts the fight-or-flight response and puts it on pause,"" says Dr. Rosa. ""Over time, belly breathing can buffer your resistance to your fight-or-flight response, so you are not as sensitive to stress triggers."" To help you be more mindful about your breathing pattern, place one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. ""You want the chest hand to be still and the belly hand to move out like you are blowing up a balloon,"" says Dr. Rosa. She suggests practicing belly breathing throughout the day, like once every hour or up to 10 to 15 times per day. ""As it becomes more of a habit, you can automatically engage belly breathing whenever you face a stressful event.""",6,0.20979728,-0.21340115

If you often find yourself tense and on-edge, try these seven ways to reduce stress. Get enough sleep. Inadequate or poor-quality sleep can negatively affect your mood, mental alertness, energy level, and physical health. Learn relaxation techniques. Meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, deep breathing exercises, and yoga are powerful relaxation techniques and stress-busters. Strengthen your social network. Connect with others by taking a class, joining an organization, or participating in a support group. Hone your time-management skills. The more efficiently you can juggle work and family demands, the lower your stress level. Try to resolve stressful situations if you can. Don't let stressful situations fester. Hold family problem-solving sessions and use negotiation skills at home and at work. Nurture yourself. Treat yourself to a massage. Truly savor an experience: for example, eat slowly and really focus on the taste and sensations of each bite. Take a walk or a nap, or listen to your favorite music. Ask for help. Don't be afraid to ask for help from your spouse, friends, and neighbors. If stress and anxiety persist, talk to your doctor. Along with these ways to reduce stress, add in a healthy lifestyle — maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, regular exercise, and a diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthful fats — and high blood pressure could be a thing of the past.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-apnea-and-heart-disease-a-weighty-matter,Sleep apnea and heart disease: A weighty matter,1,"In addition to helping control diabetes and obesity, the popular drugs known as GLP-1 agonists may also alleviate another disorder that's closely linked to cardiovascular problems: obstructive sleep apnea. This common condition — which is marked by brief pauses in breathing, often accompanied by loud snoring — doesn't just leave people groggy and sleepy during the day. Left untreated, this serious disorder raises the odds of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. Excess weight is the strongest risk factor linked with sleep apnea, which affects about 25% of men and 10% of women in the United States. More than half of people with the condition are overweight or obese, and the risk rises as body size increases, according to Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airway, and extra weight on the chest and belly puts pressure on the lungs, which makes the normal process of inhaling and exhaling less effective,"" she explains. What happens during sleep apnea? The 10- to 30-second breathing pauses that characterize sleep apnea occur when the airway in your nose or throat becomes partially or completely blocked by large tonsils, a large tongue, or too much tissue in the airway. Image: © Blueastro/Getty Images Treating sleep apnea In sleep apnea, the breathing pauses happen when the airway briefly closes (see ""What happens during sleep apnea?""). The first-line treatment is positive airway pressure (PAP), which uses a small bedside machine to push a forceful stream of air to a mask covering the nose or the nose and mouth to keep the airway open. A recent study found that one of the GLP-1 drugs, tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity) can slash the number of breathing interruptions during sleep — a key measure of sleep apnea severity. Published June 21, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine, the yearlong study included 469 people with obesity and moderate-to-severe sleep apnea, some of whom used PAP machines when sleeping. Compared with people who got a placebo injection, those treated with tirzepatide had a nearly 59% drop in their apnea-hypopnea index, a measure that describes the number of times a person's breathing slows or stops during an hour of sleep. Those taking tirzepatide lost close to 20% of their body weight. Ditch your PAP machine? ""At least once a week, I see people in my clinic who have lost so much weight on one of the obesity drugs that they don't need to use their PAP machine any longer,"" says Dr. Javaheri. (The other GLP-1 obesity drug, semaglutide, is sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss). ""Several patients lost between 50 and 60 pounds, which was enough to completely cure their sleep apnea."" While tirzepatide is not approved for treating sleep apnea, it's currently under consideration by the FDA for that use. However, even if you qualify for a prescription for either semaglutide or tirzepatide based on your medical conditions, these medications can be challenging to obtain due high demand, limited supplies, cost, and other factors. That said, the growing list of health benefits from GLP-1 agonists (see ""Anti-obesity drug lowers heart-related problems"" in the February 2024 Heart Letter) may make them both more accessible and affordable in the future. If and when tirzepatide is approved for treating sleep apnea, sleep medicine clinics will likely provide the medication, says Dr. Javaheri. Weight loss has long been recommended for sleep apnea sufferers who are overweight or obese. After people lose at least 10% of their initial weight (that is, their weight at diagnosis), insurance companies usually pay for another sleep study to see if they've improved enough to stop using PAP, which people often find cumbersome and inconvenient. ""But I advise people using anti-obesity drugs to wait until they reach their goal weight before getting retested,"" says Dr. Javaheri. Other contributors to sleep apnea Finally, it's worth noting that obesity is just one of the factors that predispose people to sleep apnea, which also occurs in people who aren't overweight. ""Some people are born with anatomical differences that leave them prone to sleep apnea, such as a narrow airway, a thicker neck, a large tongue, enlarged tonsils, or a small, receding chin,"" says Dr. Javaheri. ""Smoking also increases the risk of sleep apnea significantly, and alcohol can cause sleep apnea or make it worse,"" she adds. Image: © vitapix/Getty Images",6,0.29704434,-0.30702484
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/letting-the-air-out,Letting the air out,1,"Belching loud and proud was a badge of honor as a kid. But once we're adults, belching (or burping) can be annoying and embarrassing in the company of others. But people shouldn't be repelled by belching, as it serves an essential purpose. ""Belching is a protective mechanism against the stomach getting overinflated from swallowing too much air,"" says Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Think about how great you feel when you have a good belch."" Anatomy of a belch There are two types of belching: gastric belching and supragastric belching. Gastric belching is the everyday kind that most people experience. Every time you swallow, you take in a little air, and some of it travels down the esophagus and into the upper part of the stomach. When the stomach begins to stretch out from this air, sensors in its wall send signals to your esophagus. These signals tell the sphincter (the small ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus) to open, allowing air that has built up in the stomach to escape up and out as a belch. A gastric belch often smells. ""The air might have the odor of whatever you recently ate,"" says Dr. Staller. By contrast, with supragastric belching, swallowed air stays in the esophagus and never makes it to the stomach. The air gets quickly expelled in fast and frequent odorless belches. People can swallow too much air for various reasons. For example: Eating too fast. ""When you eat quickly, you gulp more air, which is why people often feel the urge to belch after eating,"" says Dr. Staller. The solution is to eat slower so you swallow less air. Try this: At the beginning of your meal, set a timer for 20 minutes. Then pace yourself to make your meal last until the timer goes off. Chew each mouthful 30 times, and put your fork down between bites. Carbonated beverages. Drinks like beer, soda, and seltzer can bring extra air into the esophagus and stomach. Gulping these drinks or using a straw can also increase air intake. Cutting down on carbonated beverages, drinking slower, and not using a straw can help. Gum and hard candy. Chewing gum and sucking on hard candies also can lead to inadvertent air swallowing. What if you can't belch? If you can't belch, you may have a condition called retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction (R-CPD), also known as ""no burp syndrome."" ""We still have a lot to learn about R-CPD, as there are limited data on the efficacy of treatment or how to make a true diagnosis,"" says gastroenterologist Dr. Kyle Staller at Massachusetts General Hospital. R-CPD is believed to occur when the cricopharyngeus muscle, a sphincter muscle that sits at the top of the esophagus, cannot relax and, as a result, does not open to allow air to exit the esophagus. As a result, air accumulates in the stomach, esophagus, and intestines, causing bloating and pressure in the abdomen, chest, and lower neck, and gurgling sounds from the chest and neck. Because the air cannot leave through the esophagus, it instead exits the body as flatulence, which is often excessive. Treatment options for R-CPD include a botulinum toxin injection into the cricopharyngeus muscle or surgery to cut partway through it. Both of these approaches allow the muscle to relax and air to exit the esophagus. Sound of trouble Belching is usually nothing to worry about, says Dr. Staller, but he suggests seeing your doctor if it becomes more frequent and causes distress and discomfort. Excessive belching is a common symptom for digestive disorders like functional dyspepsia (recurring symptoms of an upset stomach with no obvious cause) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). ""Belching could be a red flag if it accompanies other symptoms like sudden weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or blood in the stool,"" says Dr. Staller. Problematic belching also could be related to stress or anxiety, and treating these issues with psychotherapy and diaphragmatic breathing techniques often helps. When you do feel a belch coming, don't try to squelch it. ""There is little you can do to stop it,"" says Dr. Staller. ""You can be discreet by muffling a belch or holding it in for a few seconds until you're in a more private setting, but eventually, your body will win."" So, when you must belch, let it out and just say, ""Excuse me."" Image: © CSA-Archive/Getty Images",9,0.21671458,0.056708373
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/clearing-up-a-foggy-memory,Clearing up a foggy memory,1,"At some point, most older adults experience ""senior moments."" You misplace your phone or keys, lose your train of thought during a conversation, forget directions or a name minutes after being told, or walk into a room and don't know why. These moments of brain fogginess can be stressful and embarrassing, but are they ever cause for concern? ""The brain is like any other part of the body, and over time, it may not function as well as it used to,"" says neuropsychologist Julie Brody Magid, clinical director of the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital Memory Disorders Assessment Clinic. ""While most memory glitches are part of normal aging, in some cases they are exacerbated by problems that people can manage."" Aging and the brain People often notice memory lapses beginning in their 50s or 60s. This is when age-related chemical and structural changes begin in brain regions devoted to memory, such as the hippocampus and frontal lobes. These brain regions begin to shrink, often related to narrowing of the small arteries that deliver oxygen and nutrients. ""These changes can make learning and recalling new and existing information slightly more challenging,"" says Brody Magid. Yet age is not always to blame. Your doctor can help you sort out whether there are other problems contributing to your memory lapses. Here are some of the possibilities: Depression, anxiety, and stress. Depression can disrupt the brain's ability to focus, process, and access information, according to Brody Magid. Chronic stress and anxiety can flood the brain with the stress hormone cortisol, which, over time, can affect the brain regions responsible for storing and recalling information. ""Depression, stress, and anxiety can also cause negative and preoccupying thoughts that keep people from focusing and being present, which may contribute to memory issues,"" says Brody Magid. Medication. Brain fogginess can be a common side effect of some medications. ""If you are taking a new drug, either prescription or over the counter, ask your doctor or pharmacist if it could be affecting your cognition,"" says Brody Magid. Sleep. Research has linked a decline in brain functions with sleep problems, such as sleeping less than the recommended seven to eight hours nightly, fragmented sleep, and sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea. Mind tricks Even though most memory lapses are normal, you can take measures to manage and improve your existing brain skills. Here are some memory obstacles people encounter and ways to deal with them. Absentmindedness. This happens when you take on too many tasks or get distracted. When faced with multiple tasks, make a list, put them in order of importance, and focus on only one at a time before moving on to the next. Setting up routines and reminders can also help. For example, create a memory table by your front door or in the bedroom where you place vital objects, like your phone, medicines, keys, and glasses. Blocking. A common example of blocking is remembering and recalling names. When you meet someone, try linking that person with something that may help trigger name recall, like their hobby, work, background, or spouse. Another method is to associate the person with someone with the same name or a similar one, like a relative, celebrity, or movie character. Transience. Transience is the loss over time of certain memories like facts and events. To help retain specific memories, keep the information active in your memory; for instance, share it in conversation whenever possible, record it for future reference, and review related photographs. When to get checked If memory lapses become more frequent or substantial enough to interfere with your daily life or safety, you should get checked out, says Brody Magid. When speaking with your doctor, provide as much detailed information as possible surrounding your memory glitches. For instance, were you distracted because you were upset about something or were juggling too much at once? Does your memory recover in the moment, or does it take time for your brain to ""kick in""? Is there a pattern to your memory lapses? ""All of this background information can help your doctor determine if lifestyle factors or medical issues might be at play and need to be addressed, or if you need a formal examination at a memory clinic,"" says Brody Magid.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-can-cause-blood-in-stool,What can cause blood in stool?,1,"Discovering blood in your stool can be alarming, but it doesn't always signal a serious medical condition. Regardless of the cause, it's crucial to seek medical advice if you notice blood in your stool, as early detection and treatment can lead to better outcomes if it is caused by something serious. What does blood in stool look like? The appearance of blood in stool can vary, and the color of the blood often gives clues about the source of bleeding. Bright red blood usually suggests bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as the rectum or anus, and may be visible on toilet paper, in the toilet bowl, or on the surface of the stool. Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl or on toilet paper are often linked to conditions like hemorrhoids or anal fissures. However, certain foods such as beets, tomatoes, or foods with red food coloring can also cause stools to appear reddish. If you notice larger amounts of bright red blood, you should immediately let your healthcare provider know. Dark or tarry stools may indicate bleeding from a higher part of the digestive tract such as the stomach or small intestine. As the blood moves through the gastrointestinal system, it may be partially digested, resulting in a black, sticky appearance. However, certain foods, including blood sausage, blueberries, and black licorice, can also lead to dark stools. So can iron supplements, bismuth subsalicylate (found in Pepto-Bismol), and activated charcoal. What can cause blood in stool? There are many potential causes of rectal bleeding or blood in stool, ranging from minor issues like foods recently eaten, hemorrhoids, or anal fissures to more significant concerns such as gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, or inflammatory bowel diseases. Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels that can develop either externally (around the anus) or internally (in the lower rectum). They are the most common cause of rectal bleeding in middle-aged and older adults. Factors such as chronic constipation, straining during bowel movements, pregnancy, and prolonged sitting on the toilet can cause hemorrhoids. Symptoms of hemorrhoids can include rectal pain, itching, bleeding, and, in some cases, prolapse, where the hemorrhoids protrude through the anal canal. Anal fissures Anal fissures are small tears in the skin of the anal canal, often caused by constipation and straining to pass hard stools. Fissures can also occur due to diarrhea, vaginal childbirth, or infections. Common symptoms of anal fissures include sharp pain during bowel movements, itching around the anus, muscle spasms in the anal area, a lump or skin tag near the anus, and bright red blood in the stool, which may be seen on toilet paper after a bowel movement. Diverticulosis Diverticulosis occurs when weak spots in the inner wall of the colon cause small pouches to form. Over time, the blood vessels within these pouches can become fragile and prone to rupture, leading to bleeding. While diverticulosis is quite common, many people are unaware that they have it. Colon polyps Colon polyps are growths that occur in the large intestine (also called the colon). They are quite common — between 15% and 40% of adults may have polyps. Most polyps are benign, but some have the potential to develop into cancer over time. Removing polyps is an important step in preventing colorectal cancer. Most people with colon polyps don't experience symptoms. However, you should see your doctor immediately for advice if you develop rectal bleeding, as it may be a sign of polyps. Gastrointestinal infections Certain gastrointestinal infections can cause inflammation and irritation anywhere in the digestive tract. Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial overgrowth in the stomach that can lead to bleeding ulcers and black stools. Other bacteria and parasites that infect the intestines can cause bright red blood in the stool, often associated with abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease — results from an abnormal reaction by the body's immune system. This can expose your entire gastrointestinal system to inflammation and lead to a series of digestive problems including abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, more urgent bowel movements, and bloody stools. Colon cancer Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the tissues of the colon or rectum. When cancer originates in the colon, it is referred to as colon cancer. While colorectal cancer may not always cause noticeable symptoms, common signs can include changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool (either bright red or dark), frequent gas pains, bloating, feelings of fullness or cramping, weight loss, and fatigue. Screening for colon cancer saves lives. Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard screening test because polyps identified during the procedure can be removed before they become cancerous. Colonoscopy can also detect early cancers that can be cured with surgery. Alternative tests include stool tests for DNA and occult blood, with or without sigmoidoscopy. When should you see a doctor for blood in stool? Anyone experiencing persistent or recurring blood in the stool, even in small amounts, should schedule an appointment with their doctor. The stool should be assessed by a health care provider to identify the underlying cause.",9,0.17921467,0.14638427
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/eggs-protein-and-cholesterol-how-to-make-eggs-part-of-a-heart-healthy-diet,"Eggs, protein, and cholesterol: How to make eggs part of a heart-healthy diet",1,"One large egg has 6 grams of protein and contains lots of healthy nutrients for just 70 calories per egg. That makes them a good choice for most people. Unfortunately, public awareness has lagged behind research findings about eggs and heart health. The humble chicken egg has had a checkered past in the nutrition world. Egg yolks contain cholesterol, so at one time it seemed logical to assume that eating eggs could raise your risk for cardiovascular disease. Many people still limit their egg consumption for this reason. But the scientific evidence around eggs and heart health has evolved. It's true that eggs are rich in dietary cholesterol. But we've learned that saturated fat and trans fat are far worse for your cardiovascular health than dietary cholesterol. The good news for egg lovers is that eggs contain very little saturated fat and no trans fat. So for most people, eating an egg a day won't negatively impact your heart health. How healthy are eggs? Eggs contain healthy vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and nutrients, including: the nutrient choline, which is good for your brain and your nerves (and particularly important for pregnant women) the minerals phosophorus, calcium, and potassium the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for your eyes vitamins A, B, and D. One egg has only 1.24 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D. That's not a lot — a single serving of wild-caught salmon exceeds the recommended daily amount of 15 mcg. But egg yolks are one of the few naturally occurring food sources of vitamin D. So if you live in the Northern Hemisphere and have limited access to sun-induced vitamin D synthesis, eggs can help minimize a shortfall in vitamin D intake during the fall and winter months. How much protein is in an egg? A large egg has 6 grams of protein. The protein in eggs is considered high-quality protein because it contributes all nine essential amino acids. (These nine are considered essential because your body can't synthesize them on its own and must obtain them through your diet.) Each essential amino acid has unique functions, but eating a diet that includes all nine is necessary for your body to perform a range of critical tasks. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.36 grams per pound of body weight. This tool from the USDA can help you calculate your exact need, but the average sedentary man needs about 56 grams of protein per day, and the average sedentary woman needs about 46 grams. You may need even more than that, based on your age, activity levels, and other factors. Health benefits of eating eggs In addition to being relatively low in calories and providing a wide range of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and nutrients, the protein in eggs can also help you feel fuller for longer by increasing the production of hormones that signal that you've eaten enough. Eating protein also reduces levels of ghrelin, the hormone that makes you feel hungry. Do you need to worry about cholesterol in eggs? While eggs yolks do contain cholesterol, we now know that most of the cholesterol in the body is made by the liver. That means our cholesterol levels aren't greatly affected when we eat foods, like eggs, that contain cholesterol. Instead, the liver is prompted to make cholesterol (which can increase risk of cardiovascular disease) based on the amount of saturated fat and trans fat in our diets. Eggs contain only a small amount of saturated fat — about 1.5 grams per egg — and no trans fats. How many eggs can you eat per week as part of a heart-healthy diet? Eating an egg per day is safe for most healthy people. And the benefits you get from the protein, vitamins, minerals, and relatively few calories in your eggs outweigh risks from the tiny amount of saturated fat that you also get in the egg yolk. But watch what you eat with your eggs. If you're eating sausage, bacon, or ham with your eggs — or cooking them in a lump of butter and then slathering them in cheese — you're right to be concerned about your heart health, because you're introducing saturated fat and sodium into your meal. Instead, try your eggs poached, hard-boiled, or cooked in a little olive oil and served alongside some cooked spinach or sauteed mushrooms.",3,0.3362538,0.12346721
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-a-quick-snooze-help-with-energy-and-focus-the-science-behind-power-naps,Can a quick snooze help with energy and focus? The science behind power naps,1,"If you need a quick pick-me-up during the day, a power nap can be just the thing to help restore mental clarity and fight off fatigue. Power naps can help boost productivity and improve overall well-being, especially when taken at the right time and for the right duration. What is a power nap? A power nap is a short nap that lasts anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Even though you're only resting for a short period of time, power naps can effectively increase your level of alertness and focus. How? Power naps allow your body and mind to rest without entering deeper stages of sleep. Once you enter deep sleep — typically about 30 minutes after you've fallen asleep — you are likely to experience ""sleep inertia"" upon waking. Sleep inertia is the drowsy feeling you may get when you wake up, in which you feel temporarily disorientated and are slower to react. It can take your body 30 to 60 minutes to recover from sleep inertia. Benefits of a quick snooze: An energy boost and mental clarity Naps offer several health benefits that can improve your quality of life. Studies show that naps can enhance mood, reduce fatigue, and improve alertness. Additional research has found that power naps may help decrease blood pressure and improve heart health, especially when taken in the early afternoon. Power naps may support work performance as well. Researchers at NASA found that pilots who napped 20 to 30 minutes were over 50% more alert and over 30% more proficient at their jobs than pilots who didn't nap. How long should a power nap be? Keep your power nap to 30 minutes or less to avoid sleep inertia. A shorter nap can also help you bypass some health risks associated with longer naps. For example, a study published in Obesity found that adults who napped longer than 30 minutes were more likely to experience higher blood pressure and blood sugar levels than people who did not nap. Short nappers did not share this increased risk. Set an alarm to ensure your nap doesn't exceed the 30-minute mark. Tips for a restorative power nap The following tips can help you get the biggest boost out of your power nap. Time it right. Aim to nap in the early afternoon, ideally between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., when your body naturally experiences a dip in energy. Napping too late in the day can interfere with nighttime sleep. That said, the ideal time to nap varies by individual. Some people may benefit from earlier naps depending on what time they wake up and go to sleep. Keep it short. Set an alarm to wake you after 20 to 30 minutes. A short nap will leave you refreshed rather than groggy. Create a cozy environment. Find a quiet, dark, and comfortable space where you won't be interrupted. If you're in a bright or noisy area, consider using an eye mask or earplugs to help you fall asleep faster. Listen to your body. If you frequently feel the need for a nap, it may be a sign of inadequate nighttime sleep. While a power nap can help boost energy in the short term, make sure you're prioritizing a good night's rest as well. Frequent daytime drowsiness can also be a sign of sleep apnea, a common disorder that causes people to stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Talk to your doctor if you are regularly sleepy during the day or if you're a loud snorer. Finally, napping is not for everyone. Some people may not feel refreshed even after a short nap. In that case, the best approach may be to avoid napping and focus on getting a good night's sleep.",6,0.2064655,-0.17538863
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-latest-thinking-on-inherited-high-cholesterol,The latest thinking on inherited high cholesterol,1,"Nearly one-third of American adults have high levels of harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol circulating through their blood, which doubles their risk of heart disease compared to people with normal levels (see ""Classifying LDL level""). Most of these people likely have dozens of different genetic mutations, each of which raises LDL by a little bit. Over time — coupled with a less-than-ideal diet and not enough exercise — their LDL levels slowly creep up. But what about very high LDL? ""About 5% of the population have LDL values of 190 or higher, and their risk of heart disease is five times higher than people with near-optimal LDL,"" says Dr. Amit V. Khera, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Within this group, an important minority has familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic condition that affects about one in 250 adults. What is FH? Most people with FH have a mutation or variant in one of three different genes that provide instructions that help remove excess LDL from the bloodstream. People who inherit one variant from a parent have heterozygous FH, which can cause LDL levels as high as 350 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). People who inherit two variants (one from each parent) have homozygous FH. This very rare condition, which affects only about four in a million people, can lead to LDL levels as high as 1,000 mg/dL. Excess LDL in the bloodstream can accumulate in the skin and tendons, which is why some people with FH develop small, cholesterol-filled nodules on their eyelids or their tendons, especially those along the backs of the hands, the elbows, or the backs of the ankles (the Achilles tendons). But the biggest threat is the buildup of LDL in the arteries supplying the heart. People with untreated FH can succumb to a heart attack in their 40s or earlier, likely because of the cumulative exposure to high LDL starting at birth. Classifying LDL level These targets are for people without known heart disease. People who have heart disease or are at high risk for it should aim for an LDL of 70 or lower. LDL category Value (mg/dL) Optimal 100 Near/above optimal 100–129 Borderline high 130–159 High 160–189 Very high 190 or higher Is genetic testing necessary? If a person's close relative — a parent or sibling — has very high cholesterol or had a heart attack at a young age (before 55 in a man or 65 in a woman), that's a red flag for possible FH. Genetic testing isn't strictly necessary, as high LDL is a reliable sign of heart disease risk in anyone, regardless of the cause. However, FH testing can be beneficial for two reasons, says Dr. Khera. ""First, if you've struggled your whole life with high cholesterol despite following a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, knowing there's a genetic explanation is often helpful."" Second, an FH diagnosis can be important for your biological parents, siblings, and children, each of whom has a 50/50 chance of having the same FH variant. Although guidelines recommend checking cholesterol levels in children and adolescents at least once between ages 9 and 11 and again between ages 17 and 21, such tests usually aren't done. And when high cholesterol is found, physicians typically don't treat children and teens very aggressively. But once they hit adulthood, treating very high cholesterol is crucial, says Dr. Khera. The Family Heart Foundation has more information on FH, including a tool to search for doctors who specialize in the condition. Treating very high LDL The latest cholesterol treatment guidelines emphasize the importance of lowering excessively high LDL and keeping it low for decades. ""It's most practical to focus on finding and treating severe hypercholesterolemia, regardless of the underlying cause,"" says Dr. Khera. The first choice is a high-intensity statin: 40 to 80 milligrams (mg) of atorvastatin (Lipitor) or 20 to 40 mg of rosuvastatin (Crestor), both of which will slash LDL by about 50%. While those drugs get many people with very high LDL close to the target range of 70 mg/dL for high-risk individuals, some need additional medications, which may include ezetimibe (Zetia), a pill that inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut bempedoic acid (Nexletol), a pill that blocks cholesterol production in the liver alirocumab (Praluent) or evolocumab (Repatha), injectable drugs that help remove excess LDL from the bloodstream inclisiran (Leqvio), a twice-yearly injection that interferes with a protein in the liver that regulates LDL. Following heart-healthy habits, as outlined in the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 is also crucial. Image: © jarun011/Getty Images",1,0.15529115,-0.18439111
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-diseases-gender-bias,Inflammatory bowel disease's gender bias,1,"Just because a situation is equal doesn't make it equitable. Case in point: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — which has been diagnosed in about one of every 100 American adults — affects roughly equal numbers of both sexes. But the condition clearly inflicts a disproportionate burden on women, shaping symptoms, affecting reproductive decisions, and increasing risks of ominous downstream effects. IBD comprises both Crohn's disease — which can affect any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus — and ulcerative colitis, which is limited to the colon. Diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, urgency, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fatigue are commonplace among both men and women with the disorder. Some patients with IBD experience only mild symptoms, while others cope with much more severe cases. People with Crohn's, for instance, can develop abnormal, tunnel-like fistulas between their colon or rectum and nearby tissues such as the skin, bladder, or vagina. IBD's gender bias was highlighted by a study published in the February 2023 issue of the Journal of Personalized Medicine, which reported that women with the condition report more psychological distress and a worse quality of life than male peers. IBD can also be harder on women because of its array of specific effects on their reproductive and overall health, says Dr. Rachel Winter, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Formidable challenges Here's how IBD can affect women differently from men: Symptoms ramp up during menstruation. For many women, even without IBD, periods bring intestinal troubles such as abdominal pain, loose stools, or indigestion. For women with IBD, such overlapping symptoms can make them feel like they're having a flare even if they're not, Dr. Winter says. Sex can be painful. If Crohn's disease affects a part of the intestine near the perineum — the area between the vulva and anus — women can find vaginal sex excruciating. A fistula between the intestinal wall and the vagina can create the same issue, as can abdominal scar tissue from IBD-related surgeries. Even the idea of sex can be off-putting, since IBD patients may worry about passing stool during intercourse or feel inhibited if they have an ostomy bag that collects stool outside the abdomen. It may be harder to conceive. Fertility may suffer when rampant inflammation from IBD affects the fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs. And IBD flares during pregnancy can raise the risk of complications such as low birth weight or premature birth. ""We have open conversations with all of our patients who are considering becoming pregnant in the near future, because certain medications shouldn't be taken during pregnancy,"" Dr. Winter says. ""We want to transition to medications that are safe if they conceive."" Women who take immunosuppressive drugs have a higher risk for cervical cancer. Certain IBD medications that suppress the immune system can raise the risk of abnormal cells developing on the cervix. Because of this, doctors advise women with IBD who take these drugs to undergo screening Pap tests more frequently than other women. IBD itself does not increase the risk for precancerous or cancerous changes of the cervix. Iron-deficiency anemia is more likely. Menstrual bleeding — which carries iron out of the body — already increases women's odds of anemia. Adding in digestive tract bleeding from IBD creates a double whammy. IBD also hinders the body's ability to absorb iron, increasing anemia risk. Osteoporosis risks increase. This bone-thinning disease already disproportionately strikes women over 50 compared to men. But women with IBD are especially at risk for osteoporosis even at younger ages, particularly if they've had problems absorbing nutrients or have taken the steroid prednisone, which weakens bones. Support tips How can women with IBD generate support for any sex-specific concerns? Dr. Winter offers these suggestions: Be candid. Sharing private, potentially embarrassing symptoms or downstream effects of IBD can be daunting. But it's vital to push past awkward moments and be frank with your doctor, who may be able to propose solutions you hadn't considered. ""Women should not be afraid to openly discuss any of these issues with their providers,"" she says. Look for dedicated IBD programs. Some academic medical centers have programs aimed directly at patients with IBD, increasing the chances that clinicians there will be well versed in women-specific concerns.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/digestive-health-changes-when-to-seek-medical-care,Digestive health changes: When to seek medical care,1,"It's been an eventful year in the world, and if it seems like it's been a bumpy ride for your gastrointestinal tract, too — with bouts of heartburn, diarrhea, or constipation — this is a good time to consider whether you've been experiencing temporary symptoms or signs of something more serious or chronic. Identify your distress The first step in understanding gastrointestinal distress is putting a name to the problem. Heartburn. This fiery feeling in your chest is usually caused by stomach acid that leaks upward into the esophagus (the tube connecting your mouth and stomach). It occurs when the ring of muscles that normally stop leakage temporarily loosen or aren't working well. Heartburn might also cause a sore throat, a cough, or a metallic taste after meals. Constipation. If you're not having a bowel movement at least three times a week, that's considered constipation. Or if your stool is hard and lumpy and you strain to get it out or you have the feeling you aren't evacuating completely, that's also constipation. Diarrhea. Diarrhea is watery, unformed stool. It usually doesn't feel great as it's brewing in your gut, and it's often uncomfortable to pass it. What's causing the trouble? The digestive tract is a sophisticated yet sensitive system that can be disrupted anywhere along its route from the mouth to the anus—and it doesn't take much to cause temporary discomfort. For example, stress can slow digestion and cause constipation, increase acid production and trigger heartburn, or speed digestion and send you running for the bathroom with diarrhea. ""We call the gastrointestinal tract the 'second nervous system.' There are many nerve endings going to all parts of it, including the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Stress might result in the brain telling the tract how to react, even when there might not be anything wrong structurally,"" says Dr. Alexander Goldowsky, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Other possible causes of occasional gastrointestinal problems include your diet, weight gain, an infection, or a medication side effect. Coping with occasional bouts If you've been experiencing new digestive issues, try making a few changes to see if symptoms go away in a few days or weeks. For heartburn. Two approaches can help. One is using over-the-counter medications. Dr. Goldowsky recommends taking a fast-acting drug that targets stomach acid. Examples include calcium carbonate (Tums), aluminum hydroxide (Mylanta), and H2 blockers such as famotidine (Pepcid) and cimetidine (Tagamet). The other approach is making lifestyle changes. Avoid foods and drinks that seem to trigger your heartburn, such as spicy, fatty, or tomato-based foods; citrus; garlic; onion; peppermint; and anything with caffeine, such as chocolate, tea, or coffee. Also: eat smaller meals, stay upright for at least two hours after meals, avoid drinking alcohol or eating late at night, and sleep on a wedge pillow. For constipation. To combat constipation, Dr. Goldowsky advises taking a powdered fiber supplement that you add to food or drinks, such as Metamucil, Benefiber, or Citrucel. ""Fiber is a miracle. It helps stool form a shape and get out, so you feel empty,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. He also recommends increasing fiber in your diet (great sources include beans, lentils, peas, whole grains, berries, nuts, seeds, artichokes, pumpkin, and brussels sprouts). ""Your total goal should be around 30 grams of fiber per day,"" he says, ""but it's hard to reach that goal with food. That's why the supplement is important."" Other ways to fight constipation include drinking more fluids to help stool move along, and exercising every day (which keeps the muscles in your intestines strong). For diarrhea. Dr. Goldowsky recommends using a fiber supplement for this problem, too, since fiber helps stool form properly. It's also essential to stay hydrated to replace fluids you're losing through diarrhea. Additionally, it's a good idea to keep track of foods that might be triggering diarrhea. Common culprits include dairy foods; foods that contain gluten, artificial sweeteners, or caffeine; fried, fatty, spicy, or sugary foods; and foods with natural sugars that are difficult for some people to digest, such as those in wheat, rye, onions, garlic, legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans), honey, pistachios, cashews, asparagus, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes. It might also help to take an anti­diarrheal medication such as loperamide (Imodium). ""Medications for diarrhea are helpful, but they can overdo it and cause constipation. Take a few doses and see how you feel, then gradually reduce the amount you're taking,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. When to call your doctor Call your doctor immediately if your symptoms include bloody stools, fever, loss of bowel control, severe pain, or severe dehydration. If you don't have those symptoms but you do have heartburn, diarrhea, or constipation that isn't going away after a week or two of home remedies, it's time to see your doctor. ""We don't want to miss colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""These are unlikely causes of such symptoms, but we need to rule them out."" Your physician will also rule out other disorders that can cause gastrointestinal problems (such as low thyroid function), gut changes that affect how fast food moves through the digestive tract, and medication side effects that might be causing trouble. The encouraging news is that there's usually a way to treat the problem, including specialized diets, physical therapy, or medications. ""Don't give up. We can get you feeling better,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""My goal is for you to be able to control or eliminate your symptoms so you can function well and have a better quality of life.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/forearm-workouts-strengthening-grip-for-everyday-function,Forearm workouts: Strengthening grip for everyday function,1,"When you think about building strength, your mind might immediately go to strength-training workouts for the larger muscles in your body such as your back, chest, or legs. But the muscles of the forearm — the part of the arm that extends from the elbow to the wrist — are also worth paying attention to. Why grip strength matters Strong forearms support grip strength, which plays an important role in how well you can grasp and hold items. Think squeezing a tube of toothpaste, turning a doorknob, or holding a glass of water. Research has also found that grip strength is associated with many measures of overall health, especially as you age. A weak grip is associated with: lower total strength reduced bone mineral density falls and fractures sleep problems memory problems depression malnutrition death from any cause. How strengthening forearms can improve grip Many of the muscles that help your hand and wrist grip something solidly extend into your forearms. One study found that having larger forearm muscles was correlated with greater grip strength. Strengthening forearm muscles can help you perform gripping and grasping movements more effectively and efficiently As of now, there's no evidence that building forearm muscles and grip strength will improve longevity or overall health. However, increased grip strength will support your ability to perform gripping and grasping tasks — from opening jars to holding a cane and opening doors — that could help you stay independent longer. Simple forearm exercises to boost grip strength Some of the best forearm workouts involve surprisingly simple movements. Start with one set of 10 repetitions for each of the following strength exercises. Build up to two to three sets over time. You'll need a set of light dumbells (1 to 3 pounds) and some therapy putty (start with the softest putty), which you can purchase at a medical supply store, to perform these exercises. Wrist extension and flexion Hold a light dumbbell (1 to 3 pounds) in each hand. Keep your arms at your sides with your elbows bent, palms facing down. Moving from your wrist, lift the weights upward until you feel a gentle stretch on the inside of your wrist. Hold for a count of five. Then bend your wrist and lower the weights down until you feel a gentle stretch on the outside of your wrist. Hold for a count of five. Continue for 10 repetitions. Wrist supination/pronation Hold a light dumbbell (1 to 3 pounds) in each hand. Keep your arms at your sides with your elbows bent, palms facing down. Rotate your forearm, so your palm faces up. Hold for a count of five. Then rotate your forearm so your palm faces down. Hold for a count of five. Continue for 10 repetitions. Putty grip Roll the putty into a ball. Place the putty in your palm. Gently squeeze and release. Repeat 10 times on each hand every other day. Putty three-point pinch Roll the putty into a short, fat cylinder. Place the putty between the pads of your thumb and your index and middle fingers. Gently squeeze the putty between your fingers and thumb and release. Repeat 10 times on each hand every other day. Some people also use tools called hand grippers or grip strengtheners for a few minutes each day to build grip strength. There are many different models available online and in fitness stores. Gadgets to help compensate for reduced grip strength Forearm workouts only go so far. Sometimes you need a little assistance to accomplish tasks like opening a stubborn jar or confidently holding a sharp knife. There are a number of tools and gadgets that can help. These are often available at medical supply stores or online. They include: electric can openers jar key openers nonslip gripper mats to open jars rocker knives dental floss holders soap-on-a-rope shoehorns doorknob extenders book stands nonslip gloves.",6,0.32297295,-0.20413545
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/botulism-a-to-z,Botulism,1,"What is botulism? Botulism is a form of poisoning caused by exposure to Clostridium botulinum bacteria. These bacteria manufacture a chemical poison known as botulinum toxin that interferes with muscle function in many areas of the body, causing paralysis of individual muscles or groups of muscles. Exposure to this toxin is life-threatening, since one of the muscles it can paralyze is the diaphragm, the muscle that controls breathing. You can be exposed to the bacteria causing botulism in several ways, the most familiar being by eating contaminated food. In most food-borne cases of botulism in adults, home-canned foods are responsible. The bacteria that cause botulism exist in dirt and dust as a spore, but this form is inactive and does not produce toxin. However, when a spore is moved into a low-oxygen environment such as an enclosed jar or can, it can reproduce and make its dangerous toxin. Home-canned vegetables that are not highly acidic (asparagus, green beans, peppers, beets, and corn) are good incubators for botulism bacteria, unless they are heat-treated appropriately to kill the spores during the canning process and eaten quickly after opening. The bacteria can release large quantities of toxin into the canned food jar, causing botulism symptoms in people who sample the produce. Home-canned, smoked, or fermented fish is also a risk. Recent outbreaks have been reported from commercial carrot juice and home-canned bamboo shoots. In the United States, roughly 100 people become ill with botulism each year. About a quarter are due to consumption of contaminated food. Most cases today (about 70%) occur in infants. Babies less than 1 year old, especially those that are breastfeeding, have a different intestinal system than adults. Spores swallowed by an adult with a mature digestive tract usually will remain in their hibernating, inactive state. But spores ingested by a young infant can reproduce and can form toxin that is absorbed into the bloodstream, causing botulism. In one out of five cases of botulism in infants, the infant has eaten raw honey. More rarely, botulism spores are found in corn syrup. Since the majority of cases of infant botulism can't be traced to a food source, experts suspect that babies are exposed simply by swallowing small amounts of dust or dirt. Rarely, botulism is the result of a contaminated wound. Most wound botulism today occurs in people who inject or snort recreational drugs. Symptoms of botulism All of the symptoms of botulism are the result of nerve paralysis during exposure to the toxin. Symptoms usually begin within one to two days after eating contaminated food. Symptoms of infant botulism and wound botulism also appear suddenly. The earliest symptoms involve the eyes and face, because nerves controlling their function are affected most quickly by the botulism toxin. Early or mild symptoms, which may go away on their own, include: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (not usually present in wound botulism) double vision, blurred vision (especially when viewing close objects), or drooping eyelids dryness of the mouth. More severe cases can cause these additional symptoms: slurred or garbled speech difficulty swallowing muscle weakness in arms or legs; general fatigue difficulty breathing, sometimes severe in infants, usually constipation at first; also lethargy and a ""floppy"" neck, arms, and legs, demonstrating weak muscles; difficulty feeding; failure to cry well. Diagnosing botulism If your doctor suspects botulism after asking you about your medical history and examining you, both blood and stool samples may be tested to check for the presence of botulinum toxin. Generally these tests are done in a government laboratory that specializes in detecting botulism. Sometimes botulism bacteria can be grown from a stool sample. Botulism is uncommon enough that your doctor will consider other explanations for your symptoms. In most cases, several other tests will be ordered: a brain scan, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, to check for other diagnoses such as stroke blood tests to check for Lyme disease a lumbar puncture to help to distinguish botulism from a similar illness called Guillain-Barre syndrome an electromyogram, a test of nerve and muscle function, to determine if the problem might be another muscle-weakening disease such as polymyositis or myasthenia gravis. Once definite evidence of botulism is found with laboratory tests, usually no additional testing is needed. Expected duration of botulism Most paralysis symptoms of botulism last for several weeks and then slowly go away in the following months. Sometimes fatigue and shortness of breath can last for years. Preventing botulism You can prevent food-borne botulism with careful food-handling techniques: When home canning, use a pressure cooker that can reach temperatures adequate to kill botulism spores. Preserved food should be heated above 248º F (120º C) for at least five minutes during the canning process. Some foods, such as jams and jellies, do not require a pressure cooker because their high sugar level makes it difficult for Clostridium botulinum bacteria to grow. Do not eat or store cooked foods that have stayed at room temperature for more than four hours. Do not eat or even taste canned goods from a jar that has a bulging lid or a bad odor. Do not leave foil-wrapped baked potatoes at room temperature. They should be served hot or refrigerated. Do not store chopped garlic or onions in oil at room temperature. If you are eating home-canned fish or vegetables, first boil the food for 10 minutes with frequent stirring. This will destroy any botulinum toxin that has been produced in storage. Do not feed honey or corn syrup to infants less than 1 year old. To prevent wound botulism, do not use recreational injected drugs. Report deep wounds promptly to a physician. Treating botulism Botulism usually requires hospitalization, sometimes for a prolonged time. The main treatment for botulism is administration of an antitoxin (a chemical antidote to the toxin), and good nursing support and physician care, sometimes in an intensive care unit, with machine support by a ventilator as needed to assist breathing. If antitoxin is given early in the course of the disease, it will prevent further paralysis from the toxin, but it does not affect symptoms that are already present. Physical therapy can be helpful in aiding recovery of muscle strength. Infants with botulism present a special challenge: They are treated with antitoxin but are not given antibiotics because killing the botulism bacteria in their gut can cause a sudden release of more antitoxin. Instead, medicines that cause vomiting or treatments such as enemas are used to remove undigested food from the gut. Wounds that are a source of botulism must be treated with surgery to remove contaminated tissue. When to call a professional Botulism can worsen rapidly and is a life-threatening emergency. If you or your infant has symptoms of botulism and these symptoms do not have a known explanation, you should contact a physician immediately. Prognosis Although botulism can cause severe and prolonged symptoms, most people recover completely from the illness. Early treatment reduces the risk of permanent disability and death.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-14-study-ergothioneine-mushrooms-help-extend-lifespan.html,Study suggests ergothioneine in mushrooms can help extend your lifespan,0,"Mushrooms are a great addition to many savory dishes. Research suggests the benefits offered by mushrooms go beyond the kitchen . Several studies have found that a compound in mushrooms can help extend the human lifespan. One recent study looked into the potential benefits of fungi-derived bioactive compounds on lifespan and health span. The study also highlighted the importance of finding interventions to minimize age-related diseases. Another study published in the Nutrition Journal investigated the health benefits of mushrooms. Researchers found that mushroom consumption is linked to a longer lifespan. They credited this benefit to mushrooms' high content of ergothioneine, an antioxidant amino acid found in fungi and bacteria. While conducting the study, researchers reviewed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The 20-year prospective cohort study involved 15,000 participants. Results revealed that the people who included mushrooms in their diet had a 16 percent lower chance of early death. The researchers also discovered that consuming one serving of mushrooms per day instead of processed meat reduced the chances of dying prematurely from any cause by at least 35 percent. The research team explained that this benefit may be due to ergothioneine's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. They also suggested that ergothioneine's anti-aging properties could stem from its ability to protect against telomere shortening. Research shows ergothioneine has protective effects on telomeres Telomeres are usually described as protective ""caps"" for chromosomes. These long strings of delicate, elaborately folded DNA act like the protective plastic tips on shoelaces that help prevent fraying and damage. Longer telomeres are associated with better cellular health and are also usually linked with longevity. But telomeres naturally shorten over time, which makes them less able to preserve the structure of chromosomes. Shorter telomeres are linked with aging and chronic degenerative disease. In a study with participants over 60, those with shorter telomeres were three times more likely to die of heart disease than those with longer telomeres. They were also at least eight times more likely to die from infections. In another preliminary study published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements in 2022, a research team discovered that treating cells with ergothioneine for eight weeks alleviated telomere shortening from oxidative stress. They suggested that this can help potentially avoid mutations in DNA that could cause cancer . The researchers concluded that the results support ""a potential role for ergothioneine in oxidative stress-related conditions and healthy aging."" Ergothioneine also supports longevity by helping to replenish and recycle glutathione, the body’s master antioxidant. Data also suggests that ergothioneine offers a valuable ""trifecta"" of anti-aging gifts: supporting longer telomeres, protecting DNA and recycling glutathione. Mushrooms can support optimal brain health In a separate study, scientists found that people over 60 were found to display lower levels of ergothioneine. They added that those over 60 with mild age-related cognitive impairment showed even sharper declines in this important amino acid. This is bad because ergothioneine, which helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress, is believed to help aging adults maintain healthy cognition and memory. Test tube and animal studies have indicated that ergothioneine may also help support memory by creating new neurons or brain cells. In a trial published in the Japanese Journal of Pharmacology , the research team gave both healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment a mushroom extract containing 5 mg of ergothioneine a day for 12 weeks. They found that the supplementation resulted in significant improvements in verbal memory, working memory and sustained attention for both the healthy and the mildly impaired volunteers. (Related: 6 Mushrooms you can eat to prevent cognitive impairment and reduce your dementia risk .) Aside from its anti-aging properties, ergothioneine also helps support a healthy immune system, promotes optimal cardiovascular function and supports healthy skin. Ergothioneine is even used in skincare serums and creams to reduce the appearance of fine lines and soothe redness and irritation. It is also used in products that help fight against damage and photoaging caused by ultraviolet radiation. Visit NaturalMedicine.news for more research about mushrooms and other superfoods.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-you-need-diagnostic-tests-for-heartburn,Do you need diagnostic tests for heartburn?,1,"You just enjoyed a delicious meal, but now there's a burning feeling creeping up your chest—classic heartburn. Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or ""acid reflux,"" which occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus. But sometimes, this pain can be so intense it mimics a heart attack, making you wonder if it's something more serious. While doctors often skip extensive tests for straightforward cases, certain red flags—like trouble swallowing, internal bleeding, or severe, unresponsive symptoms—can call for deeper investigation. Here's a look at some of the diagnostic tests your doctor might recommend to get to the root of persistent heartburn. Upper GI endoscopy. This is the most commonly ordered initial test when people have worrisome symptoms. For this test, a person receives intravenous medicine to induce relaxation. It's called conscious sedation. The doctor sprays a local anesthetic in the back of the throat to prevent gagging. Next the doctor inserts a flexible tube called an endoscope down the throat. The tube has a light and camera attached, which let the doctor inspect the lining of the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine to look for areas of irritation, ulcers, or strictures. Special tools can be inserted through the endoscope to take a biopsy (tissue sample), if necessary. Barium study. After drinking a liquid barium mixture, a person has an x-ray of the chest and upper abdomen. Barium helps define the esophagus on the x-ray image and can help the physician identify problems such as a hiatal hernia, esophageal ulcers, or a stricture (narrowing) of the esophagus. This test is called an upper GI series when the stomach and first part of the small intestine are also examined. pH monitoring. This test is used less frequently than those described above. It monitors a person's reflux episodes over 24 hours via a thin, acid sensing probe inserted through the nose and positioned at the bottom of the esophagus just above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This is an excellent method for documenting acid reflux in people who have unexplained chest pain, coughing, wheezing, or hoarseness. It's also used to assess the effectiveness of acid-suppressing drugs when symptoms persist. A wireless form of the pH monitor is contained in a capsule and looks like a pill. It is placed in the esophagus and can be used to monitor pH levels for 48 hours, during periods while the person is both on and off acid-suppressing therapy. The wireless pH system is particularly useful in people who do not respond to PPIs. Impedance testing. This test can be done at the same time as pH monitoring. It measures how well food and gas pass through the esophagus and is a good way to evaluate both acid- and non-acid reflux.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/bouncing-back-from-stress,Bouncing back from stress,1,"We all experience stress in our lives. Traffic. Monthly bills. Health concerns. Relationship issues. Because the mind and body are so closely linked, these constant worries can take a toll on health, contributing to a host of diseases. While you can't erase all sources of stress, you can learn how to reduce stress and also build resilience—which is your ability to bounce back from stress. William James was a notable Harvard philosopher-psychologist of the late 19th century and a graduate of Harvard Medical School. James was also a stressed-out melancholic. He marveled at people he called ""the healthy-minded""—optimistic and positive people who appeared to live hap­pier and healthier lives. Amid the run-of-the-mill volatility everyone must deal with, James observed that the healthy-minded seemed to turn challenges and potential failures into grist for opportunities and successes. The characteristics that James saw as ""healthy-minded,"" statistician and risk-management specialist Nassim Nicholas Taleb called ""antifragile."" In his book Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder, Taleb defines fragility as the tendency to be damaged by volatility and uncertainty—the kinds of things that often create a chronic stress response. By contrast, says Taleb, the antifragile person realizes that stress is just the price we pay for being alive. Cultivating anti­fragility helps us use our strengths to overcome chal­lenges and become stronger in the process. A prime example of antifragility is the Navy Seals. The Seals are able to manage high degrees of stress and still function admirably. Faced with life-threatening situations, they can rapidly change the focus of their attention and address the issue at hand efficiently and flexibly. Brain scans show that Seals have altered acti­vation in a prefrontal brain region called the insula, which is involved in managing stress signals. As a group, Navy Seals exhibit at least seven characteris­tics of resilient people: Calm, innovative, nondogmatic thinking The ability to act decisively Tenacity Inter­personal connectedness Honesty Self-control Optimism and a positive perspective on life. Whether adopting a ""healthy-minded"" mindset, cultivating antifragility, or thinking like a Navy Seal, building resilience is a powerful tool against stress. People tend to think of resilience as a trait that you either have or don't have, but it's actually a capacity that you can develop with the right approach.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/emlisteriaem-how-to-protect-yourself-from-this-common-cause-of-food-poisoning,Listeria: How to protect yourself from this common cause of food poisoning,1,"Listeria infection is rare compared to other types of food-borne illness. But outbreaks from deli meats and other foods do occur from time to time. What is Listeria? Listeria infection is a food-borne illness caused by bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes. A Listeria infection is also called listeriosis. Most people develop listeriosis from eating contaminated foods. Food poisoning from Listeria can be dangerous, or even deadly. About 1,600 people get a Listeria infection each year in the U.S., and about 260 people die from the disease. How Listeria causes food poisoning The bacteria that cause listeriosis can be found in moist environments, including soil, water, and decaying vegetation. Animals can also carry Listeria bacteria in their intestines without getting sick themselves. As a result, tood can become infected with Listeria during harvesting, processing, preparation, or storage. If contaminated food is eaten, the bacteria can cause food poisoning. Symptoms of listeriosis The symptoms of listeriosis vary depending on whether the infection is limited to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or has spread beyond the gut. People infected with Listeria may feel symptoms within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. Intestinal symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms usually resolve within three days, and most people feel better with rest and drinking plenty of fluids. Invasive listeriosis, the term for listeriosis that spreads beyond the GI tract, can take several weeks to cause symptoms. Symptoms of invasive Listeria infection include: fever muscle aches fatigue headache stiff neck gastroenteritis confusion loss of balance seizures. A severe Listeria infection may spread to the bloodstream or brain. Severe infections may cause life-threatening conditions such as sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis. Some pregnant women who develop listeriosis have no symptoms or have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, or a serious infection in the newborn. Foods most likely to be contaminated with Listeria The foods that are most likely to be contaminated with Listeria include: deli meats hot dogs unpasteurized raw milk unpasteurized soft cheeses raw sprouts smoked seafood. While these foods have the highest risk of Listeria monocytogenes contamination, listeriosis can affect almost any improperly handled or prepared food. How to reduce your risk of food poisoning Some tips to reduce your risk of food poisoning from listeriosis or other food-borne illnesses, such as Salmonella poisoning, include the following: Set your refrigerator at 40o F (4o C) or lower and your freezer at 0o F (andndash;18 o C). Those temperatures can slow the growth of Listeria, which can grow even in cold temperatures. Use a refrigerator thermometer and adjust the settings if necessary. Use refrigerated foods by the date listed on the package. The longer you keep them, the higher the risk of Listeria growing. Clean your refrigerator regularly, and wipe up spills right away so Listeria doesn't have a place to grow. Other steps you can take to reduce your risk of food poisoning include washing your hands before and after handling food, and using separate cutting boards and utensils for produce and raw meats or seafood. A food thermometer can help ensure that meat, poultry, fish, and other foods are cooked to a safe internal temperature. Raw pet food is another potential source of Listeria contamination, so take care when preparing your pet's meals. Who is at greatest risk for severe illness from Listeria? People at greatest risk for severe illness from Listeria include pregnant women, newborn babies, people ages 65 and older, and people with a weakened immune system, such as those being treated for cancer. Listeria can harm a fetus even if the mother has mild symptoms. About one in four pregnant women who get listeriosis will miscarry or lose their baby shortly after birth. What to know about food recalls When a number of people get sick from eating or drinking the same contaminated food, it's defined as a food-borne disease outbreak. This can lead to a food recall by the U.S. government. If a food in your home matches the details on a food recall notice, don't open or consume the product. Instead, bring the product to the place where you bought it for a refund, or dispose of it to make sure no one will consume it. FoodSafety.gov, a U.S. government website, maintains a current list of food recalls and food-borne disease outbreaks, and advises what to do with a recalled product. Treating food poisoning caused by Listeria Most people with intestinal symptoms of listeriosis, such as vomiting and diarrhea, recover within a couple of days with rest and fluids. Women who are pregnant will be prescribed an antibiotic to treat listeriosis. Antibiotics are also prescribed to people who are very ill or who are at risk of becoming very ill with an invasive Listeria infection.",9,0.1063804,0.12882002
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-probiotics-help-calm-inflammatory-bowel-disease-202411133081,Can probiotics help calm inflammatory bowel disease?,1,"Approximately three million Americans have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is an umbrella term for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, illnesses marked by chronic or repeated bouts of inflammation in the digestive tract. Both types of IBD represent a complex interplay of genes, environment, and immune factors. Current therapies for IBD suppress the immune system to reduce inflammation. But emerging research on the human microbiome may help scientists better understand and manage IBD. And some preliminary studies on cells, animals, and humans have investigated whether probiotics — which are sometimes called ""good"" bacteria — are beneficial for people with IBD. The healthy microbiome: Building a barrier The human intestinal microbiome is the vast community of trillions of helpful and harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms that inhabit our gut. Ideally, the lining of the gut acts as a barrier that prevents harmful bacteria and toxins from entering the bloodstream. A healthy microbiome helps this lining block out harmful bacteria while enabling it to absorb nutrients. Beneficial bacteria in the microbiome promote a healthy, hospitable gut environment that limits inflammation and helps crowd out harmful bacteria. Recent studies on human cells and in mice suggest that a healthy microbiome produces substances that nourish cells lining the colon, so that they form a tight barrier difficult for harmful bacteria to penetrate interact with immune cells in the gut, reducing inflammation prompt the gut lining to make mucus that acts as an additional barrier to harmful bacteria. In animal studies, a healthy microbiome is essential to help build and maintain an effective barrier. Animals raised in the laboratory without a microbiome, or whose microbiome has been depleted by antibiotics, have intestinal linings that are easily damaged. An unbalanced microbiome: Inflammation and damage What happens if the microbiome doesn't have a good balance of helpful and harmful bacteria? The gut lining may become increasingly permeable. That may allow potentially harmful bacteria and their toxins to cross into the intestinal tissue and then into the bloodstream, triggering inflammation that can damage the gut. An imbalanced microbiome is known as dysbiosis. And the inflammatory cascade linked to dysbiosis is a hallmark of IBD. Probiotics: More promise than evidence Probiotics — live microorganisms in supplements or in fermented foods like kombucha, kefir, yogurt, and sauerkraut — have been proposed as therapies for IBD. The idea is that by eating beneficial bacteria we can restore and maintain a balanced microbiome, reduce inflammation, and improve the gut barrier. But what does the evidence say? Thus far, no probiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for IBD. Small randomized studies have compared specific probiotics with standard immunosuppressive therapies for IBD. The studies measured IBD symptoms, remission rates, or quality of life. Results were mixed at best: Ulcerative colitis. Some studies suggest that certain bacterial strains, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, are somewhat effective for ulcerative colitis, reducing symptoms, promoting remission, and improving quality of life. But these effects are modest compared to standard therapies, and probiotics have not shown enough benefit to be accepted in medical practice. Pouchitis. Some people with IBD may need surgery to remove the colon (large intestine). This can lead to inflammation in the remaining small intestine, which gets formed into a J-shaped pouch and attached to the anus. However, 25% to 45% of people who have a J-pouch later experience inflammation known as pouchitis. Several studies show that combining standard medication with a probiotic mix called VSL#3 effectively quells the symptoms and inflammation of pouchitis. VSL#3 contains eight strains of bacteria. It is used to treat chronic pouchitis, which is the only accepted use of probiotics in common practice for IBD. Crohn's disease. Probiotics have not been studied as rigorously in Crohn's disease as in ulcerative colitis. Most of the limited set of studies found that probiotics are no better than placebo in reducing symptoms or promoting remission. Diet, fiber, and prebiotics: A role in IBD? The makeup and activity of our microbiomes can be altered by diet. That's true even if the foods you consume aren't well-known probiotic stars like kombucha, yogurt, kefir, and other fermented foods. Gut bacteria that break down dietary fiber are a cornerstone of a healthy microbiome. A high-fiber diet can boost the number of these bacteria, as well as their beneficial and anti-inflammatory effects. Food ingredients that are not absorbed by the gut but are instead consumed by the gut microbiome are called prebiotics. We have limited — though promising — evidence supporting prebiotics for people with IBD. Currently, no specific prebiotic food or supplement is recommended for general use. However, the Mediterranean diet, which encourages fiber-rich vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, may modestly reduce symptoms and markers of inflammation in IBD. While these effects are small and inconsistent, the Mediterranean diet improves overall health in people with or without IBD. Largely for this reason, the American Gastroenterology Association recommends it for people who have IBD. The bottom line Probiotics, and possibly even prebiotics, hold promise. But we don't yet know how to harness their full potential for treating IBD. While current evidence suggests probiotics may one day be an effective way to help treat IBD, the complexity of the microbiome means that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work. Many questions remain: Which strains of bacteria in the gut should we study? How do we determine the best cocktail of probiotics to reap maximum benefit? Given that everyone's microbiome is different, is a personalized approach to probiotics the right strategy? How can we define ideal dosage and formulation of probiotics? Delivery method (capsules, powders, foods), dosage, and duration of treatment all require more research. Until these questions are answered, probiotics and prebiotics remain complementary strategies in treating IBD alongside standard immunosuppressive therapies.",0,0.21581677,0.10966168
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/digestive-enzymes-how-supplements-like-lactaid-and-beano-can-help-with-digestion,Digestive enzymes: How supplements like Lactaid and Beano can help with digestion,1,"If you're struggling with bloating or discomfort after consuming dairy, beans, or certain vegetables, digestive enzyme supplements might be what your body needs to process these tricky foods. What are digestive enzyme supplements? There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes during digestion. As food makes its way through your gastrointestinal (GI) tract, your digestive organs break it down into smaller parts, in part by using digestive juices. Digestive juices contain enzymes that break down food into smaller components of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. There are different enzymes for different components; for example, the enzyme amylase breaks down carbohydrates, the enzyme protease breaks down proteins, and the enzyme lipase breaks down fats. Your pancreas, stomach, and small intestine naturally produce these enzymes. However, sometimes the body doesn't produce enough enzymes. This can slow down digestion and lead to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and gas. Sometimes people can't make enough digestive enzymes because of a health condition like chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. In these cases, a doctor will prescribe enzyme pills to substitute for the lack of natural enzyme production. However, in cases of lactose intolerance or difficulty digesting complex carbohydrates found in beans and certain gas-producing vegetables, over-the-counter (OTC) digestive enzyme supplements may be enough improve digestion and provide relief from discomfort. How do supplements like Lactaid and Beano work? Lactaid and Beano are two popular digestive enzyme supplements that can help people digest specific foods more easily. Both supplements target specific digestive issues by providing enzymes the body may not naturally produce in sufficient quantities. And both are available without a prescription. Lactaid dietary supplements contain lactase, an enzyme that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. People who are lactose intolerant lack sufficient lactase, leading to symptoms like gas, bloating, and diarrhea after consuming dairy. Lactaid dietary supplements can be used every time you eat foods that contain dairy. But many people find that they can digest certain forms of dairy (like hard cheeses) more easily than other forms (like milk or ice cream). A little experimentation can help you figure out when you need an assist from an enzyme supplement. Beano contains alpha-galactosidase, an enzyme that helps break down a type of non-absorbable fiber found in beans, root vegetables, and some dairy products. These foods can be difficult for the body to digest, and may cause gas and bloating. Beano breaks down the non-absorbable fiber before it reaches the intestines, where it would otherwise ferment and produce gas. Taking Beano before meals can help prevent gas-related symptoms like flatulence, abdominal cramping, and bloating. Beano is taken in tablet form right before eating or with your first bite. Who can benefit from digestive enzyme supplements? Digestive enzyme supplements can benefit people who struggle to digest certain foods due to low levels of the enzymes that process those foods. For example, individuals with lactose intolerance (which affects up to 75% of the world's population) may benefit from lactase supplements like Lactaid. Similarly, more than 20% of the population experiences abdominal pain caused by intestinal gas resulting from difficulty digesting complex carbohydrates in beans and certain vegetables. They may find relief from supplements like Beano. While the evidence is still unsettled, some people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may find digestive enzymes helpful for managing their symptoms. Are digestive enzyme supplements safe? Digestive enzyme supplements are generally safe for most people, but there are a few important considerations. For example, Beano may cause allergic reactions in people with alpha-gal syndrome or mold allergies. Those with galactosemia, a metabolic disorder that causes an inability to metabolize the sugar galactose, should consult their doctor before using Beano. Pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children should check with their doctor before using a lactase product like Lactaid. Finally, as is the case with all OTC supplements, digestive enzyme supplements are not regulated by the FDA. As a result, the quality and content of these products can vary. This means you can't always be sure about the ingredients or enzyme concentration in these supplements. Prescription enzyme medications, on the other hand, are tightly regulated.",9,0.41309845,0.16911834
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/celiac-disease-exploring-four-myths-202411063079,Celiac disease: Exploring four myths,1,"Celiac disease is a digestive and immune disorder that can keep the body from absorbing necessary nutrients. ""Our conception and awareness of celiac disease has evolved over the past few decades, but there are still aspects that remain poorly understood,"" says Dr. Ciaran Kelly, medical director of the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Perhaps not surprisingly, misconceptions are widespread among the general public. One example? Many people assume that everyone who has celiac disease is plagued by abdominal pain, bloating, or diarrhea. But actually, many adults newly diagnosed with this inherited gluten intolerance don't have these symptoms. What's more, gluten — the sticky protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye — can cause gastrointestinal distress and other symptoms in people who don't have celiac disease. Read on for a deeper dive into four myths and facts about celiac disease and related digestive conditions. Myth # 1: Celiac disease is usually diagnosed at a young age Not typically. While celiac disease can develop any time after a baby's first exposure to gluten, it's usually diagnosed much later in life. According to the National Celiac Association, the average age of diagnosis is between 46 and 56. Around 25% of people are diagnosed after age 60. Celiac disease is slightly more common in women and among people with other autoimmune conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (a common cause of low thyroid levels), and dermatitis herpetiformis (a rare condition marked by an itchy, blistering rash). ""We don't know why some people go from being susceptible to actually having celiac disease,"" says Dr. Kelly. The prevailing theory is that some sort of physical or emotional stress — such as a viral infection, surgery, or anxiety from a stressful life event — may ""flip the switch"" and cause the disease to appear, he says. ""Increasing numbers of people are being diagnosed at midlife and older, often after they're found to have conditions such as anemia or osteoporosis caused by nutrient deficiencies,"" says Dr. Kelly. Myth #2: Celiac disease only affects the gut When people have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune system attack that can ravage the lining of the small intestine. A healthy small intestine is lined with fingerlike projections, called villi, that absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the immune system attacks the villi, causing them to flatten and become inflamed — and thus unable to adequately absorb nutrients. While gastrointestinal problems can occur, they aren't always present. In fact, celiac disease can present with many different symptoms that affect the nervous, endocrine, and skeletal systems. A few examples are brain fog, changes in menstrual periods, or muscle and joint pain. Myth # 3: Celiac disease versus gluten intolerance If you feel sick after eating gluten, you probably have celiac disease, right? Actually, that may not be true. Some people have non-celiac gluten sensitivity (also called gluten intolerance), which can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms after eating gluten. But gluten intolerance differs from celiac disease. Celiac disease is diagnosed with blood tests that look for specific antibodies. If antibodies are present, a definitive diagnosis requires an intestinal biopsy to look for signs of damage that characterize the condition. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not trigger antibodies or cause intestinal damage. Yet some people with this problem say they also experience brain fog, trouble concentrating, muscle aches and pain, and fatigue after eating gluten-containing foods. ""Non-celiac gluten sensitivity appears to be a real phenomenon, but it's not well defined,"" says Dr. Kelly. It's unclear whether people experiencing it are intolerant to gluten or to something else in gluten-containing foods. One possibility is sugarlike molecules known as FODMAPs, which are found in many foods — including wheat. Short for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, gas and bloating can occur when gut bacteria feed on FODMAPs. Another possibility is an allergy to wheat, which can cause symptoms such as swelling, itching, or irritation of the mouth and throat after eating wheat. Other symptoms include a skin rash, stuffy nose, and headache, as well as cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Some people may develop a life-threating allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. Myth #4: A gluten-free diet always relieves the symptoms and signs of celiac disease The sole treatment for celiac disease — adopting a diet that avoids all gluten-containing foods — doesn't always help. This problem is known as nonresponsive celiac disease. ""About 20% of people with celiac disease have ongoing symptoms, despite their best efforts to stick to a gluten-free diet,"" says Dr. Kelly. Others have intermittent signs and symptoms, particularly when they are accidentally exposed to gluten. Accidental exposures often happen when people eat prepared or restaurant foods that claim to be gluten-free but are not. Cross contamination with gluten-containing foods is another potential route. Potential solutions to nonresponsive celiac disease are being studied. Three promising approaches are: Enzymes that break down gluten, which people could take alongside gluten-containing foods. ""It's a similar concept to the lactase pills taken by people who are lactose intolerant to help them digest dairy products,"" says Dr. Kelly. Dampening the immune response to gluten by inhibiting an enzyme called tissue transglutaminase that makes gluten more potent as an antigen. Reprogramming the immune response to prevent the body from reacting to gluten.",9,0.23181741,0.014791352

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-13-emails-nytimes-mask-promoting-activist-manipulated-cochrane-review.html,"Emails reveal New York Times mask-promoting activist manipulated and misrepresented the Cochrane Review, which originally found masks useless",0,"Journalist Paul D. Thacker recently exposed corruption at the New York Times . An activist named Zeynep Tufekci misrepresented scientific findings on masks by the Cochrane Review , a prestigious medical journal, Thacker reveals. The investigation is based on hundreds of emails obtained through Freedom of Information requests and leaks from within Cochrane itself. According to internal emails from Cochrane, the New York Times mask propagandist and social media influencer -- Zeynep Tufekci -- pressured Cochrane to publicly criticize its own review showing that masks fail to stop respiratory viruses. This investigation raises significant concerns about the intersection of social media influence and scientific integrity. Thacker’s UnHerd article, titled "" How the NYT Undermined Mask Evidence: Leaked Emails Reveal How Scientists Were Smeared ,"" uncovers a troubling pattern of interference involving Tufekci, Cochrane and the broader scientific community. NYT mask propagandists exposed, manipulating scientific findings and twisting approver’s words In March 2023, Tufekci published an essay asserting that masks are effective against respiratory viruses, while attacking a mask use review by Cochrane. This came in the wake of Cochrane’s February 2023 review on masks , which found scant evidence supporting the efficacy of masks in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. The review, considered the gold standard in medical evidence, has been consistently critical of masks in prior editions dating back to 2007. However, Tufekci pressured the publisher into an interview, where she twisted the words of those involved with the review and approval process, while misrepresenting their findings. Outside observers picked apart Tufekci’s New York Times op-ed, noting a disconnect between her claims and the established scientific consensus. Tufekci contacted Cochrane’s Michael Brown, who was involved in the review’s approval process, shortly after the publication of a New York Times op-ed critical of mask mandates. The emails suggest that Tufekci misrepresented Brown’s views , citing him as supportive of her arguments while ignoring his actual stance on the review. The emails indicate that Tufekci not only sought to discredit the Cochrane review but also manipulated scientific opinions to bolster her mask mandate narrative. For instance, Brown’s comments were twisted to imply a stronger endorsement of mask efficacy than what he actually provided. Additionally, Tufekci’s communications with Cochrane’s Karla Soares-Weiser, who oversees the review, led to a rushed statement from Soares-Weiser promising revisions to the review — a move that Brown and other scientists argue was driven by media pressure rather than scientific evidence. The situation escalated when Soares-Weiser’s statement about correcting the review was later retracted, as it became clear that no substantive changes would be made. As Thacker points out, Tufekci’s pressure and influence contributed to a public relations crisis rather than a genuine scientific re-assessment. This controversy highlights a broader issue of how major news publications and influential voices on social media can impact scientific discourse and public health policy. This investigation highlights how opinion-driven journalism shapes scientific debates , disregarding evidence-based analysis, manipulating public discourse and behavior. Tufekci’s rise to fame was generated by social media hysteria and corporate media pressure Masks were first used by physicians nearly a hundred years ago, but they were used to stop the spread of bacteria during surgery. Bacteria are hundreds of times larger than viruses and can be blocked by masks. However, respiratory viruses are ubiquitous in nature and readily spread through masks. The World Health Organization, prior to their complicity in spreading propaganda during the COVID-19 scandal, ruled in 2019, as part of their "" pandemic preparedness plan "" There have been a number of high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating that personal protective measures such as hand hygiene and face masks have, at best, a small effect on influenza transmission. The researchers who worked on the Cochrane review originally agreed that masks were useless against COVID-19 . However, science, reality, common sense, personal autonomy, medical prudence and human rights have not mattered since 2020 -- when hysteria, propaganda, totalitarianism and corruption merged into a new orthodoxy. Masks are nothing but a sign of compliance to this belief system of hysteria, fraud and abuse. Tufekci’s rise to mask mandate fame occurred in March 2020, when a New York Times media reporter promoted Tufekci’s opinion piece, which generated a tweetstorm and pressured the CDC to alter their federal guidance, mandating people to mask up. In the end, national policy supporting useless medical mandates was established by tweets and a hysterical essay, without any input from scientists or a medical review process. The ensuring mask mandates went on to harm schoolchildren and would lead to abuse and mass harm to people’s immune systems, with no evidence that they prevented a single respiratory illness. Anyone who refused to comply with the insanity was accused of ""spreading covid"" and ""misinformation."" The people who rightfully fought for medical freedom and sanity faced intimidation throughout society and sometimes were segregated from society and wrongfully detained. But those who opposed the mask mandates and stood up for body autonomy were always in the right, and the science is there to prove what was obvious from the start.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cant-shake-that-cough,Can't shake that cough?,1,"Dry. Hacking. Loose. Deep. Phlegmy. Barking. Chesty. A cough can sound like any of these descriptors — often more than one at the same time — and these characteristics can sometimes point toward its cause. Now add another: lingering. What does that tell us? Not as much as we might hope, a Harvard expert says. A natural reflex that helps keep our airways clear, the average cough — typically due to a cold or another respiratory virus — lasts three weeks or less, says Dr. Jessica McCannon, a pulmonary critical care specialist with Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham. When a cough endures for eight weeks or more, it's considered chronic. Only rarely is this dangerous, but it certainly can be mystifying. ""When people come to a lung doctor for a chronic cough, they usually hope that at the end of the first visit they'll leave with an answer and some medication and will quickly feel better,"" Dr. McCannon says. ""But of all the things we care for, it's one of the most difficult. And if we don't talk about that up front, I think people will have ongoing frustration and disappointment."" Many possible culprits Indeed, be prepared for a detective hunt. Many chronic coughs have more than one contributor, so doctors don't just look to the airway or lungs to unearth the cause. ""Often we're thinking top to bottom — about the sinuses, swallow function, and esophagus and stomach in addition to the airways and lungs themselves,"" Dr. McCannon says. More than a dozen conditions or situations can explain a lingering cough, including sinus problems, such as sinusitis bronchitis seasonal allergies gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) side effects from medications, such as ACE inhibitors to treat high blood pressure. But only a handful of chronic cough triggers are serious, such as asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) interstitial lung disease, a progressive condition involving coughing and breathlessness chronic lung infections bronchiectasis, chronic inflammation of the tubes leading to the lungs lung cancer. Occasionally, chronic coughs arise from ""very weird causes"" such as impacted earwax, Dr. McCannon points out. And sometimes the culprit is all too clear: smoking — whether tobacco, marijuana, or vaping. ""Basically, anything going into the lungs that shouldn't be there will potentially cause a cough."" Seeking a diagnosis It's reasonable to try over-the-counter medications to quell your cough. The choice depends on the apparent cause of the cough, so you might take cough suppressants, antihistamines if you think it may be allergies, or antacids for acid reflux as a possibility. But if they don't make a dent, Dr. McCannon says, it's time to see a health care professional. ""Tell your doctor what's worked and what hasn't. That can give us some clues,"" she says. Certain red flags make a doctor's visit more pressing. Schedule an appointment (or a follow-up) if your lingering cough doesn't resolve after treatment with antibiotics or if you also experience breathlessness; wheezing; chest pain, pressure, or tightness; blood in your sputum; weight loss; or fatigue. ""A lingering cough with any of those things should lead you to seek care soon,"" Dr. McCannon says. Getting to the bottom of things will likely involve a physical exam, x-rays, or lung function testing. Your doctor may order CT imaging as well, ""although that's certainly not necessary at the threshold of three months unless there are other warning signs,"" she says. To make your doctor's visit more fruitful, Dr. McCannon suggests one important strategy: track your cough. ""Note its patterns. What circumstances bring it on? Is it productive or dry? Is it worse after meals, or when you're lying down? Does it intrude on sleep?"" she asks. ""Paying attention to the circumstances in which you notice it can provide us with some really helpful clues."" Image: © JGalione/Getty Images",9,-0.03448238,-0.29058442
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/midlife-adhd-coping-strategies-that-can-help-202102052381,Midlife ADHD? Coping strategies that can help,1,"Trouble staying focused and paying attention are two familiar symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common health issue among children and teens. When ADHD persists through early adulthood and on into middle age, it presents many of the same challenges it does in childhood: it's hard to stay organized, start projects, stay on task, and meet deadlines. But now life is busier, and often expectations from work and family are even higher. Fortunately, there are lots of strategies that can help you navigate this time in your life. Staying organized Organizational tools are a must for people with adult ADHD. They'll help you prioritize and track activities for each day or the coming weeks. Pick the right tools. Tools can include a pen and paper to make lists, or computer or smartphone apps to set appointment reminders, highlight important days on the calendar, mark deadlines, and keep lists and other information handy. Schedule updates. Set aside time each day to update your lists and schedules. Don't let the task become a chore in itself; think of it like a routine task such as brushing your teeth, and do it daily so it becomes an established habit. Set a timer. And a word of caution: smartphones and computers can also turn into a distraction. If you have adult ADHD, you may find yourself spending hours looking at less useful apps or sites. If that's a frequent trap for you, set a timer for each use or keep the phone off or in another room when you are trying to work. Staying focused Just being organized doesn't mean your work will get done. But a few simple approaches can at least make it easier to do the work. Declutter your home and office. Give yourself an appealing work environment and keep important items easily accessible. Reduce distractions. This could mean changing your workstation so it doesn't face a window, moving to a quieter space, or just silencing your smartphone and email alerts. Jot down ideas as they come to you. You may have an ""aha"" moment for one task while you're in the middle of another. That's okay; just write down that thought and get back to it later, after your more pressing work is finished. Meeting deadlines Deadlines pose two big challenges when you have adult ADHD. First, it's hard to start a project, often because you want it to be perfect, or you're intimidated by it so you put it off. Second, when you do start a project, it's very easy to become distracted and leave the task unfinished. How can you avoid these traps? Put off procrastinating. Put procrastination on your to-do list — like a chore — and fool yourself into actually starting your work. Deal with emails, phone calls, or other matters as soon as you can. That way there will be fewer things hanging over your head and overwhelming you later on. Be a clock watcher. Get a watch and get in the habit of using it. The more aware you are of time, the more likely you'll be able to avoid spending too long on a task. Take one thing at a time. Multitasking is overrated for everyone — and it's a nightmare for people with adult ADHD. Focus on completing one task, then move on to the next. Be realistic about your time. This can mean having to say no to new projects or other commitments. Get more help The ideas listed here can help you start coping with adult ADHD, but they may not be enough to help you overcome adult ADHD's challenges.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/narcolepsy-a-to-z,Narcolepsy,1,"What is narcolepsy? Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep. These episodes can occur often and at inappropriate times, for example while a person is talking, eating, or driving. Although sleep episodes can happen at any time, they may be more frequent during periods of inactivity or monotonous, repetitive activity. Narcolepsy usually appears between ages 15 and 30, but the condition can appear earlier or later. Once it appears, narcolepsy is present for life. Men and women are affected equally. About 50% of people with diagnosed narcolepsy have the combination of marked daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of muscle weakness (called cataplexy). The muscle weakness can be so severe that a person with narcolepsy will collapse to the floor, but not become unconscious. This type of narcolepsy is associated with a shortage of a brain-stimulating protein called orexin (also known as hypocretin). The cause of other types of narcolepsy is unknown. A genetic (inherited) predisposition appears to play a role. People with narcolepsy don't require extra hours of sleep, but they do need daytime naps because they have difficulty staying awake for long periods. During the night, healthy people normally progress through several stages of sleep before entering or leaving the state of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM). During REM sleep, your brain waves resemble those of an awake person, visual dreams occur, and muscle tone is slack. In narcolepsy, the brain-wave pattern can skip some or all of the other sleep stages, causing the person to move from the awake state immediately to REM sleep, or to awaken directly from the REM sleep stage. Symptoms of narcolepsy The earliest symptom of narcolepsy is usually daytime sleepiness, which may be extreme. However, it may take years to recognize the disorder because other, more common causes of daytime sleepiness often are blamed for the symptoms. Narcolepsy has four main symptoms. It is common for people with narcolepsy to have more than one symptom, but it is rare for a person with the disease to experience all four: Excessive daytime sleepiness — This is always present and is usually the most prominent symptom. Cataplexy — This is the sudden, temporary loss of muscle tone, which causes paralysis of the head or body while the person remains conscious. It can last a few seconds or several minutes. Mild attacks can cause slurred or stuttering speech, drooping eyelids or hand weakness that causes the person to drop objects. Severe attacks can cause the knees to buckle, leading to collapse. Typically, cataplexy is brought on by laughter, excitement or anger. The sudden relaxing of muscle tone is probably the result of the brain abruptly entering REM sleep. Sleep paralysis — This is the temporary inability to move while falling asleep or awakening. It lasts no more than several minutes. Like cataplexy, sleep paralysis probably is related to insufficient separation between REM sleep and the awake state. Hypnagogic hallucinations — These are dreamlike images that are seen during the awake state instead of during sleep. These often-frightening visions are seen just as the person is falling asleep or waking up. They tend to occur in people who also have sleep paralysis. Symptoms usually begin during adolescence or young adulthood. People with narcolepsy complain of fatigue, experience impaired performance at work and school, and may have difficulty in social relationships. Excessive daytime sleepiness can be disabling and may greatly diminish a person's quality of life. Memory lapses and visual disturbances may be particularly upsetting. More than 50% of people with narcolepsy experience periods of memory lapse or blackouts caused by very short periods of sleep called microsleeps. Microsleeps are not unique to people with narcolepsy, and they can be experienced by anyone who is severely sleep deprived. They are periods of sleep that last only a few seconds, and usually are not noticed. During such episodes, a person may get lost while walking or driving, write or speak nonsense, misplace objects, or bump into things. Later in the course of narcolepsy, a person also can develop insomnia (difficulty sleeping) during normal sleeping hours. Diagnosing narcolepsy To diagnose narcolepsy, your doctor will ask you about your history of typical episodes and will have you undergo an overnight sleep study. The sleep study checks for other explanations that could account for daytime sleepiness, such as sleep apnea or other causes of sleep interruptions. The sleep test measures brain waves, eye movements, muscle activity, heartbeat, blood oxygen levels, and breathing. A specific study called a multiple sleep latency test is a necessary part of the evaluation for narcolepsy. This test must be done after the person has had an adequate night's sleep. A multiple sleep latency test consists of four 20-minute opportunities to nap, which are offered every two hours throughout the day. Patients with narcolepsy fall asleep in approximately five minutes or less, and move into REM sleep during at least two of the four naps. Normal, well-rested sleepers take about 12 to 14 minutes to fall asleep for a daytime nap, and don't fall directly into REM sleep. Expected duration of narcolepsy Narcolepsy cannot be cured and does not go away. In most cases, symptoms can be diminished with medications, regularly scheduled naps, and good sleep habits. Preventing narcolepsy There is no way to prevent narcolepsy. For people who have the condition, avoiding conditions that bring on narcolepsy episodes may help to reduce their frequency. If you have narcolepsy and your symptoms are not controlled with medicines, you should never smoke because you could fall asleep with a lit cigarette, and you should never drive. Treating narcolepsy The main symptom of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, can be partially relieved with medications that stimulate the central nervous system. Doctors often prescribe a trial of modafinil (Provigil) first. Other potential choices include armodafinil (Nuvigil), pitolisant (Wakix), or solriamfetol (Sunosi). regularly scheduled time for exercise and short naps during the day also helps reduce daytime sleepiness. Cataplexy and sleep paralysis can be treated with a variety of medicines that can make you more resistant to entering REM sleep. Most of these medicines were developed for use as antidepressants. Examples of potentially effective medications include venlafaxine (Effexor), fluoxetine (Prozac), and protriptyline (Vivactil). Cataplexy also can be treated with sodium oxybate (also called gamma hydroxybutyrate or Xyrem), although the use of this drug is tightly controlled because it has been abused recreationally. For reasons that are not well understood, a low dose of this medicine reduces cataplexy attacks and improves daytime sleepiness in people who have narcolepsy with cataplexy, even though the drug causes sedation in most people without narcolepsy. Psychological counseling may be important for difficulties associated with self-esteem and for emotional support, especially since people with narcolepsy have difficulty doing tasks that require concentration, and may be regarded as unmotivated by family and peers. When to call a professional Call a doctor if you are excessively sleepy during the day. You should be evaluated as quickly as possible if episodes occur while you are driving a car or operating machinery. Prognosis People with narcolepsy have a significantly higher risk of death or serious injury resulting from motor vehicle or job-related accidents, and they must take care to avoid situations where such accidents might occur.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/giardiasis-a-to-z,Giardiasis,1,"What is giardiasis? Giardiasis is an intestinal illness caused by infection with the parasite Giardia lamblia, which lives in contaminated water. Although the illness most often occurs in developing countries, giardiasis is also a common cause of waterborne illness in the United States. A person can remain infected with Giardia until the infection is diagnosed and treated. In developing areas of the world, it is common for more than 20% of a country's population to have ongoing Giardia infection. In the United States, only one or two out of every 10,000 people have Giardia in a typical year, but the infection is found in about one out of three people who have prolonged diarrhea symptoms if they have recently traveled to a developing country. As one part of their life cycle, G. lamblia parasites change into cysts. Contagious cysts are found in the feces of infected people or animals. You can become infected with G. lamblia by: drinking water that has been contaminated with Giardia cysts (usually because the water has come into contact with sewage) eating uncooked fruits or vegetables that have been washed in contaminated water eating uncooked fruits or vegetables from a garden where contaminated fertilizer has been used touching feces, diapers, or objects soiled with feces, then failing to adequately wash your hands having direct contact with an infected person or animal, then failing to adequately wash your hands. G. lamblia can survive in cold, chlorinated water for up to two months, and outbreaks have occurred in municipal water supplies. People at greatest risk of giardiasis include: children in day care centers and their families day care workers travelers to developing countries campers who drink unprocessed water homosexual men (because of anal sex). Children are three times more likely to develop giardiasis than adults. It is possible that the human body develops some immunity to the parasite over time. Symptoms of giardiasis Up to two-thirds of people infected with the organism do not have any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can appear suddenly and be obvious or they may worsen slowly. Typically, symptoms start one to three weeks after exposure and include: watery diarrhea abdominal cramping bloating nausea with or without vomiting gas floating or unusually smelly stools weight loss new intolerance to milk and dairy foods in your diet low-grade fever loss of appetite. Some of the symptoms can take several months or more to begin because they are caused by gradual changes in the lining of your intestine. G. lamblia interferes with the body's ability to absorb fats, so your stools may have more fat in them during a Giardia infection. This is why your stools may float and smell foul. Diagnosing giardiasis Your doctor will ask you about your travel history, whether you might have had contact with contaminated water during camping or hiking, and whether your home has well water. If the patient is a child who attends day care, the doctor will ask about any recent outbreaks of diarrhea at the day care center. He or she also will review the patient's symptoms. The diagnosis is made by testing the stool for Giardia antigen, a protein that is made by G. lamblia parasites, or by identifying G. lamblia cysts or parasites in stool samples. Multiple stool samples may need to be collected since the infection can only be detected in a portion of collected stool samples, even if infection is present. Infrequently, diagnosis may require an inspection of the intestine with a procedure called endoscopy. In this procedure, an instrument called an endoscope is inserted through your mouth into your intestine. An endoscope is a narrow, flexible, cord-shaped instrument that is equipped with a camera. If necessary, your doctor can use the endoscope to take a small piece of tissue from your small intestine (a biopsy) to be examined in a laboratory. Expected duration of giardiasis The worst symptoms of giardiasis typically last for five to seven days, as long as diagnosis and treatment is not delayed. Symptoms can take as long as several months to completely go away after treatment because the intestine needs to repair itself. It is common to be intolerant to milk and other dairy products that contain lactose for the first few months after a Giardia infection. In some people who are not treated, the infection can cause repeated bouts of abdominal pain and diarrhea for a year or longer. Preventing giardiasis There is no vaccine that can prevent giardiasis. Medicine to prevent infection is not recommended. The best way to prevent infection is good travel habits and good sanitation. Travelers should take special care to avoid food and water that could be contaminated. It is safest to eat produce that has been peeled or cooked. Cooking kills Giardia parasites and cysts. To prevent giardiasis caused by contaminated water, drink water only from approved sources. When camping and when traveling to developing countries, drink bottled water or other beverages that have been bottled or canned. Campers can drink bottled water, treat water with iodine for eight or more hours, use a high-quality water filter or boil water for at least one minute. Travelers to developing countries should avoid drinking beverages that are served with ice. It is always a good habit to wash your hands frequently. This can reduce your risk of Giardia infection at home and while traveling. It is especially important to wash your hands after you use the bathroom, before you eat, after you change a diaper and after you care for a sick person or animal. Treating giardiasis If you don't receive treatment for a Giardia infection, you will probably eventually recover on your own. However, treatment is a good idea for anyone who is having symptoms. Treatment can also help if you don't have symptoms because treatment can prevent the spread of infection to others. This is especially true for children and for people who prepare or serve food. Commonly prescribed medications used to treat Giardia infection include tinidazole (Tindamax), nitazoxanide (Alinia), and metronidazole (Flagyl). A doctor should examine and consider treatment for sexual partners and people who have had close contact with the infected person, such as household members, even if they have no symptoms. Pregnant women generally are not treated with medications during the first trimester. If you have giardiasis, be sure to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Over-the-counter medications for diarrhea, such as loperamide (Imodium), may help your symptoms. Wash your hands frequently if you have giardiasis or if you are caring for a person or animal with this infection. When to call a professional See your doctor if you get diarrhea, especially if this diarrhea lasts for longer than several days, produces stools that float and smell foul, or if you also have abdominal cramps, bloating and fever. Prognosis In otherwise healthy people, giardiasis generally goes away completely within weeks, with or without treatment. In some cases, Giardia can be a long-term problem if it is not treated.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs-a-to-z,Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),1,"What is IBS? Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that causes a variety of symptoms, including: abdominal pain diarrhea and/or constipation bloating gassiness cramping. The severity of the disorder varies from person to person. Some people experience symptoms that come and go and are just mildly annoying. Others have such severe daily bowel problems that IBS affects their ability to work, sleep, and enjoy life. In addition, symptoms may change over time. A person may have severe symptoms for several weeks and then feel well for months or even years. Most people are never cured of IBS. However, the disorder is not related to any other disease. It does not develop into colitis. People with IBS do not have an increased risk of colon cancer. IBS usually starts in early adulthood. It affects twice as many women as men. Approximately 10% to 20% of the population has IBS, but half of all people with the condition never seek medical care for their symptoms. No one knows what causes IBS. Some studies suggest that the nerves of the colon may be much more sensitive than usual in people with IBS. The normal movement of food and gas through the colon causes pain, intestinal spasms, and an irregular pattern of bowel movements. Stress does not cause IBS, but stress can increase the frequency and severity of symptoms. IBS has been called irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis, and functional bowel disease. Symptoms of IBS People with IBS may have some or all of these symptoms: mild or severe abdominal pain, discomfort, or cramping that usually goes away after a bowel movement periods of diarrhea or constipation, or alternating between these two symptoms bloating, gassiness, or a feeling of having a distended abdomen mucus in bowel movements feeling as though a bowel movement is incomplete. Although the symptoms of IBS often change over time, people tend to develop their own pattern. For example, some people have mostly diarrhea, some have mostly constipation, and others have abdominal pain without a major change in bowel movements. Diagnosing IBS There is no test for IBS. Your doctor will diagnose IBS if you have the typical symptoms and have been tested for other disorders that can cause similar symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. Your doctor will examine you, testing your abdomen for tenderness and feeling to determine whether internal organs are larger than normal. The doctor will check for fever or weight loss. If you have any of these signs, you likely have something other than IBS. Depending on your medical history, your doctor may do tests to eliminate other diseases that may cause similar symptoms. These tests might include: blood tests stool sample, to check for blood or evidence of infection sigmoidoscopy, in which a flexible, lighted tube with a tiny camera on the end is inserted into the rectum and up the left side of the colon colonoscopy, in which a longer tube examines the entire colon. Your doctor may suggest that you stop eating or drinking certain foods for up to three weeks to determine if your diet is contributing to your symptoms. For example, your doctor may ask you to eliminate milk products if he or she suspects lactose intolerance. Expected duration of IBS IBS symptoms may be a daily problem throughout a person's life. Symptoms may come and go, lasting a day, a week, or a month before disappearing. Dietary changes with or without medication may help to reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms. Preventing IBS Because no one knows what causes IBS, it is impossible to prevent the disorder. Once diagnosed with IBS, a person may be able to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms by reducing stress or changing the diet. Treating IBS Changing your diet may improve symptoms dramatically. It often takes a long time to discover what works well for you, and you may need to alter your original program if symptoms flare. Keep track of the different foods you eat throughout the day. See which foods seem to make your symptoms worse. After you discover your particular trigger foods, eliminate them from your diet. Some common IBS trigger foods include: cabbage, broccoli, kale, legumes, and other gas-producing foods caffeine alcohol dairy products fatty foods, including whole milk, cream, cheese, butter, oils, meats, and avocados raw fruits foods, gums, and beverages that contain sorbitol, an artificial sweetener. The way you eat may help to create IBS symptoms. Eating large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often may help some people with IBS. Eating quickly can cause you to swallow air, which can cause belching or gas. Adding fiber to your diet, especially if constipation is one of your main symptoms, often helps to regulate your bowel movements and reduce abdominal discomfort. At first, fiber will increase the amount of gas in your system, so add fiber gradually. Over time, the body adjusts to the effects of fiber and the gassiness will decrease. Fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain breads and cereals are good food sources of fiber. Your doctor may recommend a fiber supplement. Some experts believe that the fiber methylcellulose creates the least amount of gas, and brands of this fiber are often recommended for people with IBS. Psyllium is also a good source of fiber. A low-FODMAP diet helps relieve symptoms for many people with IBS. You need to review a list of foods that have a high amount of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, and reduce their intake. If your symptoms are not relieved after you eliminate trigger foods and add fiber, your doctor may prescribe medications. For people that have frequent loose stools (diarrhea-predominant IBS), medication options include: antidiarrheals — loperamide (Imodium), diphenoxylate (Lomotil and other brand names) antispasmodics to reduce cramping — dicyclomine (Bentyl) pain-reducing agents — amitriptyline (Elavil), desipramine (Norpramin) alosetron (Lotronex) is approved only for women with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS who have very severe diarrhea and have not responded to other treatments. To receive this drug, you must sign a form stating that you are aware of life-threatening complications, such as a blocked, ruptured, or damaged bowel. For people with constipation-predominant IBS, fiber and plenty of fluids are the mainstays of therapy. If medication is needed, your doctor may prescribe an osmotic laxative such as lactulose. Other drugs available for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome include: lubiprostone (Amitiza), which is approved for women with persistent constipation linaclotide (LINZESS) and plecanatide (Trulance), which are approved for adults age 18 and older. Both drugs act on the cells that line the inside of the intestines. They promote increased fluid secretion into the intestine, making stool passage easier. Stress reduction through mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other practices, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can be extremely helpful. When to call a professional It is useful for anyone with irritable bowel symptoms to discuss their symptoms with a doctor, so that diet, fiber, stress reduction, and drug treatment strategies can be planned. After you have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, contact your doctor if you have: an episode of severe symptoms unexplained weight loss or fever blood in your stool abdominal pain that is accompanied by vomiting, dizziness, or fainting abdominal pain or diarrhea that awakens you from sleep. Prognosis There is no cure for IBS. But most people can lessen the symptoms by making dietary changes, reducing stress, and — if necessary — taking medication.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis-a-to-z,Diverticulosis and diverticulitis,1,"What are diverticulosis and diverticulitis? In diverticulosis, small pouches develop and bulge out through weak spots in the walls of the colon, typically in the part of the colon called the sigmoid colon on the left side of the abdomen. These small, balloon-like pouches are called diverticula. The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States ages 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. If the diverticula become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as abscess, perforation, intestinal blockage from internal scarring, or fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs. A rare but life-threatening complication called peritonitis can occur when diverticula rupture, leaking infection into the abdominal cavity. Symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis Most people who have diverticulosis don't have any symptoms, but some have mild cramps, constipation, or bloating. Diverticulitis causes more severe symptoms, including any of the following, but particularly the first two: steady abdominal pain tenderness to pressure in the lower abdomen, especially on the left side fever nausea vomiting chills cramping change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea) sharper pain with breathing or jarring movements such as walking. Lower intestinal bleeding can occur in people with diverticulosis. The loss of blood can cause weakness and dizziness. Diagnosing diverticulosis and diverticulitis The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States aged 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. However, unless you have had a colonoscopy, CT scan of your abdomen, or barium enema, you would not be aware they exist. On the other hand, diverticulitis almost always causes symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, bowel habits, and diet and will conduct a physical examination. Your doctor will press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Based on the location of your symptoms and the location of abdominal pain and tenderness, your doctor may be able to make the diagnosis without further testing. If your doctor is unsure or concerned that you may have an abscess or other complication, he or she will likely order additional studies. These usually include blood tests for signs of infection and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. Lower intestinal bleeding is commonly caused by a broken blood vessel within a diverticula. But it is often very difficult to identify the exact bleeding site, even with colonoscopy. Expected duration of diverticulosis and diverticulitis Diverticula do not disappear unless the section of colon is removed surgically. Diverticulosis is a lifelong condition that can be managed, primarily with adjustments in diet. Symptoms of diverticulitis or bleeding from diverticulosis may subside within a few days after treatment, may continue, or may get worse in the case of severe illness or complications. Preventing diverticulosis and diverticulitis People whose diets contain large amounts of fiber are less likely to develop diverticular disease. The recommended daily fiber intake is at least 20 grams per day, but a healthier goal is 35 grams of fiber daily, preferably from fruits, vegetables, and grains. Your doctor also may recommend unprocessed bran or a fiber product. It is important to increase fiber intake gradually and to drink more water to increase the bulk of the bowel movements, which reduces pressure inside the bowel. Physical activity also may lower the risk of diverticulosis. Many doctors previously recommended that people with diverticulosis avoid eating nuts, popcorn, and foods with seeds. This restriction has not been proven to prevent diverticulitis. Treating diverticulosis and diverticulitis The only possible treatment for diverticulosis is to increase fiber in the diet. Fiber will not heal existing diverticula, but it may prevent more from forming. If you have symptoms of mild diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend a short period of observation without antibiotics. There are no specific dietary recommendations, but many doctors suggest a low-fiber diet until symptoms resolve. If the diagnosis is uncertain, an abdominal CT scan is usually ordered. Depending on the results, your doctor can then decide if treatment at home with oral antibiotics versus intravenous (IV) antibiotics, either at home or in the hospital. If fever and pain continues, you may be developing complicated diverticulitis, For example, an abscess can develop when a diverticulum becomes perforated (develops a hole). An abscess is a collection of pus. A surgeon then will help your doctor plan the next step: drainage or surgery. The choice depends on the extent of the problem and your overall health. Drainage means that the surgeon cleans out the pus. Surgery also may be required during the hospital stay to treat a particularly severe episode of diverticulitis. Emergency surgery is required if the abscess breaks open and causes peritonitis, the most serious potential complication of diverticulitis. Peritonitis requires surgical repair as well as intravenous antibiotics. For persistent or recurrent bleeding from diverticulosis, surgery may be the only option. The most common procedure, known as a colon resection, involves removing the part of the colon that contains the bleeding diverticula and reattaching the ends. When done during emergencies, a colon resection is often done as a two-stage process. First, a section of colon is removed, but because of infection, it is not safe to rejoin the ends. Instead, the surgeon creates a temporary hole, or stoma, in the abdomen and connects the colon to it, a procedure called a colostomy. A bag is attached to collect the stool. Later, a second operation is done to reattach the end of the colon, and remove the colostomy. After successful treatment for diverticulitis, your doctor normally will recommend a high-fiber diet. Later, you may need to have a procedure called a colonoscopy, which is an internal examination of the colon. In general, surgery is not recommended after only one or even two attacks without complications. However, it is usually recommended after a third episode occurs in the same location within the colon. Repeated episodes of diverticulitis can lead to internal scarring and narrowing of the colon, which also may require surgery to remove a piece of the colon. When to call a professional Call your doctor if abdominal pain in one spot lasts for longer than a few hours, especially if it becomes worse or is accompanied by fever. Prognosis With proper treatment and a high-fiber diet, the outlook for people with diverticulosis and uncomplicated diverticulitis is excellent. Most people with diverticulosis never have symptoms. People who have diverticulitis usually improve within two to four days after treatment begins. Over 85% of patients recover with bed rest and liquid diet, with or without antibiotics. Most never have a second episode of diverticulitis. The prognosis varies if complications develop and is particularly serious in the case of peritonitis. About 90% of people who have a colon resection do not have symptoms return after the surgery.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/evoking-calm-practicing-mindfulness-in-daily-life-helps-202110142617,Evoking calm: Practicing mindfulness in daily life helps,1,"It's easy to say you simply don't have time to be mindful. With so much going on in daily life, who has time to stop and be present? But everyone has at least 10 minutes to spare to practice mindfulness. The point of these brief, daily reflections is to help you tap into calmness whenever life gets too hairy. Practicing everyday mindfulness can also improve your memory and concentration skills and help you feel less distracted and better able to manage stress . And mindfulness tools have been successfully incorporated into treatments for anxiety and depression. There is more than one way to practice mindfulness. Still, any mindfulness technique aims to achieve a state of alert, focused, relaxed consciousness by deliberately paying attention to thoughts and sensations without passing judgment on them. This allows the mind to focus on the present moment with an attitude of acceptance. Three easy mindfulness exercises to try Here are three simple exercises you can try whenever you need a mental break, emotional lift, or just want to pause and appreciate everything around you. Devote 10 minutes a day to them and see how the experience changes your outlook. It's time well spent. Simple meditation A quick and easy meditation is an excellent place to begin practicing mindfulness. Sit on a straight-backed chair or cross-legged on the floor. Focus on an aspect of your breathing, such as the sensations of air flowing into your nostrils and out of your mouth, or your belly rising and falling as you inhale and exhale. Once you've narrowed your concentration in this way, begin to widen your focus. Become aware of sounds, sensations, and ideas. Embrace and consider each without judgment. If your mind starts to race, return your focus to your breathing. Then expand your awareness again. Take as much time as you like: one minute, or five, or 10 — whatever you're comfortable with. Experts in mindfulness meditation note that the practice is most helpful if you commit to a regular meditation schedule. Open awareness Another approach to mindfulness is ""open awareness,"" which helps you stay in the present and truly participate in specific moments in life. You can choose any task or moment to practice open awareness, such as eating, taking a walk, showering, cooking a meal, or working in the garden. When you are engaged in these and other similar routine activities, follow these steps. Bring your attention to the sensations in your body, both physical and emotional. Breathe in through your nose, allowing the air to fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Then breathe out slowly through your mouth. Carry on with the task at hand, slowly and with deliberation. Engage each of your senses, paying close attention to what you can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste. Try ""single-tasking,"" bringing your attention as fully as possible to what you're doing. Allow any thoughts or emotions that arise to come and go, like clouds passing through the sky. If your mind wanders away from your current task, gently refocus your attention back to the sensation of the moment. Body awareness Another way to practice mindfulness is to focus your attention on other thoughts, objects, and sensations. While sitting quietly with your eyes closed, channel your awareness toward each of the following: Sensations: Notice subtle feelings such as an itch or tingling without judgment, and let them pass. Notice each part of your body in succession from head to toe. Sights and sounds: Notice sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. Name them ""sight,"" ""sound,"" ""smell,"" ""taste,"" or ""touch"" without judgment and let them go. Emotions: Allow emotions to be present without judging them. Practice a steady and relaxed naming of emotions: ""joy,"" ""anger,"" ""frustration."" Urges: When you feel a craving or an urge (for instance, to eat excess food or practice an unwanted behavior), acknowledge the desire and understand that it will pass. Notice how your body feels as the craving enters. Replace the wish for the craving to go away with the specific knowledge that it will subside.",6,0.22547445,-0.16326538
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/depressions-cognitive-cost,Depression's cognitive cost,1,"Elaine's memory lapses seemed minor, but they happened often. She frequently forgot where she parked her car or why she walked into a room; reminiscing with a good friend, she could barely remember a wondrous vacation the two had shared in their 40s. Now in her mid-60s — and with a mother with Alzheimer's disease — Elaine fretted that these memory blanks signaled she, too, was developing dementia. But the true culprit was a lot sneakier: longstanding depression. A battery of cognitive tests ruled out dementia, easing Elaine's mind but provoking distress that a condition characterized by persistent sadness and apathy could also steal her ability to recall simple details. ""Few things are as depressing and anxiety-provoking as being aware you're having memory lapses or being afraid you might develop dementia,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School who conducted Elaine's cognitive tests. Inattention a factor An estimated 21 million American adults — roughly 8% — have experienced at least one episode of depression, and women are twice as likely as men to have the condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Most people associate depression with its hallmark symptoms, which include not only sadness and apathy, but also loss of enjoyment in things that previously brought pleasure, appetite changes, and trouble sleeping. Yet memory is often a casualty as well, with research suggesting that having depression increases a person's risk for memory problems. Depressive symptoms can even speed memory decline in older people, according to a study of 8,200 adults published online June 11, 2024, by JAMA Network Open. Dr. Budson points out that memory glitches common in depressed people are a byproduct of an overstimulated mind. ""I think of these more as attention deficits than memory deficits,"" he says. ""If someone has depression, they always have something on their mind that prevents them from focusing their full attention on where they are and what they're doing."" Indeed, just getting through the day can feel exhausting when you're depressed. But an inability to drum up energy and attention is only one contributor to depression-fueled memory problems, Dr. Budson says. It's believed that depression also alters levels of brain chemicals that help us focus, such as dopamine and norepinephrine. Memory issues may also stem from other depression-related changes in the brain involved in creating, combining, and recalling memories. How dementia is distinct Importantly, however, memory problems show up in depression quite differently than in Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. Someone who's depressed, for example, is likely to have a harder time retrieving long-ago memories — like the camping trip her family took when she was 8 — than remembering what she ate for breakfast that morning. A person with dementia, on the other hand, can typically summon memories from many years ago with ease, but can't recall where she went yesterday. That's because dementia damages the hippocampus, a brain structure in charge of helping us learn new information and retrieving recent memories. We don't need the hippocampus to retrieve older memories, though, which is why people with Alzheimer's have less difficulty recalling their childhood or early adulthood. ""People with Alzheimer's can remember things that happened 20, 30, and 50 years ago quite well, at least in the early stages of the disease, but have great difficulty remembering things that happened that morning or yesterday or last week,"" Dr. Budson says. ""The pattern is almost the exact opposite of what you see in depression."" Positive memories fade first Another curious distinction in depression-related memory problems is how the mood disorder doesn't target all memories in the same way. Often, the first to fade are recollections of happier times — just when that type of boost would be especially welcome. Why? Again, brain biology is the culprit: areas that process positive or rewarding experiences are disrupted in people with depression. Many, if not most, memories are context-dependent, Dr. Budson explains. Case in point: visit the town where you grew up or your old high school, and ""all of a sudden you'll be able to retrieve memories you didn't even know you still had,"" he says. But this type of context-dependent memory retrieval doesn't just involve places—it's also relevant for moods. ""When you're feeling happy, you're more likely to be able to easily retrieve memories of other times when you were feeling happy,"" he explains. ""And when you're depressed, it's easy to retrieve memories of other times when you were feeling depressed, but difficult to retrieve those from when you were feeling happy."" This unlucky phenomenon might make it more difficult to recover from depression, creating a vicious cycle. ""It's hard to remember those happy times — and that you can be happy again,"" Dr. Budson says. ""I don't know if that worsens depression, but it makes it hard to get out of it."" Proactive steps Dr. Budson offers these strategies to lower your risk of depression and protect your memory if you're prone to the mood disorder: Get your heart pumping. Regular aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, biking, or swimming, not only generates feel-happy endorphins, but also increases growth factors in the brain that help produce new cells in the hippocampus. Stay socially engaged. Spending time with friends and family and engaging in social activities may not only stave off depression, but also help ease it. ""Being around people you like and who like you is super-helpful,"" he says. Plan around your triggers. Hard experience may have taught you that certain people, places, or events can trigger your depression to recur. Avoid those situations as much as you can, and consider alternative actions during happier moments, when you have the mental bandwidth to plan ahead. Keep your ""happy people"" on speed dial. Many of us have a special someone — perhaps a friend, relative, or religious adviser — who can lift our spirits on the bleakest days. Reach out to that person if you find yourself in emotional quicksand. To help you remember to do that, add reminders to your phone or calendar. Log your favorite memories. Knowing it's normal to have difficulty summoning up pleasant memories when you're depressed, post a written list of some of your favorites on a bulletin board or refrigerator. ""When you're feeling blue, read the list,"" Dr. Budson says. ""It might just make you smile."" Common infection's dark side: Could it trigger Alzheimer's? Being infected with Helicobacter pylori—a stomach bacterium found in an estimated two-thirds of the world's population—may be linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in adults 50 and older, a new study suggests. Passed from one person to another, H. pylori is often harmless. But it can lead to indigestion, ulcers, and (in rare cases) stomach cancer. Alzheimer's may join that list, according to the study, which was published in the March 2024 issue of Alzheimer's and Dementia. Researchers analyzed medical records spanning nearly three decades from more than 4.2 million people in the United Kingdom ages 50 and up. None of the participants had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's at the study's start. People with a symptomatic H. pylori infection had 11% higher odds of developing Alzheimer's disease over an average follow-up period of 11 years, the study found. The findings are only observational and therefore do not prove that H. pylori causes dementia. But the possibility doesn't surprise Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""We've known for more than 10 years that other infections are also associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease,"" he says. How might infections be linked to Alzheimer's? Research increasingly suggests that beta-amyloid—a type of protein involved in Alzheimer's-related brain plaques— is normally deposited in the brain to help it fight off infection, Dr. Budson says. But some people, due to genetic or other factors, aren't able to clear this protein out of the brain after the threat has passed. ""We all make a bit of amyloid during the day, and when we sleep at night, it gets flushed away,"" he says. ""That's why it's important to get a good night's sleep. But over a lifetime, people sometimes generate a little too much amyloid or have trouble clearing it away. When too much of it builds up, that's what leads to Alzheimer's.""

But sometimes people sleep too little, and then try to catch up by sleeping more than usual. However, a study published online June 27, 2024, by the journal Diabetologia found that this kind of erratic sleeping may increase a person's risk for diabetes. Researchers collected health questionnaires from approximately 36,000 adults in their 50s. The information included the average number of hours they slept on weekdays and weekends. The researchers divided sleep patterns into three categories: short (less than seven hours), normal (seven to nine hours), and long (more than nine hours). Next, to show how consistently people slept from night to night, they created nine sleep trajectory combinations — for example, short-short, short-normal, short-long, normal-normal, and normal-short. Five years later, the questionnaires were repeated. The researchers found that people who regularly reported short-long or long-short sleeping patterns — meaning they bounced back and forth from sleeping less than seven hours to longer than nine — had a 50% higher risk for diabetes than people who regularly slept the normal seven to nine hours.

But if the duration of your nightly Z's varies significantly, you might be boosting your diabetes risk, suggests a Harvard-led study published online July 17, 2024, by Diabetes Care. Researchers asked more than 84,000 diabetes-free people (average age 62) to wear activity trackers for a week, and then followed their health for more than seven years. People whose sleep duration varied the most (fluctuating by more than an hour from night to night) had a 34% higher risk for diabetes, compared with people whose sleep duration was more consistent. The association was strongest among those who slept more than eight hours per night, on average. ""However, the association was also present among those who slept seven to eight hours per night. This suggests that even for those who get enough sleep each night, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is still important,"" says Sina Kianersi, the lead author and a researcher at Harvard affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. The study doesn't prove that inconsistent sleep causes diabetes, but other studies have tied varying sleep duration to diabetes risk factors, including a big belly and high blood sugar, blood pressure, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood).

Both disorders are common in later years, and each can lead to the other. Depression in the elderly can also lead to a phenomenon called pseudodementia — an apparent intellectual decline that stems from a lack of energy or effort. People with this problem are often forgetful, move slowly, and have low motivation as well as mental slowing. They may or may not appear depressed. This syndrome responds well to treatments for depression. As mood improves, a person's energy, ability to concentrate, and intellectual functioning usually return to previous levels.

Alzheimer's Disease Harvard Health Publishing’s Alzheimer's Disease: A guide to diagnosis, treatment, and caregiving LEARN MORE Decline in mental functioning tends to be more rapid with depression than with Alzheimer's or another type of dementia. Unlike people with Alzheimer's, people with depression are usually not disoriented. People with depression have difficulty concentrating, whereas those affected by Alzheimer's have problems with short-term memory. Writing, speaking, and motor skills aren't usually impaired in depression. Depressed people are more likely to notice and comment on their memory problems, while those with Alzheimer's may seem indifferent to such changes. Since there is no simple test that can reveal whether someone has depression or dementia, treatment is often worth trying. If depression is at the root, treatment can produce dramatic improvement.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/stretching-to-help-arthritis-pain,Stretching to help arthritis pain,1,"If you're experiencing arthritis, you shouldn't let the pain keep you from staying physically active. When arthritis makes movement painful, it's only natural to try to avoid it. Yet if you keep an arthritic joint bent rather than moving through its range of motion, you allow muscles to stiffen in that position. Over time, the muscles actually shorten, curtailing range of motion and causing other problems. That can lead to a host of other problems, including weight gain, difficulty walking, and poor balance. A regular stretching routine can help you avoid this vicious cycle. Doctors and physical therapists often prescribe stretching as part of a treatment plan to help maintain or reclaim abilities and ease discomfort. Stretches can also help improve range of motion in people with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease. If you have arthritis, it's best to talk to your doctor before starting any exercise routine, including a stretching routine. Once you get the okay, try these tips to help you get started: Warm up thoroughly. Take extra time to warm up before you stretch. A hot shower or bath, a heated pool, or even warm compresses or a heating pad can also relax stiff joints before you stretch. Stretch during your least painful time of day. Morning won't work for some people, since that's when their joints are stiffest. You might do your stretches when pain relievers are at their peak effectiveness. Adapt stretches. Use pillows or rolled-up towels to adjust your range of motion in each stretch. Choose seated stretches, if necessary. Expect some discomfort. While you should stretch only to the point of mild tension, not pain, you may experience some discomfort. Try this guideline: if discomfort following stretches or other activities lasts longer than two hours, or is more severe than your usual pain, ease up on your routine. Try holding each stretch for less time. As stretching becomes easier, gradually step it up again.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/vitiligo-managing-and-living-with-this-challenging-skin-condition,Vitiligo: Managing and living with this challenging skin condition,1,"Vitiligo is a chronic condition that affects skin color. Because vitiligo affects physical appearance, living with the condition can be challenging and can affect emotional well-being. What is vitiligo? Vitiligo is a lifelong condition in which patches of skin lose color due to the destruction of melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin its color. Vitiligo can appear on any body part and affects individuals of any age, ethnicity, or gender. Quick facts about vitiligo: About 30% of people with vitiligo have a family history of it. It occurs in about 1% to 2% of the population. About half of people with vitiligo show symptoms before age 20. In one out of every five to 10 people with vitiligo, some or all the pigment eventually returns, causing the white patches to disappear. What causes vitiligo? Vitiligo is believed to be an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly targets and destroys its own cells. In the case of vitiligo, the immune system targets an individual's melanocytes, the cells that produce skin pigment. In addition, the melanocytes in a person with vitiligo may be less capable of managing an imbalance between antioxidants and harmful free radicals in the body. In both cases, the melanocytes are damaged and destroyed, resulting in patches of skin losing pigment or color. Although most individuals with vitiligo are otherwise in good health, there is a link between vitiligo and thyroid disorders, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. What does vitiligo look like? In vitiligo, patches of skin lose their pigment, resulting in areas that appear milky white or lighter than the surrounding skin. The edges of the patches can look smooth or irregular and may show redness or brownish discoloration. Vitiligo can appear anywhere on a person's skin. The areas most often affected are: the fingers and wrists in the armpits groin and genitals around the mouth and eyes inside the mouth. Vitiligo can also cause loss of pigment in hair on the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, and body hair. Vitiligo can be particularly noticeable on darker skin due to the contrast between affected and unaffected areas. In lighter-skinned individuals, the lack of pigment often becomes more apparent in the summer, when surrounding skin tans while the vitiligo patches do not. Types of vitiligo There are two main types of vitiligo: non-segmental and segmental. Non-segmental vitiligo is the most common type, affecting up to 90% of people with vitiligo. This type progresses slowly, with new patches forming periodically on both sides of the body, often symmetrically, such as on both knees or hands. Segmental vitiligo is less common but is more frequently seen in children. This type is more localized, causing rapid pigment loss on one side or part of the body. Segmental vitiligo usually stabilizes within six to 12 months, after which no new patches develop. In rare instances, vitiligo can spread to cover the entire body, a condition known as universal vitiligo. Diagnosing vitiligo To diagnose vitiligo, your doctor will review your medical history and conduct a thorough skin examination. In some cases, an ultraviolet light called a Wood's lamp is used to highlight areas of depigmentation, which appear chalky and bright under the lamp. Your doctor may perform other tests such as: blood testing to check for other autoimmune diseases an eye exam to detect uveitis, an eye inflammation associated with vitiligo. A skin biopsy, in which a small skin sample is examined in a laboratory, is rarely necessary. It can help confirm the diagnosis if the skin changes suggest other conditions. Treatment options Although there is no cure for vitiligo, there are treatments to help stop disease progression, restore skin color, and prevent new patches. For most people, the whitened skin patches last and grow larger if vitiligo is not treated. Your doctor's recommendations for treatment will depend on your needs, overall health, and vitiligo type. Topical medications. Topical treatments include topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus), and topical vitamin D analogs (such as calcipotriene). These prescription medications are applied directly to the skin. Ruxolitinib (Opzelura) is a newer medication approved by the FDA in 2022 to restore lost skin color in people with vitiligo. This cream is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is prescribed for individuals ages 12 and older primarily to treat small areas of vitiligo. Clinical trials have shown that ruxolitinib cream can effectively repigment the skin, with results lasting up to two years. Light therapy. This treatment exposes the skin to ultraviolet light, encouraging repigmentation. Ultraviolet light can be provided by a hand-held lightbox for smaller areas of skin, or delivered in a closet-sized lightbox if a larger area of skin is involved. The treatment must be repeated often, usually three times a week for at least six months. Depigmentation. This approach, which involves lightening unaffected skin to match the depigmented areas, is only used for people with severe vitiligo. This treatment is rarely used because the depigmentation is permanent and the skin without pigment is vulnerable to damage from sun exposure. Surgery. Surgical options like skin grafts or melanocyte transplants may be explored in severe cases or those that don't respond to other treatments. Surgery is not suitable for everyone, particularly people prone to scarring. Protecting and caring for your skin if you have vitiligo If you have vitiligo, protecting your skin from the sun is crucial to managing the condition. Vitiligo-affected skin is more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer. To protect your skin, stay out of the sun, wear sun-protective clothing, and apply sunscreen daily to all exposed skin. Avoid tanning beds and sun lamps, as they can worsen vitiligo. In addition, skin injuries such as cuts, scrapes, and burns can trigger new spots or patches of vitiligo, so you should take care to protect your skin. Living with vitiligo Some people embrace their natural skin with vitiligo. Others may not be comfortable with their appearance and may use makeup, self-tanner, or skin dye to cover light patches. Vitiligo can affect quality of life, leading to stress, sadness, and low self-esteem. If vitiligo is affecting your mental health, seek psychological support and counseling. A mental health professional can provide valuable support for coping with difficult feelings and managing depression. It may also be helpful to connect with others by joining a vitiligo support group or seeking emotional support from family and friends.",9,0.074179396,-0.06201488
https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/melanoma-a-to-z,Melanoma,1,"What is melanoma? Melanoma is cancer of the cells (melanocytes) that give skin its color. It develops when these cells change and reproduce aggressively. The number of cases of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is increasing faster than any other cancer. Doctors aren't completely sure why melanoma rates are soaring. It could be from spending too much time in the sun during outdoor activities. It could also be due to global changes, such as the depletion of the ozone, which absorbs many of the sun's harmful rays. Your pattern of sun exposure appears to affect your risk of developing melanoma more than the total amount of sun exposure in your lifetime. Short bursts of intense sun seem most dangerous, especially if you get sunburned. Being out in the sun can cause changes (mutations) in skin cells' genes. The most common type of melanoma spreads on the skin's surface. It is called superficial spreading melanoma. It may stay on the surface or grow down into deeper tissues. Other types of melanoma can start anywhere on or inside the body. Your risk of developing melanoma is higher if you have: red or blond hair green or blue eyes fair skin a history of being in the sun a lot, especially as a child a mother, father, sister or brother with melanoma. If one of these relatives has melanoma, you are eight times more likely to develop it. Features of freckles or moles that raise your risk of melanoma include: a new mole appearing after age 30 a new mole at any age if it is in an area rarely exposed to the sun a change in an existing mole one or more atypical moles — moles that look like a fried egg, or moles that are darker than others or have irregular borders or an irregular shape 20 or more moles larger than 2 millimeters across 5 or more moles larger than 5 millimeters across (larger than a pencil eraser) freckles caused by being in the sun. Symptoms of melanoma Melanoma is usually visible as a single dark skin spot. It may appear anywhere on the body, but it most commonly develops on the back, chest, and legs. Most of the time, melanoma develops on normal-looking skin, but it can grow out of an existing mole. Watch a mole for the A, , C, D and Es of melanoma: Asymmetry (one side doesn't match the other) Border irregularities Colors or shades of skin that are different within the same mole Diameter larger than 6 millimeters (larger than a pencil eraser) Evolving (a newly developing mole). A mole that bleeds, feels numb, or has a crusty surface may also hint at melanoma. Diagnosing melanoma If your doctor thinks a mole may be melanoma, he or she will do a biopsy of the skin or refer you to a specialist for the procedure. Before the biopsy, your doctor will check for enlarged lymph nodes close to the mole. If you have a melanoma, enlarged lymph nodes can mean that the cancer has spread. After a skin biopsy, nearby lymph nodes can swell because the skin incision is healing. In a biopsy, a doctor removes a piece of tissue and examines it in a laboratory. Based on this report, your doctor can then determine the thickness of the melanoma and how deep the cancer has grown below the skin's surface. That's the most important factor in predicting whether it can be cured. Melanomas deeper than 1 millimeter are more likely to have spread to other parts of the body. Your doctor may suggest additional tests including: blood tests imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans and MRIs additional biopsies. If the cancer is advanced, the biopsy sample of your melanoma may be tested to see if it has one of the gene mutations common in melanoma. Some melanoma treatments have been designed to attack specific genetic subtypes of this cancer. Expected duration of melanoma Melanoma can usually be cured if it is removed when the tumor has not gone deep into the skin. More advanced melanoma requires longer treatment. If you have one melanoma, you are at risk of developing another, so have a doctor examine your skin regularly. About 1 out of 20 people who have a melanoma will develop a second melanoma within 20 years. Preventing melanoma To reduce your risk of melanoma, stay out of the sun. A bad sunburn is a major risk factor. Spending a lot of time in the sun as a child may pose the greatest risk. To be safe in the sun, take these steps: Apply plenty of sunscreen and apply it frequently. It should: have a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30provide broad spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB raysbe water resistant. Wear protective sunglasses, clothing (long sleeves and long pants) and wide-brimmed hats. Stay out of the sun when it is strongest (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). Ask your doctor if any medications you take could make your skin more likely to be damaged by the sun. Avoid tanning salons. If you want to look tan, use sunless tanning creams. They are available in department and drug stores. Melanoma is often easy to spot early, because it can be seen on your skin. If you are at risk of developing melanoma, ask your doctor to examine your skin. Also ask your doctor how often you should have your skin checked. Your doctor will pay special attention to any atypical looking moles. Because some melanomas can arise from existing moles, your doctor may remove atypical moles. These moles may be more likely to become cancerous. Alternatively, your doctor may take pictures of your moles. He or she can compare the photos to your moles in the future to see if they have changed. Examine your skin regularly, especially if you have risk factors for melanoma. Use a full-length and hand-held mirror. Have someone examine your scalp using a blow dryer to part your hair. That person can also examine your back and other areas that you can't easily see. Watch for new moles and changes in existing ones. Keep an eye on moles that you've had since birth; these moles may be more likely to turn into melanoma. Treating melanoma Major advances have been made in the treatment of melanoma. Surgery is the initial treatment for melanoma that appears in just one spot. The doctor removes the visible tumor along with 1 to 2.5 centimeters of healthy skin around the tumor, depending on the size of the tumor. (Nearby skin can contain microscopic bits of the cancer.) In some cases, the doctor may perform a specialized procedure during which the tumor is shaved away one thin layer at a time. Each layer is examined under the microscope as it is removed. This technique helps the doctor remove as little healthy skin as possible. If the melanoma is more than 1 millimeter deep, your doctor will want to know if the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes. To do this, he or she may inject a radioactive liquid into the tumor. The liquid flows through the natural drainage pathway that connects the tumor to nearby lymph nodes. The drainage path can be tracked, and the first lymph node along the path is called the sentinel node. This node is removed and examined for cancer cells. If the sentinel node has no cancer, the other nodes are most often cancer-free. If cancer is found in the sentinel node, most often all the lymph nodes in the area will be removed. However, it's not been absolutely proven that removing all lymph nodes improves survival. Although spreading cancer cells might be removed, cells that are fighting the cancer also are removed. When cancer has spread to one or two other sites only, surgical removal similar to what was done the first time can improve survival. Additional therapies can often help people with thicker tumors that have grown deep into the skin and/or spread to more areas of the body. The cancer cells are tested for certain specific markers. The results guide the type of therapy that has the greatest chance of improving quality of life and survival. Most often patients are treated with immunotherapy and/or drugs designed to block major pathways that allow cancers to grow. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are less effective. But they can be used when other therapies don't work or stop working. When to call a professional Early treatment of melanoma is crucial. If you detect any of the ABCDE signs or see any suspicious skin changes, call your doctor right away. If you delay, melanoma can spread. If melanoma runs in your family, of if you have other risk factors, be especially alert. Have your doctor examine your skin regularly. Prognosis Five key factors help to determine how serious melanoma is: tumor thickness — How deep it goes into the skin location — Melanoma on the arms or legs may not be as serious as a tumor somewhere else on the body age — People older than 60 are in more danger gender — Males are more likely to die of the disease spreading of the tumor — Twenty percent of people with melanoma have cancer in lymph nodes when their cancer is diagnosed. The thickness of the tumor is the most important factor in determining whether it can be treated. Tumors on the skin's surface usually can be cured. Deeper cancers are more difficult, sometimes impossible, to treat. If melanoma cells break away and spread to organs such as the lungs, liver or brain, the cancer can be cured in only a small number of patients. If treatment begins when the tumor is less than 0.75 millimeters deep, the chance of a cure is excellent. More than 95% of people with small melanomas are cancer-free as long as 8 years later. However, for deeper melanomas, the survival rate is variable.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/insomnia-a-to-z,Insomnia,1,"What is insomnia? Insomnia is difficulty getting enough sleep or trouble sleeping without interruption. You may have difficulty falling asleep, may wake up too early, or may wake up periodically during the night. Insomnia of any kind can keep you from feeling rested and refreshed during the day. Almost all of us have episodes of insomnia at some time, but insomnia is not a short-term problem for everyone. Insomnia is classified as chronic when it happens almost every night for at least one month. Insomnia can be related to a medical or psychiatric illness, can be caused by mental stress or excitement, or can be caused by your daytime and bedtime habits. Your habits and surroundings are the usual causes of short-term insomnia problems. Factors that contribute to insomnia can include: stress or anxiety a change in sleeping environment (being a guest at a hotel or a relative's home) an uncomfortable sleeping environment (too hot, too cold, too bright, too noisy) an uncomfortable mattress pajamas that are too tight having a bed partner who snores or has disruptive sleep patterns watching television, reading a book or problem-solving in your bed, so your brain associates lying down in bed without activities other than sleeping eating a heavy meal before bedtime taking a prescription medication that has insomnia as a side effect drinking alcoholic beverages before bedtime having a high intake of beverages containing caffeine (coffee, tea, cola) during the day cigarette smoking exercising immediately before bedtime not exercising enough during the day, so you have energy to spare taking a hot bath or shower before bed traveling to a different time zone traveling to a much higher altitude shift work. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to insomnia. Women who are pregnant may have insomnia because of hormone changes, heartburn, leg cramps or a need to urinate more frequently. In addition, the unborn baby's increasing size often makes it harder for the mother to find a comfortable sleeping position. Chronic insomnia may be caused by a medical or psychiatric problem. Some common causes of chronic insomnia include: psychiatric illness, especially depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) chronic medical illnesses, especially kidney disease, heart failure or asthma painful illnesses, especially arthritis, neuropathy, acid reflux or cancer hormone imbalance, especially menopause or hyperthyroidism taking a prescription medicine that has insomnia as a side effect restless legs syndrome: this disorder causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs. Symptoms can include twitching of the legs, a habit of repetitive leg movements, and leg cramps. obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common condition. However, often the people that have this problem don't realize it. Snorers or people who are overweight may have repeated episodes in which breathing stops for 10 seconds to 30 seconds during sleep, just when the person is relaxing into deep sleep. Sleep apnea is caused most often by relaxing the tongue and throat tissues, which can settle into a position that closes your airway. Your body reacts to sleep apnea by releasing adrenaline-like ""alarm"" hormones so you will awaken and resume breathing. These hormones keep you awake for periods of the night. Symptoms of insomnia Symptoms of insomnia can include: difficulty falling asleep waking up periodically during the night waking up in the early morning, but not feeling rested feeling tired and irritable during the day having trouble concentrating. Diagnosing insomnia Your doctor often can determine the cause of your insomnia by asking about your habits and sleep environment, by reviewing your symptoms, and by examining you. Your doctor may suggest that you keep a sleep diary (a log of your sleep patterns) to provide an exact record of how many hours you sleep, whether symptoms may be your trigger for awakenings, and at what times you wake up. If your doctor suspects that a medical illness is causing your insomnia, you may need additional tests. In some patients, an overnight sleep study at a sleep clinic may be necessary. During a sleep study, your brain waves, breathing pattern and oxygen levels can be monitored, and your body movements can be observed. Expected duration of insomnia Insomnia may last only one or two nights, or it may continue for weeks, months or years. How long insomnia lasts depends on its cause, and on the success of lifestyle changes and treatment. Preventing insomnia It helps to have habits that promote healthy sleep: Follow a regular sleep schedule. Have a routine bedtime and wake up at roughly the same hour each morning. Sleep in loose, comfortable clothes in a comfortable bed. Eliminate any sources of noise or bright lights that prevent or disrupt sleep. If noise from outside your bedroom can't be eliminated, it might help if you drown out that noise by creating a monotonous noise of your own. Use a fan, a channel with static noise on your radio, or a recording of ocean waves to make a noise that can lull you to sleep. Maintain a comfortable temperature in your bedroom. Cut down on beverages containing caffeine during the day, since the stimulating effects of caffeine can last for many hours. Avoid heavy meals before bedtime. Eliminate alcohol, since many people experience wakefulness as the effect of the alcohol wears off. Exercise daily, preferably early in the day. If you read before bed, do this in a chair or in another room. Consider sleeping in a separate bed or separate room if your partner keeps you awake. If you have chronic insomnia because of chronic pain, medical illness or psychiatric problems, seek prompt treatment for your health problem. Don't assume that insomnia is an unavoidable part of your illness. Treating insomnia Changes in your bedtime surroundings and habits that can promote sleep are usually the most important way to manage insomnia. Behavioral therapies also may be used to treat some patients with insomnia. These therapies include: Relaxation therapy — Special techniques to quiet the mind and relax the muscles Sleep restriction — A program that at first permits only a few hours of sleep per night, then gradually increases the nightly sleeping time Reconditioning — A program that teaches the patient to associate the bed only with sleeping (and sexual activity) by having the patient go to bed only when sleepy and avoid daytime naps If insomnia is one of the symptoms of a medical disorder, treating the underlying problem may be all that you need. For example, treating restless legs syndrome with specific medication or sleep apnea with a special mask can markedly improve quality of sleep. Your doctor may prescribe sleeping pills for short term or occasional use. Today there are a wide variety of medications to choose from. Some act quickly and are most helpful if you have trouble falling asleep. Others have a longer duration of action when the problem is staying asleep. Many of the medications are available as generics, which tend to be much less expensive. Older people should avoid the longer acting drugs because the sedation can last much longer than eight or nine hours. Melatonin, a dietary supplement, works for some people and not others. It has a good safety profile when used in the doses directed on the label. When to call a professional Call your doctor if you are worried about sleeping problems, especially if insufficient sleep or disturbed sleep is interfering with your ability to function normally during the day. Insomnia is an urgent medical problem if sleep problems are making it unsafe for you to drive a car or to perform potentially dangerous tasks at work. Prognosis In many people with insomnia, normal sleep patterns return within a few days, especially if a lifestyle issue (stress, a habit of heavy meals before bed, a change in time zones) disappears or is modified. In people with chronic insomnia, the outlook depends on the underlying problem. In people with obstructive sleep apnea, most experience relief when they use a nighttime nose mask that provides modest continuous air pressure through the mouth and nose. This mask must be prescribed by a doctor. Additional info National Center on Sleep Disorders Research www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sleep",6,0.2682568,-0.27693582
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-help-your-child-get-the-sleep-they-need-202008312264,How to help your child get the sleep they need,1,"It's tempting at this time of year to let summer sleep schedules stay in place or let bedtimes slide, especially when parents feel tired out, too. But it's important that children have a regular routine — and that they are sleeping during the dark hours and awake during the light ones, as our bodies do best that way. That's true for families who are home-schooling, as well: even when the trip to school is just a walk to the kitchen table, allowing for more sleep than those catching an early bus may get, no child should be spending all morning in bed. Sleep is crucial for all of us, and this is particularly true for children. Without enough quality sleep, children are more likely to have health and behavioral problems — and difficulty learning. Here are a few simple things you can do to help your child get the sleep they need. Have a regular schedule Our bodies do best when we go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time every day. Children and teens need eight to 10 hours of sleep. Count back 10 hours from when your child needs to get up in the morning. That's roughly the time they need to be getting ready for bed (for younger children, count back 11 hours). For example, if your teen needs to be up at 7, then they should be getting ready for bed by 9, and in bed by 10 (since most of us don't fall asleep the moment our head hits the pillow). A younger child should start getting ready (bathing, etc.) by around 8. Understand that teens are biologically wired to fall asleep later and wake up later and will naturally have later bedtimes. Unfortunately, most school districts don't accommodate to this, so you are often working against biology. While it's okay to stay up a bit later on weekends, don't let the bedtime vary by more than an hour or so. Turn off the screens before bed The blue light emitted by screens can keep us awake. It's best if the screens can be off two hours before you want your child asleep. Use that time when they start getting ready for bed as the time that the screens go off. The only real way to achieve this is to get all devices out of the bedroom. Teens will fight you on this. If you can, hold firm (and buy them an alarm clock if they say they need their phone for this). At the very least, be sure that the phone is on Do Not Disturb mode overnight. Have an environment that encourages sleep Quiet things down. If you are watching TV, turn the volume down, and in general try to not make much noise after children go to bed. Consider a white noise machine or a fan (or air conditioner if you live somewhere warm). There are also white noise apps for those teens who won't give up their phones. Room-darkening curtains can make a difference for children who tend to wake up at the first light of dawn — or who can't fall asleep if it's not fully dark outside. Know how other factors influence sleep Busy teens often have difficulty getting everything done in time to get enough sleep. Talk with your teen about their daily schedule and look for ways to help them get more shut-eye, such as getting homework done during the school day, or limiting video games or other activities that eat into homework time. Sleep needs to be the priority. Limit caffeine. It's best not to have any, but certainly nothing from mid-afternoon on. Limit naps! For a tired older child naps may seem like a good idea, but they can interfere with nighttime sleep. Naptime is okay through preschool. Make sure your child gets exercise. It's not only important for their health, it helps their sleep. Have calming routines before bed (not exercise!). If your child is having trouble falling asleep, or is waking up at night, talk to your doctor. It's also important to talk to your doctor if your child is snoring or having other breathing problems at night. Don't ever ignore a sleep problem; always ask for help.",6,0.12653048,-0.13664502
https://www.infowars.com/posts/record-increase-in-us-homelessness-in-2024,Record Increase in US Homelessness in 2024,0,"Homelessness increased by a record 18% over the last year, says the Department of Housing and Urban Development. A total of 771,480 people, or around 20 in 10,000 in the US, were homeless and living in an emergency shelter, safe haven, transitional housing program, or an unsheltered location, according to new data released on Friday. That amounts to an 18% increase on 2023. The 2023 annual data showed a 12% increase. Over the last year, children under the age of 18 experienced the greatest increase in homelessness. More than 150,000 under-18s were classed as homeless, a 33% rise on 2023. Black people, who represent 12% of the US population, represented just under a third of all homeless people. The Department of Housing and Urban Development attributed the increase to “our worsening national affordable housing crisis, rising inflation, stagnating wages among middle- and lower-income households,” as well as “the persisting effects of systemic racism,” “public health crises,” “natural disasters,” increase immigration to the US and the end of anti-homelessness programs brought in during the COVID-19 pandemic.",5,-0.13997869,-0.06765278
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/gratitude-enhances-health-brings-happiness-and-may-even-lengthen-lives-202409113071,"Gratitude enhances health, brings happiness — and may even lengthen lives",1,"Several evenings a week, as Tyler VanderWeele gathers around the dinner table with his wife and two young kids, the family deliberately pauses during the meal to do something simple but profound. Each member shares several things for which they're grateful — an act that VanderWeele, co-director of the Initiative on Health, Spirituality, and Religion at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, feels changes his family dynamic for the better. ""I do think it makes a difference and can be a very powerful practice,"" he says. ""Even on those bad days where life seems difficult, that effort is worthwhile."" Gratitude, health, and longevity How can the power of gratitude affect our lives? Recent research has pointed to gratitude's myriad positive health effects, including greater emotional and social well-being, better sleep quality, lower depression risks, and favorable markers of cardiovascular health. Now, new data from the long-term Nurses' Health Study shows that it may extend lives. ""Gratitude has been one of the most widely studied activities contributing to well-being, but we couldn't find a single prior study that looked at its effects on mortality and longevity, much to our surprise,"" says VanderWeele, co-author of the new research. What did the study look at? Published July 2024 in JAMA Psychiatry, the new study drew on data from 49,275 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Their average age was 79. In 2016, participants completed a six-item gratitude questionnaire in which they ranked their agreement with statements such as, ""I have so much in life to be thankful for,"" and ""If I had to list everything I felt grateful for, it would be a very long list."" Four years later, researchers combed through participants' medical records to determine who had died. There were 4,608 deaths from all causes, as well as from specific causes such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, neurodegenerative disease, infection, and injury. Deaths from cardiovascular disease — a top killer of women and men in the United States — were the most common cause. What did the researchers find? Participants with gratitude scores in the highest third at the study's start had a 9% lower risk of dying over the following four years than participants who scored in the bottom third. This did not change after controlling for physical health, economic circumstances, and other aspects of mental health and well-being. Gratitude seemed to help protect participants from every cause of death studied — including cardiovascular disease. But what does this actually mean? ""A 9% reduction in mortality risk is meaningful, but not huge,"" VanderWeele says. ""But what's remarkable about gratitude is that just about anyone can practice it. Anyone can recognize what's around them and express thanks to others for what's good in their life."" While the study couldn't pinpoint why gratitude is associated with longer life, VanderWeele believes several factors may contribute. ""We know that gratitude makes people feel happier. That in itself has a small effect on mortality risk,"" he says. ""Practicing gratitude may also make someone a bit more motivated to take care of their health. Maybe they're more likely to show up for medical appointments or exercise. It may also help with relationships and social support, which we know contribute to health."" What are the study's limitations and strengths? The study was observational. This means it can't prove that gratitude helps people live longer — only that an association exists. And the particular sample of people analyzed is both the biggest strength and limitation of the research, VanderWeele says. All were older female nurses with high socioeconomic status. The vast majority were white. ""Does the longevity effect extend to men, to those who are younger, and to those with lower socioeconomic resources?"" VanderWeele asks. ""Those are all open questions."" On the plus side, he says, the study sample's large size is one of its biggest strengths. So is the extensive data gathered on potential confounding factors such as participants' physical health, social characteristics, and other aspects of psychological well-being. ""Between the quality of the data and the size of the sample, we were able to provide reasonable evidence for this modest longevity effect,"" he says. Try this: Six questions to evoke gratitude Not feeling especially grateful today? You have the power to change that. Asking yourself certain questions can evoke gratitude, such as What happened today that was good? What am I taking for granted that I can be thankful for? Which people in my life am I grateful for? What is the last book I read or movie, show, or social media clip I saw that I really appreciated, and why? What am I most looking forward to this week, month, and year, and why? What is the kindest thing someone has said or done lately? Similarly, a few simple actions can infuse gratitude into your days. Try VanderWeele's family routine of regularly expressing gratitude around the dinner table. Another well-known practice — that's perhaps becoming forgotten in this digital age — is penning thank-you notes. ""I do think writing a thank-you note or gratitude letter gets your mind to dwell on something positive for a longer period, to think more deeply about it, because you have to put it not just in words, but in writing,"" VanderWeele says. ""It also deepens the relationship and builds that bond."" One less-recognized but valuable gratitude practice is called a ""savoring exercise,"" which builds on aspects of mindfulness. All that's required is ""pausing, looking around you, and taking in and enjoying everything that's good in your current setting,"" VanderWeele says. ""It's not a big leap to go from recognizing the good to expressing gratitude for what you have.""",6,0.19029438,-0.071364135
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/rem-sleep-what-is-it-why-is-it-important-and-how-can-you-get-more-of-it,"REM sleep: What is it, why is it important, and how can you get more of it?",1,"You may not think much about your dreams, other than occasionally wondering what they mean. But dreams are an important part of a sleep stage known as REM sleep. All sleep is important, but REM sleep plays a key role for brain health and function. What is REM sleep? Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is part of your body's normal sleep cycle. Each of your body's sleep cycles lasts about 80 to 100 minutes. Most of us experience four to six sleep cycles per night. Your first REM episode usually lasts for just a few minutes. They lengthen during each subsequent sleep cycle. Toward the end of the night, you may spend up to half an hour in REM sleep. REM sleep is when most of your dreams occur. During REM sleep, your heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, and breathing increase. Your eyes move rapidly, even though they are closed. The muscles in your arms and legs also become temporarily unable to move. This prevents you from acting out your dreams as you experience them. How much REM sleep do you need? Just like your overall slumber patterns, your REM sleep needs shift as you age. Newborns spend about half their snooze time in REM sleep. This starts to decrease by about 6 months, and continues to decline throughout childhood and the teen years. By age 20, most people spend just over 20% of their total shut-eye time in REM sleep. In older adults, time spent in REM sleep decreases slightly, to about 17% by age 80. Benefits of REM sleep Benefits of REM sleep include: Improved learning. During REM sleep, your brain prunes its synapses, the spaces in which brain cells communicate with one another. This appears to improve memory and problem-solving abilities. Mood regulation. REM sleep helps your brain process emotional memories, including ones associated with fear. Brain development. REM sleep is thought to aid in the development of the central nervous system, which includes your brain and spinal cord. That may be one reason why infants, particularly newborns, require so much REM sleep. Protection against dementia. People who get less REM sleep may have a greater risk of developing dementia, according to a study published in the journal Neurology. The researchers found that for every 1% reduction in REM sleep, there was a 9% increase in the risk of dementia. REM sleep is so important that if you don't get enough one night, your body will naturally increase it the next — you'll enter this stage earlier and stay in it for longer. This is known as REM rebound. How to get a good night's sleep Sleep is elusive for many of us — over 14% of American adults experience trouble falling asleep most days of the week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most REM sleep occurs at the end of the night, so getting enough total sleep helps to maximize REM sleep. Here are some tips to help you fall asleep and stay asleep: Stick to a sleep schedule. Set a regular bedtime and wake-up time and stick to it, even on weekends and when you're on vacation. This will help to regulate your sleep/wake cycle and make it easier for you to drift off at night. If you can't fall asleep within 20 to 30 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room, and do something relaxing like reading or knitting until you feel sleepy again. Don't stay in bed and watch the clock, which can make insomnia worse. If you have trouble sleeping one night, try not to sleep later or nap the next day. Doing so will disrupt your routine. You may be more tired that day, but you will sleep better that night. Limit alcohol and caffeine. A nightcap may help you nod off, but it suppresses your REM sleep. Caffeine also interferes with a good night's rest because it blocks brain chemicals that promote sleep. A study published in the Journal of Biological Rhythms found that three 150-milligram servings of caffeine a day — the equivalent of about 4-1/2 cups of coffee — affected REM sleep in young healthy men. Stay active. Exercise itself has been shown to slightly decrease REM sleep. But a 2024 study published in the journal Scientific Reports found that regular physical activity increases the amount of deep, restorative sleep that you get, which in turn boosts mood and energy. Try to exercise outside in the morning, since natural light helps to set your body's sleep/wake cycle. Relax before bed. Try the following calming rituals an hour or two before bedtime: Listen to soft music. Take a warm bath or shower. Stretch. Read. Avoid doing it on your phone or tablet, however, as those devices emit blue light that can interfere with sleep.",6,0.2313449,-0.23118238

Lawrence, and most young children would agree. But sometimes those beloved — that is, parents — would rather have some privacy and not be woken by a kicking child all night. So what can you do? Sleep-alone campaign step one: Understanding Before you do anything, be sure you understand why your child wants to sleep with you. It's most likely simply because they love you and feel most secure snuggled next to you, but before you work to change the habit, be sure that your child is ready for — and can handle — the change. If your child has been more clingy or irritable than usual, or is having difficult behaviors in any way, touch base with your doctor. Sleep-alone campaign step two: Changing habits Changing where your child sleeps is changing a habit. When it comes to changing habits, it helps to be practical and — this is really important — consistent. Here are some tips: You might also be interested in...

Not that anything can really take the place of you, but it is certainly easier to get them to stay in their own room or space if they like it there. Work with them to set up and decorate in a way they like. As you create the space, keep in mind what keeps your child awake. If it's light, use room-darkening curtains. If it's darkness, think night lights and flashlights. If it's noise, think about getting a white-noise machine. Set your child up for success. Please: no TVs or devices in the bedroom. They get in the way of healthy sleep. Have a consistent bedtime. Try not to let your child stay up late — or sleep late — on weekends. This way your child is more likely to be tired when you want them to be tired. Have a consistent, calming, and nurturing bedtime routine. Try to lower the energy level, perhaps with a bath and then some snuggling and reading stories. You want to help them wind down, and also be sure they end the day feeling loved. If your child has a hard time going to bed alone, it's okay to sit in the room and ease yourself out bit by bit after lights are out (you can literally move closer and closer to the door). Try to gradually shorten the time you are in the room. If your child gets out of bed, bring them back to their bed. This is the hard part: your child won't like it, and it can be exhausting for you if they keep creeping out of their bed and into yours. But if you give in and let them stay in your room, they will stay in your room. Every night. Use incentives. Make sure your child gets major kudos for any progress at all — and maybe earns something extra for staying in their own bed all night. Try to steer away from things, if possible, and think more about quality time (an extra story, a fun outing). If nothing is working, or your child is really upset, talk to your doctor. There may be more going on, and the two of you can work together to figure things out and help your child. Both of you deserve a restful night's sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/xylitol-what-to-know-about-this-popular-sugar-substitute,Xylitol: What to know about this popular sugar substitute,1,"The next time you pop a stick of sugar-free chewing gum in your mouth, take a look at the list of ingredients: Chances are you'll see an ingredient called xylitol. This sugar alcohol that tastes as sweet sugar but has fewer calories and negligible effects on blood sugar levels and insulin. For this reason, xylitol is used in many sugar-free gums, candies, baked goods, and diabetes-friendly foods. You'll also find xylitol in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other types of oral-care products. What is xylitol? A naturally occurring sugar alcohol found (in trace amounts) in many fruits and vegetables, xylitol can be processed from certain trees or from a plant fiber called xylan. It tastes about as sweet as regular sugar, but with only about half the calories per serving. Store-bought xylitol is a white, crystalline powder that can be used as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in recipes. What are the health benefits of xylitol? Eating too much sugar has been linked to a host of serious health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and tooth decay, so sugar-free sweeteners like xylitol are a compelling alternative. Xylitol is lower in calories and carbohydrates than sugar Xylitol is an excellent alternative to sugar for people who need to watch their weight, their blood sugar levels, or both. The sugar alcohol contains about 2.4 calories per gram (compared with 4 calories per gram in regular sugar). That makes it a good option for those who want to limit their simple carbohydrate intake, like people with diabetes or related metabolic syndromes. Xylitol doesn't cause blood sugar spikes When measured on the glycemic index (GI), a measure of how quickly food raises blood sugar, xylitol's GI score is 7, while regular sugar has a GI score of about 60. Xylitol's lower GI score correlates to more sustained energy without the spike and plunge associated with a sudden intake of regular sugar. Xylitol is good for your dental health Xylitol may help prevent tooth decay by reducing levels of bad bacteria in your mouth. According to a review published in the Journal of International Society of Preventive & Community Dentistry, consuming 5 to 10 grams per day of xylitol-containing products (like lozenges, candies, chewing gum, toothpaste, or mouth rinse) significantly prevented cavities and tooth decay compared with products that do not contain xylitol. So don't be surprised if your dentist recommends a xylitol-containing chewing gum at your next checkup. Xylitol in everyday products Many sugar-free products contain xylitol, including sugar-free candy, gum, baked goods, mints, cough syrup, chewable vitamins, some nut butters, ice cream, and oral hygiene products like toothpaste and mouthwash. You can also buy xylitol in bulk at most grocery stores or online retailers to use in cooking and baking. Possible side effects Most people can add xylitol to their diets without noticing any side effects. But some people may experience digestive problems like gas, bloating, and diarrhea if they consume too much too quickly. If you notice uncomfortable digestive problems, cut back your xylitol intake and reintroduce it slowly. And if you have other digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you may want to avoid sugar alcohols entirely. Additionally, an observational study published in the June issue of European Heart Journal found that high levels of xylitol were associated with greater risk of heart attack or stroke in adults years later. While more research is needed (the study was small, and observational versus experimental), it's best to keep your consumption of xylitol in check. Keep xylitol away from your dog Xylitol is highly toxic to dogs, causing dangerously low blood sugar, liver failure, and even death. Keep sugar-free products out of your dog's reach, and always check the ingredient label on ice cream and peanut butter before offering it to your pup.",0,0.34405482,0.25669724
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/high-lipoproteina-raises-heart-attack-risk-even-in-healthy-people,High lipoprotein(a) raises heart attack risk even in healthy people,1,"High blood levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a) — a variant of LDL cholesterol — may triple the risk of a heart attack, even among people with no other risks for heart disease, a new study confirms. The study included 6,238 people ages 43 to 65 who had their Lp(a) levels measured. Values in the top 10% — 216 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) or greater — were defined as high, while values in the lower 50% — less than 42 nmol/L — were defined as low. Most had conditions or habits that raised their heart disease risk, known as standard modifiable risk factors (SMuRFs). These include diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and unfavorable cholesterol levels. While about 4% of the study participants had all four SMuRFs, nearly 24% had none. Over a median follow-up period of nearly nine years, high Lp(a) levels were linked to nearly triple the risk of heart attack, regardless of the presence or number of SMuRFs a person had. Having a high Lp(a) was equivalent to having two SMuRFs. The findings support more widespread Lp(a) testing, according to the authors, whose study was published May 21, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Everything I eat lately tastes like it's been doused in salt, even if I know it hasn't. Why might this happen? A. This phenomenon certainly puts a damper on enjoying your food. But you should know there are many possible reasons food can taste oversalted. Do you have seasonal allergies? Sometimes postnasal drip leads to a salty sensation, as can an allergy to a particular food. Also on the list of potential culprits are gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, certain autoimmune conditions, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Even a chronically dry mouth — which can be a side effect of various medications — can make food taste especially salty. Even if you have one of these conditions, don't just accept living with a salty mouth. It's wise to mention the issue to your primary care doctor. She'll work with you to help improve your symptoms, which may be as easy as changing your medications. Otherwise, she may recommend some simple blood tests to investigate the cause.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/doomscrolling-dangers,Doomscrolling dangers,1,"What was the first thing you did when you woke up this morning? If you reached for your phone and scrolled through the news — scanning headline after headline blaring bad tidings — you're doing something called doomscrolling. And you're definitely not alone. It's an understandable urge: with wars raging across the world, frequent mass shootings, multiple climate disasters, and a polarized populace poised to vote in another presidential election, our newsfeeds are ablaze with distressing information. Many of us scan it hungrily, constantly; we hit refresh, and the stream starts anew. The phenomenon of doomscrolling — one of the Oxford English Dictionary's words of the year in 2020 — rose to prominence during the pandemic when our upended lives prodded us to relentlessly track the latest COVID casualties. But more than four years later, we're still living through tremendous social, political, and economic unrest, and doomscrolling has emerged as an insidious threat to our minds and bodies, Harvard experts say. With the media's propensity to blast mostly bad news (as the saying goes, ""if it bleeds, it leads""), ""we're not getting any messages about hope — it's all negativity,"" says Dr. Richard Mollica, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ""It has been one onslaught after the other,"" agrees Dr. Aditi Nerurkar, a lecturer in the Division of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""Our brains and bodies are expertly designed to handle short bursts of stress. But over the past several years, the stress just doesn't seem to end. Doomscrolling is our response to that."" Women particularly vulnerable Who's susceptible? Every last one of us. ""If you have a device, it's open season for doomscrolling,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. The behavior is rooted in our brain's limbic system — often referred to as the lizard or reptilian brain — that's dominated by a structure called the amygdala. It promotes self-preservation and drives the fight-or-flight response to danger, fueling us to troll for threats. ""Stress stokes our primary urge to scroll,"" she says. ""We're hypervigilant and scanning for danger. The more you scroll, the more you feel you need to."" But two key groups are especially vulnerable: women and people with a history of trauma, Dr. Mollica says. Women are hit harder by doomscrolling because ""most of violent media is about hurting women and children,"" he says. Meanwhile, people who've lived through violence doomscroll out of fear, says Dr. Mollica, who is also director of the Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""They don't feel safe in the world and want to get a handle on what's going on so they can calm their anxiety. But in these same people, doomscrolling acts as a trigger."" Physical and mental ripple effects Perhaps unsurprisingly, stomach-churning news has a tendency to turn our stomachs. But nausea is far from the only physical effect of doomscrolling. Others can include headaches, muscle tension, neck and shoulder pain, low appetite, difficulty sleeping, and even elevated blood pressure, according to Harvard experts. ""When people doomscroll for hours, they're sedentary for a long time too,"" Dr. Nerurkar notes. ""The ripple effects are vast and problematic."" In the wake of the pandemic, doomscrolling's mental health effects have been examined more extensively. An April 2023 research review published in Applied Research in Quality of Life analyzed three separate studies involving a total of about 1,200 adults, suggesting doomscrolling is linked to worse mental well-being and life satisfaction. An August 2024 study of 800 adults published in Computers in Human Behavior Reports reinforces those findings, suggesting doomscrolling evokes greater levels of existential anxiety — a feeling of dread or panic that arises when we confront the limitations of our existence. Yet another study in Computers in Human Behavior in April 2024 provided additional perspective, suggesting that employees who doomscroll while at work may become less engaged with their professional tasks. On a practical level, Dr. Nerurkar says, doomscrolling can give us ""popcorn brain,"" which happens when we spend too much time online. ""It's the real, biological phenomenon of feeling your brain is popping because you're being overstimulated online,"" she explains. ""Then it's hard to engage with the real world, which moves at a much slower pace."" How to cut back While keeping abreast of current events is essential, doomscrolling provides no extra benefits. ""We need to stay informed, but not at the expense of our mental health,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""And cutting back is not about abstinence; it's about decreasing reliance."" How to accomplish this? Strategies mainly revolve around creating ""digital boundaries that can give your brain and body a chance to recalibrate to normal,"" she says. Dr. Nerurkar and Dr. Mollica suggest these approaches: Keep your phone off your nightstand. That doesn't mean it can't be in the bedroom, but keeping your phone out of easy reach means you can't compulsively grab it upon waking. ""It could be the biggest game changer for your stress from doomscrolling,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""You're acclimating yourself instead to wake up to the light, look at your bed partner, and go to the bathroom and brush your teeth, creating a buffer to your stress response."" Follow suit in your work space. Similarly, place your phone in a desk drawer or 10 or more feet away from where you're planted during working hours. Don't bring your phone to the dinner table. At mealtime, leave your phone more than an arm's length away, and set it to silent mode. Switch your phone to grayscale. This type of visual boundary makes scrolling less enticing by dialing back the saturation levels of colors on your screen. ""There's some early data that this decreases screen time,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. Opt out of notifications. These types of beeps and dings — which alert us to new headlines, emails, messages, and the like — are self-selected. Opting out is as simple as reviewing your phone's settings. ""This is about re-establishing some boundaries,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""Are you using your device, or is your device using you?"" Focus on community news. Local headlines tend to be less doom-and-gloom and more uplifting. ""Stick to the environment you live in,"" Dr. Mollica says. Just say no. Tell people who are sharing depressing or violent stories that you're not interested. ""This puts you in control,"" Dr. Mollica says. ""You're not giving your power to someone else."" Focus on the good. Volunteer at a charity or another altruistic organization such as an animal shelter. Or take part in emotionally freeing activities, like a dance class or nature walks. ""You need to share positive emotional experiences with others,"" Dr. Mollica says. Talk to your doctor. If you find you can't stop doomscrolling or that it makes you extremely upset, it's time to discuss it with a professional. ""A small percentage of people really need professional help, and the best place to start is by talking to your primary care doctor about it,"" Dr. Mollica says. ""Certain problems are very hard to overcome on your own."" Image: © Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images",5,-0.26290658,-0.11292924
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cooling-off-heartburn,Cooling off heartburn,1,"At some point, everyone experiences heartburn — that deep, painful burning sensation in the chest that can be so intense it's mistaken for a heart attack. Heartburn (also known as acid reflux) occurs when stomach acid flows backward into the esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. It often happens when you eat too quickly or too much, or after you eat rich, spicy, or acidic foods. Heartburn usually goes away on its own, but sometimes you need an over-the-counter remedy to get relief. For more severe and ongoing heartburn, you might need stronger medication. Which should you use, and when? Here's a breakdown. Occasional heartburn For now-and-then heartburn, use antacids. They quickly neutralize digestive acids in the stomach and esophagus. ""They work well for people with mild, occasional heartburn and provide immediate relief,"" says Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Liquid antacids provide faster relief, but many people find tablets more convenient. There are three categories of over-the-counter antacids: magnesium-based (Maalox, Mylanta), aluminum-based (Amphojel), and calcium-based (Tums, Rolaids). ""There aren't data to support whether one works better than the others,"" says Dr. Chan. Other products, like Gaviscon, contain both aluminum and magnesium. The combination of ingredients creates a foam layer when ingested, which floats to the top of the stomach to help block acid reflux. Another option is a seltzer (Alka-Seltzer), which has sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) as the active ingredient. ""These are the least powerful antacids,"" says Dr. Chan. They contain high levels of sodium, so do not take them if you are on a salt-restricted diet or have heart failure, high blood pressure, or kidney problems. Recurring heartburn If heartburn strikes many times a week, symptoms become more severe, or antacids don't work, you can try an over-the-counter H2 blocker. These work by blocking histamine, a chemical that signals the stomach to produce acid. ComBrands include famotidine (Pepcid) and cimetidine (Tagamet). H2 blockers are taken twice a day for one to two weeks. People whose heartburn is troublesome only at night often need only a single dose taken in the evening or at bedtime. ""H2 blockers are fine to take in the short term, but check with your doctor if you need to continue taking one after a few weeks,"" says Dr. Chan. ""They can prescribe a stronger H2 blocker if needed."" Also consult your doctor before taking an H2 blocker if you take a blood thinner, antidepressant, or blood pressure medication. Making changes If you take medication to manage recurring or persistent heartburn, you also should focus on adopting healthy lifestyle habits. They help reduce your dependence on drugs, and may even make it possible for you to stop taking them. For example: Weight loss and exercise. Losing excess weight and engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise daily can prevent flare-ups and reduce symptoms. Avoid trigger foods. Keep a daily food diary in which you list the foods and beverages that coincide with heartburn symptoms. Choose one and remove it from your diet for two weeks. Then add it back and note whether symptoms return. Repeat the process as needed until you find your trigger foods and drinks. Eat smaller meals. A large meal can remain in the stomach for several hours, increasing the risk of acid reflux. Eat frequent smaller meals a day instead of three large ones. Persistent heartburn If symptoms become intense or linger longer than two to three weeks despite taking an H2 blocker, you should consult your doctor. ""Persistent heartburn is caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD,"" says Dr. Chan. If you are diagnosed with GERD, your doctor will probably recommend a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), the strongest stomach acid inhibitor medication. PPIs — such as omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and esomeprazole (Nexium) — inhibit certain cells from ""pumping"" acid into the stomach, which lowers acid levels and reduces heartburn pain. PPIs are available over the counter or by prescription and are usually taken once daily. ""While both nonprescription and prescription PPIs work basically the same, your doctor will advise you on which one you need,"" says Dr. Chan. Long-term treatment with a PPI is often necessary, as heartburn usually returns when treatment ends. However, once your heartburn is under control, you may continue with a lower-dose PPI or switch to an H2 blocker. Image: © decade3d/Getty Images",9,0.29013655,0.01768867
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/music-as-medicine,Music as medicine,1,"Just a few gentle strums of ukelele music can immediately transport us to a place of calm. This mysterious effect is one reason board-certified music therapist Lorrie Kubicek helps many patients take up the easy-to-play instrument after they're diagnosed with cancer or another major health condition — transforming a fraught situation into a constructive one. ""Instead of saying 'I have to go to the hospital for my chemo,' patients start saying, 'I have to go to the hospital for my ukelele lesson,'"" says Kubicek, co-director of the Katherine A. Gallagher Integrated Therapies Program at Harvard-affiliated Mass General Cancer Center. But music therapy is far more than a pleasant diversion, exemplifying how the art and science of medicine can work in tandem. With ancient roots — the Chinese character for medicine includes the character for music — the approach also helped rehabilitate World War II veterans' minds, bodies, and spirits. Characterized by personally tailored music interventions such as singing, songwriting, playing an instrument, listening to music, or moving to the beat, music therapy strikes a chord in many areas of medicine. Evidence increasingly suggests it helps people better manage disease symptoms and treatment side effects by curbing stress, soothing pain, promoting sleep, and boosting focus. ""Music connects you to a part of yourself that's well, and that's true no matter what patient population we're working with,"" Kubicek says. ""Music remains, no matter the challenges a person is facing."" Personalized approach Music therapy isn't the same thing as music medicine, in which patients simply wear headphones and listen to their favorite music for relaxation or distraction while undergoing medical treatment. It also doesn't require any musical background or experience to participate or benefit. The therapy begins with a one-on-one assessment with a music therapist to explore how each person relates to music and what problems they may face. ""We combine this information with evidence-based interventions to help patients feel, deal, or heal as quickly as possible,"" Kubicek says. ""We figure out how music can help you move toward your goals in a way that sets you up for success."" Building on decades of research, recent studies indicate this type of intervention can provide important relief by reducing anxiety during medical treatment, according to a 2021 research review published in Psychiatry Research. ""We see this all the time,"" she says. ""Because of music's connection to the limbic system in the brain, it can help you access the relaxation response and calm your nervous system, slowing down your breathing. It really helps shift your mind from what it's stuck on or worried about and helps you land in the moment you're in."" People with Alzheimer's disease were the focus of a research review published online in March 2023 by Alzheimer's Research and Therapy, which suggested that music therapy improved memory, attention, and orientation in these patients. And for people with psychiatric illnesses such as depression, Kubicek says, music therapy can ""bring energy and joy back at a very dark time in people's lives. It's also really beautiful to see how music can connect people of different ages and stages, cognitive abilities, and cultures."" Stretching the benefits Regardless of diagnosis, music therapy can hit the right notes as long as you feel a connection to music. ""You don't need to be a musician. You just need to love music and have something you want to develop or nurture,"" she says. You also don't need to wait for your doctor to offer music therapy. Ask her — or your local hospital or clinic — to refer you to a program. ""If you do have a specific diagnosis, you can always ask your health care team,"" Kubicek says. You can also find a music therapist near you through the American Music Therapy Association. To maximize the therapy's benefits, find a balance between taking risks and staying in your comfort zone, Kubicek advises. ""When we're exploring music, often we're trying something new for the first time,"" she says. ""Find that 'stretch zone,' because you don't know the full effect of what music can do for you until you try."" Image: © Aflo Images/Getty Images",8,0.015108682,-0.09508175
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drinks-on-a-plane-consider-saying-no,Drinks on a plane: Consider saying no,1,"Some people enjoy having a bit of bubbly when jetting off to a new locale, perhaps as a way to toast the start of an adventure. But drinking champagne or any other alcoholic beverage on an airplane might pose risks ranging from falls to heart attacks. This is particularly true if you intend to sleep on the flight, such as on a long-haul overnight flight. So it might be time to rethink your drink order. Your body on a plane Before you even take a sip of alcohol, your body experiences physiological effects of being high above sea level: there's less atmospheric pressure to force oxygen into red blood cells for delivery throughout your body, and blood oxygen drops from normal levels of 96%–100% to about 90%, or even below 90%. Your body has a way to compensate for that. You breathe faster to take in more oxygen. Your heart rate increases to move blood through your system faster. However, reduced blood oxygen levels and increased heart rates can be dangerous for people with a heart condition. Complicating factors Small dips in blood oxygen can become more pronounced on a plane when you add other factors into the mix, and drinking alcohol is one of them. ""Some studies suggest that alcohol impairs the ability of red blood cells to take up oxygen by altering hemoglobin, the molecule that actually carries the oxygen,"" says Dr. Matthew Mosquera, medical director of the Alcohol, Drugs, and Addiction Inpatient Program at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. The following factors can also lead to lower blood oxygen: Aging: Our ability to adapt to changes in blood oxygen levels declines as we age. Sleeping: Breathing normally slows during sleep, even on an airplane. Underlying conditions: Less oxygen gets to your lungs if you have lung disease, sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep), or heart problems. What's the risk? The more contributors to low blood oxygen you have, the harder it becomes for your body to compensate, especially on a plane. That was illustrated in a study published online June 3, 2024, by Thorax. Researchers wanted to know more about the combined effects of alcohol consumption and airplane cabin pressure during sleep on a plane. They randomly assigned 48 healthy people (ages 18 to 40) to spend two nights sleeping at normal air pressure or at the equivalent of airplane cabin pressure. Participants drank alcohol (the equivalent of two beers or two glasses of wine) before one of the nights and were sober for the other. They also wore devices measuring their blood oxygen and heart rate. Compared to sleeping in normal air pressure, sleeping in airplane cabin pressure made blood oxygen levels lower and heart rates higher. Combining drinking and sleeping when in airplane cabin pressure made oxygen levels even lower and heart rate even higher. ""Drinking and sleeping on a plane puts a big strain on your body, especially your cardiovascular system,"" Dr. Mosquera says. ""And there's even more strain if you have heart or lung disease. It places you at a higher risk for a heart attack or stroke."" Other alcohol risks on a plane Drinking alcohol on a plane poses additional health risks. For example, it increases your fall risk causes dehydration, which adds to the strain on your cardiovascular system impairs your judgment and ability to focus (which you don't want when it's time to get off the plane) may help you fall asleep, but reduces the time you spend in good-quality deep sleep. What you should do Is it best to pass on alcohol when the drink cart approaches? That depends. ""If you're healthy, drinking in moderation might be okay,"" Dr. Mosquera says. However, he urges you to consider the following: Think twice about drinking alcohol and taking certain medications. Alcohol can worsen drowsiness from drugs that make you sleepy. Drink extra water. This will help your body flush out the alcohol, and prevent dehydration caused by alcohol. Be mindful of your balance. Take your time going from a sitting position to standing, to avoid falls. And if you have heart or lung disease, sleep apnea, or chronic lung disease, or if you've had a stroke in the past — especially if you plan to sleep on the flight — it may be wisest not to drink alcohol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/protect-your-skin-during-heat-waves-heres-how-202408143066,Protect your skin during heat waves — here's how,1,"Global average temperatures have soared in 2024, surpassing records set just last year. Extreme heat poses numerous health risks, some of which are visible on our skin. Understanding how heat affects your skin can help you take measures to prevent or ease heat rash, eczema, rosacea, the discoloration of melasma, and many other skin conditions sparked or worsened by high temperatures. How does heat affect your skin? Heat waves can provoke or worsen several skin conditions. Heat rash (miliaria) occurs due to obstruction of sweat ducts on the skin, which are responsible for helping the body maintain a normal temperature by releasing water to the surface of the skin. As these sweat glands get blocked with excessive sweat on an extremely hot day, they do not function properly and red itchy bumps develop. Grover disease, a rash of small, red, itchy bumps on the chest and back, can also be triggered or worsened by excessive heat and sweating. Often this clears up within a few weeks or months. Less often symptoms may persist for years, with flares during the summer months. Eczema is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy plaques that affects millions of people in the United States. Increased sweating during heat waves can lead to skin irritation and inflammation, aggravating eczema symptoms. Dehydration caused by fluid loss through sweating can make the skin more susceptible to eczema flare-ups. Rosacea, which causes facial redness, visible blood vessels, and acne-like bumps, is also heat-sensitive. Heat causes blood vessels to dilate as the body attempts to cool itself, resulting in visible redness and flushing. High temperatures, especially combined with sun exposure, can cause flare ups. Melasma. Hyperpigmentation disorders like melasma also worsen with heat. Melasma is characterized by irregular dark patches on the face and is often triggered by UV exposure from the sun. Heat can increase the activity of melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment, making these patches more pronounced. Additionally, the combined effects of heat and UV radiation accelerate collagen and elastin degradation, leading to premature aging and loss of skin elasticity. Skin cancer risk rises with increased exposure to UV radiation. Heat waves — now beginning earlier, ending later, and lasting longer — contribute to UV exposure, particularly among people who work outdoors. And preliminary research suggests prolonged exposure to high temperatures may further boost skin cancer risk. This could be of particular concern for firefighters, who face extended exposure to extreme heat. Heat waves, air pollution, and skin During heat waves, levels of environmental pollutants like ozone and particulate matter can rise. And reactions between these pollutants, heat, and UV radiation spawn secondary pollutants such as peroxyacetyl nitrates (PANs). Pollutants like these can irritate the skin and contribute to inflammation through oxidative stress and DNA damage, so inflammatory conditions such as eczema and rosacea may worsen. Can heat affect medications? High temperatures compromise the effectiveness of certain medications. For instance, EpiPens, which are crucial for managing life-threatening allergic reactions, can lose their potency when exposed to high temperatures. Check the instructions on all of your medicines to see which ones should be stored in a cool, dry place or refrigerated. If you're not sure which medicines might be affected by heat, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. Retinoids in skin care products, antibiotics taken for acne, and immunomodulators for autoimmune diseases can make skin more susceptible to sun damage. This can lead to severe sunburns or rashes known as photodermatoses. If you experience this, contact your health care team for advice. Protect your skin when temperatures climb Keep skin cool Wear light, breathable clothing. Choose natural fibers like cotton and linen to help regulate body temperature and prevent sweat-induced skin issues. Avoid synthetic fabrics, which can trap heat and moisture. Take cool baths or showers. Use cool or tepid water to bathe. Avoid hot showers, which can strip the skin of natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation. Find cool spaces. If your home is not air-conditioned, seek out cooler places and ways to cool off during heat waves. Keep skin hydrated Drink ample water and eat water-rich foods. Foods like watermelon and cucumbers can provide additional hydration. Moisturize your skin. Apply light, non-comedogenic moisturizers immediately after bathing. Look for ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, which are beneficial for enhancing skin hydration. Limit exposure to sun and pollution Use protective clothing. Wear wide-brimmed hats, UV-blocking sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts to shield the skin from harmful radiation. Wear sunscreen. Apply broad-spectrum mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, or iron oxide to protect against UV radiation and pollutants. Use topical antioxidants. Use products like vitamin C in your morning skin care routine to mitigate oxidative stress. Wash up. Cleansing face and body at the end of the day may help you limit skin exposure to pollutants while also rinsing off any sunscreen residue.",9,0.008979546,-0.11698072
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/lifestyle-strategies-to-help-prevent-natural-age-related-decline-in-testosterone,Lifestyle strategies to help prevent natural age-related decline in testosterone,1,"As men get older, their testosterone levels naturally decrease, which can cause undesirable symptoms for some. However, adopting healthy lifestyle habits can help improve or maintain testosterone levels. What is testosterone and what does it do? Testosterone is a hormone primarily produced in the testes. It plays a crucial role in male development and characteristics, influencing muscle mass, bone density, and sex drive. It's also important for regulating mood and cognitive function. Testosterone levels change throughout life: they are low before puberty, increase sharply during puberty, and then gradually decrease by about 1% each year, although there are some exceptions. What can cause levels of testosterone to drop? Signals from the brain to the pituitary gland regulate testosterone production in men. The pituitary gland, which is found at the base of the brain, sends messages to the testes to produce testosterone. A ""feedback loop"" carefully monitors levels of this hormone in the blood. Anything that affects this system can contribute to declining testosterone levels. Aging is the most common cause, but other genetic and acquired conditions can also lead to drops in testosterone. These include: obesity chronic diseases, such as kidney disease, diabetes, lung disease, and cirrhosis critical illness, such as a heart attack, surgery, or head trauma certain medications, such as glucocorticoids (steroids) and opioids congenital disorders, such as Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome stress sleep apnea tumors. What are the symptoms of low testosterone? Many men with low testosterone never have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, low testosterone can cause a range of effects. Some symptoms are general, such as fatigue, poor concentration, and mood changes. Others are more specific, such as: reduced sex drive erectile dysfunction infertility physical changes including decreased muscle mass, increased body fat, and thinning hair. If you have any of these symptoms, ask your doctor if it might be related to low testosterone. He or she can order a blood test to check the level. Because blood testosterone levels can fluctuate, it's important to do the test in the morning before 10 a.m. In general, a normal total testosterone level is 300 ng/dL or higher. Natural ways to help maintain testosterone levels Certain lifestyle habits can help slow the natural testosterone decline that comes with age. Doctors often recommend a trial of intense lifestyle changes for men with low testosterone before considering medications. Here are some natural ways to maintain and improve testosterone levels as you age. Maintain a healthy weight and lose weight if needed Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for testosterone levels. Excess body fat, particularly around the abdomen, can contribute to lower testosterone. Losing weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can help boost testosterone production up to 30%, according to some research. Exercise Regular physical activity is one of the best ways to maintain healthy testosterone levels. Both resistance training like weightlifting, and cardiovascular exercises such as running or swimming, can increase testosterone. The largest improvements are seen with moderate- or high-intensity resistance exercises involving large muscle groups, such as squats and bench presses. Other lifestyle changes Other factors that can affect testosterone levels include: Diet. Well-rounded diets full of healthy fats, proteins, and nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables support healthy testosterone production. Foods that have been linked to increased testosterone include onions, oysters, fatty fish (which contains healthy omega-3 fats), and extra virgin olive oil. Alcohol. Excessive alcohol consumption can lower testosterone levels, impair sexual function, and reduce sperm count due to hormone disruption. Reduce or avoid alcohol, or at least limit your intake to no more than one drink per day. Smoking. Nicotine found in cigarettes and chewing tobacco has been linked to lower testosterone levels, though some studies suggest smoking may not affect or could even increase these levels. However, smoking can negatively affect male reproductive health, including sperm count, motility, and morphology. Quitting smoking may help some men restore a normal testosterone level. Environmental toxins. Chemicals found in certain plastics, including bisphenol A or BPA, disrupt hormone-producing glands and have been associated with decreased testosterone levels and reduced sperm count. Try to avoid BPA-containing products such as plastic bottles, containers, and certain canned foods. Instead, look for ""BPA-free"" labels. The role of sleep in testosterone production Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining testosterone levels. Most testosterone release occurs during sleep, particularly during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage. Sleep apnea, a condition in which you stop breathing for short periods while you are asleep, can negatively affect hormone levels, including testosterone. Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night to support healthy hormone production. If you have sleep apnea or are concerned you may have symptoms of this condition, talk with your doctor about treatment options. Manage stress to help libido Chronic stress can also negatively impact testosterone levels and libido. High stress increases cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with testosterone production. Stress affects not only the body but also the mind. It can cause mental distractions and make it hard to focus on or enjoy sex. Additionally, stress can impact your mood, potentially leading to anxiety and depression, both of which can reduce your interest in sex. Enhancing mental well-being through relaxation techniques and mindfulness, and adopting a healthier lifestyle to minimize the negative effects of stress, are important for maintaining testosterone levels and healthy libido.",1,0.26663265,-0.13769762
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-palpitations-identifying-possible-causes-and-managing-triggers,Heart palpitations: Identifying possible causes and managing triggers,1,"Do you occasionally feel your heart doing flip-flops when you're stressed or nervous — for example, right before you give a big presentation? These are called heart palpitations. They are very common, but they can feel scary. Here's a closer look at what heart palpitations are, what they feel like, causes, and, when you might need to worry. What are heart palpitations? Have you ever noticed your heart seeming to beat more forcefully or faster than usual? This is known as heart palpitations. They happen to a lot of people — in fact, they are one of the top reasons people see their primary care provider or even a cardiologist. Heart palpitations may feel uncomfortable, but most of the time they're harmless. They should always be checked out by your doctor, however, in case they're being triggered by an underlying medical condition. What do heart palpitations feel like? If you have heart palpitations, you may feel like your heart is pounding or racing. You may also feel it not just in your chest, but in your neck. Some people describe a sensation of ""flip-flopping"" in their chest, where their heart seems to skip a beat. Some people experience heart palpitations all day. Others just notice heart palpitations at night, during exercise, or in times of stress. What causes heart palpitations? There are many different causes of heart palpitations. These include: Physical stress or strong emotions. Heart palpitations can be brought on by physical stress, such as intense exercise, or a fever. They can be triggered by strong emotions as well. When you are upset, your body releases stress hormones that can affect your heart rate. Heart conditions. Sometimes heart palpitations are due to an electrical misfire in your heart that causes it to beat quickly or erratically. One of the most common causes is atrial fibrillation, a rapid, irregular heartbeat. Hormonal changes. Up to 42% of perimenopausal women and 54% of postmenopausal women report that they experience heart palpitations. Certain substances. Caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine can all trigger heart palpitations. Metabolic changes. Low blood sugar can lead to heart palpitations. You may also experience them if your body produces too much thyroid hormone, a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Do you need to worry about heart palpitations? See your doctor if you have heart palpitations; most of the time, they can find the trigger. The evaluation usually involves a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical signals of your heart. If you have heart palpitations but a normal ECG, your doctor may ask you to wear a heart monitor for a couple of weeks. You push a button on the portable device when you feel a heart palpitation, and that information is sent to your doctor. It can help to pinpoint a cause. Sometimes, heart palpitations can indicate a heart attack or stroke if they occur along with other symptoms. Call 911 if you also experience: shortness of breath chest pain or pressure — it may be constant, or it may come and go chest discomfort that radiates into your arms, back, stomach, neck, or jaw sweating, nausea, or lightheadedness. Lifestyle changes to prevent heart palpitations If your heart palpitations aren't due to an underlying medical condition, the following lifestyle changes may help to prevent them or reduce their frequency. Try vagal maneuvers. These are physical movements you can do to stimulate your vagus nerve, which helps to control your heart rate. Your doctor may recommend that you: cough hold your breath and bear down, like you are having a bowel movement place an ice-cold towel over your face. Steer clear of certain substances. Limit caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, certain soft drinks, and even chocolate. Don't have more than one alcoholic beverage per day. More than that can promote palpitations in some people, and it increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. In addition, don't smoke or consume nicotine-containing products. Tweak your medications. Certain drugs can trigger heart palpitations. These include asthma inhalers and some over-the-counter cough and cold medications. Your doctor may be able to suggest alternatives. Manage stress. If you are depressed or anxious, your body releases stress hormones that can impact your heart rate. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to help you manage your emotions, such as regular exercise, talk therapy, and relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga. Medical treatment for heart palpitations If your palpitations are due to an underlying medical condition such as atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, or hyperthyroidism, your doctor can recommend medication to get that condition under control.",9,0.17807218,-0.28895134
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-big-pharma-admits-mrna-vaccine-causes-cancer.html,Big Pharma admits mRNA vaccine causes CANCER,0,"Pharmaceutical giants have finally admitted that the experimental mRNA vaccine can cause cancer . The revelation that DNA contamination can lead to birth defects or cancer surfaced when Dr. Robert Malone, the biochemist who helped invent the mRNA vaccine, made an appearance at House of Representatives hearing led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). According to Malone, Moderna has a patent that acknowledges RNA is preferable to DNA in vaccines due to risks of insertional mutagenesis, which might activate oncogenes or inhibit tumor suppressor genes. ""Moderna has a patent on the use of RNA for vaccines,"" Malone stated. ""And in that, Moderna explicitly acknowledges that RNA is superior to DNA for vaccine purposes because problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis that could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes."" ""FDA [ Food and Drug Administration ] says they're not aware of any concerns, but Moderna, in its patent, lays out the same concerns about DNA in insertional mutagenesis and genotoxicity,"" Malone continued. He added that Moderna knew DNA was a contaminant but was left in because of how they make it. ""They use DNA to make RNA, and then they degrade the DNA and then they have to purify the degraded DNA away from the RNA and the process they are using is not that good,"" he said. Another Big Pharma company also eventually acknowledged that its jabs, which were meant to ""cure"" COVID-19, are also contaminated with cancer-causing DNA fragments. In the documentation to regulatory bodies, Pfizer omitted information about the presence of Simian Virus 40 sequences in its vaccine. The documentation suggests that there are certain DNA sequences present in the vials that are normally not allowed in anything that is going to go into humans, ""not the least of which is an antibiotic resistance gene,"" Malone explained. “They include these sequences from SV 40 – not the whole virus, but highly active promoter sequences – which is exactly the thing that the FDA in their older regulations said must be avoided because it confers even more risk for insertional mutagenesis.” He added that the FDA did not take the raw DNA sequences, reconstruct those plasmid maps and look at them themselves. Instead, they took for granted what Pfizer had given them. “And now this is all coming out because of what these researchers found,” he further said. Malone warned that the potential consequences for jab recipients are ""anything that is associated with DNA damage, i.e., birth defects and cancer being the most notable ones."" (Related: Moderna’s mRNA COVID jab 30% more deadly than Pfizer’s, VAERS data shows .) Get ready for the ""updated COVID-19 vaccines"" Despite the recent admission, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s updated vaccine is expected to be available in either August or September. According to public health officials, they preferred the term ""updated vaccines"" in line with the need to formulate a new vaccine every year to match circulating variants like what they did for the flu shot. ""Historically, when we're talking about COVID vaccines, we're talking about boosters that would happen at some time post your previous vaccine,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, the chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital. ""Now we're targeting annual vaccines for COVID-19 that are similar to flu. It's a reformulation based on what's circulating, and this is why we're talking about an annual campaign rather than a booster."" The updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccines will target the JN.1 lineage of the virus, which is claimed to be an offshoot of the omicron variant. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available for six-month-old babies and adults while the Novavax vaccine will be available for those aged 12 and older. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Americans receive the updated 2024-25 vaccine when it becomes available. ""CDC recommends everyone ages six months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the potentially serious outcomes of COVID-19 this fall and winter whether or not they have ever previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine,"" the CDC website indicated. The updated jab is not considered a booster. ""We have to remember that this virus is constantly changing and that your protection from previous infection or previous vaccines declines over time,"" Brownstein said. ""Making sure that you receive the most updated formulations of vaccine will ensure that you have the most recent protection and we of course assumed that like previous years.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/weighing-in-on-weight-gain-from-antidepressants-202408023063,Weighing in on weight gain from antidepressants,1,"If you're struggling with depression, the most important question about taking an antidepressant is whether it will work. But another question on your mind may be whether it will fuel weight gain. A new study provides some context by suggesting how much weight, on average, people taking one of eight commonly used antidepressants might expect to gain. This insight is valuable, since people with depression often stop taking antidepressants because they don't like the effect on their weight, a Harvard expert says. ""It's important to acknowledge that weight gain is a key reason that some people decide to stop antidepressants, even if they're otherwise working well,"" says Dr. Roy Perlis, associate chief of psychiatric research at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""It's also a reason people may be reluctant to start them in the first place, even if they're quite depressed or anxious."" What did the study look at? Published July 2024 in Annals of Internal Medicine, the new study drew on data from more than 183,000 people between ages 20 and 80. Their average age was 48, and 65% were women. Most were overweight or obese at the study's start. The researchers analyzed participants' electronic health records and body mass index. They gauged weight gain or loss at regular intervals — six, 12, and 24 months — after people began taking an antidepressant for the first time. The study compared the weight-related effects of sertraline (Zoloft) to seven other antidepressant medications: escitalopram (Lexapro) paroxetine (Paxil) duloxetine (Cymbalta) citalopram (Celexa) fluoxetine (Prozac) venlafaxine (Effexor) bupropion (Wellbutrin). What did the research find? The antidepressants led to the following average weight gain: sertraline: Nearly 0.5 pounds at six months; 3.2 pounds at 24 months escitalopram: 1.4 pounds at six months; 3.6 pounds at 24 months paroxetine: 1.4 pounds at six months; 2.9 pounds at 24 months duloxetine: 1.2 pounds at six months; 1.7 pounds at 24 months. Citalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine didn't confer lower or higher odds of weight gain than Zoloft, the study found. And only bupropion was associated with a small amount of weight loss — 0.25-pounds — at six months. But that trend reversed at 24 months, when bupropion led to an average weight gain of 1.2 pounds. What does the study tell us? ""Weight gain is common among antidepressant users, even if the amounts gained on average are modest,"" says Dr. Perlis, who was not involved in this new study. It underscores similar findings from other studies of antidepressants, including research he published with colleagues a decade ago. ""While differences in weight gain for specific antidepressants tend to be small, there are certainly some — like bupropion — that tend to cause less weight gain,"" he notes. It's crucial to keep in mind that the study points out average weight gain. Many people taking antidepressants won't gain any weight and others could gain more. ""Still, having average values to work with — and seeing that these averages line up well with prior studies — at least lets us give people a sense of what they might expect,"" he says. ""One caution is that some people lose weight as a result of depression, which can impact appetite,"" he adds, ""so some of what we're seeing may be people regaining weight they'd lost as their depression or anxiety improves."" What additional limitations did the study have? Other limitations may have shaped the findings. The study was observational, meaning it cannot prove that antidepressants cause weight changes, only that they were linked with them. It wasn't a randomized, controlled trial — considered the gold standard in research — and the participants taking antidepressants weren't compared to a control group not taking the medications. Additionally, only about one in three participants was still taking their initially prescribed medication six months after the study started. That makes it difficult to link any later weight changes with a specific medication. ""As with any study that's not randomized, we don't know if the differences between medicines could reflect other differences in who gets prescribed these medicines,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""But, for circumstances where a randomized trial is unrealistic, health records can be a helpful way of trying to study side effects and at least generate a partial answer to these important questions."" What else should you consider? Another thing to consider, if you're taking an antidepressant, is what types of side effects you're willing to tolerate in pursuit of its mood-smoothing benefits. ""The best way to manage side effects is to anticipate them — to have an open conversation with your doctor about the potential risks and how we'll manage them if they occur,"" Dr. Perlis says. What can you discuss with your doctor? If weight gain is a particular concern for you, you may also wish to consider nondrug treatments for depression. They include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy that teaches people to become aware of their thought patterns and adjust them during stressful moments to reframe their thinking. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a brain stimulation therapy that is noninvasive. It uses an electromagnetic coil placed on the scalp to deliver magnetic pulses that stimulate nerve cells to brain regions involved in depression. ""We know that certain kinds of talk therapies, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, can be very effective for treating depression and anxiety disorders,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""Whether people choose talk therapy or antidepressant medications can depend on their preference. It's important to have multiple options.""",8,0.20724027,-0.15140457
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/top-5-ways-to-reduce-crippling-hand-pain,Top 5 ways to reduce crippling hand pain,1,"Hand pain is more than just annoying. The stiffness and swelling that go along with hand pain can sap strength and diminish the ability to carry out routine functions, like buttoning clothes. One common cause of hand pain is osteoarthritis—when the shock-absorbing cartilage between bones in the finger joints and at the base of the thumb becomes worn or damaged. Hand pain can also result from nerve conditions, like the pain and tingling you feel when there is pressure on the median nerve in the wrist (the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome) or the ulnar nerve near the elbow. Sometimes hand pain results from tendinitis, an inflammation of the tissue that attaches muscles to the bones. Here are five methods to help manage hand pain, retain hand function, and avoid surgery. 1. Splinting A splint stabilizes the position of your fingers, thumb, or wrist. You can wear a splint for a few weeks if arthritis flares, so the inflammation can settle down. 2. Injections An injection of a corticosteroid into a joint can reduce inflammation. The relief it provides can last for many months. For some people the amount of relief diminishes with subsequent injections. 3. NSAIDs A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) helps relieve hand pain by blocking enzymes that produce pain and swelling, but it's not effective for carpal tunnel syndrome. Long-term use of oral NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are linked to ulcers, stomach bleeding, liver damage, and increased risk of heart attacks. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac (Voltaren), pose less risk. 4. Heat and cold Heat can loosen hand stiffness. Even a hot shower will do the job. Cold is effective for hand pain that results from activity, such as playing golf. Apply it in the form of flexible gel pads you keep in the freezer, or even bags of frozen peas or corn, which conform well to the three-dimensional complexities of the hand. 5. Exercises and stretches These focus on your hand's tendons and muscles. A physical therapist or occupational therapist can guide you through exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles, which can help absorb the stress on joints in the hand and reduce pain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tackling-the-top-stressors-for-dementia-caregivers,Tackling the top stressors for dementia caregivers,1,"Caregiving is a demanding job that you commit to out of love, loyalty, compassion, and often necessity. And when the person you're caring for has dementia, the job is especially difficult. It comes with a long list of physical, financial, logistical, and emotional challenges. Which are the most difficult, and how can you cope? Recent findings A 2024 Alzheimer's Association survey highlights the stressors caregivers say are most burdensome. The survey included more than 1,500 current or recent unpaid caregivers of adults ages 50 or older with cognitive problems. The top five stressors were costs, coordinating numerous doctor visits, securing doctor appointments, finding the right doctors, and getting help to take a break (respite care). Only half of the caregivers surveyed had ever spoken with health care professionals for guidance. Physical and emotional tolls Caring for a person with dementia is physically and emotionally demanding. For example, you might need to help a loved one with bathing, dressing, eating, and getting in and out of a car. It takes physical strength and stamina. Caregiving also puts you through an emotional wringer. It's common to feel frustration with the unpredictability of your loved one's behavior: one day they understand and recognize you, but the next day they don't. You might feel helpless if you don't know how to communicate with a loved one or how to cope with dementia-specific behaviors such as sundowning (meltdowns at the end of each day). You might feel anguish that they might not be getting adequate care. Above all, you probably feel grief at gradually losing the individual you once knew. ""Caregivers might also experience anger from the demands of nonstop caregiving. Then, recognizing their anger, caregivers might immediately feel guilty about resenting the loved one or having a desire to take time for themselves,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. The combination of stressors puts caregivers at high risk for burnout, high blood pressure, sleep problems, depression, isolation, weight changes, and even premature death. What you can do Resolving caregiving challenges is an ongoing process. Here are some ways to get started. For logistical challenges: Talk to your loved one's doctors about whether you can consolidate numerous appointments on the same days or do some visits as a video or phone call. For help finding services: Your local Area Agency on Aging can provide a free comprehensive list of services tailored to your loved one's needs and connect you to the people who provide them. The agency can also guide you to groups in your area that might help pay for services such as respite care or transportation. Alternatively, ask your local health care system if it has a comprehensive dementia care program that provides similar help. Many systems are ramping up dementia care navigation services as a result of a new initiative from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services called Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE). It pays providers to offer caregiver training, help lines, care navigators, and individual care plans. You can also turn to the ARCH National Respite Network and Resource Center, a national resource program to direct you to respite services in your area. For help coping emotionally: Join a free caregiver support group — either online, such as those offered by the Family Caregiver Alliance, or in person (if time permits) at a senior center or local hospital. Or work with a therapist online (it's covered by your own Medicare). ""For example, if you feel guilty about negative emotions, a therapist might acknowledge your struggle with guilt and help you understand that perfection is impossible. You'll be guided to establish realistic goals,"" Dr. Collier says. To avoid burnout: ""Caregiving often requires a team, so don't feel bad asking for help from friends and family or hiring health aides at home,"" Dr. Collier says. ""The assistance can give you a much-needed break. And taking time for yourself is not just okay, it's recommended. You need to exercise, get enough sleep, see your doctors, and take part in pleasurable activities, such as spending time with friends or reading a book. Caregiving is a marathon, with endless things to do, but you must set the priority to recharge regularly.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-use-a-continuous-glucose-monitor,Should I use a continuous glucose monitor?,1,"Q. I'm overweight, but don't have diabetes yet. Should I use a continuous glucose monitor, like people with diabetes do? A. Increasingly, new technologies are allowing us to monitor how our body is functioning. Smart watches and specialized rings monitor the number of steps we take and flights we climb, our heart and breathing rates, and our blood oxygen levels. People with diabetes need to monitor their level of blood sugar, often multiple times a day, to make sure it doesn't get either too high or too low. When I was beginning my medical career, measuring blood sugar levels required a venipuncture (using a needle to take a blood sample). That was not something a patient could do, so instead we asked patients to collect several urine samples a day and use a kit to measure the level of sugar in it. That gave a crude indication of when blood sugars were too high, but didn't help determine when sugars were too low. Then, new technology allowed people to prick a fingertip, collect a drop of blood on a special test strip, and use a machine to measure the blood sugar level. This was more accurate than the urine testing and much more feasible than multiple venipunctures each day, but people didn't much like pricking their fingertips. Neither did their fingers. Then came continuous glucose monitoring technology. A small device sticks to the skin, and a tiny sensor on the underside of the device painlessly pushes into the skin. The sensor continuously monitors the level of sugar and sends that information wirelessly to another device (such as a smartphone) where a person can easily see their sugar level. With some devices, an alarm goes off when the sugar is too high or too low. Continuous glucose monitors can be expensive and are not always covered by insurance. You ask if you should use a continuous glucose monitor, even though you do not have diabetes. There are relatively few studies of that question. At this time, there is no solid evidence of the value of these monitors in people who do not have diabetes. What will future studies show? I'm much better at predicting the past than predicting the future, but here goes: my bet is that these devices will have no value in people who have no risk factors for diabetes. On the other hand, they may prove to have value in some people who have risk factors for diabetes — such as people who are overweight (like you), people with prediabetes whose blood sugar levels are somewhat high, and people for whom diabetes runs in the family. But this will need to be scientifically established before it's worth using such monitors. Or before insurance is likely to pay for them.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-change-your-night-owl-lifestyle,Tips to change your night-owl lifestyle,1,"Do you naturally stay up until the wee hours and sleep late in the morning? Do you feel more creative, productive, or focused in the afternoon or evening than you do in the morning? If so, you're probably a ""night owl."" That's the opposite of a ""morning lark,"" someone who wakes with the sun and goes to sleep early. For a long time, doctors believed there were no health differences between night owls and morning larks as long as you got the optimal seven to nine hours of sleep per night. But that thinking is changing. So it might be time to consider if you should try to shift your sleep pattern. Night owl risks A growing amount of evidence suggests that being a night owl may increase the risk of developing many health problems. For example, a 2023 Harvard-led study of about 64,000 healthy middle-aged women, followed for eight years, found that those who said they were night owls were 72% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks. The night owls were also more likely than morning larks to be overweight and have an unhealthy life-style — drinking a lot of alcohol, smoking, eating a poor diet, and getting too little sleep. Even after scientists calculated the impact of those lifestyle factors on health, the night owls were still 19% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks. In addition, a 2021 study of almost 137,000 middle-aged and older adults suggested that having a bedtime past 10 p.m. was tied to a 20% greater risk of having obesity or a dangerously large waistline (35 or more inches for women, 40 or more for men), compared with people who went to bed between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The risk for obesity was even higher (35% to 38%) among people who went to bed between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Night owls in this study also slept fewer hours (six or seven hours per night) than morning larks (eight or nine hours per night). The risks of little sleep The fact that night owls sometimes sleep less than morning larks only adds to the risk. Sleep is the time when the brain flushes out toxins and consolidates memories and new bits of information. It's when our muscles and cells rebuild. Getting an inadequate amount of good-quality sleep is linked to poor concentration; increased risks of falls, broken bones, and car crashes; a weakened immune system; and many diseases, such as dementia, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, and depression. The power of darkness The typical human sleep-wake cycle makes the desire for sleep strongest between midnight and dawn, when it's dark outside. ""We sleep best, with the highest-quality sleep, when the sun is down. That's just how we're wired,"" says Dr. Kenneth Sassower, a pediatric and adult sleep neurologist at Harvard-­affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""If you're a night owl and you don't go to sleep until the middle of the night, you're not maximizing the number of hours you can sleep in darkness. The sun comes up soon after your bedtime, which might lead to poor-quality or interrupted sleep."" Tips for success Give yourself the best chance of successfully shifting your sleep-wake cycle by following good sleep hygiene. Exercise daily, but not too close to bedtime. Avoid alcohol and spicy food close to bedtime. Create a sleep ritual an hour before bed: turn down the lights, turn off the TV and computer screens, and do a quiet activity (like reading). Sleep in a cool, dark room, and make sure your bed and bedding are comfortable. Changing your sleep schedule It's not that the evidence is so strong that night owls should definitely go to sleep and awaken earlier. But the evidence is convincing enough that it's worth a try, particularly if you're not sleeping long enough or if the bulk of your sleep isn't occurring when it's dark outside. Is it possible to shift your sleep-wake cycle, even if you're not wired to go to bed earlier? ""Yes, but it's a slow process,"" Dr. Sassower says. He recommends the following steps. Set a bedtime goal. Dr. Sassower suggests aiming for a bedtime between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., so you'll get at least five hours of sleep in darkness. Gradually go to bed earlier. ""You can't just start going to sleep hours earlier and expect to make a lasting change to your sleep-wake cycle. Your brain won't comply,"" Dr. Sassower says. He advises rolling back your bedtime by 20 minutes every five days, until you reach your desired bedtime. For example, if you currently go to sleep at 1 a.m. each night and would prefer a bedtime of about 11:30 p.m., go to sleep at 12:40 a.m. for five nights then 12:20 a.m. for five nights then midnight for five nights then 11:40 p.m. for five nights then 11:20 p.m. indefinitely. Use medication. Until you reach your bedtime goal, it might help to take melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle. If you use an over-the-counter supplement, you should take it two hours before bedtime. It would be more effective, Dr. Sassower says, if you take a more potent prescription version of melatonin, a drug called ramelteon (Rozerem), at bedtime. You'll have to talk to your doctor about that. Set a wake time. ""Don't get up late,"" Dr. Sassower says. ""You need a consistent wake time to train the brain. Don't make it any later than 9 a.m."" Be patient. Once you've reached your bedtime goal, it will take about 90 days to officially establish the new sleep schedule and make it stick. ""I'm not saying it's easy,"" Dr. Sassower says, ""but it can be done. And you'll probably sleep better, feel the difference, and improve your health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/rethinking-hdl-cholesterol,Rethinking HDL cholesterol,1,"Cholesterol, a waxy, pale yellow fat, travels through the bloodstream in tiny, protein-covered particles called lipoproteins that mix easily with blood. You need cholesterol to create cell membranes, make hormones, and synthesize vitamin D, among other things. But if you're trying to avoid heart disease, you should keep tabs on your blood cholesterol values — especially your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream helps to create artery-clogging plaque, raising your risk of a heart attack. Your cholesterol report (also called a lipid profile or lipid panel) also includes your high-density lipoprotein (HDL); see the table below for recommended values. HDL has long been referred to as ""good"" cholesterol, based on observational studies dating back decades showing that people with high HDL levels are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease. However, the scientific understanding of HDL has evolved in the ensuing years, and many cardiologists now believe that HDL may be more of a bystander rather than a ""good guy"" that helps lower heart disease risk. ""Higher HDL levels are closely linked with behaviors like eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise,"" says Dr. Stephen Wiviott, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Talking trash about HDL Researchers have also discovered that the way HDL functions and its role in the body are more complex that once believed. ""The analogy that's often used to describe HDL is a garbage truck, because it picks up extra cholesterol, or garbage, from the bloodstream and the arteries and then transports it to the liver, where it's recycled or disposed,"" says Dr. Wiviott. That was the rationale behind the creation of experimental drugs that raised HDL levels dramatically — between 60% and 100%. Over the past decade, large clinical trials tested five of these drugs (known as CEPT inhibitors) in people with low HDL levels. But while the drugs reliably raised HDL levels, they didn't achieve the most important goal: preventing heart attacks, strokes, and other complications from clogged arteries. Maybe, the thinking went, it wasn't the number of garbage trucks that mattered but how good they were at picking up trash. That is, maybe the drugs increased the wrong kind of HDL cholesterol. It turns out that HDL comes in different shapes and sizes. Some types are spherical, while others are doughnut-shaped. Some types of HDL are great at plucking excess cholesterol from LDL and artery walls (a process referred to as reverse cholesterol transport), while some are not. Lipid lowdown: What numbers are best? The desirable values are for people without known heart disease. LEVEL CATEGORY TOTAL CHOLESTEROL Less than 200 mg/dL Desirable 200–239 mg/Dl Borderline high 240 mg/dL and above High LDL CHOLESTEROL Less than 100 mg/dL Optimal 100–129 mg/dL Near optimal/above optimal 130–159 mg/dL Borderline high 160–189 mg/dL High 190 mg/dL and above Very high HDL CHOLESTEROL Less than 40 mg/dL Low 60 mg/dL and above High TRIGLYCERIDES Less than 150 mg/dL Normal 150–199 mg/dL Borderline high 200–499 mg/dL High 500 mg/dL and above Very high Source: Adapted from the National Cholesterol Education Program. A better garbage truck? What if you had an HDL-based drug specifically designed to improve reverse cholesterol transport? Think of it as an empty garbage truck with a better trash compactor. But when investigators tested four weekly infusions of this type of experimental drug on more than 18,200 recent heart attack survivors, it was no better than a placebo in preventing heart attack, stroke, or death, as detailed in a study published May 2, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine. ""It's yet another point of reference to suggest that targeting HDL with medications may not be helpful,"" says Dr. Wiviott. But these findings shouldn't distract you from focusing on the factors you can control — namely, making sure your LDL is below 100 milligrams per deciliter, or even lower if you have heart disease (see advice about LDL-lowering strategies). That's true even if you have a high HDL level, which shouldn't be considered overly reassuring or a reason to ignore an elevated LDL value, says Dr. Wiviott.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-you-reduce-your-cholesterol-without-taking-a-drug,Can you reduce your cholesterol without taking a drug?,1,"It's one of the most common questions people ask their doctors: How do I lower my cholesterol? Many of them hope to avoid taking drugs, while others are interested in natural cholesterol-lowering medications, like the Heart Letter reader who wrote to us recently. She's an active, slender 76-year-old who follows a heart-friendly diet (mostly organic fruits and vegetables, grains, and lean meats, but no red meat and no alcohol). Her blood pressure and blood sugar levels are normal, but her LDL (""bad"") cholesterol is 157 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), which is considered borderline high. In general, there are three main ways to lower LDL to the recommended 100 mg/dL or lower: diet, a dietary supplement, or a prescription medication, such as a statin. Here's how Heart Letter editor in chief Dr. Christopher Cannon counsels patients on this topic. Dietary changes What many people don't realize is that only about 20% of the cholesterol in your bloodstream comes from your diet — your liver and intestines make the rest. For most people, the cholesterol present in food doesn't have that much of an effect. However, most of the cholesterol in the average person's diet comes from animal-based foods such as meat and dairy, which are also high in saturated fat. Saturated fat clearly raises LDL cholesterol and should be consumed in limited amounts. The rest of your diet matters, too. Swap saturated fat for unsaturated fats (such as those found in vegetable oils, avocados, and fatty fish). Eat plenty of plant foods (like vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains — especially oats) that are rich in fiber, which helps lower your cholesterol by making dietary cholesterol harder to absorb from your gut. If you eat cheeseburgers and ice cream regularly but then gradually transition to a healthier diet, you're likely to see your LDL level fall. If your diet is already quite healthy (like the reader described above), further tweaks might not make that much of a difference. ""I often tell patients that while some people see modest reductions in their LDL after changing their diet, some do not,"" says Dr. Cannon. Still, a healthy diet has other cardiovascular benefits, even if your LDL doesn't drop very much, he adds. For example, many of the compounds found in whole, unprocessed plant foods help dampen inflammation, discouraging plaque buildup. Supplements Many dietary supplements sold in the United States claim to benefit heart health. But only three may help drive down LDL cholesterol, and only by a modest amount. Psyllium husk. Derived from the seeds of the Plantago ovata plant, this fiber supplement is best known as a treatment for constipation (Metamucil is one familiar brand). The powder is mixed with a liquid to make a thick gel. Psyllium husk or powder is also available in wafers, bars, and capsules. It's thought to absorb bile acids and cholesterol, which are then eliminated from the body during bowel movements. The suggested daily dose is 5 to 10 grams. An April 2024 review article in the journal Nutrients found that taking psyllium daily for a month or two can lower LDL by about 6 points, on average. Plant sterols. Found naturally in the cell membranes of plants like nuts, soybeans, peas, and rapeseed (the source of canola oil), these compounds (also call phytosterols) have a structure similar to cholesterol. Eating them helps limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Manufacturers offer many types of foods with added plant sterols, including margarine (such as Benecol), mayonnaise, bread, breakfast and snack bars, milk, and juice. Phytosterols are also available in capsule form. Some studies show that consuming 2 grams of plant sterols per day for at least eight weeks can lower LDL by up to 10%. However, a recent, carefully controlled four-week trial — the Supplements, Placebo, or Rosuvastatin Trial, or SPORT — found only a 4.4% LDL reduction from plant sterols. Red yeast rice. Made by steaming white rice with the yeast Monascus purpureus, this red-hued extract contains monacolin K, the same active ingredient in the prescription cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. Some studies suggest that supplements containing 4 milligrams (mg) to 10 mg of monacolin K can lower LDL between 20% and 25%. But SPORT reported a mere 6.6% LDL reduction from red yeast rice. ""I have several patients who've been able to lower their LDL a little bit with psyllium, which is a safe, inexpensive product,"" says Dr. Cannon. The problem with the plant sterols and red yeast rice is the same as with all dietary supplements: the amount of active ingredient is not regulated and may vary from batch to batch. If you want to try these products, do so only under a doctor's supervision and use brands tested and vetted by ConsumerLab.com, an independent testing company. Statins Unlike dietary supplements, drugs in the class known as statins contain a known amount of the active ingredient — a compound that both decreases the amount of cholesterol the body makes and boosts the liver's ability to clear cholesterol from the blood. These drugs can lower LDL between 25% and 55%. Note that simply having elevated LDL cholesterol doesn't necessarily mean you should be taking a statin, Dr. Cannon notes. The ultimate goal is to lower your risk of heart disease, and other factors (like your age and other health conditions) affect your risk. He recommends using the American College of Cardiology's risk calculator. The calculator provides treatment advice about managing your LDL and other heart disease risk factors, which you can then discuss with your physician. For our reader, a moderate-intensity statin may be reasonable, according to the calculator's recommendation. When people are reluctant to start taking a statin, a coronary calcium score can help them make a more informed decision. Our reader's calcium score is 116, which suggests she has a small amount of plaque in her coronary arteries (see ""Should I get a calcium score?"" in the April 2023 Heart Letter for information about this test). ""But any number above zero means that the person has coronary artery disease,"" Dr. Cannon explains. Anyone with that diagnosis should get their LDL down to 70 or lower, which will prevent additional plaque buildup, he says. For someone with an LDL of 157, a statin is the most effective means to reach that goal. Image: © fcafotodigital/Getty Images",3,0.3685448,-0.041044597
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/increasing-energy-levels-for-sex,Increasing energy levels for sex,1,"Men want plenty of energy to fully enjoy sex. Yet as men age, many factors can diminish their energy levels and lower their libido and sexual stamina. For instance, muscle mass naturally declines, and the body becomes less efficient at producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy-carrying molecules found in cells. Testosterone levels also diminish, and sleep problems are common, leading to fatigue. ""Addressing these issues also can increase energy levels and keep you more active and mentally alert,"" says Dr. Martin Kathrins, director of the Men's Health Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Here's a look at these energy blockers and how to overcome them. ATP and muscle mass The best ways to increase ATP and muscle mass are with diet and strength training. Foods that contain polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and protein can boost ATP. Favoring plant-based foods, as with the DASH or Mediterranean diet can increase your intake of foods rich in these fatty acids, like fatty fish (salmon), avocados, olive oil, and nuts (almonds, walnuts). High-quality protein sources include beans, nuts, soy (soy milk, tofu), and poultry. Another protein source is protein powder from plants (soybeans, peas, rice, or hemp) or milk (casein or whey protein). The powder can be added to a smoothie, stirred into oatmeal, or mixed with water or milk (regular, soy, or almond). Strength training helps build muscle mass, which spurs your body to produce more ATP. More muscle mass also increases your basal metabolic rate, the amount of energy your body uses at rest. Like other kinds of physical activity, strength training boosts levels of energy-promoting neurotransmitters in the brain. Low testosterone Fatigue is a common side effect of male hypogonadism, a condition in which the testicles don't produce enough testosterone, the male sex hormone. On average, testosterone levels drop about 1% each year beginning in a man's late 30s and could fall by as much as 50% by age 70. (A blood test from your doctor can determine if you have low testosterone.) Testosterone replacement therapy, which is given via absorbable pellet implants, topical gels, patches, or injections, can often help spark energy and improve libido in men with low levels. Speak with your doctor about whether you should get your testosterone level checked and whether testosterone therapy is appropriate. Sleep Sleep is divided into two phases: REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep involves three stages. Sleep experts believe that the last non-REM stage (known as deep sleep) plays the greatest role in energy, as it helps the body make ATP. Older adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. However, many older adults have trouble falling or staying asleep, which means less time spent in deep sleep and leads to daytime fatigue. Poor sleep also can increase stress levels and interfere with how your body and brain store and use energy. Specific problems can interfere with sleep, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and nocturia (the need to urinate during the night). ""If you have problems sleeping through the night, consult your doctor to determine if you have any of these conditions,"" says Dr. Kathrins. Otherwise, practicing good sleep hygiene can help you get a good night's rest. For example, go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends, to keep your sleep/wake cycle synchronized with your circadian rhythms. Establish a bedtime ritual where you give yourself an hour before sleep to bathe, brush your teeth, and relax. Use the bed only for sleeping or sex (no TV or electronic devices), and keep your bedroom dark and cool. If you take afternoon naps, keep them under 20 minutes, and don't nap later in the afternoon or within several hours of your regular bedtime.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-vacation-habits-to-continue-all-year,Healthy vacation habits to continue all year,1,"Picnics, beach outings, dozing in the shade: there's a reason many of us feel our best during summer getaways. But we tend to snap back into our everyday, task-oriented mindset soon after — at the expense of our bodies and minds. What if we could keep the best parts of our vacation routines and use them to fuel better health all year long? There are solid reasons to embrace a shift. More than four in 10 cancers are linked to lifestyle choices we can change, such as poor diet and physical inactivity. These risk factors are also among the top contributors to heart disease. They're also habits we tend to improve when we're away from the grind, says Dr. Kathryn Corelli, a primary care doctor and women's health specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Vacation is when people take a step back and really give themselves permission and time to focus on what's important to them,"" Dr. Corelli says. ""But when they come back, suddenly those habits sort of snap back too. You lose a lot of those gains, the reasons you felt good."" Habits to foster Healthy activities we embrace on vacation and neglect the rest of the year tend to fall into two camps — doing more of some things and less of others. More time outdoors. Mounting evidence suggests that spending time in nature can improve a wide range of health factors, including blood pressure, by lowering stress and promoting exercise, according to a March 2023 paper in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine. ""Many of my patients spend a lot of time indoors during the year and they feel cooped up, anxious, and stressed,"" Dr. Corelli says. ""When they get outside, they always benefit."" More movement. Speaking of exercise, walking, swimming, biking, and hiking can seem far less of a chore when you're doing it for fun. ""Continuing some of those habits — whether going on walks or parking farther away from your destination — can be really powerful in the long term,"" she says. Less time online. We gain perspective when we pull back from virtual pursuits, a shift that pays big dividends for mental health. ""We spend a lot of time on screens. But that time takes away from something else, such as sleep or connecting with our kids,"" she says. ""Also, there are a lot of data supporting the idea that comparing ourselves to people online can be bad for anxiety."" More varied diet. Vacation food is sometimes overly rich and caloric — think of cruise ship buffets — but can also deviate gloriously from the humdrum by incorporating a wider array of mouth-watering fruits and vegetables and fewer processed foods. ""There's no perfect way to eat,"" Dr. Corelli says, ""but try to eat relatively healthy, unprocessed foods 80% of the time."" More dining with others. It's easier to munch more mindfully — which also helps you avoid overeating — when you're enjoying leisurely meals with family and friends instead of dashing off to the next commitment. ""We connect as humans over food; that's been in our cultural DNA for a long time,"" she says. ""People feel closer to family and friends after vacation, and we know socializing can help prevent cognitive decline."" More sleep. A significant part of revitalizing simply comes from getting better shuteye, without alarms or insomnia-inducing deadlines. But while those stressors may return, we can be more diligent about practicing good sleep hygiene when vacation ends by avoiding screens for an hour before bed and keeping consistent bed and wake times. ""Those things are really important for continuing the relaxation you've fostered on vacation,"" Dr. Corelli says. Novel brain engagement. There's a reason booksellers hawk ""beach reads"" in the summer months: people typically spend more time reading on vacation. Or maybe you while away the afternoons playing board games or completing sudoku or crossword puzzles. ""Think of it like stretching your brain — it's not on autopilot,"" she says. ""Doing this can help protect us from dementia in the long run."" Adjustment advice Before you plunge back into your everyday routine, Dr. Corelli advocates doing a bit of reflection. This could include devising a list of pros and cons for the things you did on vacation that you'd like to continue. ""This can be motivating,"" she says. ""Finding your own reasons for continuing or not continuing a behavior and thinking them through can get lost during our fast-paced everyday life,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/recognizing-and-easing-the-physical-symptoms-of-anxiety,Recognizing and easing the physical symptoms of anxiety,1,"Simple strategies can reduce the headaches, upset stomach, and shortness of breath that may be triggered by emotional stress. You've had headaches on and off, or possibly nausea, or muscle pain. It could be emotions, rather than a physical illness, driving your symptoms. Blame your autonomic nervous system. This is a system in your body that you don't consciously control, but that regulates things like your heart rate, breathing, urination, and sexual function. It's also the system that reacts when you are under a physical threat. The autonomic nervous system produces your fight-or-flight response, which is designed to help you defend yourself or run away from danger. When you are under stress or anxious, this system kicks into action, and physical symptoms can appear — headaches, nausea, shortness of breath, shakiness, or stomach pain. Doctors see it all the time — patients with real pain or other symptoms, but nothing is physically wrong with them. In today's world, many people may be noticing new physical symptoms without realizing what's causing them. For some people, this situation is the start of a vicious cycle. Anxiety and stress themselves produce these physical symptoms, and on top of that your reaction to those symptoms can make them worse. The more you focus on them, the more alarmed you become, and the more intense your symptoms become. It can get really out of control and become so uncomfortable that you might not be able to do much more than sit and worry. Identifying and easing anxiety It's possible to become so fixated on the physical effects from your anxious state that you don't even realize you were anxious to begin with. So, how do you know if anxiety is causing your symptoms? And if it is, how can you feel better? Here are some tips to help you interrupt this cycle. Stop and assess. The first step is to pause for a second and observe what's going on with your body. Think about what you are experiencing and whether it relates to a feeling of emotional upset or a reaction to something alarming or stressful. If your symptoms followed a stressful event or period of time, it's possible these emotions triggered your symptoms. Also, be alert to signs that you are tensing your muscles, which can also indicate a stress reaction. Distract yourself. If you suspect anxiety is at the root of your physical symptoms, distraction can be a helpful tool. It's good to build a repertoire of things that can distract you from your focus on your body. Look at a photo album. Do the laundry. Even something as simple as watering the plants or putting together a jigsaw puzzle can help. This can fairly reliably get you out of a cycle of increased anxiety and increased physical symptoms. Very often, once you move on to another activity and take your mind off your symptoms, you'll start to feel better. Distractions are different for each person. Try different activities to figure out what takes your mind to a calm place. Relax your body — or work it. To relieve stress, try some deep breathing or relaxation exercises. There are numerous online resources and smartphone apps that can help guide you through relaxation techniques. Physical activity can also help you relieve tension. Try to squeeze in a daily walk or a run. Reassure yourself. If you believe your symptoms are being caused by anxiety, reassure yourself that what you are experiencing is not harmful or fatal. They're not serious, and they don't signal an impending medical disaster. The symptoms will pass when the anxiety eases. Get checked. There is a difference between anxiety that triggers physical symptoms and physical symptoms that trigger anxiety. For example, people who are having an asthma attack and therefore having trouble breathing will likely feel anxious. But anxiety is not causing their shortness of breath. If you have a physical problem that does not resolve with relaxation or other techniques, contact your doctor to have it checked out. Know when to seek help. Simple anxiety sometimes crosses the line and becomes an anxiety disorder. Signs that you might have a problem include shying away from activities because you are fearful, or being so preoccupied with worry that it affects your ability to function. If this sounds like you, it's time to seek some help. Anxiety disorders are very treatable using a variety of different approaches. Image: © Mykyta Dolmatov/Getty Images",9,0.23296523,-0.29541346
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/parenting-isnt-easy-two-important-skills-can-help-202407243060,Parenting isn't easy: Two important skills can help,1,"They say that parenting is the greatest — and the most challenging — job that many of us will ever land. Life can be tough for kids too, especially when they go through emotionally trying times. What can parents do to help their kids manage episodes of anger, sadness, or anxiety triggered by school, siblings, and daily living? Whether you are a parent to an elementary-age child, a tweener ages 8 to 12, or a teenager, practicing two skills can help both you and your child: validation and coping. Practicing validation Validation teaches your children that feeling and expressing their emotions is okay. ""When parents use validation, they are affirming to their child that it's fine to feel emotions and they should not be suppressed,"" says Dr. Chase Samsel with the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Harvard-affiliated Boston Children's Hospital. ""It shows them you understand their feelings and point of view, and it establishes trust. This, in turn, can help a child feel supported and open to discussing solutions."" Start with acknowledgement Acknowledge their emotions with comments like, ""It sounds like you are frustrated or angry,"" or ""I can see that you've had a tough day at school."" But which emotion — or emotions — is your child feeling? ""It can be difficult for parents to recognize the genuine emotion their child is battling,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""Many times, kids have an emotional reaction but can't explain what's going on, or don't want to, or express various emotions at once."" Other times, different emotions lie underneath the one being shown. This is especially common among teenagers where they display anger, but often the real emotion is fear, anxiety, or sadness. ""In these incidences, just recognizing they are going through something difficult is enough,"" says Dr. Samsel. Practice validation often A child may not respond to validation at first — they may not want to talk about their emotions or may ignore your interest. But consistent validation will eventually pay off. ""By repeating validation when emotional crises arise, the child soon will become more comfortable expressing their emotion,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""Once they recognize that their parents welcome this and will not be reprimanded, they will be open to sharing details."" Building a coping skills toolbox Coping skills are ways parents can teach their children to manage emotional problems when they arise. Try a breathing exercise together Breathing exercises are a popular strategy, as they are easy to learn and quick to use. Dr. Samsel recommends any of the following: three-part breathing, ujjayi breathing, and belly breathing. Other coping skills include guided meditation, visualization, squeezing a ball for stress relief, taking a walk or playing outside, and reading together (ideal for preschool and elementary-age children). ""Sometimes just giving children alone time in their room or ""taking space"" works well,"" says Dr. Samsel. Tap into coping skills yourself It's also vital for parents to adopt these strategies when dealing with their own emotions, says Dr. Samsel. Not only will this help you feel calmer, but it's a great way to model that coping skills help everyone — adults, too! For example, try telling your kids when you feel upset or frustrated about something that happens during your day. Announce that you plan to take a walk to de-stress or do a breathing exercise. Later, share your strategies for problem-solving. ""Kids watch what their parents do and will often mimic their behavior,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""If they see you constructively working through your emotions, they will be more open to doing the same."" Be flexible Never insist on having older kids use a coping mechanism, even when situations call for it. That could feel like punishment and trigger an automatic resistance. Instead, Dr. Samsel suggests parents expose their children to different types of coping skills and then let them decide which ones they want to try. ""They may need to experiment to find techniques they can easily follow and that work for them,"" says Dr. Samsel.",2,0.05075398,-0.006800581

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side,Blue light has a dark side,1,"What is blue light? The effect blue light has on your sleep and more. Although it is environmentally friendly, blue light can affect your sleep and potentially cause disease. Until the advent of artificial lighting, the sun was the major source of lighting, and people spent their evenings in (relative) darkness. Now, in much of the world, evenings are illuminated, and we take our easy access to all those lumens pretty much for granted. But we may be paying a price for basking in all that light. At night, light throws the body's biological clock—the circadian rhythm—out of whack. Sleep suffers. Worse, research shows that it may contribute to the causation of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. What is blue light? Not all colors of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths—which are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost attention, reaction times, and mood—seem to be the most disruptive at night. And the proliferation of electronics with screens, as well as energy-efficient lighting, is increasing our exposure to blue wavelengths, especially after sundown. Light and sleep Everyone has slightly different circadian rhythms, but the average length is 24 and one-quarter hours. The circadian rhythm of people who stay up late is slightly longer, while the rhythms of earlier birds fall short of 24 hours. Dr. Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School showed, in 1981, that daylight keeps a person's internal clock aligned with the environment. Is nighttime light exposure bad? Some studies suggest a link between exposure to light at night, such as working the night shift, to diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. That's not proof that nighttime light exposure causes these conditions; nor is it clear why it could be bad for us. Exposure to light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms. Even dim light can interfere with a person's circadian rhythm and melatonin secretion. A mere eight lux—a level of brightness exceeded by most table lamps and about twice that of a night light—has an effect. Light at night is part of the reason so many people don't get enough sleep, and researchers have linked short sleep to increased risk for depression, as well as diabetes and cardiovascular problems. Effects of blue light and sleep While light of any kind can suppress the secretion of melatonin, blue light at night does so more powerfully. Harvard researchers and their colleagues conducted an experiment comparing the effects of 6.5 hours of exposure to blue light to exposure to green light of comparable brightness. The blue light suppressed melatonin for about twice as long as the green light and shifted circadian rhythms by twice as much (3 hours vs. 1.5 hours). In another study of blue light, researchers at the University of Toronto compared the melatonin levels of people exposed to bright indoor light who were wearing blue-light–blocking goggles to people exposed to regular dim light without wearing goggles. The fact that the levels of the hormone were about the same in the two groups strengthens the hypothesis that blue light is a potent suppressor of melatonin. It also suggests that shift workers and night owls could perhaps protect themselves if they wore eyewear that blocks blue light. Inexpensive sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses block blue light, but they also block other colors, so they're not suitable for use indoors at night. Glasses that block out only blue light can cost up to $80. LED blue light exposure If blue light does have adverse health effects, then environmental concerns, and the quest for energy-efficient lighting, could be at odds with personal health. Those curlicue compact fluorescent lightbulbs and LED lights are much more energy-efficient than the old-fashioned incandescent lightbulbs we grew up with. But they also tend to produce more blue light. The physics of fluorescent lights can't be changed, but coatings inside the bulbs can be so they produce a warmer, less blue light. LED lights are more efficient than fluorescent lights, but they also produce a fair amount of light in the blue spectrum. Richard Hansler, a light researcher at John Carroll University in Cleveland, notes that ordinary incandescent lights also produce some blue light, although less than most fluorescent lightbulbs. Protect yourself from blue light at night Use dim red lights for night lights. Red light is less likely to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin. Avoid looking at bright screens beginning two to three hours before bed. If you work a night shift or use a lot of electronic devices at night, consider wearing blue-blocking glasses or installing an app that filters the blue/green wavelength at night. Expose yourself to lots of bright light during the day, which will boost your ability to sleep at night, as well as your mood and alertness during daylight. image: © Innovatedcaptures | Dreamstime.com",6,0.20298241,-0.11994292
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/does-exercising-at-night-affect-sleep,Does exercising at night affect sleep?,1,"On call Q. I have heard that you should not exercise at night because it can cause sleep problems. Is this true? A. Traditionally, experts have recommended not exercising at night as part of good sleep hygiene. However, a small study, published in Sports Medicine suggests that some people can exercise in the evening as long as they avoid vigorous activity for at least one hour before bedtime. The researchers examined 23 studies that evaluated sleep onset and quality in healthy adults who performed a single session of evening exercise compared with similar adults who did not. They found that not only did evening exercise not affect sleep, it seemed to help people fall asleep faster and spend more time in deep sleep. However, those who did high-intensity exercise — such as interval training — less than one hour before bedtime took longer to fall asleep and had poorer sleep quality. Despite the findings in this particular study, I generally recommend against strenuous physical activity for at least two hours before getting into bed. In addition to regular exercise, you can help achieving quality sleep by doing the following: Set a regular bedtime and adopt a relaxing bedtime routine. Turn off devices that give off light, such as the TV, computer, and phone, at least 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Be sure your bed is comfortable and your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Don't take long naps during the day. If you need a nap, restrict it to 20 to 30 minutes in the early afternoon. If you can't fall asleep after 15 to 20 minutes, go to another room. Read quietly with a dim light until you feel sleepy. — by Howard LeWine, M.D. Editor in Chief, Harvard Men's Health Watch Image: © Wavebreakmedia/Getty Images",6,0.30793983,-0.23239757
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy,Is extra-virgin olive oil extra healthy?,1,"Q. I know olive oil is part of a heart-healthy diet, but is extra-virgin olive oil healthier than regular olive oil? A. Many studies continue to confirm the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which cuts the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet's nutritional benefits probably come from various sources, but the generous use of olive oil appears to be a key contributor. Regardless of the type, olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, containing about 75% by volume. When substituted for saturated fat, monounsaturated fats help lower your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. The health benefits of olive oil have been attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, observational studies have shown a link between lower risks of cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and even dementia in people who consume higher amounts of olive oil than those who use little or none. Still, extra-virgin olive oil does offer something extra that regular olive oil does not. Extra-virgin olive oil is pressed mechanically from ripe olives and processed without high heat or chemical solvents. This protects chemicals in the oil called phenols. In contrast, regular, highly processed olive oils lose these chemicals. Small laboratory-based experiments suggest that higher concentrations of phenols may provide extra antioxidant effects. Even so, there are no definitive studies that show extra-virgin olive oil has a greater ability than refined oil to prevent heart problems, cancer or other diseases. Keep in mind that olive oil is not the sole healthy ingredient in a Mediterranean diet. Think of it as just one aspect of the Mediterranean style of eating, which includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts; whole grains; and limited amounts of red meat.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exposure-therapy-what-is-it-and-how-can-it-help,Exposure therapy: What is it and how can it help?,1,"Exposure therapy is a way to help people conquer their fears, stress, or anxiety. Exposure therapy has been scientifically proven to be a safe and effective treatment for a variety of psychological issues. What is exposure therapy? Exposure therapy is a type of psychological therapy used to help people overcome problems such as phobias, panic attacks, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It involves exposing a person, in a safe environment, to the object, activity, or situation that they fear or struggle with. When people are afraid of something, they tend to avoid it. While this may work in the short term, over time the fear may become worse and negatively impact a person's life. Exposure therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. It can help break the cycle of avoidance and fear. Who might benefit from exposure therapy? Exposure therapy has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for people of all ages, including children and teenagers, in helping them overcome their fears. Examples of people who may benefit from exposure therapy are veterans with combat-related PTSD, adults with anxiety disorders including specific phobias, and children who have experienced traumatic events. What to expect from exposure therapy Exposure therapy starts with a provider learning more about you and what you are afraid of. You'll typically meet with the therapist once a week for several weeks to a few months, usually averaging between eight and 12 sessions. There are several different types of exposure therapy that can be used, based on your need and circumstances. Real exposure involves directly facing the object, situation, or activity that you are afraid of. The exposure starts gradually and is slowly increased. For example, someone with a fear of spiders may be shown a live spider across the room, then asked to observe it up close, and eventually may be encouraged to handle it. Imagined exposure involves imagining the object, situation, or activity that you fear. For example, a veteran may be asked to remember and describe the sights and sounds of being in combat. Simulation exposure involves using virtual reality technology to simulate what you are afraid of. It's used when real exposure is not possible, such as for people with a fear of flying on planes. Sensation awareness, also called interoceptive exposure, involves creating physical sensations that are harmless but feared. For example, the provider may ask someone who gets panic attacks to run on a treadmill to make their heart rate go up, to show them that this sensation is not dangerous. Prolonged exposure is therapy that is provided more slowly, over a period of several months, so that a person has time to accept the exposure and sufficiently process the experience. This type of exposure therapy is often used to treat PTSD. It is not typically used for other anxiety disorders. Exposure therapy is sometimes combined with relaxation exercises, to help associate a feared object or situation with relaxation. Benefits of exposure therapy Untreated fear, stress, or anxiety can have a profound impact on your quality of life. Exposure therapy can help in several ways. Over time, it can help weaken the negative association you previously had with something you feared. Exposure therapy can also show that you are capable of confronting your fears and managing your anxiety. It can restore a feeling of power and control that comes from facing and overcoming your fears or negative circumstances. Exposure therapy can result in significant symptom reduction, with benefits continuing for years after treatment. Which mental health professionals practice exposure therapy? Not all therapists or counselors are trained in, or provide, exposure therapy. Licensed psychologists (PhD or PsyD), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or licensed clinical social workers (LCSW) can all deliver exposure therapy.",1,-0.048347082,-0.10772832
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/dreaming-of-a-good-nights-rest,Dreaming of a good night's rest,1,"Sleep problems are an all-too-common reality for most older adults. Maybe they have trouble falling asleep, or wake up several times during the night, or have to take naps during the day to fight fatigue. Some of these sleep issues are age-related. For example, older adults often sleep less deeply than younger people and are more easily awakened. They also may take specific medication that have sleep-disrupting side effects. Older adults also are more likely to suffer from conditions that affect sleep, like sleep apnea (where you experience short pauses in your breathing many times during the night) and restless legs syndrome (an uncontrollable urge to move the legs). Rest and renew Proper sleep is as important as diet and exercise for optimal health. When you sleep, your body's cells repair and recharge themselves, so you feel energized the next day. Sleep also clears toxins from the brain, which keeps your brain sharp. The amount of sleep people need does not change as they age, according to Dr. Salma Batool-Anwar, who specializes in sleep disorders at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Older adults still require seven to nine hours of sleep per night, just like when they were younger,"" he says. Healthy sleep also means uninterrupted sleep. A good night's rest consists of completing four to five continuous sleep cycles. Each cycle includes periods of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, when you dream, and non-REM sleep, when you have deep, dreamless slumber. ""If your sleep gets disrupted or becomes fragmented, you could lose a chunk of either non-REM or REM sleep,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Healthy sleep leads to a healthier brain Fragmented sleep can lead to a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. A study published by Current Biology measured sleep quality of adults in their 60s and 70s in a lab over an eight-hour night of sleep and periodically measured beta-amyloid protein in their brains with a PET scan over several years. (Beta-amyloid buildup is linked with Alzheimer's disease.) People with poor sleep quality also had higher amounts of beta-amyloid. Those with more restorative sleep had lower levels. Pillow talk See your doctor if you feel you suffer from a sleep-related disorder. Otherwise, the following strategies can help keep your sleep cycle running smoothly. Review your medications. Diuretics (water pills) used to control blood pressure can make you wake up to use the bathroom. Some antidepressants cause daytime drowsiness and make it hard to fall asleep at night. ""Consult your doctor about possibly changing medication, lowering the dose, or taking it at different times, like at night rather than in the morning,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Watch your naps. Regular naps reduce fatigue and increase alertness and mood. But they also can interfere with your sleep cycle if you take them later in the day. ""Schedule them during a specific time of day, like in the early to late afternoon,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Keep naps to 15 to 20 minutes (set a timer to make sure you don't oversleep). Sleeping longer can make you feel groggy. Set stimuli cutoffs. For example, don't watch TV or use a computer at least an hour before bedtime. If your bladder often wakes you up, don't drink any liquids at least two hours beforehand. Also, avoid caffeine at least three hours before bedtime; caffeine reaches a peak level in your body within an hour after consumption, but it takes three to five hours for half of it to be eliminated. While regular exercise can help with sleep quality, working out within three hours of bedtime may lead to fragmented sleep. Create a sleep routine. Go to bed around the same time, and give yourself about an hour beforehand for bedtime rituals like bathing, brushing your teeth, and putting on comfortable pajamas. ""The structure teaches your body and mind how to properly wind down, which makes falling and staying asleep easier,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Prepare a soothing sleep setting. Make sure the bedroom is dark and cool. Listen to a relaxing sound machine. Or wear eyeshades or earplugs if you are sensitive to light or noise. Buy new sheets and pillows. Also, don't keep any stimulating electronics in the bedroom like a TV, computer, or phone. Establish a time limit. If you don't fall asleep within about 20 minutes, don't lie in bed awake.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/can-your-blood-tests-predict-your-future-risk-of-stress-anxiety-or-depression,"Can your blood tests predict your future risk of stress, anxiety, or depression?",1,"When the doctor says your blood sugar or cholesterol levels are off, you might worry about diabetes or heart disease. But a large study published online April 2, 2024, by JAMA Network Open suggests that abnormal levels of those biomarkers might also signal a risk for developing chronic stress, anxiety, or depression years later. Researchers at facilities around the world, including Harvard, analyzed the health information of more than 211,000 people in Sweden. At the start of the study, participants were middle-aged (42 on average) and free of chronic stress or mood disorders. Each person was tested for levels of blood sugar and fats, such as triglycerides and HDL (good) cholesterol. After 21 years, people who'd had high blood sugar and high triglycerides at the start of the study were more likely to have developed chronic stress or mood disorders by age 60, compared with people who'd had low or normal blood sugar levels and triglycerides. On the flip side, people who'd had high levels of HDL were less likely to develop chronic stress or mood disorders compared with people who'd had low levels of HDL. This study doesn't answer the question of whether abnormal levels of sugar and fats lead to chronic stress, anxiety, or depression, or if the connection is more complicated or involves other factors. However, we know for sure that it's important to keep levels of sugar and fats normal to reduce the risk for many diseases. Image: © Westend61/Getty Images",1,0.28504166,-0.23002557
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/reaching-the-climax,Reaching the climax,1,"Regular orgasms offer numerous health benefits for men, such as lowering stress, boosting mood, and improving sleep quality. Some research has suggested that they may help reduce the risk of heart disease and prostate cancer. However, as they age, men can face obstacles to achieving orgasms. They may be unable to have an orgasm during sex (a condition known as anorgasmia), or it may take a frustratingly long time to climax (what's called delayed orgasm). Men also may have trouble maintaining an erection long enough to have sex. Sometimes, lack of arousal can prevent them from reaching an orgasm. ""Men don't have to achieve an orgasm every time during sex to have a satisfying experience with their partner,"" says Dr. Sharon Bober, director of the Sexual Health Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""But if men are unable to have regular orgasms during sex, there are ways to help."" Many issues can contribute to problems having orgasm, such as low testosterone levels, medication side effects, and psychological problems like anxiety and stress, so first check with your doctor. Still, sometimes men only need extra stimulation or sexual excitement to reach orgasm. Or they may require help maintaining an erection (and don't want to rely on erectile dysfunction medication). In these cases, Dr. Bober suggests trying the following strategies. Masturbate more Masturbating alongside your partner or enlisting their help can increase excitement. ""Masturbation helps reduce the stress of performance or climaxing within a certain period, since you can take your time and go at your own pace,"" says Dr. Bober. Men also may benefit from frequent solo masturbation. ""Men know what arouses them, and masturbating more by themselves can help them focus on their own pleasure,"" says Dr. Bober. ""This may help lower expectations with partner sex because they don't have to view having an orgasm as the ultimate goal of their satisfaction. Instead, they can focus on the experience of connecting with their partner, which can increase arousal."" Get erotic Reading erotic literature together can stimulate sexual desire through storytelling, imagery, fantasy, and language. ""Reading and listening stimulate your largest sexual organ: your brain,"" says Dr. Bober. There are now many erotic novels and short story anthologies that cater specifically to older adults. (You can find a wide selection with an Internet search and via websites for publishing houses and booksellers.) Play with toys Many kinds of sex toys and devices help increase stimulation and help maintain erections. For instance, the penile vibratory device is placed around the penis and vibrates to stimulate the nerves in the base of the penis to encourage an orgasm. It's used before sex and can be incorporated into foreplay. To help maintain an erection, men could try a penile band, also known as an ED ring. It fastens around the base of an erect penis to keep blood from escaping. Bands are made of rubber, plastic, or silicone and can be bought online. Another helpful device is a vacuum pump. You place your penis into an airtight plastic cylinder that's attached to a handheld pump. Air is pumped out of the cylinder to create a vacuum, which increases blood flow to the penis. It takes about five minutes to get an erection. You then remove your penis from the cylinder and fit a penile band around its base to prevent blood from draining. The erection lasts until the band is removed. Some pumps are manual, while others operate on a battery. You can find them in many pharmacies and online. Go exploring Devote more time to the excitement of hugging, kissing, and exploring each other's bodies, and experiment with different foreplay like giving each other a massage or giving and receiving oral sex. Also, talk with your partner about what they are interested in trying. This could include fantasies, role playing, or different sexual positions. ""Many times, just having the conversation can boost arousal for both people,"" says Dr. Bober. Image: © yacobchuk/Getty Images",6,0.21021271,-0.22376408
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/web-based-app-helps-people-accurately-assess-need-for-statin,Web-based app helps people accurately assess need for statin,1,"Using a Web-based app, most people correctly identified their need for a cholesterol-lowering statin and took the drug appropriately without a prescription, according to a new study. Published online April 8, 2024, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the study included 1,196 adults who used the app, which is based on current guidelines for statin use. Their average LDL (bad) cholesterol level was about 140 mg/dL. In general, LDL levels should be 100 or lower and even less (below 70 or even 55) for people with heart disease. Nearly 91% of the participants correctly determined whether they should or shouldn't take a statin, as compared with a doctor's assessment. Most continued on to the six-month treatment phase, and 98% correctly used the recommended drug (a 5-milligram dose of rosuvastatin [Crestor]), achieving a 35% drop in their LDL levels. The app is being developed by the drug's maker, AstraZeneca, based on FDA guidance, but it still requires regulatory approval. The goal is to enable people to assess their need for a statin and start the drug without a physician's prescription. Image: © rogerashford /Getty Images",8,0.12057145,-0.116187915
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/meditation-a-heartfelt-habit,Meditation: A heartfelt habit?,1,"Meditating sounds so simple: Just sit comfortably and quiet your mind. Yet even seasoned practitioners will tell you that settling into a meditative state isn't easy, especially when you're anxious, worried, or stressed. But meditation may benefit people prone to cardiovascular disease, so it's worth giving this mind-calming technique a try (see ""How meditation may help your heart""). ""When you start any new activity, coaching or guidance can really help, and that's also true when learning to meditate,"" says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Many communities have meditation centers where you can take classes in person. But online courses, which are more convenient and accessible, can be just as effective, he says. Another option is to try a smartphone app that offers guided meditations; popular ones include Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, and 10% Happier. How meditation may help your heart An article published Feb. 15, 2024, in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews looked at the potential cardiovascular benefits from two forms of meditation: mindfulness-based practices and Transcendental Meditation. The authors analyzed 81 randomized controlled trials involving a total of nearly 7,000 people. Over all, the findings were mixed, which may reflect some of the inherent challenges of studying meditation. For one thing, creating an appropriate placebo or control group for meditation is tricky. Often, the controls are either people on a waiting list to receive meditation training (inactive controls) or those who do crossword puzzles or attend education sessions (active controls). For another, the people most likely to volunteer for a meditation study are often already sold on meditation's benefits and may differ from those who aren't interested in the practice. Still, the review found that mindfulness-based interventions probably reduce stress and may also lower anxiety, depression, and blood pressure. Transcendental meditation may also reduce blood pressure. According to the authors, some of meditation's effect may be indirect: when people feel calmer, that may help them avoid unhealthy ways of coping with stress, such as drinking alcohol or making poor food choices. Attention and awareness Meditative practices fall into two broad categories: focused attention and open monitoring. With focused attention, you concentrate on one thing: counting, a mantra (a word or phrase such as ""peace"" or ""may I be well""), or an object (a candle, a tree, or prayer beads, for example). One well-known form, Transcendental Meditation, uses mantras. With open monitoring, you open your awareness to everything you're experiencing, including thoughts, feelings, sounds, and bodily sensations. Mindfulness meditation, which has become popular in recent decades, incorporates both attention and awareness. Other forms of meditation include samatha (calming and concentration) meditation, vipassana (insight) meditation, and metta (loving-kindness) meditation. Cultivating a meditation practice These tips may help you foster a regular meditation practice: Practice when it's practical. For some people, mornings are most convenient. Others prefer to meditate at the end of the day. Stick with it. Make it a habit once you've found your ideal time of day to meditate. Don't have high expectations. You won't emerge from your first session as a changed human being. Meditation is a process. Give it time, and you'll see improvements gradually. Take your practice with you. Meditate wherever you can find quiet moments alone — in your bedroom, at work, or while walking in the park. Accessorize. To focus your mind, use something meaningful to you, such as a candle, a piece of art, or a photo of a loved one. Be prepared to be uncomfortable. Stilling your thoughts is harder than it sounds. It could take a while for you to feel comfortable in the practice. Don't fight the feeling. Relax into the practice. Let your thoughts drift away. Ease into your breath. Even if you feel slightly uncomfortable, try to give in to the feeling and not push back against it. Be kind to yourself. If you don't get the hang of meditation right away, forgive yourself and try again. You will eventually get it. Check in with yourself. After each session, pause and take stock of your feelings.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-leaky-gut-syndrome,What is leaky gut syndrome?,1,"Q. I've been gassy and bloated in recent months, and my sister suggested that I may have leaky gut syndrome. What's that? A. For starters, anyone who's been dealing with chronic intestinal symptoms like yours should see a doctor. There are many reasons for gas and bloating to persist, and a medical evaluation will help get to the bottom of things. Beyond that, while leaky gut syndrome isn't a clinical diagnosis, it may be one possible contributor to your symptoms. A ""leaky gut"" happens when the barrier between the gut and bloodstream breaks down due to inflammation in the small intestine. The resulting bacteria and toxins that seep through the gut lining can trigger a variety of intestinal problems, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or gastroparesis (which prevents proper stomach emptying). To determine what's causing your distress, your doctor will likely ask what foods, supplements, and medications you consume. She may also perform blood tests or endoscopic exams of the digestive tract to detect any infections or structural reasons for your symptoms. Sometimes, a simple change of diet — such as cutting out certain foods or adding others — does the trick. But getting properly assessed is your next step.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/guidelines-for-healthy-eating-with-diabetes,Guidelines for healthy eating with diabetes,1,"""What can I eat?"" is one of the most common questions that people with diabetes ask. The American Diabetes Association no longer makes specific recommendations about proportions of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Instead, its guidelines focus on developing healthy eating patterns, with the help of your doctor and a registered dietitian who has experience working with people who have diabetes. The guidelines include the following recommendations: Reduce overall carbohydrates. When you do eat carbs, they should come from nutrient-rich sources, such as vegetables (particularly non-starchy ones), whole grains, fruits, legumes, and dairy products, rather than from processed foods with added fat, sugar, and sodium. Limit your intake of saturated fat (found mainly in animal products).Even good fats such as olive oil should be eaten in moderation. Replace sugar-sweetened beverages (including those sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup or sucrose) with water. Reduce sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day, or lower if you have high blood pressure. Drink alcohol in moderation only if you can account for the calories in your daily meal plan. Moderate drinking is defined as one standard drink a day for women and up to two a day for men. You must be cautious, however. Alcohol can worsen low blood sugar reactions in people who take insulin or certain other diabetes medications. And because some effects of alcohol (such as drowsiness or slurred speech) resemble those of hypoglycemia, it can be hard to recognize a true diabetic emergency if you have one.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/exercise-can-ease-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain,Exercise can ease rheumatoid arthritis pain,1,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause pain and stiffness that makes moving the last thing you want to do. But staying active is important. Not only is it beneficial for your general health — it's also a way to strengthen the muscles around your joints, improve your range of motion, and give you the opportunity to take part in the activities you enjoy. For people with RA, it's best to take a cautious and strategic approach when starting an exercise program. An individualized program — ideally developed with the help of a physical therapist — can help you protect vulnerable joints while strengthening surrounding muscles. A well-rounded exercise program should include each of these elements: Aerobic conditioning. Exercise that increases your heart rate and breathing rate has many benefits, including lowering your chances of developing conditions such as diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. When choosing aerobic activities, people with RA should consider low-impact exercises such as swimming, bicycle riding, and walking. Resistance training. Weak muscles, whether related to inactivity or side effects of medications like steroids, can diminish your stamina and leave joints less stable. Isometric exercises — exercises that involve muscle contractions with no movement, such as clasping your hands and pressing your arms together — can be a great way to start resistance training. When pain is under control, free weights or weight machines are good options for building muscle and increasing strength. Stretching and flexibility exercises. Joints damaged by RA don't move with the same ease or to the same degree (also called range of motion) as healthy joints. That makes activities that lengthen and strengthen the muscles surrounding your joints, such as stretching exercises, tai chi, and yoga, especially important for people with RA. Balance exercises. Having RA can cause problems with gait and balance, leaving you more vulnerable to stumbles and falls. A physical therapist can recommend individualized balance-training exercises. These may include practicing standing on one leg or exercises to strengthen core muscles.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/4-ways-to-eat-your-way-to-lower-cholesterol,4 ways to eat your way to lower cholesterol,1,"Many people can lower their cholesterol levels simply by changing what they eat. For example, eating less meat (and leaner cuts) and more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains can potentially lower your total cholesterol by 25% or more. Here are four steps for lowering your cholesterol through diet. Stick with unsaturated fats and avoid saturated and trans fats. Most vegetable fats (oils) are made up of ""healthy"" unsaturated fats that are good for your heart. Foods that contain healthy fats include oily fish, nuts, seeds, and some vegetables. At the same time, try to limit your intake of foods high in saturated fat, such as many meat and dairy products. Get more soluble fiber. Eating more soluble fiber, such as that found in oatmeal and fruits, can lower blood cholesterol levels when eaten as part of a healthy-fat diet. Include plant sterols and stanols in your diet. These naturally occurring plant compounds are similar in structure to cholesterol, so when you eat them, they help limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Plant sterols and stanols are found in an increasing number of food products such as spreads, juices, and yogurts. Find a diet that works for you. When a friend or relative tells you how much his or her cholesterol level dropped after trying a particular diet, you may be tempted to try it yourself. If you do, and after a few months you discover that you're not getting the same benefits, you may need to chalk it up to genetic and physiological differences. There is no one-size-fits-all diet for cholesterol control. You may need to try several approaches to find one that works for you. Although diet can be a simple and powerful way to improve cholesterol levels, it plays a bigger role for some people than for others. Don't be discouraged if you have followed a diet but haven't reached your goal blood level. Keep it up. Even if you do end up needing medication to keep your cholesterol in check, you likely will need less than if you didn't make any dietary changes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-rid-of-bloating-tips-for-relief,How to get rid of bloating: Tips for relief,1,"Why am I so bloated? Chances are, you've thought this at some point. Bloating is very common: nearly one in seven Americans reported experiencing it over the course of a week, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. That tight, full feeling of bloating can be uncomfortable. And it's often accompanied by distension, in which the abdomen swells in size. The good news is there's a lot you can do with lifestyle, including diet and exercise, to relieve symptoms. Understanding bloating: Causes and triggers Bloating results when too much gas builds up in the abdomen. Here's a quick look at some of the most common reasons for excess gas buildup and bloating. Swallowing too much air. You swallow air every time you eat or drink. But if you consume food or fluid very quickly, you may gulp down extra air every time you swallow. Certain foods. Fruits, veggies, whole grains, and beans are all good for you, but they are harder for your gastrointestinal (GI) tract to digest. Vegetables like cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli, for example, all contain the carbohydrate raffinose. Your body can't break this substance down until it reaches your colon, where the bacteria who devour it release gas. Food intolerance. Some people are lactose intolerant, which means they have trouble digesting the milk sugar lactose. As a result, they may notice bloating after they eat or drink dairy products. Others have fructose intolerance, which means they develop GI symptoms after they eat foods high in fructose, a sugar naturally found in fruits and honey as well as table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup. A slowing system. As you get older, your digestive system tends to slow down. This can cause gas to build up in your GI tract and trigger bloating. SIBO. Some people have too many bacteria in their small intestine, a condition known as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO can lead to an imbalance of bacteria that support digestion, leading to symptoms like bloating as well as constipation and diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Bloating is a common symptoms of IBS, a condition characterized by chronic belly pain and altered bowel habits. Most people get bloated occasionally. But if it happens a lot, or if you have other symptoms like stomach pain, unexplained weight loss, or bloody stools, see your doctor. They'll want to check for a more serious condition like inflammatory bowel disease or even colon cancer. Dietary changes to reduce bloating The following dietary tweaks can help to reduce bloating. Keep a diary. For a few weeks, note what you ate, when you ate, and when you felt especially bloated. This may help you and your doctor identify foods that are problematic. Remove or decrease quantities of key culprits. Some of the top offenders for bloating include: carbonated beverages like soda and beer dairy products: you can switch to lactose-free milks (Lactaid, others) or plant-based milks like almond milk instead sugar-free gum and candies — they contain artificial sweeteners that can cause bloating beans fruits high in fructose such as apples, apricots, bananas, peaches, pears, and dried fruit cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower. Consider a low-FODMAP diet. If the above steps don't help, you may want to consider this eating pattern, which avoids certain types of carbohydrates that are hard to digest. Since this diet can be very restrictive, it's best to do it under the guidance of a nutritionist. Mindful eating practices to prevent bloating If you gobble down your meals, you may find that you're bloated afterwards. When you eat fast, you swallow air. You may also overeat. Both contribute to bloating. One way to help prevent this is to practice mindful eating. That means you focus on your food rather than your phone, TV, or another distraction. Some ways to eat mindfully include: Eat with chopsticks, or with your non-dominant hand (so if you're a righty, eat with your left hand). Chew your food 30 times per bite. Eat in a screen-free zone — that means no smartphone, computer, or TV. Plate your food rather than eating it straight from a container or serving dish. Eat sitting down. Make your meal last at least 20 minutes. Physical activities to keep bloating at bay Staying active is good for your brain, heart, and even your gut. According to a 2023 review published in the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, exercise — whether it's walking, running, biking, swimming, or doing yoga — appears to help relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, which include bloating. It may also help relieve stress, which has also been linked to worsening of bloating. If you can't fit in a regular workout, at least try to take a stroll after meals. People who took a 10-to-15-minute walk after they ate reported less bloating, according to a 2021 study. Home remedies for bloating relief There are a lot of products out there claiming to cure bloating. While there's no magic way to instantly relieve gas, here are a few things you can try at home. Cook with anise. This herb has also been shown to reduce bloating in people with IBS and dyspepsia. Try over-the-counter medications. The most popular one is simethicone, found in products like Gas-X or Maalox Anti-Gas. Simethicone helps to break up gas bubbles. Other products, like CharcoCaps, contain activated charcoal. These products may help with occasional bloating, but there's no good evidence any work. Consider alpha-d-galactosidase. Also known as Beano, this over-the-counter product helps to break down certain difficult-to-digest carbohydrates found in beans and some vegetables.",9,0.3699366,0.1185281
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/are-you-getting-essential-nutrients-from-your-diet,Probiotics and prebiotics: what's really important,1,"Probiotics and prebiotics are a hot topic these days. You've likely seen many ads on television and online for supplements and foods that promise to deliver helpful bacteria and their benefits. Here's what you need to know before purchasing these products. Your large intestine contains 100 trillion ""good"" bacteria that are essential to health. Called the microbiome, these beneficial microbes help maintain healthy bowel function, and may even help with conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. Research suggests they may even play a role in regulating weight and mood. Everyone starts with their own unique microbiome at birth. We add to these through the foods we eat. Here are some of the best ways to add healthful bacteria to your microbiome: Yogurt and kefir. Be sure to look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label to make sure you are getting live cultures. Fermented foods. Beneficial microbes are the ""cooks"" for some familiar foods. For example, they turn cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into sour pickles, soybeans into miso, and sweetened tea into kombucha. When the products have been pasteurized — as most packaged fermented foods are — the microbes will be dead. The best solution is to buy from delis where they do the pickling themselves, or natural food stores that carry fermented foods. Or make your own; you can find clear and easy instructions in books and online. There are also probiotic supplements on the market, of course. But none have proven medical indications. It's best to stick with dietary sources rich in pre- and probiotics. You can help your body produce healthy gut bacteria. Here's how: Include plenty of foods rich in insoluble fiber, which tend to contain the most prebiotics. You'll find them whole-grain products such as oatmeal and whole-grain breads, as well as in vegetables like asparagus, leeks, onions, and garlic, and starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes and corn. Beans, lentils, and peas are also good sources. Limit sugar, saturated fat, and processed foods. These can deplete the good bacteria in the gut. As always, try to stick with whole, unprocessed foods.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/how-to-silence-snoring,How to silence snoring,1,"Snoring is generally harmless, but it can be annoying, especially for your bed partner. Fortunately, you can take steps to alleviate the problem. Start by making lifestyle changes and trying simple home remedies. You can also try one of the many products marketed as stop-snoring aids. But if you snore and you also wake up gasping for air or frequently feel sleepy or tired during the day, you likely have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can cause hypertension and more serious medical problems. Consult a doctor if your snoring affects the quality of your sleep. Lifestyle changes and home remedies You can try these do-it-yourself suggestions to help keep your airway open during sleep: Avoid alcohol — or don't drink alcohol within three hours of bedtime. This will help prevent your airway muscles from becoming slack while you sleep. Lose weight if you are overweight or obese. Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airways. Losing some weight could help to open the airways for someone who is overweight or obese, although many people who are lean also snore. Try home remedies for nasal obstruction issues. If your nose is stuffy due to mucus, try rinsing your sinuses with saline. If you have allergies, reduce dust mites and pet dander in your bedroom or use an allergy medication. If swollen nasal tissues are the problem, a humidifier or medication may reduce swelling. If you smoke, quit. In addition to smoking's many other negative health effects, people who smoke are also more likely to snore. Possible reasons include nightly nicotine withdrawal, which can disrupt sleep, as well as increased swelling and irritation in the upper airway. In fact, even secondhand smoke from another member of your household may increase your risk of snoring. Sleep on your side or elevate your head. When you sleep flat on your back, your tongue falls back and presses against the top of your airway, so sleeping on your side may help. To help you stay on your side, try pressing a long, oversized body pillow against your back. You can also wear a small fanny pack filled with tennis balls, or tape a tennis ball or rolled-up pair of socks to the back of your pajamas. This makes lying on your back uncomfortable. Or you can try elevating your head by using an extra pillow or a wedge pillow, or by propping up the head of your bed using blocks of wood under the top of the bed frame. These lifestyle changes and home remedies may help with simple snoring. However, if you have periods of gasping during sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness as well as snoring, it could be sleep apnea and let your doctor know.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-you-become-a-super-ager,"Can you become a ""super-ager""?",1,"The 2024 presidential election, in which the two leading candidates will turn 78 and 82 during the year, has raised the issue about cognitive health as people age. But individuals known as ""super-agers"" have shown that for some, age really is only a number. ""Super-agers are known to maintain peak mental prowess well into their 90s and avoid Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,"" says Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, chief of the Division of Brain Injury Rehabilitation at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""While the general thinking is that memory declines and brain functions slow as we age no matter what, studies on super-agers suggest this is not inevitable, and there may be ways to maintain high levels of cognitive function for much longer in life."" The aging brain The average brain declines in volume and weight by about 5% per decade after age 40, with a steeper decline after age 70. Brain shrinkage particularly affects the brain regions involved with learning and memory, like the frontal lobe and hippocampus. A smaller brain volume is also linked to less robust communication between brain regions, which leads to slower processing speed and can impair other cognitive functions. ""These usual age-related brain changes can affect thinking and make it harder to recall words and names, focus on tasks, and process new information,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. The brains of super-agers, however, shrink at about half the average rate, and their memory and cognitive skills stay on par with younger brains. What goes on inside super-ager brains that accounts for this? Harvard investigators, publishing in the November 2021 issue of Cerebral Cortex, offer a clue. They recruited 40 older adults who were identified as super-agers. The super-agers took a memory test while their brains were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which shows the activity of different brain areas. For comparison, the researchers also carried out the memory test and fMRI scan on 41 young adults (average age 25). The super-agers performed similarly to the younger people on the memory tests. The fMRI also showed that activity in the super-agers' visual cortex, the brain area that processes visual input, was similar to that in the younger brains. What's super about super-agers? Studies have found that genetics is the greatest component in the state of aging brains. ""Science has identified about 100 genes common among super-agers, although it's unclear which ones in particular are linked with neurological benefits,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. ""If you win the lottery and are born with those genes, you have a good chance of becoming a super-ager."" But what if your genetic scratch-off is a bust? Can you still be a winner with super-aging? ""Super-agers also tend to follow a healthy lifestyle, and many reach their 90s free of problems like heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Here's a look at the healthy daily habits of many super-agers and how they may help protect your brain. Eat more ""superfoods."" Many super-agers follow diets rich in foods high in antioxidants, polyphenols, and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients have been shown to fight inflammation and help protect the body from disease-causing cell damage. Examples include berries, whole grains (oatmeal, quinoa), fatty fish (salmon, trout), nuts (walnuts, almonds), olive oil, cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower), avocados, and green tea. Unsurprisingly, these foods are staples in many plant-based diets associated with brain and heart health, like the MIND, DASH, and Mediterranean diets. It's not certain which of the foods or amounts are ideal, so focus on meals that contain a variety of them. Be more active. Super-agers tend to engage in more physical activity. Regular exercise has been found to help maintain brain volume and cognitive function, even if you begin later in life. Exercise sparks physiological changes in the body, such as the production of growth factors — chemicals that enhance brain cell function and survival and can actually stimulate formation of new brain cells. Many studies have suggested that the parts of the brain that control thinking and memory are larger in volume in people who exercise than in people who don't. It doesn't matter what type of exercise you do. Research has found that walking, swimming, other aerobic activity (especially high-intensity interval training, or HIIT), strength training, tai chi, and yoga are all associated with improved memory. But consistency is key. ""Being active on a regular basis leads to greater brain benefits,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Be more social. Super-agers tend to have more social interactions. Studies have shown that regular social engagement is associated with healthier brains. The opposite is also true: social isolation is linked to lower volume of gray matter in brain regions related to cognition. Challenge yourself. Super-agers challenge their brains, and studies have shown that learning new things as you age aids memory. For instance, study a second language, learn a musical instrument, or adopt a new hobby. Get good sleep. Super-agers also prioritize sleep. (Guidelines suggest seven to nine hours nightly.) ""During sleep, the brain clears away metabolic waste that builds up early in the development of Alzheimer's disease,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. A study in the November 2022 issue of the journal Sleep found that trouble falling or staying asleep three or more nights per week for three months boosted the risk for worsening memory in older adults.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-low-should-ldl-cholesterol-go,How low should LDL cholesterol go?,1,"When it comes to reducing ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, how low should you go? ""People who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases can benefit from driving LDL levels as low as possible to help reduce their risk for heart attacks and strokes,"" says cardiologist Dr. Christopher Cannon, editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter. ""Across many large clinical trials, for LDL, the lower the better."" The good and the bad Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body. The body uses it to make cell membranes and certain hormones. The fat you consume from food is absorbed in the intestine and transported to the liver, which converts it into cholesterol and then releases it into the bloodstream. Eating high-cholesterol foods often has only a modest impact on cholesterol in the blood, but many such foods are also high in saturated fats, which have a greater effect on cholesterol levels. ""Most of your cholesterol level is determined genetically,"" says Dr. Cannon. There are two main types of cholesterol: LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL is called ""bad"" because excess amounts in the bloodstream can lodge inside artery walls. These deposits, called plaques, can rupture and trigger clotting that blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke. By comparison, HDL has in the past been considered ""good"" because some forms of HDL collect excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls. Still, notes Dr. Cannon, ""many clinical trials have found that raising blood levels of HDL does not lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, so the focus is on lowering LDL."" By the numbers Current guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology set optimal LDL levels for the general population at below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL); 100 to 159 mg/dL is deemed high, and 160 mg/dL and higher is considered dangerous. People with known cardiovascular disease should aim for LDL levels below 70 mg/dL. ""Thus, across the spectrum of patients, the higher risk ones have a lower goal for LDL,"" says Dr. Cannon. Besides high LDL levels, having one or more other factors also can contribute to your cardiovascular risk, such as a family history of premature heart disease (a father or brother who was diagnosed at 55 or younger, or a mother or sister diagnosed before age 65) smoking obesity diabetes high blood pressure low levels of HDL (below 40 mg/dL). Why the focus on 70 mg/dL? ""Studies have shown that when LDL falls below this number, plaques in arteries get smaller and they stabilize, which lowers the risk for heart attacks and stroke,"" says Dr. Cannon. But how far below 70 mg/dL should you go? Clinical trials have shown and European guidelines recommend that people with cardiovascular disease at the highest risk should aim for LDL levels below 55 mg/dL. Dr. Cannon notes that the U.S. guidelines have not been updated since 2018, and believes they will eventually follow Europe's lead and make 55 mg/dL the new target for high-risk individuals. What about people who are not at high risk? In most people in this group, LDL levels between 100 and 130 mg/dL may be acceptable. ""However, we still generally aim for LDL levels below 100, since benefits have been seen in trials that look at ways to prevent cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Cannon. ""Ultimately, your doctor can suggest the ideal target LDL based on your cardiac risk factors and history."" Lifestyle and medications The first step to lowering high LDL levels is making dietary changes — cutting down on saturated fat by adopting a heart-healthy diet like the Mediterranean, DASH, or other similar plant-based diets — losing weight, and increasing exercise. But often medication is needed to help drive down very high LDL levels and keep them low. This usually begins with a type of drug called a statin. Statins work to lower LDL by blocking an enzyme in the liver that helps make cholesterol. The drugs also have anti-inflammatory properties, and inflammation is a known contributor to plaque buildup. Another benefit: statins help prevent plaques from breaking open and releasing chemicals that stimulate blood clot formation, which leads to heart artery blockage and a heart attack. Depending on your LDL level, your doctor will recommend the best statin and dosage for your situation. The downside to statins is the possible side effects. The most common are achy muscles. If this happens to you, your doctor can temporarily lower the dose or switch to a different statin. While statins are the first-line drug choice, three other classes of medications also can help reduce LDL — ezetimibe (Zetia), bempedoic acid (Nexletol), and PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha, Praluent, or Leqvio). ""Any of the three can be added to or substituted for statin therapy if people have not reached their LDL goal, or if they cannot tolerate statin side effects,"" says Dr. Cannon. Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Bempedoic acid and PCSK9 inhibitors work on liver cell receptors to increase the uptake and destruction of LDL cholesterol, thereby lowering LDL blood levels. Can your LDL be too low? Not really, says Dr. Cannon. ""Driving down LDL to really low levels might increase the risk of medication side effects, but there are no problems directly related to very low LDL levels.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/want-better-sleep-aim-for-at-least-an-hour-of-exercise-per-week,Want better sleep? Aim for at least an hour of exercise per week,1,"Regular exercise promotes better sleep quality and reduces the risk for insomnia. But how much exercise does it take to get sleep benefits? A study published online March 26, 2024, by BMJ Open suggests an answer. Researchers evaluated the sleep questionnaire responses of about 4,400 people (ages 39 to 67) in Europe. Participants reported on their overall health and various aspects of their physical activity and sleep habits (including how long they usually slept each night and any insomnia symptoms they had, such as difficulty falling asleep, nighttime awakenings, or daytime sleepiness). Answers were collected at two points in time, 10 years apart. People who said that they exercised at least twice a week (for a total of at least an hour a week) for the entire 10 years were much less likely to report sleeping difficulties compared with people who reported that they were either inactive or less active during the study period. The study is observational and can't prove conclusively that exercising an hour or more per week will improve sleep. But we know that any amount of exercise is beneficial for health. This study provides an additional incentive to get more active. Image: © kali9/Getty Images",6,0.2866077,-0.3193127
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/is-niacin-safe-for-the-heart,Is niacin safe for the heart?,1,"Q. I've been taking a product called Niagen (nicotinamide riboside) as an anti-aging supplement. But I recently read that niacin may increase the risk of heart disease. Could that be a concern with Niagen as well? A. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is a water-soluble vitamin that helps your body convert food into energy. Niacin is the generic name for nicotinic acid and nicotinamide (also called niacinamide) and related derivatives such as nicotinamide riboside, the product you take. Niacin occurs naturally in many foods, including poultry, nuts, beans, and grains. It's also found in multivitamin supplements, B complex supplements, and supplements containing only niacin. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are the two main forms found in supplements. High-dose nicotinic acid is also available as a prescription medication for improving blood lipid levels. Niacin can lower triglycerides and raise high-density lipoprotein levels, usually requiring 1,500 to 2,000 milligrams (mg) a day to achieve this. However, prescription niacin has not been shown to lower the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke. A large study of more than 25,000 patients tested niacin in combination with cholesterol-lowering statin drugs found little additional benefit when compared with statins alone. What's more, high-dose niacin was associated with many worrisome side effects, including a higher risk of new-onset diabetes, worsening control of diabetes in those already had it, and a higher risk of serious gastrointestinal symptoms requiring hospitalization. As a result, in 2016, the FDA withdrew its approval of niacin for use in combination with statins or other lipid-lowering agents. Since then, niacin use in people with heart disease has fallen. The recent news about niacin you're referring to comes from a study of about 1,100 people with heart disease who were followed for three years. Researchers found that higher blood levels of two breakdown products of excess niacin were linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. However, they had no information about the participant's dietary niacin intake, and because this wasn't a clinical trial, the results cannot prove that niacin is to blame for this observation. In addition, we know that the amount of niacin found in multivitamins is not harmful. According to the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, the daily upper limit (the largest daily intake of a nutrient considered safe for most people) for niacin from dietary supplements is 35 mg for adults. Nicotinamide has fewer side effects than nicotinic acid. But at high doses — 500 mg per day or more — nicotinamide can cause diarrhea and easy bruising and can increase bleeding from wounds. So that's something to keep in mind when taking nicotinamide supplements. Also, based on the scientific evidence to date, this supplement appears to have little benefit for people.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/salmonella-is-sneaky-watch-out-202405293044,Salmonella is sneaky: Watch out,1,"Pop quiz: what is Salmonella? If you've ever had a run-in with this bacteria, you know it can cause a food-borne illness called salmonellosis, a form of food poisoning. But you may not know that Salmonella bacteria sicken an estimated 1.35 million people and hospitalize 26,500 every year in the United States. What's more, it kills more total people than any other type of food poisoning. And Salmonella bacteria can be sneaky — not only by triggering unusual complications, but infecting people in startling ways, says Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. One patient she treated showed up with an abdominal aortic aneurysm — a dangerous bulge in the lower section of the body's largest artery — that looked infected. Testing revealed a culprit some would find surprising: Salmonella. ""It's just an interesting organism and it can be kind of scary,"" she says. How do people get infected by Salmonella? Many of the foods Salmonella bacteria lurk in are raw or undercooked. Breaded raw chicken products like nuggets and chicken Kiev are one way it may reach your table. But a variety of foods have been implicated — including organic basil, cantaloupes, ground beef, nut butters, raw cookie dough, eggs, raw or unpasteurized milk, and flour. Even small pets such as turtles and frogs, along with dog food, have contributed to Salmonella outbreaks in recent years. You can also become infected by handling contaminated food and spreading the bacteria from your hands to your mouth. Additionally, you can spread it to others on your hands or even on your clothes without becoming sick yourself. ""It's a bug that's carried in stool and animal feces and is also present in the environment,"" Dr. Hohmann says. ""So it can set up shop in lots of different inanimate objects, soils, and machinery, especially in moist environments."" What symptoms can Salmonella cause? Most of the time, Salmonella infection leads to gastroenteritis, usually causing just an upset stomach, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. These symptoms can start as soon as six hours after ingesting the bacteria. Typically, symptoms resolve on their own within two to three days. Some people have such mild symptoms they're barely noticeable. ""The classic case might be a college student who eats a burrito from a sketchy place, gets sick for a couple of days, gets better, and doesn't think anything of it,"" says Dr. Hohmann. Sometimes symptoms are more serious, such as severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, or unexplained high fever and marked fatigue. These symptoms require a call to your doctor. How is salmonellosis treated? Most people will get better on their own without any medicines. Replacing lost fluids by sipping water or electrolyte drinks to avoid dehydration will help. Call a doctor if you have diarrhea and a fever higher than 102° F diarrhea that doesn't improve after three days bloody stools vomiting so severe it prevents you from keeping liquids down. Treating the infection with medicine comes with an annoying paradox, Dr. Hohmann says. If doctors decide to prescribe antibiotics, the person taking the medicine may shed the organism for longer than if they were never treated. ""Then that person may have the opportunity — either through poor personal hygiene, sex, or working as a food worker — to spread it to others,"" she explains. ""It's challenging."" What complications can Salmonella lead to? Some people get sicker with salmonellosis than others, with seemingly no rhyme or reason. But certain folks are especially vulnerable to serious infection, including: adults 65 and older pregnant women children under 5 people whose immune systems are weakened by diseases (such as cancer) or treatments (such as immunosuppressing drugs). A small percentage of those infected can have Salmonella in their blood, which can spread the infection to other parts of the body such as the urinary tract, bones, joints, or central nervous system (brain and spinal fluid). And, like Dr. Hohmann's patient with the abdominal aortic aneurysm, on rare occasions Salmonella can lead to unusual blood vessel complications in people who already have atherosclerosis, blockage of the arteries caused by plaque buildup. ""It's not that common,"" she says. ""Many physicians are aware of it, so they take special care if Salmonella is found in a person with vascular disease."" What steps can you take to avoid Salmonella? While new USDA rules that take effect in 2025 may help fuel recalls of certain foods, we all can take steps to avoid the food poisoning, illness, and hospitalizations that Salmonella exposure can cause. Dr. Hohmann and the CDC suggest these strategies: Using hot water and soap, wash cutting boards or plates on which you cut into raw foods — including vegetables and fruit — before using those surfaces for other purposes. If possible, use separate cutting boards for produce, meat, and fish. Refrigerate or freeze foods that are perishable, prepared, or left over within two hours to thwart salmonella growth. Always wash hands well with soap and water before preparing food and after contact with animals, using the toilet, or changing diapers. If you have a sick pet, take extra care handling its feces and wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Take additional steps to help more vulnerable people stay healthy: Don't let young children touch high-risk animals, such as turtles, frogs, chickens, or ducks. ""And if you're taking young children to a petting zoo, they should not be petting animals unless you can disinfect their hands immediately afterward,"" she says. Older adults and those with compromised immune systems should take extra care to wash and cook foods thoroughly. People who have had a transplant (such as a kidney transplant) should not keep reptiles or amphibians as pets. ""You hate to make people paranoid, so that we're washing our lettuce leaves with soap, but it's worth thinking about these things, particularly if you have people in your household who are susceptible — which is an increasing number of people,"" Dr. Hohmann says.",4,-0.011080481,0.121598974
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/sleeping-apart-good-for-your-sex-life,Sleeping apart: Good for your sex life?,1,"A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that one-third of respondents reported occasionally or regularly sleeping in separate rooms to accommodate a bed partner. This may seem like a sign of a troubled relationship, but the practice is quite common and can lead to couples being happier and closer, according to Sharon Bober, associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and founding director of the Sexual Health Program at Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""Just because you don't always sleep in the same bed doesn't mean that you feel separated as a couple,"" she says. Contributing issues The main motivation behind separate sleeping is not about lack of physical desire or emotional intimacy, but simply the need for both people to get a good night's rest. ""Sharing a bed means you share the other person's sleep behavior,"" says Bober. ""If a person snores, grinds their teeth, thrashes and twitches, or gets up repeatedly at night, this can disrupt their partner's sleep, making partners more tired and irritable, which can strain the relationship."" Other issues that could contribute to sleeping apart include environmental factors (one partner needs the bedroom to be cooler or warmer) and sleeping schedules (one might like to stay up later reading or watching TV, or might need to get up early). ""Getting restful sleep is essential for good health and a good sex life,"" says Bober. ""Sometimes sleeping in separate rooms, both people can sleep better and feel rested. Instead of resulting in something negative, this might allow for both partners to have more energy, better mood, and consequently more desire for sex."" Pillow talk Sometimes just one person expresses the desire to sleep separately, which can make their partner feel rejected and worry about their relationship. ""If either partner feels concerned about not sleeping in the same bed, the couple needs to talk about what might feel worrisome,"" says Bober. ""The conversation might reveal an issue not related to intimacy that has been lingering for a while."" Before sleeping apart, another option may be to consider compromises that address the issues of disrupted sleep and are acceptable to both people. For example, if your partner's snoring wakes you up, wear earplugs, use a bedside sound machine, or wear earbuds and listen to a podcast as you fall asleep. The snoring partner could try sleeping on their side or see a doctor to find out whether there's an underlying health problem, like sleep apnea. Even when a couple agrees to a new sleeping arrangement, Bober suggests several strategies to enhance and maintain connection while also making the transition smoother for both partners: Set a schedule. At first, agree to sleep apart during the week or on specific days when partners need the most rest, but choose to sleep together on the weekends and make adjustments as needed. Make both sleeping spaces cozy. ""You both need a comfortable sleeping environment,"" says Bober. ""Make sure both people are happy with their sleeping space."" Have a snuggle time. Before bedtime, spend time together in bed to snuggle, talk, read together, or have some romantic time; then, when it's time for sleep, move to your separate beds. You can also do the reverse: get in bed together in the morning and connect with coffee and conversation. ""This kind of flexibility can help couples continue to associate the bed with closeness, pleasure, and intimacy,"" says Bober. Make a date for sex. Not sleeping together can interfere with spontaneous sex. If you and your partner are concerned about a declining sex life, schedule time for intimacy. ""This can create a sense of excitement and allow for anticipation,"" says Bober. To enhance the experience, tie your get-together to a date night or a romantic evening at home. Nap together. Another idea is napping together during the day. ""Even a short nap together can help maintain the bedroom bonding and is something couples can do either on occasion or more regularly,"" says Bober. Assess the arrangement regularly. Check in with each other every day to see what's working and what isn't. It's not good enough if sleeping separately feels helpful only for one person in the relationship. You can always go back to the drawing board and come up with a revised plan. Sleeping apart, either once in a while or more regularly, can be beneficial, if both partners are happy with the setup, sleep well, and continue to feel connected as a couple.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/10-habits-for-good-health,10 habits for good health,1,"The foundation of a healthy lifestyle consists of lasting habits like eating right, watching your weight, exercising regularly, managing your mental health, and getting routine medical exams. But even daily, small steps toward these goals also can have a significant impact. Here are some practices that can help support your ongoing health journey. While you might find it unrealistic to follow them all the time, try to include them in your daily life as much as possible. 1. Do a morning stretch Stretching before getting out of bed wakes up the body, improves circulation, and promotes relaxation, helping to set the day's tone. While you're still lying in bed, move the covers aside, then flex and release your lower limbs several times. Bend your knees and lift your legs into the air. With your legs still elevated, flex your feet up and down and rotate them side to side. Next, sit up and slowly look left and then right. Roll your shoulders several times. Flex your wrists up and down, and open and close your hands repeatedly. 2. Stay hydrated Proper hydration supports digestion, improves brain performance, and increases energy, among other health benefits. Drink a big glass of water after you wake up and a glass with every meal. 3. Floss Maintaining good oral health includes daily flossing, but make sure you do it right. First, wrap the floss around your middle fingers, which helps you reach the back teeth. Then loop the floss around one side of a tooth, so it makes a C shape. Beginning at the gum line, slide it up and down the tooth several times. (Don't move the floss back and forth in a sawing motion. You miss cleaning the entire tooth, and the friction can irritate the gum.) Repeat on the other side of the tooth, and then the other teeth. 4. Apply sunscreen Sunscreen is the best defense against skin-damaging rays. After washing your face in the morning, apply a facial moisturizer that contains sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Or blend equal parts sunscreen and a regular moisturizer. Use one or two nickel-sized dollops to cover your entire face, neck, ears, and any bald or thinning spots on your head. 5. Go nuts When you crave a snack, reach for unsalted nuts and seeds like almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and cashews. They contain many beneficial nutrients and help prevent cravings for highly processed foods. Nuts are high in calories, so keep to a palm-sized portion. 6. Nap Afternoon naps can recharge a weary body and may boost cognitive function. A study published online on Jan. 25, 2021, by General Psychiatry found that nappers scored higher on cognitive tests than non-nappers. The researchers found that shorter and less frequent naps — lasting less than 30 minutes, no more than four times a week — were associated with the most benefit. Schedule naps for the early afternoon, and use a timer so you don't oversleep. 7. Bust some moves Break up bouts of sitting with small bursts of movement. For example, dance across a room instead of walking. When you brush your teeth, suck in your lower gut for 30 seconds, which activates your abdominal muscles. Do 10 air squats or push-ups (on the ground or against the kitchen counter). Make it a habit to stand up ""twice"" each time you stand up — that is, get up, sit back down, and then get back up. 8. Take a breather Alternate-nostril breathing, in which you breathe through one nostril at a time, is believed to help reduce stress by slowing your breathing rhythm and forcing you to take deep, full breaths. Using a finger or thumb, close one nostril and slowly breathe in and out through the open nostril. After about five to 10 breaths, switch and close the other nostril and repeat the breathing pattern. For a variation, try inhaling through one nostril with the other closed, changing finger/thumb positions, and exhaling through the previously closed nostril. Then, inhale through that one, close it, and exhale through the other nostril. Go back and forth like this for a few minutes. 9. Enjoy a hobby A study published online Sept. 11, 2023, by Nature Medicine suggests that having a hobby is good for people's overall health and mood. Hobbies involve creativity, sensory engagement, self-expression, relaxation, and cognitive stimulation. One way to pick up a new hobby is with a project kit designed to teach you a skill like gardening, building a model, carving wood, or making beer, soap, hot sauce, or jewelry. The kits come with instructions and all the materials you need to start. You can find kits at local bookstores or hobby stores, or go online: just type ""how-to kits"" or ""project kits"" into a search engine. 10. Be social Social interactions can stave off loneliness and protect against depression and cognitive decline. Strive to have some kind of social engagement every day: make a phone call, send an email, or chat with a neighbor. Another option is to create your own social pod — a small, intimate group that you interact with regularly, like meeting for coffee or conversing over a Zoom call. Casual conversations are also helpful; for example, chat with a grocery store employee or interact with a stranger on the street. Image: © andreswd/Getty Images",6,0.3908534,-0.14924113
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/keto-diet-is-not-healthy-and-may-harm-the-heart,Keto diet is not healthy and may harm the heart,1,"The ketogenic (keto) diet — which is high in fat and protein and low in carbohydrates — doesn't meet standards for a healthy diet and may not be safe for some people with heart disease, according to a review in the March 2024 issue of Current Problems in Cardiology. The review summarized the current evidence on how keto diets may raise heart disease risk. While the diet may dramatically reduce fat mass and weight over the short term, there is scarce evidence for any long-term benefit. Ketogenic diets appear to lower blood levels of triglycerides but raise levels of artery-clogging LDL cholesterol. With respect to lowering blood sugar and blood pressure, the observed short-term benefits fade over time. The diet's extreme carbohydrate restrictions may lead people to shun most vegetables and fruits and consume large amounts of leafy greens. But the vitamin K in these foods may interfere with the anti-clotting drug warfarin taken by some heart patients. And drugs known as SGLT-2 inhibitors, which are used to treat diabetes and heart failure, may be incompatible with a keto diet, according to the review.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/caregiving-crisis,Caregiving crisis,1,"If a traditional caregiving scenario were captured on time-lapse video, Katherine Lyman contends that early scenes would depict an adult daughter accompanying her aging parent to a doctor's appointment looking ""put together"" and on top of things. Just a few years later, however, the daughter would appear drastically different — ""really disheveled, because she isn't taking care of herself."" ""I cannot tell you how many times I've leaned forward, looked the daughter in the eyes, and asked, 'How are you coping with all of this? What are you doing to let off steam? It's great that you're keeping all these plates spinning, but it comes at a cost,'"" recounts Lyman, a geriatric nurse practitioner at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Increasingly, that cost is caregivers' own health and well-being. Indeed, the story of caregiving in the United States is becoming something of a cautionary tale as troubling forces collide. More caregivers are on tap than ever, with 43 million Americans providing unpaid assistance to a family member or another loved one. Nearly three-quarters are 50 or older themselves, while more than 75% are women, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. Meanwhile, an estimated 73 million Americans will be 65 or older by 2030, potentially fueling the need for additional caregivers. Longevity is perhaps the biggest contributor to the brewing storm, Harvard experts say. ""A lot of us are living into our late years and living very well and independently, but not all of us,"" Lyman says. ""Those years may come with increased infirmity or cognitive impairment, or both."" Spectrum of responsibilities As people age, several core issues tend to prompt the need for spouses, adult children, or others to step in to help. Let's dub the problem areas the three M's: mobility, memory, and medications. Yet caregiving is far from a one-size-fits-all proposition, with duties falling on a spectrum from occasional to relentless and minor to suffocating. ""It runs the gamut from actually living with the person to living in a different state and putting cameras in different rooms to check on them,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, clinical chief of gerontology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""Some caregivers come periodically, fill pill boxes, take people to doctor's appointments, or take them shopping. But caregiving can also be financial: paying the bills, organizing the taxes, or taking over as power of attorney."" Whether they're popping in a few times a week or handling daily bathing, dressing, and toileting — or something in between — caregivers often wear many hats, Lyman notes. ""You become not just their caregiver, but their confidante, psychiatrist, chef, grocery shopper, laundress, chauffeur, and pharmacist,"" she says. Health fallout Such comprehensive responsibilities can exact an underappreciated physical and mental toll — especially if your loved one's deterioration is prolonged — and create a downward spiral that affects both caregiver and recipient. Six in 10 caregivers work part or full-time, spreading themselves even thinner. Copious research has focused on the mental health fallout. Between 40% and 70% of caregivers deal with significant symptoms of depression. And those who are women fare worse than men who take on such duties, reporting higher levels of depression and anxiety. Similarly, a wide range of studies point to caregiving's physical consequences, especially pain. Caregivers are prone to headaches and often suffer back injuries or cope with arthritis, Dr. Salamon says. A Sept. 1, 2023, study published by The Gerontologist that gathered data from nearly 2,000 caregivers (average age 62) showed just over half suffered pain of some kind. About 30% said their pain limited the ways they could provide care. Caregivers also face an increased risk of heart disease, and women caring for a spouse are more likely to report having high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. ""Many caregivers in their 50s, 60s, and 70s have their own health issues,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""It gets more stressful as time goes on and the patient and caregiver both get older."" About 10% of caregivers acknowledge their own health has suffered as a result of their responsibilities. But that doesn't mean they're vigilantly attending to it. Nearly three-quarters reported not having gone to a doctor as often as they should, while more than half had missed medical appointments, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. ""People start losing weight, not eating properly, and not paying attention to themselves,"" Lyman says. ""Their health takes a back seat, and so do their interests."" How to rally the troops Even in large families, the lion's share of caregiving responsibilities often falls to one sibling when Mom or Dad is declining. But family members should recognize that the caregiver isn't a hero—and shouldn't be expected to perform like one. ""I don't think a lot of family members realize how stressful caregiving is, and they don't offer to help,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, clinical chief of gerontology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""They leave it to the caregiver to ask them, and that's not right. They need to wholeheartedly offer."" To smooth that process—and the sometimes-fraught dynamic between caregiver and other relatives—Harvard experts offer these tips: Call a family meeting. This can be held in person or over Zoom, ideally including the patient's doctor or a geriatric care manager. The best result: everyone gets on the same page about day-to-day problems and caregiving responsibilities that require attention. Create a schedule. This might include setting up a shared online calendar for family members to sign up for tasks and time periods to chip in. Rotate care. ""Set up a schedule so every day 'belongs' to a different child,"" Dr. Salamon suggests. Match people's tasks to their abilities. If your sister is a finance whiz, she's probably the right one to handle Dad's taxes. Your brother is a lawyer? Ask him to sort out the legal nuances of Mom's property sale. Be specific. If you're the caregiver, you may want two hours to go to a social event or appointment. Say so. ""It's very important to make your requests concrete, tell others exactly what you need, and do it in spite of any guilt,"" Dr. Salamon says. Ask how you can help. If you're not the main caregiver, can you take over one evening each week or stay for a weekend? Or perhaps you can coordinate services such as housecleaning, yard work, or transportation to medical appointments. Be explicit about what you can provide. ""Say, 'I can take Mom to the hairdresser on Wednesday afternoon,' or, 'I'm coming on Wednesday for two hours—why don't you take some time off?'"" Dr. Salamon says. Finding help Even as they feel the strain, caregivers are often loath to seek support. ""They're good at giving help, but lousy at asking for it,"" Lyman says. Still, it's crucial to make that leap. Harvard experts offer these strategies for caregivers to preserve body and soul: Look into respite care. Some assisted living or nursing facilities provide temporary care so family members can take a vacation. Adult day programs can provide a daily break. ""Sometimes they only run from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., but that can be huge,"" Lyman says. ""And some provide transportation."" Call your local Agency on Aging. Some offer housekeeping services to eligible older adults, while others coordinate volunteers who can pinch-hit and ""stay for a few hours so the caregiver can get out and be free for a little while,"" Dr. Salamon says. Sniff out informal help. ""Ask friends who drive if they can pick Mom up and bring her to the senior center or to her hair appointment,"" Lyman suggests. Explore houses of worship. Local religious groups may have cadres of helpers. ""Some have volunteers who pick up people who want to go to their service and take them home afterward,"" Lyman says. Consider therapy. Nearly four in 10 caregivers describe their responsibilities as emotionally stressful. Talking to a therapist can bring relief. Tap into telehealth. Schedule virtual visits with doctors or therapists to get the care you need. ""You don't have to leave Mom unattended,"" Lyman says. ""You can go into the next room and shut the door for a half-hour or hour."" Image: © laflor/Getty Images",2,-0.08906034,-0.10765375
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-difference-between-age-spots-and-sun-spots,What's the difference between age spots and sun spots?,1,"Q. I have a couple of brown skin patches that look like age spots. But my friend says they might be sun spots, which can develop into skin cancer. How can I tell the difference? A. It's an important question, since distinguishing sun spots from age spots — or ""liver"" spots, as our grandmothers called them — can help us determine when to seek a doctor's evaluation. Both spots tend to appear on areas that get a lot of sun exposure, such as the face, hands, arms, and shoulders. The color of age spots ranges from pink to tan to brown. They're bigger than freckles and usually oval-shaped. They're often found in clusters. Age spots can be unsightly, but they are harmless. Sun spots, known medically as actinic keratoses, come in a variety of colors. The biggest difference between harmless age spots and sun spots (actinic keratoses) is the texture. Age spots are smooth and flat, but potentially dangerous actinic keratoses usually feel rough and scaly. Actinic keratoses can develop into skin cancer, so it's vital that you show any such spots to your doctor. And if you're in doubt about any type of skin changes, it's also wise to point those out.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/surprising-symptoms-of-chronic-heartburn,Surprising symptoms of chronic heartburn,1,"With a name like heartburn, it's easy to assume that the condition always shows up as a fiery feeling in your chest or stomach. While that's certainly the classic symptom, chronic heartburn can also make its presence known in other ways, such as a tingling feeling in the nose, chest pressure, a bitter or metallic taste, a hoarse voice, tooth damage, or a dry cough. What's the link between these symptoms and that spicy spaghetti you had for dinner? Stomach acid. It can leak up into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Chronic leakage is a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is responsible for symptoms that you might mistake for other conditions. Heart symptoms Sometimes acid reflux irritates the upper part of the stomach or the esophagus, which can cause chest pain or pressure, mimicking pain from a partial blockage in a heart artery or even a heart attack. What you should do. If you're worried about sudden pain in your chest, don't try to figure out if it's heartburn. ""This is especially true for people with heart disease risk factors,"" says Dr. Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist and editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter. But discerning the difference between heartburn and heart problems is complicated, and it's best to talk to a doctor about it. ""Chest pain can come from many causes, like acid reflux, but also stress, lung irritation, or muscle aches,"" Dr. Cannon says. ""We have to consider your heart disease risk factors. For example, do you have high blood pressure or diabetes? Does the pain come with exercise? Those could all point to heart trouble, and we might order tests. If the pain comes when you lie down after eating a heavy meal, and taking an antacid makes it better, then it's likely heartburn."" Lifestyle strategies to combat heartburn Lifestyle habits are an important part of thwarting heartburn. Try as many of the following as possible: Avoid foods and drinks that seem to trigger heartburn symptoms, such as anything spicy, fatty, fried, greasy, or acidic (like tomato sauces or citrus); foods with onions or garlic; alcohol; soda; and anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or chocolate. Eat smaller meals. Stay upright for at least two hours after meals. Avoid late-night eating or drinking (especially alcohol). Sleep on a wedge pillow. Quit smoking. Lose weight if you need to. Nose or throat symptoms In GERD, stomach acid can get up high in the throat and even the area behind the nose, triggering a number of potential symptoms. ""The upper airway isn't built to have the same protections as the stomach or esophagus, so when reflux comes up, it causes injury, almost like a low-level chemical burn. It can cause a dry cough, a sore throat, a hoarse voice, a feeling like there's a lump or mucus plug in the back of the throat, or a tingling feeling in the nose,"" says Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT) at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Because these symptoms overlap with many other conditions, such as a cold or allergies, it can be a long time before you recognize that you have GERD. What you should do: If you suspect GERD might be causing your symptoms, talk to your primary care provider or an ENT. ""We usually recommend that someone go on a four-week trial of heartburn medications, such as over-the-counter omeprazole, and make temporary lifestyle changes to avoid heartburn triggers,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. (See ""Lifestyle strategies to combat heartburn."") ""If symptoms improve after four weeks, it's a good indicator that you probably have reflux disease,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. Mouth or dental symptoms For some people, GERD symptoms might seem more like mouth or dental problems. ""If the acid reaches your mouth, you might develop mouth sores or ulcers, erosion or wear on your teeth, or cavities. The cavities could be due to the acid, sugary heartburn medications, your diet, poor oral hygiene, or a combination of those factors,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Acid reflux can also create a bitter or metallic taste in the mouth. What you should do. If you suspect that acid reflux is reaching your mouth, rinse frequently with water to neutralize it and protect your gums, soft tissues, and teeth. ""Wait 30 minutes after meals or after detecting reflux to brush your teeth. This allows your saliva — and water that you rinse with or drink — to neutralize the mouth's acidity,"" Dr. Jiang says. ""Just before brushing, rinse with water to eliminate the acid first, so you don't accidentally brush the acid against your teeth and cause more extensive wear. And get your teeth cleaned at least twice a year."" Image: © ljubaphoto/Getty Images",9,0.31141636,-0.008916382
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/trending-now-home-sleep-tests,Trending now: Home sleep tests,1,"Want to find out if the snoring, gasping, or choking sounds you're making during sleep are actually signs of obstructive sleep apnea? Until recently, you would have had to go to a sleep lab, get hooked up to dozens of sensors, and spend the night. Now, thanks to the miniaturization of sophisticated technology, you can conduct a basic sleep test in your own bed. ""Home sleep tests are often the preferred approach to detect sleep apnea, not just by doctors, but also by insurance companies. Many are no longer covering in-lab studies, which cost thousands of dollars. A home sleep test costs a few hundred dollars, and it's usually covered,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. However, she cautions that you can't always rely on results from a home test. What's involved? You need a prescription for a home sleep test. You can talk to your primary care physician or a sleep specialist about it. Or you can order a home sleep test online from any number of companies. You visit a company's website, purchase the test, and talk to a company-affiliated doctor via telemedicine. The doctor can prescribe the test if it's right for you. You might also be interested in...

Applying the latest results from nutrition science, Harvard experts take you by the hand and guide you to create an eating plan to improve heart health, longevity, energy, and vitality. LEARN MORE Dr. Javaheri has reservations about arranging a test online. ""You won't know if it's the best-quality sleep test or the best interpretation of the results. A lot of those companies just send a standardized blurb about the results,"" she says. Taking the test Either you will pick up your test from your doctor's office or the test will be delivered to you. It involves wearing a few small sensors overnight, typically a nasal cannula, a loop of thin tubing worn under the nose to measure your breathing patterns a pulse oximeter, a small gadget placed on the finger to measure oxygen levels in your blood a chest strap, an adjustable belt that measures the effort or movement your body is making to breathe. Each of those sensors plugs into a small data monitor, which is worn on the chest strap. A newer type of home sleep test has even less equipment. The data recorder is worn on the wrist, like a watch. It connects to a pulse oximeter and a small chest sensor. The chest sensor measures breathing effort and snoring sounds. Test results While it's not as detailed or as accurate as an in-lab sleep study, a high-quality home sleep test yields fairly reliable results. ""You have an 80% chance that the test will be right,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""But we compare the results with your symptoms to help make sure the results are accurate and to determine the best treatment options."" If the test results don't match your symptoms—for example, if you have sleep apnea symptoms and a negative test result — your doctor will have to investigate further. ""We'll look at the context of the results and the circumstances of the test. It could be that you had nasal congestion on the night of the test, you were breathing through your mouth, and the nasal sensor didn't pick that up,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""If we have strong suspicions that you have sleep apnea, we'll need to schedule an in-lab study."" What is obstructive sleep apnea? Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition marked by 10- to 30-second pauses in breathing during sleep. Those pauses are called apneas and can occur hundreds of times per night. The breathing disruptions occur when the airway in your nose or throat becomes partially or completely blocked by large tonsils, a large tongue, or too much tissue in the airway. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, and car accidents. Image: © Blueastro/Getty Images Should you consider a home test? The tests aren't for everyone. People with a serious chronic condition, such as heart failure or a breathing disorder, may need additional data from an in-lab study to help determine treatment. For people who don't have serious chronic conditions, a home sleep test can be a game changer. ""If you have a straightforward case, it's the best way to go,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""It's cost-effective, and it's more comfortable than an in-lab study. And since you are doing the test at home, it is more likely to capture your natural sleep habits.""

https://www.infowars.com/posts/kennedy-trump-white-house-will-remove-fluoride-from-drinking-water,Kennedy: Trump White House Will Remove Fluoride from Drinking Water,0,"A new Trump administration will make removing fluoride from US public water one of its priorities, according to RFK Jr. On Saturday, Trump’s health czar told Twitter that, on the day of the inauguration, the White House will issue general advice to stop adding fluoride to water. “On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy Tweeted. “Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President ​@realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.” In a second Tweet, Kennedy drew attention to a recent federal court ruling, in which an Obama-appointed judge, after reviewing a huge number of scientific studies and hours of expert testimony, ruled that the EPA had “improperly approved this dangerous neurotoxin.” Judge Edward Chen, in the Northern District of California, ruled that fluoride in drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children. “In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote. “EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.” American towns have already started removing fluoride from their water supplies after Judge Chen’s ruling. Yorktown and Somers, both in New York State, have both announced an end to municipal fluoridation. Somers Supervisor Robert Scorrano said that the town’s decision to stop fluoridating the municipal water supply would “give residents the freedom to choose their own sources of fluoride, ensuring personal control over their health decisions. Additionally, concerns about potential long-term health risks from fluoride exposure support reevaluating its use in public water systems.” In addition to the potential risks to health and IQ, a new report has also shown that the dental benefits of fluoridation are limited. The new report, published by the Cochrane Review, says that any benefits for tooth decay are now minimal, because people have a much higher baseline level of dental health than they did 50 years ago.",4,-0.18865754,0.19036031
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/taming-high-triglycerides,Taming high triglycerides,1,"When you get a cholesterol test (also known as a lipid panel or lipid profile), the most important value is your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol. High LDL levels track closely with the artery-clogging process at the root of most heart disease. But a lipid panel also reveals your blood level of triglycerides, which are the most common form of fat both in food and in your bloodstream. Because levels rise after you eat, triglycerides need to be measured after at least eight hours of fasting to get an accurate reading for treatment decisions. When and why should you pay attention to your triglyceride value? For healthy adults, a normal level is less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), but 25% to 30% of Americans have values that exceed that level. Values of 151 to 200 mg/dL are borderline high; those 201 to 499 are high, and those 500 and higher are very high. When does risk start to rise? Many studies have linked high triglycerides to a heightened risk of heart disease. ""But when you adjust for having related problems, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes, the association isn't quite as strong,"" says Dr. Nicholas Marston, a preventive cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Still, a recent study found that the risk of heart-related problems starts to rise at triglyceride levels greater than 89 mg/dL — far lower than the 150 mg/dL value long considered to be normal. The study, published Feb. 6, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association, included more than 14,000 Italian adults who were followed for an average of just over 11 years.

LEARN MORE ""If people with high triglycerides eat a healthier diet, exercise regularly, and lose weight, they can lower their levels by more than 50%,"" says Dr. Marston. These tips can help: Choose carbs wisely. Cut back on easily digested carbohydrates like white bread, white rice, chips, sugar-laden breakfast cereals, and anything else — including beverages — with a lot of added sugar. Watch fats. Cut back on saturated fats from meat and butter, which can elevate triglycerides. Try to eat more unsaturated fats from plants, oils, and fish, which bring down triglycerides. Avoid excess alcohol. Moderate drinking (one drink per day for women, two for men) may be reasonable. But less is better if your triglycerides are high. Get moving. Regular exercise lowers triglycerides. You might also be interested in... Workout Workbook The numbers are shocking. Just three out of 10 American adults are active enough to stay healthy and fit, and nearly four out of 10 admit they aren’t active at all, despite reams of research proving that exercise is a powerful preventive, and sometimes an antidote, for disability and illness. Which side of this divide are you standing on — and why? Maybe you’re not sure what blend of exercise is best. Or perhaps you know exactly what you need to do, but your workouts have become so humdrum that it’s harder than ever to dig up the energy to do them. Do you want to jump-start your sputtering exercise program? Or are you stuck on a plateau and wishing you could kick it up to the next level? LEARN MORE Aim for a healthy weight. If you qualify as obese or overweight, reaching a healthy body weight can drive your triglycerides down to a normal range. Dropping even just 5% to 10% of your weight can help. Medication for high triglycerides Anyone with a triglyceride level of 150 to 499 should be checked and treated for any underlying health problems that might be to blame, including diabetes, obesity, a low thyroid level (hypothyroidism), and liver or kidney disease. But when triglycerides remain high after addressing these issues and making lifestyle changes, medication may be a good idea, especially for people at risk for cardiovascular disease. Many people in this category are already taking a cholesterol-lowering statin, which lowers triglycerides by about 30%. Drugs known as fibrates, including fenofibrate (Antara, TriCor, others) and gemfibrozil (Lopid) lower triglyceride levels by about 50%, but they do not lower the risk of heart attack or stroke when added to a statin. Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), which contains a highly purified form of a specific fat in fish oil, lowers triglycerides by about 30%. And when people with diabetes or heart disease take icosapent ethyl with a statin, it lowers their risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from cardiac causes by about 25%. On the horizon Very high triglyceride levels (500 mg/dL and above) sometimes have a genetic component. An extreme example is familial hyperchylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), which affects just one to two in a million people. These people — whose blood appears milky from the high fat levels — are prone to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Serious cases can be life-threatening. Two investigational drugs, plozasiran and olezarsen, are RNA-targeted therapies that put the brakes on a protein that controls triglyceride metabolism. Both drugs lower triglyceride levels dramatically and eliminate the risk of pancreatitis, says Dr. Marston. These drugs may also prove helpful for treating people with moderately elevated triglycerides levels, he adds. Image: © jarun011/Getty Images",3,0.29235226,-0.11055498
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-and-brain-health-whats-the-connection,Sleep and brain health: What's the connection?,1,"Asleep shortfall doesn't just make you feel groggy and grumpy the next day. Over time, insufficient sleep can harm your cardiovascular health. The evidence is so compelling that the American Heart Association (AHA) added healthy sleep duration to its ""Life's Essential 8"" recommendations to lower heart attack and stroke risk. Adults should strive for seven to nine hours of sleep each night. But the quality of your sleep is also important, says Dr. Susan Redline, the Peter C. Farrell professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School. Various sleep problems can cause disrupted or fragmented sleep (see ""What's sabotaging your sleep?""). ""Even if you sleep for at least seven hours, sleep disruptions can prevent you from getting enough deep sleep and may also cause unhealthy blood pressure surges,"" says Dr. Redline. Those problems may increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive issues, according to a scientific statement by the AHA published in the March 2024 issue of the journal Stroke. Cerebro­vascular disease includes conditions that affect the brain's blood vessels, including ""silent"" strokes, which go unrecognized. What's sabotaging your sleep? These disorders can affect not only the duration but also the depth and continuity of sleep. Insomnia refers to the inability to fall or stay asleep, which is commonly linked to stress or anxiety. Other possible sleep disrupters include painful medical conditions; caffeine or alcohol use; and environmental factors such as light, noise, an uncomfortable bed, or a room that's too hot or cold. Obstructive sleep apnea is marked by repeated pauses in breathing caused by narrowing of the throat during sleep, which can lead to drops in oxygen levels and to multiple awakenings throughout the night. Periodic limb movement disorder is characterized by involuntary jerking or twitching movements in the legs during sleep. For more information, see Harvard Health Publishing's Special Health Report Improving Sleep. Why deep sleep is vital Over the course of the night, people cycle through different phases of sleep, spending about a quarter of the time in deep (slow-wave) sleep — a phase that's vital to restoring energy and supporting memory, says Dr. Redline, who co-authored the AHA statement. Blood pressure and heart rate are at their lowest point during deep sleep. Meanwhile, the brain's housekeeping system — a series of channels called the glymphatic system, which drains cerebrospinal fluid — flushes away toxins, including beta-amyloid and other proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease. When people don't get sufficient amounts of deep sleep, blood pressure may not decline as it should. This can trigger activity in cells in blood vessel walls and activate damaging inflammation. The glymphatic system, whose function depends on healthy brain blood vessels, may falter. Foiled by fragmented sleep? Brief awakenings during the night, especially those caused by sleep apnea, can cause surges in the hormone epinephrine and raise blood pressure, a problem known as nocturnal hypertension. ""These blood pressure elevations can leave people at risk for cerebrovascular problems,"" says Dr. Redline. Small blood vessels deep in the brain may be damaged by tiny clots or microbleeds, causing so-called silent strokes, which cause no noticeable symptoms. But a series of such strokes over time can lead to a condition known as multi-infarct dementia. What you can do If you don't feel rested and refreshed when you wake up in the morning despite getting at least seven hours of sleep, you might have a sleep disorder. Talk to your doctor for help identifying and addressing the problem, Dr. Redline advises. If your bed partner or family member says you snore loudly, see ""Should you be tested for sleep apnea?"" in the May 2023 Heart Letter. Even if you don't think you have insomnia, you might be experiencing frequent, brief awakenings without noticing them. Wearable devices (monitors worn on the wrist or finger) feature apps that measure sleep efficiency. The data may provide clues about brief awakenings as well as limb movements during sleep, says Dr. Redline. Make an effort to follow all the steps in Life's Essential 8, which are closely interrelated. ""Think of sleep as one of the vital habits that helps reinforce all the other healthy practices,"" says Dr. Redline. Image: © Filmstax/Getty Images",6,0.23632213,-0.34408572
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-and-why-to-fit-more-fiber-and-fermented-food-into-your-meals-202404263036,How — and why — to fit more fiber and fermented food into your meals,1,"An F may mean failure in school, but the letter earns high marks in your diet. The two biggest dietary Fs — fiber and fermented foods — are top priorities to help maintain healthy digestion, and they potentially offer much more. How can you fit these nutrients into meals? Can this help your overall health as well as gut health? Fiber, fermented foods, and the gut microbiome The gut microbiome is a composed of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms living in the colon (large intestine). What you eat, the air you breathe, where you live, and many other factors affect the makeup of the gut microbiome. Some experts think of it as a hidden organ because it has a role in many important functions of the body — for example, helping the immune system function optimally, reducing chronic inflammation, keeping intestinal cells healthy, and providing some essential micronutrients that may not be included in a regular diet. Your gut communicates with your brain through pathways in the gut-brain axis. Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked with mood and mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. However, it's not yet clear that these changes directly cause these types of problems. We do know that a healthy diet low in processed foods is key to a healthy gut microbiome. And increasing evidence suggests that fiber and fermented foods can play important parts here. Fiber 101 Fiber's main job is to make digestion smoother by softening and adding bulk to stool, making it pass quickly through the intestines. But fiber has other benefits for your microbiome and overall health. A high-fiber diet helps keep body weight under control and lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Research has found that eating enough fiber reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. What to know about fiber There are two types of fiber: insoluble (which helps you feel full and encourages regular bowel movements) and soluble (which helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar). However, recent research suggests people should focus on the total amount of fiber in their diet, rather than type of fiber. If you're trying to add more foods with fiber to your diet, make sure you ease into new fiber-rich habits and drink plenty of water. Your digestive system must adapt slowly to avoid gas, bloating, diarrhea, and stomach cramps caused by eating too much too soon. Your body will gradually adjust to increasing fiber after a week or so. How much fiber do you need? The fiber formula is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories consumed. Your specific calorie intake can vary depending on your activity levels. ""But instead of tracking daily fiber, focus on adding more servings of fiber-rich foods to your diet,"" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Which foods are high in fiber? Fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are all high in fiber. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans has a comprehensive list of fiber-rich foods and their calorie counts. What about over-the-counter fiber supplements that come in capsules, powders that you mix with water, and chewable tablets? ""If you have trouble eating enough fiber-rich foods, then these occasionally can be used, and there is no evidence they are harmful,"" says Rimm. ""But they should not serve as your primary source of dietary fiber."" Fermented foods 101 Fermented foods contain both prebiotics — ingredients that create healthy changes in the microbiome — and beneficial live bacteria called probiotics. Both prebiotics and probiotics help maintain a healthy gut microbiome. What to know about fermented foods Besides helping with digestion and absorbing vital nutrients from food, a healthy gut supports your immune system to help fight infections and protect against inflammation. Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, though not all experts agree with this. Many foods that are fermented undergo lacto-fermentation, in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid. Not only does this process remove simple sugars, it creates various species of good bacteria, such as Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium. (Keep in mind that some foods undergo steps that remove probiotics and other healthful microbes, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning.) The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. In addition to probiotics, fermented foods may contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. How often should you eat fermented foods? There is no recommended daily allowance for prebiotics or probiotics, so it is impossible to know precisely which fermented foods or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add more to your daily diet. Which fermented foods should you choose? Fermented foods have a range of tastes and textures because of the particular bacteria they produce during fermentation or that are added to foods. Yogurt is one of the most popular fermented foods (look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label). Still, many options are available if you are not a yogurt fan or want to expand your fermented choices. Kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and pickles are a few examples. As with fiber, probiotics are also marketed as over-the-counter supplements. However, like all dietary supplements, they do not require FDA approval, so there is no guarantee that the types of bacteria listed on a label can provide the promised benefits — or are even in the bottle. ""Therefore, it is best to get your probiotics from fermented foods,"" says Rimm. To learn more about the value of fiber, fermented foods, and a healthy gut microbiome, listen to this episode of the Food, We Need to Talk podcast, ""Understanding the Microbiome.""",3,0.26782513,0.17895007
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-blood-sugar-monitoring-without-diabetes-worthwhile-202106112473,Is blood sugar monitoring without diabetes worthwhile?,1,"Here's an ad you haven't seen, but it could be coming soon: A man jogs along a dirt path meandering through idyllic countryside. He pauses at an overlook and glances down at his cellphone. The phone screen flashes a number, telling him his blood sugar is normal. He smiles and resumes his run. What's different about this ad, you wonder? The jogger doesn't have diabetes. So, how does his phone know his blood sugar? And why, in the middle of a run, does he want to know the result? Read on. If you don't have diabetes, should you monitor your blood sugar? Several companies are working hard to make this sort of ad a reality, as they begin marketing implantable blood sugar measuring devices to people without diabetes. Called continuous glucose monitoring systems, or CGMs, they are often used by people with diabetes. These companies could reap enormous profits by convincing healthy people without diabetes (or other blood sugar problems) to start monitoring blood sugar. CGMs use tiny sensor wires, or filaments, that pierce the skin to frequently and easily assess blood sugar levels. The filaments remain in place, usually on the upper arm or abdomen, protected by an adhesive patch. Results are displayed on a receiver or transmitted to the user's phone. While CGMs have required a prescription in the past, recent FDA clearance of over-the-counter CGMs may tempt healthy people to begin using these systems without a specific medical reason to do so. Where's the health benefit in this? Already, many of us monitor our weight, heart rate, or steps per day — so why not monitor blood sugar? And, is there any evidence of benefit for healthy people without diabetes to continuously monitor their blood sugar levels with CGMs? There's little published research to help answer these questions. The best study I could find found nothing particularly surprising: among 153 people who didn't have diabetes, about 96% of the time blood sugar levels were normal or nearly so. In fact, many of the abnormal levels were considered implausible or a mistake. Another small study looked at sedentary individuals without diabetes who were overweight or obese. Participants completed a counseling session about the effects of physical activity on blood sugar and used a CGM device and an activity tracker for 10 days. Afterward, they reported feeling more motivated to exercise. Yet another analysis of CGM use for rare conditions causing low blood sugar among children found no evidence of health benefit. But I could find no published study suggesting that monitoring translates into improved health for healthy people without diabetes or other blood sugar problems. So, until more studies prove the value of CGM for people without diabetes, we won't know whether the cost and time it takes to implant one of these systems is accomplishing anything or is just the latest health monitoring fad wasting effort and money. Speaking of cost, CGMs aren't cheap: they can cost several thousand dollars a year. And it's unlikely that health insurers will cover CGMs for people without diabetes, at least until there is compelling evidence that they're actually helpful. Blood sugar monitoring for people with diabetes offers undeniable health benefits For people with diabetes, a major goal of therapy is to keep the blood sugar close to the normal range. This helps to prevent symptoms and complications, prolong life, and improve quality of life. The development of CGM devices that can frequently and easily monitor blood sugar levels without finger sticks has revolutionized care for millions of people with diabetes. Besides providing results of blood sugar levels, some devices have alarm settings that alert the user, or other people, if blood sugar becomes dangerously low or high. And some systems can transmit results directly to the user's doctor, if desired. If knowledge is power, why not monitor your blood sugar? So, why would a person who doesn't have diabetes want to monitor their blood sugar? Possible reasons include Detecting prediabetes. In prediabetes blood sugar is slightly high, but not high enough to meet the definition of diabetes. For healthy people, blood sugar testing is typically recommended every three years or so; if prediabetes is diagnosed, repeat testing is recommended more often, at least yearly. CGM might allow earlier diagnosis of prediabetes or diabetes. This could be particularly helpful for people at higher risk for diabetes due to family history or other factors, and people taking medicines that can raise blood sugar. The notion of ""optimizing"" blood sugar for peak mental or physical performance. Not surprisingly, some CGM makers suggest knowing your blood sugar can help you make changes to keep it in an ""ideal range"" that will help you perform your best, prevent diabetes, or improve health in some other way. For example, you might change what or when you eat. None of these marketing notions has been proven, or even well studied. And guess what — even the ideal blood sugar range for a person who isn't diabetic is uncertain. A sense of control. Having more information about your body may provide you with a feeling of control over your health, even if you take no immediate action. Curiosity. Let's face it, it's tempting to gather information about our bodies that might be interesting (even when we're not sure what to do with it). But truly, knowledge that is useless, redundant, or inaccurate doesn't make you powerful! It may even be harmful. For example, if biologically insignificant drops in blood sugar lead you to snack more (""to avoid hypoglycemia""), you could gain weight and actually increase your risk of developing diabetes. If the monitoring system sometimes provides inaccurate information or false alarms, unnecessary anxiety, calls or visits to the doctor, visits to an emergency room, and even inappropriate treatment may follow. The bottom line Unfortunately, some makers of CGM systems aren't waiting for solid research results to market these devices to healthy people. So, consumers and marketing professionals — not researchers or doctors — may wind up driving demand for the product. For any new technology there's a scientific learning curve to figure out when to use it. In my view, we're at the very beginning of the learning curve for home monitoring of blood sugar in people without diabetes. Before buying into what may be the next fad in health monitoring, I think we need to learn a lot more. There is wisdom in the teachings of one of my favorite professors in medical school: ""Just because you can measure something doesn't mean you should.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-stretching,The importance of stretching,1,"You may think of stretching as something performed only by runners or gymnasts. But we all need to stretch in order to protect our mobility and independence. A lot of people don't understand that stretching has to happen on a regular basis. Ideally, it should be daily. Why stretching is important Stretching keeps the muscles flexible and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints. Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are unable to extend all the way. That puts you at risk for joint pain, strains, and muscle damage. For example, sitting in a chair all day results in tight hamstrings in the back of the thigh. That can make it harder to extend your leg or straighten your knee all the way, which inhibits walking. Likewise, when tight muscles are suddenly called on for a strenuous activity that stretches them, such as playing tennis, they may become damaged from suddenly being stretched. Injured muscles may not be strong enough to support the joints, which can lead to joint injury. Regular stretching keeps muscles long, lean, and flexible, and this means that exertion won't put too much force on the muscle itself. Healthy muscles also help a person with balance problems avoid falls. Where to start With a body full of muscles, the idea of daily stretching may seem overwhelming. It's most important to focus on the body areas needed for critical for mobility: your lower extremities: your calves, your hamstrings, your hip flexors in the pelvis and quadriceps in the front of the thigh. Stretching your shoulders, neck, and lower back is also beneficial. Aim for a program of daily stretches, or at least three or four times per week. Find a physical therapist (your local Y is a good place to start) who can assess your muscle strength and tailor a stretching program to fit your needs. Proper execution Stretching the muscles before they're warmed up can actually hurt them. When everything is cold, the fibers aren't prepared and may be damaged. If you exercise first, you'll get blood flow to the area, and that makes the tissue more pliable and amenable to change. All it takes to warm up the muscles before stretching is five to 10 minutes of light activity, such as a quick walk. You can also stretch after an aerobic or weight-training workout. Hold a stretch for 30 seconds. Don't bounce, which can cause injury. You'll feel tension during a stretch, but you should not feel pain. If you do, there may be an injury or damage in the tissue. Stop stretching that muscle and talk to your doctor. Try a hamstring stretch A hamstring stretch will keep the muscles in the back of your thigh flexible. Sit on the floor with your legs in front of you. Slide your hands down your legs until you feel a burning sensation. Hold for 30 seconds, then slowly return to a sitting position. The cumulative effect of stretching Stretching once today won't magically give you perfect flexibility. You'll need to do it over time and remain committed to the process. It may have taken you many months to get tight muscles, so you're not going to be perfectly flexible after only a few sessions. It takes weeks to months to get flexible, and you'll have to continue working on it to maintain it. Image: kali9/Getty Images; bottom image: zdenkam/Getty Images",6,0.26076415,-0.2052525

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-eggs-risky-for-heart-health,Are eggs risky for heart health?,1,"For most people, an egg a day does not increase your risk of a heart attack, a stroke, or any other type of cardiovascular disease. In the past, it seemed logical to think eggs would be bad for your heart health. We knew that the cholesterol in eggs came from the egg yolks, and we knew that high levels of cholesterol, especially LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood increased the risk of cardiovascular disease. So, it seemed logical that avoiding cholesterol in the diet made sense. Since then, however, research has shown that most of the cholesterol in our body is made by our liver — it doesn't come from cholesterol we eat. The liver is stimulated to make cholesterol primarily by saturated fat and trans fat in our diet, not dietary cholesterol. But a large egg contains little saturated fat — about 1.5 grams (g). And research has confirmed that eggs also contain many healthy nutrients: lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for the eyes; choline, which is good for the brain and nerves; and various vitamins (A, B, and D). In fact, just one large egg contains 270 international units (IU) of vitamin A and 41 IU of vitamin D. One large egg also contains about 6 g of protein and 72 calories. The evidence that cholesterol in one egg a day is safe for most people comes from huge studies — many conducted here at Harvard Medical School — that have followed hundreds of thousands of people over decades. They regularly report what they eat and all of the medical conditions that they develop. It is those studies that do not find higher rates of heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular diseases in people who eat up to one egg per day. Of course, it matters greatly what you eat with your eggs. The saturated fat in butter, cheese, bacon, sausage, muffins, or scones, for example, raises your blood cholesterol much more than the cholesterol in your egg. And the highly refined ""bad carbs"" in white toast, pastries, home fries, and hash browns may also increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/proton-pump-inhibitors,Proton-pump inhibitors: What you need to know,1,"Stomach acid is natural, a valuable chemical contributor to orderly digestion. But in excess or in the wrong place, it's a menace, inflaming and irritating the esophagus, typically causing heartburn and sometimes contributing to the development of ulcers in the stomach and the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. People have dealt with stomach acid–related woes in a variety of ways, proven and otherwise, for eons, but it wasn't until the mid-1970s and the introduction of cimetidine (Tagamet) that a treatment targeted the production of stomach acid itself. Cimetidine was a huge commercial success; by some accounts, it was the first blockbuster drug. Other drugs in the same class, known as H2 blockers, quickly followed suit. Now the proton-pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) have eclipsed the H2 blockers as the most commonly prescribed agents to reduce stomach acid. Examples of PPIs include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and esomeprazole (Nexium). They are prescribed to both prevent and treat ulcers in the duodenum (where most ulcers develop) and the stomach. They also counter the various problems that occur when stomach acid escapes into the esophagus, which — if it happens on a regular basis — is a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In most head-to-head trials, the PPIs have proved to be superior to the H2 blockers. Reducing stomach acid levels isn't one of medicine's glamour jobs, but it's yeoman's work, so PPIs are generally considered quite a success story: safe (more on that just below), effective medications that target the source of a lot of gastrointestinal distress. What is a PPI? Many people take PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). By lowering stomach acid levels, they reduce acid reflux into the esophagus and the resulting heartburn symptoms. Appropriate use of proton pump inhibitors Taking a PPI makes sense if you have a chronic problem with stomach acid or the prospect of one developing. But the occasional case of mild heartburn does not need to be treated with a PPI. For that kind of spot duty, the old standbys of antacid medicine like Tums, Rolaids, and Maalox will most likely work just as well, as will any of the H2 blockers. In fact, it takes several days for PPIs to have their full effect on acid secretion, so an H2 blocker may be more effective for a mild, short-term problem with stomach acid. Yet people often take PPIs under the mistaken assumption that they are the better medication in all circumstances. If heartburn is the problem, there are also changes you can make that may help that don't involve taking anything. The commercials are right: gobbling down a large meal can give you heartburn, so eating smaller meals can help tame the problem. And if you're heavy, GERD and heartburn are on that very long list of problems that ease up and may even go away if you lose some weight. PPIs are the most potent inhibitors of stomach acid available, and they're a welcome addition to the medical armamentarium. But every pill — indeed, every medical intervention — is a risk-benefit balancing act. You don't need to take a PPI for the incidental case of heartburn. If you have a prescription, the reasons for it should be reviewed periodically to make sure they're still valid; it's common for people to take medications far longer than is necessary, and that is particularly true of the PPIs. For most people who need to take a PPI, it should be for the lowest dose and shortest amount of time as possible. However, there are conditions that indicate long-term and sometimes indefinite use of a PPI, such as in people with esophagitis due to GERD. There are differences in the chemical properties of the different PPIs and how they are metabolized. But comparative studies haven't yielded any clear-cut winners, so the less expensive PPIs are the best choice for most people. Side effects Initially, there was some worry that PPIs might increase the risk of developing stomach cancer. Those concerns were unfounded, but others have taken their place, partly because people often take PPIs on a daily basis for years, so the total exposure to the drug ends up being quite significant. Here's a rundown of the some of the side effects that are causing concern: Fracture risk. Some studies have shown an association between PPIs and the risk of fracture — particularly hip fracture — while others have not. Calcium is absorbed in the small intestine, not the stomach. But low stomach acid levels can have downstream effects, especially in the duodenum, and some research shows that one of them could be reduced absorption of calcium, which could lead to osteoporosis, weaker bones, and, consequently, a greater chance of breaking a bone. The fracture risk is probably pretty small, but it's another reason for not taking a PPI unless necessary. Pneumonia risk. Several studies have shown that people taking PPIs seem to be more likely to get pneumonia than those who aren't. The association has been documented among people living in the community and hospital patients alike. Normally, stomach acid creates a fairly inhospitable environment for bacteria, but if acid levels are reduced by PPIs, the bacteria count can go up. The thinking is that in people with GERD who take PPIs, bacteria-laden stomach contents may travel up the esophagus and then get inhaled into the windpipe and lungs, where the bacteria cause pneumonia. C. difficile risk. People typically develop Clostridium difficile infections in the hospital after taking antibiotics that have disrupted the natural bacterial ecology of the large intestine. The infections cause diarrhea but can also become a lot more serious, even life-threatening. Studies have shown a fairly strong statistical correlation between PPI use and C. difficile infection, although it's still just a correlation and not proof of direct cause and effect. Some experimental evidence suggests that PPIs may change conditions in the gut to be more favorable to C. difficile bacteria. Iron and B12 deficiency. Stomach acid helps render the iron and vitamin B12 from food into forms that are readily absorbed. So, there is worry that an unintended consequence of long-term use of PPIs might cause deficiencies of this vitamin and mineral because of lower stomach acid levels. Your doctor can periodically blood tests to make sure B12 and iron levels are in the normal range. Image: dragana991/Getty Images",8,0.15996017,0.17739041
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cannabidiol-cbd-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-2018082414476,Cannabidiol (CBD): What we know and what we don't,1,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is often covered in the media, and you may see it touted as an add-in booster to your post-workout smoothie or morning coffee. You can even buy a CBD-infused sports bra. But what exactly is CBD? And why is it so popular? How is cannabidiol different from marijuana, cannabis, and hemp? CBD, or cannabidiol, is the second most prevalent active ingredient in cannabis (marijuana). While CBD is an essential component of medical marijuana, it is derived directly from the hemp plant, a cousin of marijuana, or manufactured in a laboratory. One of hundreds of components in marijuana, CBD does not cause a high by itself. According to a report from the World Health Organization, ""In humans, CBD exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential…. To date, there is no evidence of public health related problems associated with the use of pure CBD."" A recent study in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology concluded that ""acute CBD alone is unlikely to significantly impair daily functioning or workplace performance."" Is cannabidiol legal? CBD is readily obtainable in most parts of the United States, though its exact legal status has been in flux. All 50 states have laws legalizing CBD with varying degrees of restriction. In December 2015, the FDA eased the regulatory requirements to allow researchers to conduct CBD trials. In 2018, the Farm Bill made hemp legal in the United States, making it virtually impossible to keep CBD illegal — that would be like making oranges legal, but keeping orange juice illegal. The Farm Bill removed all hemp-derived products, including CBD, from the Controlled Substances Act, which criminalizes the possession of drugs. In essence, this means that CBD is legal if it comes from hemp, but not if it comes from cannabis (marijuana) — even though it is the exact same molecule. Currently, many people obtain CBD online without a medical marijuana license, which is legal in most states. The evidence for cannabidiol health benefits CBD has been touted for a wide variety of health issues, but the strongest scientific evidence is for its effectiveness in treating some of the cruelest childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which typically don't respond well to antiseizure medications. In numerous studies, CBD was able to reduce the number of seizures, and, in some cases, stop them altogether. Epidiolex, which primarily consists of CBD, is the first cannabis-derived medicine approved by the FDA for these conditions. Animal studies, and self-reports or research in humans, suggest CBD may also help with: Anxiety: Studies and clinical trials are exploring the common report that CBD can reduce anxiety. Insomnia: Studies suggest that CBD may help with both falling asleep and staying asleep, in part by helping address chronic pain and anxiety. Chronic pain: Increasingly, human studies are substantiating the claims that CBD helps control pain. One animal study from the European Journal of Pain suggests CBD could help lower pain and inflammation due to arthritis when applied to skin. Other research identifies how CBD may inhibit inflammatory and neuropathic pain, which are difficult to treat. Addiction: CBD can help lower cravings for tobacco and heroin under certain conditions, according to some research in humans. Animal models of addiction suggest it may also help lessen cravings for other addictive substances such as alcohol, cannabis, opiates, and stimulants. Is CBD safe? Side effects of CBD could include nausea, fatigue, and irritability. CBD can increase the level of blood thinning and other medicines in your blood by competing for the liver enzymes that break down these drugs. Grapefruit has a similar effect with certain medicines. This interaction is particularly important if you are taking a blood thinner, an anti-epileptic, or an immunosuppressant medication, all of which need to have stable levels in your blood. People taking high doses of CBD may show abnormalities in liver-related blood tests. Many nonprescription drugs, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), have this same effect. You should let your doctor know if you are regularly using CBD so that he or she can check your liver enzymes periodically. A significant safety concern with CBD is that it is primarily marketed and sold as a supplement, not a medication. Currently, the FDA does not regulate the safety and purity of dietary supplements, and no one, really, is regulating the CBD market. So you cannot be sure that the product you buy has active ingredients at the dose listed on the label. In addition, the product may contain other unknown elements. If you buy CBD, it is safest to make sure that there is independent laboratory testing as attested to by a COA (certificate of analysis) that should accompany every CBD product. How can CBD be taken? CBD comes in many forms, including oils, tinctures, capsules, patches, vapes, and topical preparations for use on skin. If you're hoping to reduce inflammation and relieve muscle and joint pain, a topical CBD-infused oil, lotion or cream — or even a bath bomb — may be the best option. Alternatively, a CBC patch or a tincture or spray designed to be placed under the tongue allows CBD to directly enter the bloodstream. Dcotors don't recommend smoking anything, including CBD. Outside of the US, the prescription drug Sativex, which uses CBD as an active ingredient, is approved for muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis and for cancer pain. Within the US, Epidiolex is approved for certain types of epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis. The bottom line on cannabidiol Some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild, indefensible claims, such that CBD is a cure-all for cancer or COVID-19, which it is not. We need more research, but CBD is proving to be a helpful, relatively non-toxic option for managing anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. Without sufficient high-quality evidence in human studies, we can't pinpoint effective doses, and because CBD currently is typically available as an unregulated supplement, it can be difficult to know exactly what you are getting, or to conduct studies. If you decide to try CBD, make sure you are getting it from a reputable source. Again, please discuss your use of CBD or any other supplements with your doctor to make sure that it won't affect any other medicines you take.",8,0.17481945,-0.012754343
https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/9-tips-to-boost-your-energy-naturally,9 tips to boost your energy — naturally,1,"Most of us feel we need more energy. In fact, 14% of Americans said they did not have the energy they needed to get things done in one Gallup survey. Fortunately, there are things you can do to enhance your own natural energy levels. Here are nine tips: 1. Control stress Stress-induced emotions consume huge amounts of energy. Talking with a friend or relative, joining a support group, or seeing a psychotherapist can all help diffuse stress. Relaxation therapies like meditation, self-hypnosis, yoga, and tai chi are also effective tools for reducing stress. 2. Lighten your load One of the main reasons for fatigue is overwork. Overwork can include professional, family, and social obligations. Try to streamline your list of ""must-do"" activities. Set your priorities in terms of the most important tasks. Pare down those that are less important. Consider asking for extra help at work, if necessary. 3. Exercise Exercise almost guarantees that you'll sleep more soundly. It also gives your cells more energy to burn and circulates oxygen. And exercising can lead to higher brain dopamine levels, which helps elevate mood. When walking, pick up the pace periodically to get extra health benefits. 4. Avoid smoking Smoking siphons off your energy by causing insomnia. The nicotine in tobacco is a stimulant, so it speeds the heart rate, raises blood pressure, and stimulates brain-wave activity associated with wakefulness, making it harder to fall asleep. And once you do fall asleep, its addictive power can kick in and awaken you with cravings. 5. Restrict your sleep If you think you may be sleep-deprived, try getting less sleep. This advice may sound odd but determining how much sleep you actually need can reduce the time you spend in bed not sleeping. This process makes it easier to fall asleep and promotes more restful sleep in the long run. Here's how to do it: Avoid napping during the day. The first night, go to bed later than normal and get just four hours of sleep. If you feel that you slept well during that four-hour period, add another 15–30 minutes of sleep the next night. As long as you're sleeping soundly the entire time you're in bed, slowly keep adding sleep on successive nights. 6. Eat for energy Eating foods with a low glycemic index — whose sugars are absorbed slowly — may help you avoid the lag in energy that typically occurs after eating quickly absorbed sugars or refined starches. Foods with a low glycemic index include whole grains, high-fiber vegetables, nuts, and healthy oils such as olive oil. In general, high-carbohydrate foods have the highest glycemic indexes. Proteins and fats have glycemic indexes that are close to zero. 7. Use caffeine to your advantage Caffeine does help increase alertness, so having a cup of coffee can help sharpen your mind. But to get the energizing effects of caffeine, you have to use it judiciously. It can cause insomnia, especially when consumed in large amounts or after 2 p.m. 8. Limit alcohol One of the best hedges against the midafternoon slump is to avoid drinking alcohol at lunch. The sedative effect of alcohol is especially strong at midday. Similarly, avoid a five o'clock cocktail if you want to have energy in the evening. If you're going to drink, do so in moderation at a time when you don't mind having your energy wind down. 9. Drink water What's the only nutrient that has been shown to enhance performance for all but the most demanding endurance activities? It's not some pricey sports drink. It's water. If your body is short of fluids, one of the first signs is a feeling of fatigue.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response,Understanding the stress response,1,"A stressful situation — whether something environmental, such as a looming work deadline, or psychological, such as persistent worry about losing a job — can trigger a cascade of stress hormones that produce well-orchestrated physiological changes. A stressful incident can make the heart pound and breathing quicken. Muscles tense and beads of sweat appear. This combination of reactions to stress is also known as the ""fight-or-flight"" response because it evolved as a survival mechanism, enabling people and other mammals to react quickly to life-threatening situations. The carefully orchestrated yet near-instantaneous sequence of hormonal changes and physiological responses helps someone to fight the threat off or flee to safety. Unfortunately, the body can also overreact to stressors that are not life-threatening, such as traffic jams, work pressure, and family difficulties. Over the years, researchers have learned not only how and why these reactions occur, but have also gained insight into the long-term effects chronic stress has on physical and psychological health. Over time, repeated activation of the stress response takes a toll on the body. Research suggests that chronic stress contributes to high blood pressure, promotes the formation of artery-clogging deposits, and causes brain changes that may contribute to anxiety, depression, and addiction. More preliminary research suggests that chronic stress may also contribute to obesity, both through direct mechanisms (causing people to eat more) or indirectly (decreasing sleep and exercise). Sounding the alarm The stress response begins in the brain (see illustration). When someone confronts an oncoming car or other danger, the eyes or ears (or both) send the information to the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing. The amygdala interprets the images and sounds. When it perceives danger, it instantly sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus. Command center When someone experiences a stressful event, the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing, sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus. This area of the brain functions like a command center, communicating with the rest of the body through the nervous system so that the person has the energy to fight or flee. The hypothalamus is a bit like a command center. This area of the brain communicates with the rest of the body through the autonomic nervous system, which controls such involuntary body functions as breathing, blood pressure, heartbeat, and the dilation or constriction of key blood vessels and small airways in the lungs called bronchioles. The autonomic nervous system has two components, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system functions like a gas pedal in a car. It triggers the fight-or-flight response, providing the body with a burst of energy so that it can respond to perceived dangers. The parasympathetic nervous system acts like a brake. It promotes the ""rest and digest"" response that calms the body down after the danger has passed. After the amygdala sends a distress signal, the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic nervous system by sending signals through the autonomic nerves to the adrenal glands. These glands respond by pumping the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) into the bloodstream. As epinephrine circulates through the body, it brings on a number of physiological changes. The heart beats faster than normal, pushing blood to the muscles, heart, and other vital organs. Pulse rate and blood pressure go up. The person undergoing these changes also starts to breathe more rapidly. Small airways in the lungs open wide. This way, the lungs can take in as much oxygen as possible with each breath. Extra oxygen is sent to the brain, increasing alertness. Sight, hearing, and other senses become sharper. Meanwhile, epinephrine triggers the release of blood sugar (glucose) and fats from temporary storage sites in the body. These nutrients flood into the bloodstream, supplying energy to all parts of the body. All of these changes happen so quickly that people aren't aware of them. In fact, the wiring is so efficient that the amygdala and hypothalamus start this cascade even before the brain's visual centers have had a chance to fully process what is happening. That's why people are able to jump out of the path of an oncoming car even before they think about what they are doing. As the initial surge of epinephrine subsides, the hypothalamus activates the second component of the stress response system — known as the HPA axis. This network consists of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal glands. The HPA axis relies on a series of hormonal signals to keep the sympathetic nervous system — the ""gas pedal"" — pressed down. If the brain continues to perceive something as dangerous, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which travels to the pituitary gland, triggering the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This hormone travels to the adrenal glands, prompting them to release cortisol. The body thus stays revved up and on high alert. When the threat passes, cortisol levels fall. The parasympathetic nervous system — the ""brake"" — then dampens the stress response. Techniques to counter chronic stress Many people are unable to find a way to put the brakes on stress. Chronic low-level stress keeps the HPA axis activated, much like a motor that is idling too high for too long. After a while, this has an effect on the body that contributes to the health problems associated with chronic stress. Persistent epinephrine surges can damage blood vessels and arteries, increasing blood pressure and raising risk of heart attacks or strokes. Elevated cortisol levels create physiological changes that help to replenish the body's energy stores that are depleted during the stress response. But they inadvertently contribute to the buildup of fat tissue and to weight gain. For example, cortisol increases appetite, so that people will want to eat more to obtain extra energy. It also increases storage of unused nutrients as fat. Fortunately, people can learn techniques to counter the stress response. Relaxation response. At the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital people learn how to counter the stress response by using a combination of approaches that elicit the relaxation response. These include deep abdominal breathing, focus on a soothing word (such as peace or calm), visualization of tranquil scenes, repetitive prayer, yoga, and tai chi. Most of the early research evaluated how effective the relaxation response is at countering chronic stress in people with hypertension and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Those results suggest the technique may be worth trying — although for most people it is not a cure-all. For example, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 122 patients with hypertension, ages 55 and older, in which half were assigned to relaxation response training and the other half to a control group that received information about blood pressure control. After eight weeks, 34 of the people who practiced the relaxation response — a little more than half — had achieved a systolic blood pressure reduction of more than 5 mm Hg, and were therefore eligible for the next phase of the study, in which they could reduce levels of blood pressure medication they were taking. Physical activity. People can use exercise to stifle the buildup of stress in several ways. Exercise, such as taking a brisk walk shortly after feeling stressed, not only deepens breathing but also helps relieve muscle tension. Movement therapies such as yoga, tai chi, and qi gong combine fluid movements with deep breathing and mental focus, all of which can induce calm. Social support. Confidants, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, relatives, spouses, and companions all provide a life-enhancing social net — and may increase longevity. It's not clear why, but the buffering theory holds that people who enjoy close relationships with family and friends receive emotional support that indirectly helps to sustain them at times of chronic stress and crisis.",6,0.22268595,-0.2567745
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/weighing-the-dangers-of-extra-weight,Weighing the dangers of extra weight,1,"An estimated 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI), a calculation that takes into account both height and weight. Standard definitions consider a healthy BMI as between 18.5 and 24.9, overweight as 25 to 29.9, and obese as 30 and higher. (Calculate your BMI using this online tool.) While far from perfect, BMI offers a simple gauge of whether someone's weight might pose a problem. Studies have found that a BMI higher than 25 increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer. But what if you have put on only a little extra weight in recent years — say, five pounds or so — and your BMI doesn't fall into the category of overweight? Is that still cause for concern? ""Any excess weight can pose a health risk and affect one's daily life,"" says Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""When you carry extra pounds, you also are more susceptible to joint pain, low energy, and problems sleeping."" Yet the greatest threat is the potential for gaining even more weight. ""It's easy for five pounds to quickly turn into 10 pounds and then 15 pounds, and as the weight increases, so do the health risks,"" says Dr. Willett. Why do you gain weight? It's common for men to gain some weight with age. Metabolism naturally slows, and lean muscle mass steadily declines, both of which cause the body to burn calories at a slower rate. In addition, most men consume more daily calories than they need."" When you take in extra calories and don't burn them off, they will be stored as fat,"" says Dr. Willett. But where you accumulate that extra fat is the real issue with weight gain. Based on its location, fat can be described as either subcutaneous or visceral. Subcutaneous fat is located just under the skin. Visceral fat lies deep within the abdominal cavity and pads the spaces between your abdominal organs. Of the two, visceral fat is more dangerous, as high amounts are linked with heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and high cholesterol levels. Do you have too much visceral fat? Check your waist size. ""For men, a waist of 40 inches or more is considered a sign of excess visceral fat,"" says Dr. Willett. ""But even a small change in your clothing, like pants that now feel snug or having to change notches in your belt, are signs of increasing visceral fat."" What is your ideal weight? There's no one-size-fits-all number for a person's ideal weight. The number depends on age, genetics, body frame, medical history, and average weight as a young adult. ""Your BMI can offer a clue about whether you need to lose excess weight, but consulting with your doctor can help determine your ideal healthy weight range,"" says Dr. Willett. Still, you should not ignore even small weight changes. ""A little weight gain may seem normal for many men, but that doesn't mean they should accept it and not do anything about it,"" says Dr. Willett. ""It's easier to make modest adjustments now than to wait until you gain a lot more weight."" You can turn back those extra pounds with a combination of aerobic exercise, strength training, and a healthy diet. Experts recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (for example, brisk walking, running, swimming, or cycling) most days of the week, plus at least two weekly weight or resistance training sessions to maintain muscle mass and strength. To avoid putting on more pounds, stick with a diet that prioritizes plant-based foods, like the Mediterranean or DASH diet. Image: © Tetra Images/Getty Images",3,0.25763872,-0.123194546

Completed in 2016, the LOOK AHEAD trial followed more than 5,000 people for 12 years. It showed that a portion-controlled diet combined with exercise could help people with diabetes lose weight. Over all, however, their risk of heart disease did not decrease. Published in the March 2024 issue of Diabetologia, the new study looked specifically at LOOK AHEAD participants (about 18% of the total) who showed some evidence of diabetes remission, defined as needing no diabetes medications and a close-to-normal blood sugar value at some point in time. Those who achieved remission had a 40% lower rate of cardiovascular disease and a 33% lower rate of chronic kidney disease compared with those who didn't achieved remission. The authors say the benefits likely stemmed from improvement in the participants' weight, fitness, blood sugar, and LDL (bad) cholesterol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/update-on-atrial-fibrillation,Update on atrial fibrillation,1,"Atrial fibrillation causes a rapid, chaotic heartbeat that usually comes and goes without warning. Commonly known as afib, it's caused by electrical misfires in the heart's upper chambers (atria). While some people don't notice any symptoms, others feel a fluttering, pounding sensation in their chest and may become lightheaded, dizzy, and breathless during a bout of afib. But the real danger is a heightened risk of serious strokes (see ""Atrial fibrillation and stroke""). An estimated one in 11 people ages 65 and older have afib, which becomes more common with age. ""There are many things you can do to both lower your risk and prevent the progression of afib,"" says Dr. Moussa Mansour, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Atrial Fibrillation Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. In fact, lifestyle modifications are now a prominent focus of the latest guidelines for managing afib, he says. Here's a summary of the updated recommendations, published Jan. 2, 2024, in the journal Circulation. Atrial fibrillation and stroke During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (atria) quiver rapidly instead of contracting forcefully. Blood pools along the walls of the left atrium, eventually forming clots that may break free to travel through the left ventricle (lower chamber) to the aorta (the large vessel carrying blood out of the heart). If the clot lodges in an artery to the brain, it may block blood flow and cause an ischemic stroke. Illustration: © Rujirat Boonyong/Getty Images Alcohol and caffeine advice ""The most important advice is about alcohol use, which is one of the first things my patients ask about,"" says Dr. Mansour. Strong evidence from multiple studies shows that drinking alcohol raises the risk of afib. There's no magic number of drinks considered safe or risky, although the guidelines suggest no more than one per day. But it's clear that the less alcohol you drink, the better, he says. People also wonder if they should avoid coffee. In some people, caffeine seems to trigger palpitations — the sensation of a skipped, missed, or strong heartbeat. Still, observational studies haven't shown any increased risk of afib among coffee drinkers. In fact, one found that people who drink one to three cups of coffee daily are less likely to have afib than people who drink lower or higher amounts. ""Caffeine doesn't seem to be something people need to worry about,"" says Dr. Mansour. Weight Excess weight, on the other hand, is an issue for many people. Obesity, which is defined as a body mass index or BMI of 30 or higher, promotes afib on several fronts. First, it can worsen high blood pressure, and second, it makes people more prone to obstructive sleep apnea. ""In addition, clinical studies show that obesity increases fat around the heart,"" says Dr. Mansour. This promotes inflammation of the heart muscle, which may lead to changes in the structure of the atria, spurring the onset and progression of afib, he adds. The guidelines recommend that people strive for a BMI of 27 or lower. Research suggests that even modest weight loss (about 10% of your body weight) can help keep your heart rhythm more stable and is linked to better outcomes following treatment for afib. Exercise Exercise not only supports weight loss, it can also lower afib burden, which refers to both the duration and frequency of afib. The afib guidelines suggest 210 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, which may also help reduce afib symptoms. But Dr. Mansour keeps the advice to his patients simple: ""Aim for three to four hours of exercise every week, at a level of effort that's more than a casual walk, but nothing too crazy,"" he says. However, dedicated exercise buffs who work out far more than the average person can still develop afib. ""If you trained for marathons in your 30s and keep up that level of intensity into your 60s, the recommendation is to do less exercise if you develop afib,"" says Dr. Mansour. But if exercise is a big deal for you and important for your mental health, there's no hard-and-fast rule about dialing back, he says. Sleep Dr. Mansour recommends that anyone with afib who snores should be tested for sleep apnea, a condition marked by brief pauses in breathing that often triggers loud snoring, grunts, and gasps. More than one in five people with afib have sleep apnea, and treating the problem may lessen afib recurrence. Image: © patrickheagney/Getty Images",1,0.2149551,-0.3770021
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/night-owls-may-face-higher-diabetes-risks,Night owls may face higher diabetes risks,1,"Women who are night owls have a higher risk of developing diabetes and are more likely to practice unhealthful lifestyle habits compared with early birds, a new analysis suggests. In the Harvard-led study, published online Sept. 12, 2023, by Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers tracked nearly 64,000 female nurses ages 45 to 62 over eight years. The women had no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. Participants reported lifestyle behaviors that included diet quality, physical activity, alcohol use, body mass index, smoking, and sleep habits. They also reported whether they were diagnosed with diabetes. Women who fit an ""evening chronotype"" — preferring to stay up and wake up later — were 19% more likely to develop diabetes than those with a ""morning chronotype,"" who prefer to go to bed and wake up earlier. Additionally, night owls were 54% more likely than early birds to report unhealthy lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and poor sleep habits. Earlier research has also suggested that shorter or irregular sleep is linked with a higher risk of diabetes, the study authors noted. They theorized that ""circadian misalignment""—being a night owl, for example, but also working early morning shifts, which is common in nursing—could disrupt the body's ability to properly process sugar.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/two-workout-strategies-that-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-risk,Two workout strategies that reduce cardiovascular disease risk,1,"Doing regular aerobic exercise — the kind that works your heart and lungs — is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Now, findings published online Jan. 17, 2024, by the European Heart Journal suggest that doing a combination of aerobics and strength training might reduce cardiovascular risk factors just as effectively. The study involved about 400 people (ages 35 to 70) classified as overweight or obese who also had high blood pressure. They were randomly assigned to one of four exercise programs: a 60-minute aerobic workout three times a week, a 60-minute strength training workout three times a week, a 60-minute combination of aerobics and strength training (30 minutes of each) three times a week, or no exercise at all. After one year, people in both the aerobics-only group and the combination exercise group (but not the strength-training-only group) had a significant reduction in a combined measure of cardiovascular risk factors, compared with people who didn't exercise. These risk factors included blood pressure, LDL (bad) cholesterol, blood sugar, and body fat. People doing the combined workouts also improved their muscle strength. What this means: it might be equally healthful to replace half of your aerobic workout with strength training, without adding additional exercise time.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/is-that-dental-pain-an-emergency,Is that dental pain an emergency?,1,"Agonizing tooth pain, sharp jaw discomfort, a dull ache in your gums — each one is a sign of dental trouble or something even more serious. Unfortunately, many people put off a call to the dentist — a potentially risky move, since dental problems can be more advanced than you realize. ""As we age, we can feel less pain in our teeth because the nerves inside them shrink, and dentin — a porous material beneath tooth enamel — builds up. So something can fester for a long time and turn into a bigger, more complex problem,"" says Dr. Lisa Thompson, a geriatric dentistry specialist at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Here's more on what causes dental pain, how to identify it, and when you should call your dentist or even 911. Tooth pain Tooth pain can stem from several problems. Perhaps the most common is a cavity, a tiny hole in the tooth. Plaque — a sticky mix of food particles and bacteria covering the outer layer of a tooth, the enamel — creates chemicals that break down the enamel. The deeper the cavity, the more likely the nerve in the tooth will be exposed, resulting in sharp pain and sensitivity to hot or cold foods. Those symptoms can also come from a cracked tooth or a cracked or loose filling, which can expose the nerve. Tooth pain might also be due to trauma, such as accidentally biting down on a fork. That can bruise the ligament holding your tooth in the jaw, generating an initially sharp and then dull ache in the tooth. If you experience tooth pressure when you bite down on food, have sinus pressure without nasal congestion, or a have a bad (acidic) taste in your mouth, it could be that a cavity or cracked tooth has led to a painful infection at the root of the tooth, creating a small pocket of pus called an abscess. Gum pain Gum pain tends to be an achy soreness rather than a sharp pain. It has many potential causes. It might be as simple as having sensitive gums, brushing your teeth too vigorously, or having irritation from a bit of food (such as a piece of popcorn) stuck in your teeth or in the space between your gum and teeth. Gum pain can also come from a cut if something poked you (such as a corn chip), irritation from toothpaste that contains sodium laurel sulfate, or canker sores (aphthous ulcers). Pain in the gums can also be due to dentures or partials that don't fit well or aren't cleaned regularly. ""You might see red bumps on the irritated area or have a burning sensation from a fungal infection,"" Dr. Thompson says. Another possibility: plaque buildup at the bottom of teeth is irritating the gums and causing gingivitis, an early stage of gum disease marked by swollen, bleeding gums. Untreated gingivitis can progress below the gum line (becoming periodontal disease). It can destroy the ligament holding the tooth in place as well as the bone, leading to gum pain, abscesses, and tooth loss. Signs of an abscess caused by gum disease include a pimple of pus on the gum or facial swelling. Jaw pain Jaw pain can be sudden and sharp, or a chronic tenderness that gradually increases over time. Dull, chronic jaw pain usually comes from a problem with the temporomandibular joint, where the jaw bone meets the skull on either side of your head. Trouble related to this joint is called a temporomandibular disorder, or TMD. ""You can get TMD from injury such as joint dislocation or from problems related to muscles, stress, arthritis, and even behaviors you aren't even aware of. Maybe you grind your teeth at night, chew gum, or bite on a pen,"" Dr. Thompson says. Be especially vigilant about a pain that suddenly affects your neck and lower jaw. That can be a form of the pain called angina caused by narrowed heart arteries — or it could even be a symptom of a heart attack. Heart-related jaw pain can occur without the more common heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath. What you should do Sudden neck and lower jaw pain can signal an emergency. Call 911, especially if you have known heart problems. All other tooth, gum, and jaw pain should trigger a call to your dentist — as soon as possible if you suspect a cracked filling or tooth, gum disease, or an abscess. ""Bacteria from the abscess can get into the bloodstream, and can travel to other spaces in your body, such as your brain or heart. It can be life-threatening. If your dentist can't see you immediately, go to an emergency department, although there's not much they can do but give you antibiotics until you can get to a dentist,"" Dr. Thompson says. ""And if you suspect that your diet, behavior, or brushing habits might be causing pain, go ahead and experiment: get a soft toothbrush, use a Waterpik, switch toothpastes. And keep brushing and flossing your teeth every day."" Image: © vitapix/Getty Images",9,0.2431689,-0.06231876
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/green-poop-what-stool-color-can-indicate-about-health,Green poop: What stool color can indicate about health,1,"Question: My poop sometimes turns green. What can cause green poop? What do changes in stool color mean about your health? Answer: Temporary changes in stool color from the usual brown most often do not indicate a serious medical problem. But certain color changes may require medical attention, especially if you have other symptoms. Green poop Intermittent green stool in someone who otherwise feels fine is usually related to eating dark green vegetables, such as spinach and kale. Another reason for green poop is the rapid passage of green bile from the small intestine when a person has diarrhea. Medications, including bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), iron supplements, and some antibiotics, may also result in greenish colored stool. Very pale brown stool Pale stools can be a sign of liver or gallbladder conditions. If insufficient bile is produced by the liver or there is a blockage of the bile duct, the bile salts that aid digestion can be greatly reduced. Examples of conditions that can lead to pale stools include hepatitis, cirrhosis, and gallstones. People with pale stools due to one of these problems often have jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) and cola-colored urine. Yellow stool Excess fat in poop can give stool a yellow color. An extremely high-fat diet might cause the color change. However, if stool is yellow, greasy, floats in the toilet bowl, and smells bad, that probably means there is a problem with fat absorption. This can occur from liver disease, pancreatitis, a bile or pancreatic duct blockage, or a small intestine condition such as celiac disease. Some infections such as giardiasis can also cause yellowish stool. Red poop Red poop always raises the possibility of blood in the stool. Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl or on toilet paper are most often from hemorrhoids. Larger amounts of bright red blood should always prompt an immediate call for medical advice. If a person also has lightheadedness, then emergency evaluation is needed. Anyone with persistent or recurrent rectal bleeding, even in minimal amounts, should make an appointment with their doctor. Some red foods such as beets and tomatoes and red food dyes can also cause red poop. Black stool Tarry, foul-smelling black stool can indicate bleeding from the stomach or upper small intestine. Stomach acid and digestive enzymes convert blood from a red color to black. This always requires immediate medical attention. Iron supplements, bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), and activated charcoal may blacken stool. Blood sausage, blueberries, and black licorice are also possible causes.",9,0.23547056,0.11728507
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/managing-intrusive-thoughts,Managing intrusive thoughts,1,"It seems to come out of nowhere — a strange, disturbing thought or a troubling image that pops into your mind. It might be violent or sexual, or a recurring fear that you'll do something inappropriate or embarrassing. Whatever the content, it's often unsettling and may bring on feelings of worry or shame. The more you try to push the thought from your mind, the more it persists. Intrusive thoughts, as these are called, are thought to affect some six million Americans, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. Sometimes intrusive thoughts are associated with a mental health disorder, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, where thoughts become so bothersome that they prompt repetitive behaviors or compulsions to try to prevent them from occurring. They are also common in post-traumatic stress disorder, which can be triggered by a life-threatening or extremely stressful event, such as an accident or violent attack. But many people who experience these thoughts don't have a mental health disorder. Intrusive thoughts are often triggered by stress or anxiety. They may also be a short-term problem brought on by biological factors, such as hormone shifts. For example, a woman might experience an uptick in intrusive thoughts after the birth of a child. Any life stressor, if big enough, can increase your risk of having intrusive thoughts. While intrusive thoughts may be disturbing, they aren't harmful or mean that you have a secret desire to do the things that popped into your mind. Identifying intrusive thoughts So, how can you tell if you are experiencing intrusive thoughts? There are some signs to look for. The thought is unusual for you. An intrusive thought is usually very different from your typical thoughts. For example, it might be uncharacteristically violent. The thought is bothersome. If a thought is disturbing and it's something you want to push out of your mind, it might be an intrusive thought. The thought feels hard to control. Intrusive thoughts are often repetitive and won't go away. The more you think about an intrusive thoughts, it might make you more anxious and dwell on them even more. Instead of fighting intrusive thoughts, it's better to learn to live with them. When these thoughts emerge, try taking the following steps: 1. Identify the thought as intrusive. Think to yourself, 'that's just an intrusive thought; it's not how I think, it's not what I believe, and it's not what I want to do. 2. Don't fight with it. When you have an intrusive thought, just accept it. Don't try to make it go away. 3. Don't judge yourself. Know that having a strange or disturbing thought doesn't indicate that something is wrong with you. When to seek help See a mental health professional if unwanted thoughts are starting to disrupt your daily life, particularly if they're impairing your ability to work or to do things you enjoy. However, even if intrusive thoughts aren't affecting your life in a significant way, you can still see someone to get help. Cognitive behavioral therapy is one strategy that is often successful in helping people manage intrusive thoughts. The process may help you to shift some of your general thought patterns, which can enable you to better manage these thoughts when they do occur and might lessen their frequency. Intrusive thoughts can also be managed by addressing the underlying problem, such as anxiety, stress, or a personal history of trauma. While it may be helpful to share the particular thoughts you are having, keep in mind that even if you aren't comfortable talking about them in detail, a therapist can still help. People should also know that intrusive thoughts typically respond well to therapy. Keep in mind that you might not need help forever. It may be a very short-term thing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/spring-cleaning-prioritize-your-fridge-and-pantry,Spring cleaning? Prioritize your fridge and pantry,1,"With spring's arrival, maybe you're planning to attack those dusty baseboards, smeared windows, and cluttered closets. But if you've been neglecting your refrigerator and pantry, these hard-working storage areas should take priority — and they need far more than annual cleaning to help you avoid food-borne illnesses, Harvard experts say. It's not a minor threat. Each year, an estimated one in six Americans — 48 million people — get sick from germs in food, according to the CDC. About 128,000 of them are hospitalized and 3,000 die as a result of food-borne illness. Spring cleaning offers an opportunity not only to thoroughly scour your home, but also to give your fridge and pantry — which can harbor harmful bacteria — more than just a cursory swipe of a sponge. In the process, you can purge dated and possibly contaminated products from overlooked corners. Think of it this way: these chambers don't just house your food; they also protect it—and you, by extension. ""It's tough to compare this to spring cleaning, because certainly I'd recommend cleaning out your refrigerator and pantry way more than once a year,"" says Cynthia Parenteau, associate director of public health in the Department of Environmental Health and Safety at Harvard University, who specializes in food safety. ""Personally, I do it once a week. Every time new groceries go in, I make sure anything that's expired goes out, and I move older food to the front."" Dangerous complications Food-borne illnesses result from microbes or toxins that contaminate foods or drinks. More than 30 pathogens (disease-causing agents), including Salmonella, norovirus, Listeria, Escherichia coli, and bacteria that cause botulism, are known to travel in food. Raw or undercooked poultry or meat, raw eggs, unpasteurized milk or dairy products, raw fruits and vegetables, and foods prepared in large batches kept at unsafe temperatures are vehicles for these pathogens. Some lucky folks manage to skirt the consequences of eating germ-laden foods, while others develop food poisoning and suffer through symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intense stomach cramps, and fever. ""The majority of us eventually get a food-borne illness,"" says Parenteau's colleague Marykate Franks, a senior environmental public health officer. ""Most people associate it with the last thing they ate, though that may not be the case. If we're lucky, we feel crummy for a day or two, rebound, and write it off."" While food poisoning symptoms often resolve without problem, infections spread by food can have lasting, dangerous consequences. They sometimes lead to conditions such as arthritis, meningitis, kidney damage, or brain and nerve damage. (See ""When should you see a doctor for food poisoning?"") Parenteau notes that certain people — including pregnant women, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems — are susceptible to worse cases and more serious outcomes. Cleaning strategies How can you better protect yourself? Parenteau and Franks recommend these tips to tackle your refrigerator and pantry: Take everything out. Approach your food clean-out with the same commitment as you would a closet purge. Completely emptying your fridge and pantry allows you to appraise each item for safety as well as inspect the inside of each space. ""Even with something as simple as cleaning out your pantry, you'll find a wayward cheese puff at the back or a pile of cracker crumbs,"" Franks says. ""You also have to be alert for mice or flour weevils that might be really intrigued by what you have in your cabinets."" Wash everything thoroughly. Pull out all shelving and clean every surface with food-safe sanitizer spray. (For a homemade version, Harvard experts suggest blending one tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach with a gallon of water.) Pay particular attention to any spills or dried, sticky areas. Make sure surfaces are dry before putting anything back. Check expiration dates. Toss all expired food or drink items, as well as those whose containers are rusted or leaking. If you don't know the expiration date, a rule of thumb suggests keeping opened refrigerated items for seven days or less. ""This is a good opportunity to go through your refrigerator and pull out all the Tupperware and leftover restaurant containers and make way for new stuff,"" Parenteau says. Use your senses. Expiration dates differ from sell-by or best-used-by dates, which only suggest freshness. This is often applicable to items such as condiments and salad dressings. If those dates have only recently passed, check the product's appearance and smell for signs of decay. ""If something doesn't quite smell right or the color of the food is off, trust your instincts,"" Franks says. ""Better safe than sorry."" Pay attention to packaging. Generally, unopened or vacuum-packed foods will stay fresher longer. But once they're opened, the clock starts. ""The date to use a product by becomes pretty confusing when you see a freshness date a month or two down the road but you've already opened it,"" Parenteau says. She advises using a marker to note on the package the date you unsealed it. Then keep it for only another seven days — especially packaged deli meats or hot dogs. Avoid cross-contamination. Keep raw meat, seafood, and eggs separate from ready-made foods so germs don't spread. Store these items in sealed containers so juices don't leak onto other foods. And if your refrigerator features dedicated meat and produce drawers, use them only for those items. ""You don't want juices that leak from chicken or beef packages getting on produce or food items that are not going to be cooked,"" Parenteau says. When should you see a doctor for food poisoning? In most cases, food poisoning symptoms are mild enough to ride out without medical attention. But certain symptoms should prompt a doctor's evaluation, according to the CDC. These include bloody diarrhea or diarrhea lasting longer than three days fever over 102° F vomiting so frequently you can't hold liquids down signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth and throat, scant urination, and dizziness upon standing. Don't forget your freezer. Since the whole purpose of freezing food is to keep it from spoiling, the freezer doesn't need as much attention as the refrigerator. But take a look at its contents every few weeks and weed items out. ""Everyone is guilty of sticking something in the back of the freezer, saving it for a rainy day, and forgetting about it,"" Franks says. ""It's good to pull that stuff out to check if it expired and assess if it's worth keeping."" Image: © fcafotodigital/Getty Images",4,-0.050266165,0.11972177
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/regular-exercise-improves-brain-regions-linked-with-memory,Regular exercise improves brain regions linked with memory,1,"Science has shown that one of the benefits of exercise is better brain health, including a lower risk for dementia, but researchers have not known why. A study published online Dec. 7, 2023, by the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease may offer an explanation. The study examined MRI brain scans of 10,125 people with no health issues, average age 52, more than half of whom were men. Approximately 75% reported engaging in moderate or vigorous exercise like walking, running, or participating in sports, an average of four days per week. The scans showed that this group had larger brain volumes in several key areas, such as the hippocampus and the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, compared with people who exercised less than this amount or not at all. These brain regions are responsible for cognitive skills such as memory and learning. Over all, the exercisers also had larger volumes of gray matter, which helps process information, and white matter, which connects brain regions.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/fighting-fatigue,Fighting fatigue,1,"Here are some tips to help you get your energy back. If you have felt like you are dragging lately, you may be wondering what is going on. Fatigue is a common symptom that can be caused by a whole host of factors, from medical conditions and stress to poor sleep. The good news is that in many cases you can make changes that will help bring your energy back, but you need to get to the root of the problem in order to treat it. Fatigue triggers Part of the challenge when it comes to a general symptom like fatigue is that it's so commonplace and can be triggered by so many different things. This makes it hard to pinpoint what's causing the problem. However, there are a few main culprits that often cause fatigue. Stress. Some people have reported feeling increasingly fatigued these days. This might be the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic — or more specifically, of the stress it has caused. Changing responsibilities, added work, struggles with child care, financial pressures, and reduced social opportunities are just some of the stressors people now face. And chronic stress can lead to fatigue. When you are under stress, it can cause levels of a hormone called cortisol to rise, which can trigger problems sleeping as well as feelings of anxiety and other symptoms. Hormonal changes. In women, hormonal changes can contribute to shifts in metabolism and sleep disturbances, which lead to fatigue. A decline in female hormones, such as estrogen, during the menopause transition may induce hot flashes, which can lead to broken sleep. Hot flashes are brief episodes during which your body feels like it's overheating. They can last for a few seconds or minutes. During a hot flash, your skin may flush, and you may start to sweat. If these occur at night, they can make it hard to sleep soundly and leave you dragging the next day. Problems associated with the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of your neck that regulates your metabolism, may also cause fatigue. When the thyroid gland is underactive and produces inadequate levels of thyroid hormone (a condition called hypothyroidism), it can make you feel tired, in addition to other symptoms. Women are more likely than men to have thyroid disease, and incidence rises with age. Your diet. If you are not eating a well-balanced diet, it may result in vitamin deficiencies that can sap your energy. Two of the more common ones are vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiencies. Fatigue is also sometimes brought on by dehydration. Poor sleep habits or sleep disorders. Perhaps the most obvious reason you might be feeling tired is that you are not getting adequate sleep. Sometimes this results from bad sleep habits. Staying up late at night, too much screen time — those habits can definitely affect people's energy level. People who have work schedules that require staying up all night may also have difficulty getting a consistent block of time to achieve restful, deep sleep. But inadequate sleep can also be caused by insomnia or poor sleep quality triggered by stress, or sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, tissues in your throat relax during sleep, periodically blocking your airway, causing breathing interruptions that disrupt sleep. Medical conditions and medications. Fatigue may be the predominant symptom in people with depression. Numerous medical conditions, including infections, anemia, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, neurological conditions, and autoimmune conditions also cause fatigue. Certain medications can also make people feel tired or drowsy. Overcoming fatigue If you are experiencing fatigue that lasts for more than a day or two, try to determine what is causing you to feel so tired and then test different solutions to see if they help. Make lifestyle changes. If you suspect that lifestyle factors, such as poor sleep or eating habits, are causing your fatigue, work on improving your diet and focusing on following good sleep practices at night. (See ""How to get a better night's sleep."") Fatigue may also be brought on by a sedentary lifestyle, so it is important to make sure you are getting enough physical activity. While it can be a challenge to get moving if you are tired all the time, exercise can help you feel better if you give it a chance. As with any type of behavioral change, recognize that it may feel too difficult. Try to break things down into small, achievable goals. For example, you might start by doing two minutes of exercise a day, and then after a few days increase it to five minutes, and then 10 minutes, she says. Getting more physical activity into your day can also help you sleep more soundly at night. Check your medications. Fatigue may be caused by certain medications. If you are taking a new medication and suddenly experience fatigue, reach out to your doctor. Promote calm. If anxiety or stress is triggering your symptoms, paying attention to your mental health should be a priority. Cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation practice, and stress reduction strategies can help. How to get a better night's sleep If you are experiencing sleep disturbances, improving your sleep habits may help. Strategies to try include the following: Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Avoid electronic devices at least two hours before bed, because the light from these devices may disturb your body's natural sleep clock. Sleep in a quiet, dark, cool space. Avoid caffeine late in the day. Get regular exercise. Avoid alcohol before bed. Alcohol may help you fall asleep faster, but it generally results in more fragmented sleep, and sleep quality in people who are alcohol users tends to be worse. However, if these strategies do not help, and the sleep problems you are experiencing are frequent and affect your daily life, it is time to visit your health care professional. Seeing your doctor However, not all causes of fatigue are treatable on your own. You may need to pay a visit to your primary care provider. Warning signs for fatigue include severe or persistent symptoms or when it interferes with your ability to function. If this is the case, it may be time to make an appointment to get checked out. Your clinician will want information about your diet, physical activity, sleep habits, stress level, and mood. He or she will do a physical exam and likely order blood tests to rule out anemia or a thyroid disorder. If your fatigue is being caused by an underlying medical condition, treating it can often help you get your energy back. Image: © ljubaphoto/Getty Images",6,0.20525302,-0.30967325

In grooming him for the recent debate, Biden's advisers reportedly told the New York Times that they forgot to factor in his nap time, which is why he was struggling just to function. Insiders told the Times that Biden often appears ""confused or listless"" and has trouble keeping up with ""the thread of conversations,"" especially over the past several months. Biden also regularly has an expression on his face of ""blank-stared confusion,"" they confirmed. ""In interviews, people in the room with him more recently said that the lapses seemed to be growing more frequent, more pronounced and more worrisome,"" the Times further reported. ""The uncomfortable occurrences were not predictable, but seemed more likely when he was in a large crowd or tired after a particularly bruising schedule.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-alkaline-water-better,Is alkaline water better?,1,"Question: Is alkaline water better for you than plain water? Answer: The simple answer is no. There is not any evidence to support choosing bottled or home-treated alkaline water over safe tap water or regular bottled water. To better understand what is meant by alkaline water, let's start with a review of pH. This is a measure of the acid-base balance of a fluid. The range of pH is zero to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral. A pH above 7 means the fluid is alkaline (basic) and a pH below 7 is acidic. The higher the pH number the more alkaline it is, and the lower the number the greater the acidity. For reference, the normal pH of our blood is slightly alkaline, with a range of 7.35 to 7.45. The fluid in the human stomach is very acidic, with a usual pH of 1.5 to 3.5. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that town water pH should range between 6.5 and 8.5, with most town water averaging around 7.5. Common bottled waters are usually close to neutral at a pH of 7.0. Bottled alkaline water has a higher pH between 8 and 9. Because the fluid in the stomach is so acidic, once regular or alkaline water gets down to your stomach there will be little difference in the resulting stomach fluid pH. You could potentially raise the stomach fluid pH by drinking a lot of alkaline water, but it would only be temporary. Even if you drank enough alkaline water to slightly raise the pH of your blood, your kidneys would quickly go into action to rebalance your blood pH. One potential benefit of alkaline water is to provide symptom relief of heartburn from acid reflux. But again, this would only be temporary. There are much more effective options, such as antacids and drugs that block stomach acid production. There are possible disadvantages from drinking alkaline water with pH levels above 9. The water will likely have a bitter taste. And for people who regularly take stomach acid production blockers called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to maintain a higher stomach pH, drinking strong alkaline water could be dangerous. Adding alkaline water could raise that pH even more and might result in an increased blood pH, which can alter the normal blood levels of chemicals like potassium, especially if they have kidney disease.",0,0.19987509,0.11745763
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-sleeping-with-an-eye-mask-improve-learning-and-alertness-202402213017,Does sleeping with an eye mask improve learning and alertness?,1,"All of us have an internal clock that regulates our circadian rhythms, including when we sleep and when we are awake. And light is the single most important factor that helps establish when we should feel wakeful (generally during the day) and when we should feel sleepy (typically at night). So, let me ask you a personal question: just how dark is your bedroom? To find out why that matters — and whether sleeping in an eye mask is worthwhile — read on. How is light related to sleep? Our circadian system evolved well before the advent of artificial light. As anyone who has been to Times Square can confirm, just a few watts of power can trick the brain into believing that it is daytime at any time of night. So, what's keeping your bedroom alight? A tablet used in bed at night to watch a movie is more than 100 times brighter than being outside when there is a full moon. Working on or watching a computer screen at night is about 10 times brighter than standing in a well-lit parking lot. Light exposure at night affects the natural processes that help prepare the body for sleep. Specifically, your pineal gland produces melatonin in response to darkness. This hormone is integral for the circadian regulation of sleep. What happens when we are exposed to light at night? Being exposed to light at night suppresses melatonin production, changing our sleep patterns. Compared to sleeping without a night light, adults who slept next to a night light had shallower sleep and more frequent arousals. Even outdoor artificial light at night, such as street lamps, has been linked with getting less sleep. But the impact of light at night is not limited to just sleep. It's also associated with increased risk of developing depressive symptoms, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Light exposure misaligned with our circadian rhythms — that is, dark during the day and light at night — is one reason scientists believe that shift work puts people at higher risk for serious health problems. Could sleeping with an eye mask help? Researchers from Cardiff University in the United Kingdom conducted a series of experiments to see if wearing an eye mask while sleeping at night could improve certain measures of learning and alertness. Roughly 90 healthy young adults, 18 to 35 years of age, alternated between sleeping while wearing an eye mask or being exposed to light at night. They recorded their sleep patterns in a sleep diary. In the first part of the study, participants wore an intact eye mask for a week. Then during the next week, they wore an eye mask with a hole exposing each eye so that the mask didn't block the light. After sleeping with no light exposure (wearing the intact eye mask) and with minimal light exposure (the eye mask with the holes), participants completed three cognitive tasks on days six and seven of each week: First was a paired-associate learning task. This helps show how effectively a person can learn new associations. Here the task was learning related word pairs. Participants performed better after wearing an intact eye mask during sleep in the days leading up to the test than after being exposed to light at night. Second, the researchers administered a psychomotor vigilance test, which assesses alertness. Blocking light at night also improved reaction times on this task. Finally, a motor skill learning test was given, which involved tapping a five-digit sequence in the correct order. For this task, there was no difference in performance whether participants had worn an intact eye mask or been exposed to light at night. What else did the researchers learn? No research study is ever perfect, so it is important to take the conclusions above with a grain of salt. According to sleep diary data, there was no difference in the amount of sleep, nor in their perceptions of sleep quality, regardless of whether people wore an eye mask or not. Further, in a second experiment with about 30 participants, the researchers tracked sleep objectively using a monitoring device called the Dreem headband. They found no changes to the structure of sleep — for example, how much time participants spent in REM sleep — when wearing an eye mask. Should I rush out to buy an eye mask before an important meeting or exam? If you decide to try using an eye mask, you probably don't need to pay extra for overnight shipping. Instead, follow a chronobiologist's rule of thumb: ""bright days, dark nights."" During the daytime, get as much natural daylight as you possibly can: go out to pick up your morning bagel from a local bakery, take a short walk during your afternoon lull at work. In the evening, reduce your exposure to electronic devices such as your cell phone, and use the night-dimming modes on these devices. Make sure that you turn off all unnecessary lights. Finally, try to make your bedroom as dark as possible when you go to bed. This could mean turning the alarm clock next to your bed away from you or covering up the light on a humidifier. Of course, you might decide a well-fitted, comfortable eye mask is a useful addition to your light hygiene toolkit. Most cost $10 to $20, so you may find yourself snoozing better and improving cognitive performance for the price of a few cups of coffee.",6,0.24850492,-0.15012497
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/fighting-inflammation-with-food,Fighting inflammation with food,1,"In the fight against chronic inflammation — a state of persistent activation of the immune system — your diet is a powerful weapon. Eating healthy foods helps quiet chronic inflammation, and it benefits your health in other ways (like lowering cholesterol levels). Chronic inflammation often is seen with, and may contribute to, chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline. Where do you find inflammation-fighting foods? They're all part of a Mediterranean-style diet, which consists of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, lean proteins, and small amounts of dairy foods and olive oil. ""Plant-based foods provide us with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals—plant chemicals that appear to fight free radicals [molecules that damage cells] and may protect our cells against inflammation, cancer growth, and viruses,"" says Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Fish, nuts, and plant oils contain healthy unsaturated fats, which are good for your blood vessels, heart, and brain."" Here are some foods that support the quest to keep inflammation in check. Berries Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries may just seem like sweet treats. But berries are also hardworking inflammation fighters. Berries contain phytochemicals called anthocyanins, which give the fruits their red and purple hues. Anthocyanins have an anti-inflammatory effect on cells and are associated with lower risks of heart disease, cognitive decline, and diabetes. Fatty fish Fatty fish — such as salmon, tuna, and sardines — are abundant sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. That benefit might be due to reduced inflammation in the body, especially in the blood vessels (protecting them against the buildup of plaque). Some evidence has found that eating fatty fish is associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker in the blood. Leafy greens Green leafy vegetables — such as arugula, chard, kale, and spinach — are loaded with vitamins A, B, C, E, and K, as well as important minerals (iron, magnesium, and potassium) and phytochemicals. Spinach is associated with a reduction in inflammation levels over time, slowed cognitive decline, and reduced risks for coronary artery disease and stroke. Nuts and seeds Tiny but mighty, nuts and seeds (such as pistachios, almonds, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds) are rich in fiber and other nutrients that help keep your gut bacteria healthy and in turn may help tamp down brain inflammation (see ""Shield your memory from decline""). Certain nuts and seeds — such as walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and hemp seeds — are also good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Tomatoes Tomatoes get their superpowers from a phytochemical called lycopene. It not only gives tomatoes their vibrant red color, but also appears to help reduce levels of interleukin-6, a protein that causes inflammation. Tomatoes are also associated with reduced risks for developing heart disease and prostate cancer. What to eat To get enough foods that fight inflammation, eat at least two servings of fatty fish per week and at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day (two fruits, three vegetables). It's okay to enjoy a handful of nuts or seeds each day. And you'll want to bulk up on fiber sources, such as legumes like beans and lentils (women older than 50 need 21 grams of fiber per day; men need 30 grams per day). ""For the most impact, get the widest variety of plant-based foods possible in each meal. For example, make a big green salad with several kinds of greens and colorful vegetables, seeds, berries, and a simple dressing of a little olive oil and vinegar,"" McManus suggests. ""Or cook whole grains such as quinoa or brown rice, and stir in the greens of your choice, beans, and colorful vegetables like carrots, squash, and tomatoes."" It's easiest to toss extra plant foods into a meal when you have them on hand. ""If produce seems to spoil faster than you can use it, keep it in your freezer, divided into small amounts. That way, you can reach for fruits and vegetables when you need them,"" says McManus. And as much as possible, avoid eating processed foods. They typically contain high amounts of calories, added sugars, unhealthy saturated fats, and salt, and are associated with chronic inflammation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/alert-this-hidden-condition-increases-heart-attack-and-stroke-risks,Alert: This hidden condition increases heart attack and stroke risks,1,"It has an unfamiliar name, produces few symptoms, and involves a cluster of health problems. But metabolic syndrome is a common and dangerous condition that's steadily increasing in adults of all ages in the United States, largely a result of the obesity epidemic. The syndrome significantly increases the risks for heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and more. What is it? Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated conditions. A diagnosis requires at least three of the following cardiovascular risk factors. Obesity. You have this risk factor if your waistline is greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women, no matter your height, or if your body mass index is 30 or more. High blood sugar. After you eat, your body converts carbohydrates into blood glucose, a type of sugar that the body uses for energy. Sugar in the blood then enters your cells, where it's needed to produce energy. In people with diabetes or prone to it, this process is impaired, raising sugar levels in the blood and damaging the cells and blood vessels. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL) or more is considered high. Having diabetes (a fasting blood sugar of 126 mg/dL or higher) also counts as a metabolic syndrome risk factor. High triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood. Having a high level — 150 mg/dL or higher — increases your risk for heart disease and stroke. You can find your triglyceride levels in your cholesterol test results. Low HDL (good) cholesterol. HDL is another type of fat in the blood. It helps remove LDL (bad) cholesterol. If your HDL is below 40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women, it's considered low. High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if your systolic pressure (the top number in a measurement) is 130 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher, or your diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is 80 mm Hg or higher. If you're already taking medication for high blood pressure, you should still count this condition as a metabolic risk factor. What does it mean? When three or more of these risk factors occur together, metabolic syndrome is present, and numerous studies have shown that means you have higher risks for heart disease and stroke. ""Having just one of the risk factors is bad enough. But having more makes the likelihood of bad health outcomes greater. That's why clinicians developed the term metabolic syndrome many years ago: it helped identify people at risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Today we have even better risk calculators, which take other risk factors into account, such as age and activity levels. But you can still pay attention to metabolic syndrome as a way to recognize that trouble is brewing,"" says Dr. David M. Nathan, a Harvard Medical School professor and the director of the Diabetes Center and Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. Metabolic syndrome also increases the risk for developing liver disease, kidney disease, or sleep apnea (a condition marked by pauses in breathing during sleep). What to eat when you have metabolic syndrome Having metabolic syndrome means you're likely overweight or that you have another condition, such as high blood sugar, cholesterol, or blood pressure, that may be stoked by an unhealthy diet. One of the best antidotes is eating a healthy plant-based diet. Swap junk food for lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish and poultry; and limited portions of red or processed meats. And do one thing more: ""Eat less. If you expend more calories than you're taking in, you'll lose weight,"" says Harvard Medical School diabetes expert Dr. David M. Nathan. His go-to tricks: eat smaller portions and focus on foods high in fiber (such as vegetables and legumes), which will keep you fuller longer. Diagnosis and treatment You can measure your waist to see if you have at least one metabolic syndrome risk factor. But you can't see the others. So perhaps discuss it at your next doctor appointment, and double-check your annual blood work results. The good news is that you can reverse metabolic syndrome. Losing weight is central to reducing many of its features. Lowering elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels also plays a major role in reducing your risk for heart disease and stroke. If you can do that and live a healthy lifestyle — exercising daily, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, not smoking, and limiting alcohol intake — you'll not only decrease your risks for heart disease and diabetes, but also increase your odds of living longer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-i-still-need-to-keep-taking-a-statin,Do I still need to keep taking a statin?,1,"Q. I'm 81 years old, and I've been on a statin drug for 30 years because I'm at increased risk for heart disease. At my age, do I need to still keep taking it? A. Statin drugs were introduced into medical practice in the 1980s. They are very effective at lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and in reducing inflammation inside cholesterol-filled plaques of atherosclerosis. In people older than 75, are they still effective in lowering cholesterol and in reducing the risk of heart disease? In the last few years, we have started to get solid information that addresses your question. A recent study from Denmark, published in the August 2023 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, included about 84,000 people — about 10,000 of whom were older than 75. Participants began taking one of two different statin drugs, simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin (Lipitor), between 2008 and 2018. The study found that the people most likely to have their LDL cholesterol lowered by statin drugs were those older than 75. So, statins remain effective at lowering cholesterol in people older than 75. But do they also reduce the risk of developing heart disease? Another observational study from Denmark, published in The Lancet in 2020, identified more than 90,000 people not on statins who were free of heart disease or diabetes (a risk factor for heart disease) — and then started taking a statin drug. Over an average follow-up period of 7.7 years, the people who were most likely to benefit from statin drugs were those older than 75. Randomized trials provide stronger evidence than observational studies. However, relatively few randomized trials of the ability of statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs to reduce heart disease risk have included people older than 75. To overcome that problem, an international team based here at Harvard pooled the results for more than 21,000 people older than 75 (and even more who were younger than 75) from multiple different cholesterol-lowering drug trials. The study, published in 2020 in The Lancet, found that the older group benefited at least as much as the younger group. In short, for people older than 75 who have heart disease already, or who, like you, are at increased risk of developing heart disease, I think there now is solid evidence that statins remain effective at lowering cholesterol and, more important, in reducing the risk of new or recurrent heart disease. For people older than 75 who have not been diagnosed with heart disease and are not at increased risk for developing it, I think the value of statins still is uncertain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-portfolio-diet-a-smart-investment-for-your-heart,The portfolio diet: A smart investment for your heart,1,"The portfolio diet, which emphasizes plant foods rich in fiber and healthy fats, was conceived some 20 years ago. Since then, many studies have documented the diet's ability to lower harmful LDL cholesterol. But because none of those trials lasted any longer than six months, the portfolio diet's long-term returns were unknown. Now, new research suggests that the more closely you follow a portfolio-style eating pattern, the greater your protection against heart disease and stroke. Published Nov. 28, 2023, in Circulation, the study included more than 210,000 people who enrolled in three Harvard-led health studies in the 1980s and 1990s. Using data from diet questionnaires the participants filled out every four years, researchers scored each person's diet based on how well it complied with the portfolio eating pattern. After 30 years of follow-up, researchers compared the scores with the participants' health outcomes. People with higher scores (that is, those who followed the diet most closely) had a 14% lower risk of heart disease compared to those with lower scores. ""A lot of different foods can lower LDL cholesterol, but only by a little bit — about 5% to 10%. The idea behind the portfolio diet was to combine many of these foods together to get a larger reduction,"" says registered dietitian Andrea Glenn, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the study. Earlier studies found that the portfolio diet may lower LDL cholesterol by as much as 30%. In the new study, people with higher portfolio diet scores not only had better cholesterol profiles, they also had lower blood levels of C-reactive protein and other inflammatory substances compared to people with lower scores, says Glenn. Inflammation is a key player in the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries — the root cause of most heart attacks. What's in the portfolio diet? The diet discourages foods from animal sources, particularly red and processed meat, high-fat dairy, and eggs, which means it's naturally low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, both of which raise LDL cholesterol in the body. The featured foods fall into five main categories. Here's a rundown, including ways to incorporate them into your meals. Plant protein. This includes beans, lentils, and peas (collectively known as legumes), with a specific focus on foods made from soybeans, says Glenn. In 1999, the FDA authorized a health claim for soy protein, noting that consuming at least 25 grams daily as part of a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fat may lower the risk of heart disease. Soy protein comes in many different forms: edamame (whole, green soybeans often sold frozen in pods), soy milk, soy yogurt, tofu, or tempeh (fermented soybeans). But there are many other legumes to choose from, including black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), lentils, and split dried green peas. Try this plant protein Swap out some of the meat in homemade soups, stews, or casseroles with beans or tofu. Replace some dairy products (like milk and yogurt) with soy-based versions. Snack on edamame or hummus. Nuts and seeds. All nuts — including almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, walnuts — are included. So are all sorts of seeds: chia, flax, hemp, pumpkin, sunflower, sesame. Try these nuts and seeds Add nuts or seeds to hot cereal, muffins or other baked goods, yogurt, and salads. Spread peanut butter or other nut butters on whole-grain crackers or sliced apples. Snack on mixed nuts. Viscous fiber. Viscous fiber is a type of soluble fiber that has a somewhat sticky quality, says Glenn. ""It's found in grains like oats and barley, certain vegetables such as eggplant and okra, and fruits like apples, oranges, berries, and persimmons,"" she says. One of the best sources is psyllium seed husks, which transform into a viscous gel when dissolved in water. People may be familiar with psyllium because the powdered husks are the key ingredient in Metamucil, which helps treat constipation, says Glenn. But you can buy plain psyllium seed husk in stores. In the intestines, viscous fiber binds to bile acids, which carry fats from your small intestine into the large intestine for excretion. This triggers your liver to create more bile acids—a process that requires cholesterol. If the liver doesn't have enough cholesterol, it draws more from the bloodstream, in turn lowering your circulating LDL. In addition, viscous fiber is fermented in the gut into short-chain fatty acids, which may also inhibit cholesterol production. Try this viscous fiber Build what Glenn calls a ""super portfolio breakfast"": oatmeal topped with soy milk, fruit, nuts, and seeds. Try combos such as raspberries, chopped walnuts, and chia seeds or diced apples, almonds, and sesame seeds. Swap regular bread for oat bran bread. Try different ways to prepare eggplant, such as a Chinese-style stir-fry or ratatouille, a French vegetable stew. Plant sterols. Also known as phytosterols, these exist naturally in nuts, soybeans, peas, and canola oil. Plant sterols have a structure similar to cholesterol; eating them helps limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Margarine enriched with plant sterols, such as Benecol, provides a concentrated dose. But you have to eat quite a bit (about four tablespoons daily) to make a difference, says Glenn. It tastes similar to other types of margarine and can be used as a spread for toast and in sandwiches. Monounsaturated fats. Used in place of saturated fats, these fats help lower cholesterol. Extra-virgin olive oil is the top recommendation; other good options include canola, soybean, or ""high-oleic"" sunflower or safflower oils. Stock a variety of these oils for use on salads and in cooking and baking. Avocados are also rich in monounsaturated fat. You don't need to embrace every aspect of the diet to reap benefits, says Glenn. ""But we saw a dose-related response in the study, which means that the more of these foods were added to the diet, the lower the risk of cardiovascular disease we observed,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/antidepressant-may-help-manage-irritable-bowel-syndrome-symptoms,Antidepressant may help manage irritable bowel syndrome symptoms,1,"Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant also used to treat nerve pain, may be one of the best pharmacologic choices to help improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS causes abdominal pain and changes to bowel movements, with symptoms fluctuating in severity over time. IBS has no cure, and standard treatments like dietary and lifestyle changes and taking antispasmodic or antidiarrheal medications yield varying benefits. In a study published Nov. 11, 2023, in The Lancet, 463 people with IBS took either amitriptyline (10 to 30 milligrams based on the severity of each person's symptoms) or a placebo every day for six months. Afterward, people who took amitriptyline were almost twice as likely as those taking a placebo to report an overall improvement in their symptoms and had significantly lower IBS severity. It's believed amitriptyline helps by increasing people's threshold for IBS pain and discomfort. The researchers suggested that doctors should consider low-dose amitriptyline for managing IBS when dietary and other lifestyle changes are not sufficient.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/ovary-removal-before-menopause-may-pose-health-risks,Ovary removal before menopause may pose health risks,1,"Women who have both ovaries removed before menopause face far higher odds of several chronic health conditions decades later, according to a study published online Sept. 12, 2023, by Menopause. The study involved 274 women (average age 67) whose ovaries had been removed before menopause for a noncancerous condition — either with or without a hysterectomy. An average of 22 years after their surgery, the women underwent comprehensive physical exams to assess the presence of any chronic conditions and measure their strength and mobility. Compared with women of the same age who still had their ovaries, women who were under age 46 when their ovaries were removed were 64% more likely to have arthritis, twice as likely to have obstructive sleep apnea, and nearly three times as likely to have had a bone fracture. They also performed worse on a six-minute walk test. Women who'd undergone ovary removal between ages 46 and 49 also had higher odds of arthritis and sleep apnea than same-age women who didn't have the surgery. However, researchers didn't find a link between ovary removal before menopause and an array of other conditions, including cancer, diabetes, dementia, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, irregular heart rhythm, osteoporosis, or kidney, liver, or thyroid disease. Women who have their ovaries removed before menopause should consider going on estrogen therapy until about age 50, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/bad-bedfellows,Bad bedfellows,1,"You woke up with a pep in your step, feeling energetic and well rested. But wait: your sleep tracker says otherwise. Does the data change your plans for the day and how you'll approach bedtime that night? Are you now anxious when you'd been feeling calm? The rise of sleep tracking devices — which monitor physiological factors related to sleep — has made this conundrum increasingly relevant. A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine shows that more than one-third of Americans have used electronic sleep tracking devices. Seven hours of sleep each night are generally adequate for an average adult, Harvard experts say. But many folks are fixated on getting a ""perfect"" eight hours after learning that sleep deprivation can raise the risks of an array of potentially serious health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The quest for better sleep may backfire, however, leading to anxiety and stress that can thwart restful slumber. ""We do need to lower the emotional temperature a bit and be rational about this,"" says Dr. John Winkelman, chief of the Sleep Disorders Clinical Research Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Many people still don't respect the importance of sleep, but using sleep trackers feeds into some people's anxieties,"" he says. ""Anxiety and psychological arousal are the opposite of what we need when we sleep."" Influential data Many types of devices are marketed to track sleep, ranging from watches and rings to smartphone apps and mattress monitors. Some measure whether you're asleep or not by recording aspects such as movement, heart rate, body temperature, and breathing patterns—all of which change at different sleep stages. The data these devices generate can also hold a lot of sway over how people feel each day. A small 2018 study in the Journal of Sleep Research demonstrated this phenomenon. It involved 63 adults with insomnia who were given wrist-worn sleep trackers. In the morning, half of them received information telling them they'd slept poorly, while the others were told they'd slept well — regardless of their actual sleep quality. All reported on their mood and alertness several times over the course of the day. The 32 participants who were told their sleep was poor reported lower alertness during the day and greater sleepiness in the evening compared to those given positive feedback. And people told they had restful sleep reported a significantly higher level of positive mood and alertness. ""In fact, there was no meaningful difference in sleep quality between the two groups,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""I'm a little bit addicted to my Fitbit, but I don't use it to inform how I feel during the day. I just like knowing the data and thinking about the relationship of the data to how I think I slept. But understand: those two things are far from synonymous."" Pluses and pitfalls Using sleep trackers can present distinct pros and cons, Harvard experts say. Among the pros: They can make you more aware of your sleep patterns. They can offer affirmation if you're trying to form better sleep habits. ""Trackers allow people to see if their bedtimes and wake times aren't stable, which they should be,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""Our sleep is really best when we're on a regular schedule."" They can identify a potential sleep disorder by spotlighting signs such as awakening many times during the night. ""Some trackers offer information about your oxygen variability,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""They can be very helpful in identifying sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea."" But the devices can also lead to an unhealthy preoccupation with sleep, which can fuel insomnia, Dr. Winkelman says. Here are some other downsides: Interpreting and using the data can be confusing. For example, your tracker may tell you that you're apparently not sleeping very deeply, but you might not know how to change that. Focusing on sleep data may lead some people to ignore how they actually feel after sleeping. ""Can you wake up without an alarm clock? Make it through the day without feeling exhausted or drinking five cups of coffee?"" asks Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""To me, those are probably much more useful metrics."" A lack of accuracy Sleep trackers are only as useful as the data they produce — which aren't always accurate. A small 2019 study in the journal Sensors compared several types of sleep trackers to the gold standard of sleep measurement, a sleep study called polysomnography. After comparing 27 nights of sleep study recordings in 19 participants ages 19 to 64 (66% women) with sleep tracker data from the same nights, researchers found the trackers lacking. Specifically, the devices had difficulty detecting participants' wake periods, which hindered their ability to estimate total sleep time and sleep quality. However, the sleep trackers accurately detected the most basic sleep parameter — the actual amount of time participants spent in bed. ""They're not accurately reflecting how much sleep people are getting, or the depth of sleep or type,"" Dr. Klerman says. ""I think they're more accurate now than they used to be. On the other hand, they haven't been tested on every type of person who wears them."" What color is your sleep noise? It may seem paradoxical that a noisy environment could promote sleep. But some people prefer not to slumber in total silence — instead, they add background sound to the bedroom to sleep more soundly. Recent years have seen a proliferation of sleep machines and apps that emit various audio frequencies that sound similar to static from an untuned radio or TV. Some people profess that listening to these monotonous sounds before or during sleep can help them drop off more easily and stay asleep longer, calming them and drowning out background noise like traffic or creaky pipes. These sounds have colors assigned to them based on each noise's strength and frequency: White noise is perhaps the best‑known of all noise colors and contains all audio frequencies. It can be intense and high-pitched, resembling a fan, air conditioner, or vacuum. Pink noise is lower-pitched than white noise. It sounds like steady rain, wind blowing through trees, or waves on a beach. Brown noise sounds more bass, like a rushing river, pounding surf, or strong winds. Sleep-boosting measures If you've found that anxiety surrounding sleep is keeping you from restful slumber, Harvard experts suggest seeking a special type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called CBTi, that's designed to improve insomnia. ""The cognitive part works on anxious thoughts, while the behavioral part actually decreases the amount of time you spend in bed so you're really sleepy when you get there,"" Dr. Winkelman says. Here are some other tactics to improve your sleep: Set consistent bed and wake times. You can use a tracker to help you do this or merely rely on the clock. But either way, the practice should prod you to wind down calmly before bed. Don't check sleep data first thing in the morning. Start your day, decide how you feel, and then look at your sleep tracker. Monitor substance use surrounding sleep. Pay attention to when you last used caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, which can all affect sleep quality. Consider your medication use. Ask your doctor if any prescriptions or supplements you take might make it harder to fall or stay asleep. Tweak the use of those medications if possible. Stay alert for breathing issues. If your bed partner says you snore or gasp frequently while sleeping, tell your doctor. Ditto if you can't sleep lying down and need to sit up, which usually indicates breathing problems. ""A tracker may not catch that,"" Dr. Klerman says. ""That's really good evidence you should see a health professional."" Image: © Kudryavtsev Pavel/Getty Images",6,0.14219855,-0.2727693
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/poor-sleep-linked-to-next-day-episodes-of-atrial-fibrillation,Poor sleep linked to next-day episodes of atrial fibrillation,1,"When people with atrial fibrillation (afib) sleep poorly, they may be more likely to have an episode of afib the next day, a new study finds. The study included 419 people with paroxysmal afib, which is characterized by intermittent episodes of a rapid, irregular heart rate. For 10 weeks, they used a smartphone app to rate their nightly sleep as amazing, good, average, bad, or horrible, and then used mobile electrocardiograms to measure afib episodes the following day. Researchers found that worse sleep quality on any given night was linked to a 15% greater risk of an afib episode the next day. Continued poor sleep was associated with longer episodes of afib, with each progressively worse category of sleep linked with an average of 16 additional minutes of afib per day. Strategies to improve sleep might help prevent and treat afib, say the authors, whose findings were published online Oct. 12, 2023, by JACC Clinical Electrophysiology.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-for-taming-caregiver-stress,Tips for taming caregiver stress,1,"Caring for others fulfills a basic social contract in ways that can draw generations and individuals closer. Certainly, caring for an elderly parent or ailing spouse or partner is a worthy, often satisfying pursuit. But it isn't easy. If you're among the many millions of Americans acting as caregivers for friends, family, or neighbors, you may often wrestle with stress as well as exhaustion, anger, guilt, grief, and other emotions. Two-thirds of these caregivers are women. The task is especially hard on women in the so-called sandwich generation, who are simultaneously caring for children and older parents, quite possibly while working outside the home, too. While you attend to the needs of others, your own sense of well-being may head south. Studies of men and women responsible for the long-term care of relatives show higher rates of illness, suppressed immune response, slower healing, and even earlier death among caregivers. Additionally, research reveals that ongoing stress endured by older adults caring for spouses with Alzheimer's disease has a negative impact on the caregiver's own mental functioning. In order to give care to others, you need stress relief, support, and time for yourself and your family. Theses ""Tips for taming caregiver stress"" may help. • Relaxation response techniques and nurturing techniques are vital. Practicing them often will enable you to feel calmer, happier, and better able to help others. If it's too hard to find the time, consider getting extra help with some household tasks. The Eldercare Locator at www.eldercare.gov can help you find varied services for older adults and their families; it's run by the Administration on Aging. The Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving, at www.rosalynncarter.org, also provides recommendations for evidence-based caregiver support programs. • Protect your own health. Research suggests that a caregiver's immune function is often suppressed by the stress of caring for others. Boost your resistance by eating well, getting enough rest and exercise, and pursuing activities that bring you pleasure. Take advantage of regular respite care from professionals, family, and friends to give you much needed breaks. • Join a support group to talk out frustrations with other people in your situation and to get helpful ideas. Some caregiver support groups are available online (such as a nationwide chat group run by AARP; for a quick link to it, go to /cgteam). Others are run by local hospitals, senior centers, and community groups. • A blend of assertiveness and cognitive restructuring skills can help you share the work, instead of taking on everything yourself. Spell out to other family members what needs to be done and what sort of help would be best. If no one offers help, ask for it. Linking those who can lend a hand has gotten much easier with new websites and apps that help friends, family, and communities coordinate care. Another example of a helpful site is CaringBridge (www.caringbridge.org). • When someone offers help, accept. Keep handy a list of small tasks people can do, such as calling regularly, cooking an occasional dinner, shopping, and running errands. You can dole out tasks or ask people to check off what they can do. • Accept that circumstances change quickly. Periodically reassess what you can offer and what assistance you need. If it's getting too hard to fulfill certain needs, ask family members for help or consider other options, such as hiring paid caregivers to take on these tasks. Consult a geriatric care manager (www.aginglifecare.org) or social worker for help; your local council on aging or visiting nurse association should be able to help you find one. If necessary, consider another living arrangement that would help you meet your needs and those of your loved one. • Accentuate your spiritual connectedness to something greater than yourself, be it to God, community, or the natural world. • Remember that you're doing this not solely out of obligation. Focusing on the love you hold for your loved one can help dial back stress when things become frustrating and overwhelming.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/when-to-worry-about-worrying,When to worry about worrying,1,"We all worry. Today, there seems to be no shortage of things to worry about. It's normal to feel anxious on occasion. In fact, temporary anxiety can be a healthy response to uncertainty and danger. But constant worry may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Do I have generalized anxiety disorder? According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 5.7% of adults in the U.S. experience GAD . While other types of anxiety disorders arise from particular situations, generalized anxiety disorder is persistent and characterized by debilitating worry and agitation about everyday matters. People with generalized anxiety disorder can't shake the feeling that something bad will happen and they will not be prepared. They may worry to excess about missing an appointment, losing a job, or having an accident. Some people even worry about worrying too much. Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder Persistent, excessive worry about several different things for at least six months Fatigue, difficulty sleeping, or restlessness Trouble concentrating Irritability Muscle tension Feeling tense or ""on edge"" Only your doctor can determine whether you meet the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. If you think you might have this condition, don't hesitate to talk to your primary care doctor. There are many different treatments that can ease the very real discomfort of this condition. Physical symptoms are common too and can include a racing heart, dry mouth, upset stomach, muscle tension, sweating, trembling, and irritability. These bodily expressions of anxiety can have a negative effect on physical health. For example, people with generalized anxiety disorder are at greater risk for heart attack and other cardiovascular problems. Treating anxiety If you have generalized anxiety disorder, your doctor may discuss the following treatment options. Therapy. For some people, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help. CBT helps people recognize when they are misinterpreting events, exaggerating difficulties, or making unnecessarily pessimistic assumptions, and offers new ways to respond to anxiety-provoking situations. Medications. Commonly prescribed drugs include antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (like Prozac or Zoloft), or dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (like Effexor or Cymbalta). These drugs take longer to work than the traditional anti-anxiety drugs, but also may provide greater symptom relief over time.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/does-your-gut-affect-your-risk-for-alzheimers-disease,Does your gut affect your risk for Alzheimer's disease?,1,"Q. I know that your genes and lifestyle can influence your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. Now I read that microbes in our guts also may be involved. Really? A. Genes and lifestyle both influence our risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. And, as strange as it may seem, so may the microbes in our gut. We've known for nearly 200 years that microbes live on and in us. We thought they were just living off the warmth and nutrients that our bodies provided to them — invisible freeloaders that had no effect on our health. Beginning about 20 years ago, we began to learn that was wrong. Like humans, microbes have genes. All of the different genes of the microbes that live on us or in us, collectively, are called our ""microbiome."" To our surprise, we've learned that these microbe genes can make chemicals that can affect human health. We now know that our microbiome can affect our risk for obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other important diseases. A study reported in October 2023 in the prestigious scientific journal Brain finds that our microbiome may even influence our risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies had reported that in people with Alzheimer's disease, some particular species of gut bacteria are more prevalent, while other species are less so, compared to people without the disease. But that did not answer the cart-and-horse question: does the disease affect the difference in the gut bacteria, or does the difference in the gut bacteria affect the disease? The new study provides provocative evidence that the gut bacteria may actually influence the risk of getting the disease. The research team took a group of healthy young rats and eliminated all bacteria from their guts. Then the team collected bowel movement samples from people with Alzheimer's disease and from people with normal cognition and no signs of the disease. Such samples are full of gut bacteria. Then the samples from humans were squirted into the rats' guts. The microbiome from people with Alzheimer's disease — but not the microbiome from people without the disease — caused some Alzheimer's-like changes in the rats' brains. Those rats also developed memory impairments. Moreover, the rats that received the microbiomes from the most severely affected Alzheimer's patients developed the greatest brain abnormalities and memory problems. It will require much more research to confirm that our gut microbiome influences our risk of Alzheimer's disease—and, if so, how it does so. The answer to that last question could someday point to treatments that can treat or even prevent Alzheimer's disease. Image: © chombosan/Getty Images",3,0.21695097,0.007610265
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-navigate-a-sleep-divorce,"Tips to navigate a ""sleep divorce""",1,"When your bed partner regularly shatters your good night's rest — by snoring, kicking, tossing and turning, or stealing the covers, for example — you might wonder if you'd be better off sleeping apart. And you're not alone if you give it a try. A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that a third of respondents reported occasionally or regularly sleeping in separate rooms to accommodate a bed partner. Just keep in mind that the arrangement comes with a risk. ""Your relationship might suffer, especially if one person doesn't want to sleep apart or doesn't like the new sleeping environment,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. Here's what you can do if you're considering a ""sleep divorce."" Why consider a sleep divorce? Sleeping apart seems counterintuitive for couples. But a good night's sleep is very important for health. ""Sleep deprivation promotes depression, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, which can keep you from engaging well with your partner. A lack of sleep also increases the risk for chronic health problems such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline,"" notes Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. The goal is to sleep seven to nine hours per night. Work with your partner to make sleep a priority for both of you. And make that sleep top quality. Have a heart-to-heart first Discuss your partner's disruptive sleep behaviors with compassion, and talk about the problems that result for both of you. ""The conversation can be embarrassing. It requires you to be vulnerable, and a lot of sensitive topics might come up beyond sleep behavior,"" Dr. Collier says. ""If it's hard to communicate about it, consider a couples counseling session with an objective third party to guide you."" Seek a compromise Before seeking a complete sleep divorce, consider compromises that are acceptable to both of you. ""For example, if your partner's snoring wakes you up, try wearing earplugs, use a bedside sound machine, or wear earbuds and listen to a podcast as you fall asleep,"" Dr. Collier suggests. If snoring is a problem, your partner could try sleeping on his or her side and seeing a doctor to find out what's causing the snoring. Dr. Collier recommends you go together to the doctor's appointment so you both learn about any possible underlying conditions and treatments, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for sleep apnea. ""Another solution could be sleeping separately in the same room. Perhaps you each get a bed. That's helpful when one person awakens frequently to urinate or has involuntary twitching movements in the legs during sleep. Another idea is napping in the same place during the day but sleeping apart at night."" Sleeping apart successfully If you decide to try sleeping apart, consider following these guidelines. Make both sleeping spaces cozy. ""Neither of you should have to sleep on the couch,"" Dr. Collier says. ""You both need a good mattress and a comfortable sleeping environment that's cool, dark, and inviting. Make sure both parties are happy."" Schedule intimacy. Sharing a bed promotes personal connection, sexual activity, and feelings of comfort and security. To get the same intimacy when you sleep apart, Dr. Collier says, you must make a concerted effort. For example, if nighttime is when you have sex, cuddle, or share meaningful details of your day, schedule that before bedtime, and then move to separate rooms after your time together. Or set aside time for closeness during the day and make it a priority. Create a nighttime routine. It can be tough sleeping alone after years of being together, especially if you have anxiety or stress. ""You'll have to develop your own bedtime routine, one that makes you feel relaxed and sleepy, such as reading for a little while and then turning out the light and listening to a bedside sound machine. If you miss the comfort and security of your partner, sleeping with a body pillow or a weighted blanket might help,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Or, talk to your partner on the phone or in a video call as you're going to sleep. That way you can still be together."" Assess the arrangement regularly. Check in with each other daily to see what's working and what isn't. ""It's not good enough if it's helpful only for one person,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Go back to the drawing board and come up with something better. Your relationship is at stake, and so is your health and well-being. Sleeping apart can be beneficial if both parties are happy with the setup, both parties sleep well, and you continue to nurture your relationship.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/poor-sleep-linked-to-high-blood-pressure,Poor sleep linked to high blood pressure,1,"Sleep problems — including trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and too little sleep — are associated with a greater risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) in women, according to a new study. Published in the Nov. 2023 issue of Hypertension, the study tracked the health of 66,122 women for 16 years. When the study began in 2001, the women ranged in age from 25 to 42 and didn't have hypertension. After researchers accounted for various demographic and lifestyle factors, they found that compared to women who slept seven to eight hours daily, those who slept six or five hours were 7% and 10%, respectively, more likely to develop hypertension. Women who said they sometimes or usually had trouble falling or staying asleep were 14% and 28% more likely to have hypertension, respectively, compared to those who rarely had trouble sleeping. The findings don't prove that sleep problems cause elevated blood pressure. However, as the authors suggest, one possible explanation for the link may be increased stress, which is associated both with poor sleep and high blood pressure.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-worry-about-your-waistline,Should you worry about your waistline?,1,"Extra padding around your midsection goes by many different names — a spare tire, muffin top, or love handles. Too much of any type of fat isn't healthy, but some forms are worse than others. The flab you can pinch between your fingers is known as subcutaneous fat, which lies just beneath the skin. A more worrisome type of fat lies deep within the abdominal cavity, padding the space between your organs (see illustration). Known as visceral fat, it does more than add inches around your waistline; it also raises your risk of cardiovascular problems. ""Growing evidence suggests that your waist circumference is a better predictor of heart disease than your body mass index,"" says Dr. Osama Hamdy, medical director of the Obesity Clinical Program at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center. Body mass index (BMI), an indirect estimate of body fat based on height and weight, doesn't distinguish between the different types of fat. ""People can have what's considered a healthy BMI but still have a large belly and visceral fat,"" says Dr. Hamdy. Another measurement, the waist-to-hip ratio, correlates with visceral fat. But there's no need to do that extra hip measurement or math because waist circumference alone is strongly linked to visceral fat, says Dr. Hamdy. Just make sure you measure correctly (see ""Gut check: How to measure your midsection""). Why is visceral fat dangerous? Visceral fat is also a marker for ectopic fat, which refers to fat that accumulates inside organs (such as the liver, heart, and pancreas) and muscles. Both type of fat are closely tied to metabolic problems, especially type 2 diabetes — which, in turn, is a potent risk factor for heart disease. In addition, visceral fat secretes hormones and other inflammatory factors, collectively called adipokines or cytokines, which trigger a buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries (atherosclerosis). Who's at risk? Your genes, ethnic background, and sex all influence how likely you are to accumulate visceral fat. Native Americans (notably the Pima tribe), Hispanics, and people living in India and South Asia have a higher likelihood of abdominal obesity (as well as diabetes). In addition, white men and black women tend to accumulate relatively more visceral fat compared with black men and white women. Gut check: How to measure your midsection To measure your waist accurately, wrap a measuring tape around your bare abdomen just above the upper border of your hipbone, which you can easily feel on both sides. Usually, the tape measure will cross your bellybutton, but not for everyone. Make sure the tape measure isn't twisted and that it stays taut, but not tight enough to compress the area. Don't suck in your gut or hold your breath. Check the number right after you exhale. For women, a waist circumference of 35 inches or higher signals a high risk. For men, it's 40 inches or higher. Ideally, your waist circumference should be no greater than one-half your height. What helps to banish a big belly? Although some people are predisposed to larger midsections, there's a lot you can do to remedy the problem, says Dr. Hamdy. Get regular exercise. Sit-ups or other abdominal exercises won't shrink your belly. Instead, you need to burn calories to lose fat and build muscle through a combination of aerobic and strength training. Aim for at least 30 minutes daily of moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking), and do strength-based exercise at least two days per week. Follow a healthy, reduced-carbohydrate diet. Avoid foods and drinks with added sugars and other simple carbohydrates that spike blood sugar and encourage your body to store fat. These include foods made with white flour (common culprits include what Dr. Hamdy calls the ""P's and B's"": pasta, pizza, pretzels, bread, and bagels) and starchy foods, such as white potatoes, white rice, and corn. Try time-restricted eating. Some research suggests this strategy may lower blood sugar levels and reduce visceral fat. There are many ways to structure your eating; for example, you might eat only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and fast during the other 16 hours. This not only limits calorie intake but also kick-starts the body's fat-burning process. Illustration by Scott Leighton",3,0.30832484,-0.071877435
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-you-should-walk-with-a-doc,"Why you should ""Walk with a Doc""",1,"You know that walking helps your heart. So does spending time with other people, being outside in nature, and learning about ways to improve your health and well-being from a professional. Want to get all four at once? Show up at a Walk with a Doc event. Launched in 2005, this nonprofit organization sponsors free, doctor-led walks in mostly outdoor venues (usually public parks) across America. Today, Walk with a Doc is in 34 countries worldwide, including 560 communities around the United States. In surveys and focus groups, participants give the program high marks. Nearly all of the responders — 96% — say they strongly agree that Walk with a Doc has helped them lead a healthier lifestyle, according to a 2020 article in Current Cardiology Reports co-authored by Walk with a Doc founder Dr. David Sabgir. The program's initial inspiration was to encourage people to be less sedentary. But the informal teaching that happens before and during the walks is a boon for patients and doctors alike, says cardiologist Dr. Simin Lee, associate physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""In our current health care system, most of the care is compressed into a short office visit,"" she says. Walk with a Doc gives physicians time to discuss important health topics — such as exercise, diet, and stress management — in greater depth. Dr. Lee started the Walk with a Doc chapter in Jamacia Plain, the Boston neighborhood bordering the Longwood Medical Area, which is home to Harvard Medical School and many of its affiliated medical institutions. Walking and talking ""Most of the chapters do monthly walks, but I wanted to encourage continuity and habit formation, so I did my walks every week,"" says Dr. Lee. The walks, which are currently led by her Brigham and Women's colleague Dr. Catherine Hwang, feature a 1.5-mile loop around Jamaica Pond every Wednesday evening at 5:30 pm. In general, weekday walks are usually about 30 minutes long; weekend walks may last 60 to 90 minutes. About five minutes before starting the walk, the doctor speaks on various topics of interest, including those requested by the participants. For her initial talks, Dr. Lee focused on the recommended ""dose"" of exercise. During the walk, she demonstrated what moderate-intensity exercise looks like. ""I'd tell people to notice how I could still talk in full sentences but that my breathing was a little heavier than when we were just standing around,"" she says. During later walks, she taught interval training by cueing the group to pick up their walking pace for a few minutes, and to then pull back and return to their normal walking speed. Interval training is a good way to add variety to your workout and is especially helpful for improving cardiovascular fitness, she notes. ""Sometimes, it can feel futile to just rattle off some basic counseling about exercise during an office visit. It's so much more powerful when you can demonstrate it in person,"" she says. As much as we appreciate all the medications we have at our fingertips to manage cardiovascular disease, people really are interested in doing things for their health that doesn't involve taking pills, Dr. Lee says. She also did a series of talks about how exercise benefits so many chronic health conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, dementia, and cancer. Camaraderie and pleasant scenery As Dr. Sabgir wrote in his article, most Americans are living lives that are sedentary, lonely, and not connected with nature. Many Walk with a Doc programs, including Dr. Lee's, have helped foster social connections and forged friendships among the participants. The walks she led often included 10 or more people, who would sometimes bring friends or family members along. ""Creating a shared sense of community is a really important aspect of the program,"" she says. So is the stress-relieving power of spending time in nature, which has become less and less common. Research suggests that over half of all Americans spend fewer than five hours outdoors each week. ""In our increasingly digital world, where people spend a lot of time inside in front of screens, it's just lovely to be outside to get fresh air and witness a beautiful sunset and the changing seasons,"" says Dr. Lee.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-does-coffee-help-with-digestion,Why does coffee help with digestion?,1,"Q. I love my morning cup of joe, but I've noticed it also sends me straight to the bathroom for a bowel movement. Why can coffee have a laxative effect? A. Since about half of American adults profess to drink coffee every day, this perennially popular drink must boast some pretty compelling benefits. Beyond waking up our brains, coffee also helps jolt some people's digestive tracts. This happens for several reasons. A 2021 study suggests that two hormones coffee boosts — gastrin and cholecystokinin — trigger the so‑called gastrocolic reflex, prompting the colon to contract and move waste through the rectum. Since colon contractions tend to be strongest in the morning anyway, drinking coffee plays into this natural digestive process. This hormonal action is specific to coffee, not tea or other drinks, but coffee's caffeine content heightens this effect by increasing colon contractions and stool movement. For some people, this can happen within minutes; for others, it might take hours — or not happen at all. On the other hand, people who tend to be constipated often find that their morning cup of coffee helps keep them regular. But don't drink excessive amounts of coffee just for this reason. It can make us jittery or worsen the symptoms of certain conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, glaucoma, or overactive bladder.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-am-i-prone-to-skin-tags,Why am I prone to skin tags?,1,"Q. I've had a couple of skin tags over the years, but lately several have popped up. Why? A. These fleshy, soft growths — which are more common among women — are unquestionably annoying. They can sprout almost anywhere on the skin, but skin tags tend to develop on the neck, under the arms, or around the groin. While skin tags can be unattractive, the good news is that they're benign and won't develop into cancer. But they're linked with several health conditions that aren't harmless, which is why you should be concerned if you're developing more of them. These include diabetes or metabolic syndrome (a constellation of high blood pressure, unhealthy blood sugar levels, extra fat around your waist, and unhealthy cholesterol levels). Skin tags are also more common if you're pregnant or obese, or if you have family members who also develop them. Your doctor may want to run blood tests if you're getting a lot of skin tags with no explanation. If you'd like, she can also remove them using various in-office techniques.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/prebiotics-in-plant-based-foods-may-help-control-unhealthy-eating,Prebiotics in plant-based foods may help control unhealthy eating,1,"Science has shown that a healthy gut can make beneficial changes in the brain and vice versa, via a connection known as the gut-brain axis. A healthy gut requires good amounts of probiotics (beneficial bacteria), which grow by feeding off prebiotics, compounds found in plant fiber. A new study suggests prebiotics have a role in the gut-brain axis beyond being a food source and eating them might help people choose healthier foods. Researchers recruited 59 overweight adults who regularly followed a Western diet (higher in red meat, saturated fat, and processed foods) and assigned them randomly to take either 30 grams of inulin (a prebiotic found in onions, leeks, artichokes, and bananas) or a placebo supplement, every day for two weeks. Next, the participants had brain MRIs while they viewed pictures of various low-, medium-, and high-calorie foods and indicated how much they wanted them on a one to 10 scale. The MRIs measured how much of the brain's reward network was activated when the participants made their choices. Over a second two-week period, the process was repeated: everyone took the supplement they had not taken earlier, and then underwent the MRI session. The researchers found that after taking the prebiotic supplement, people were more likely to select medium- or low-calorie foods than high-calorie ones, and their MRIs showed less activation in their brain's reward network when shown high-calorie foods. The results were published online Oct. 4, 2023, by the journal Gut. Image: © OscarWong/Getty Images",3,0.356722,0.260935
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-lower-your-dementia-risk,How to lower your dementia risk,1,"An estimated 3% of adults ages 65 and older currently have dementia, and that proportion rises substantially as people age. By age 85, about one-third will be diagnosed with some form. The diagnosis of dementia is based on a set of symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, changes in personality, a decline in cognitive skills, and inability to perform everyday activities. But can you do anything to lower your risk? ""The most convincing evidence continues to be for the boring stuff — aerobic exercise, a brain-healthy diet, and quality sleep,"" says neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, chief of the division of brain injury rehabilitation with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Even people with a family history of dementia could lower the risk by investing more in these basic healthy lifestyle habits."" Here's how they help with dementia prevention. Aerobic exercise. The buildup of beta-amyloid protein in the brain is a key hallmark of many diseases that cause dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia. Another common form, vascular dementia, stems from damage to brain cells that occurs when narrowed or hardened blood vessels fail to supply enough blood to the brain. Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, supporting blood vessels and decreasing the risk of blood vessel damage. It also helps reduce inflammation, thought to be one of the main causes of abnormal protein buildup. Aerobic exercise is any activity that increases your heart rate. Although most aerobic exercise requires you to move your entire body, the main focus should be on your heart and lungs. ""Activities like walking, running, swimming, cycling, even dancing, if done at sufficient intensity, get you breathing faster and your heart working harder,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Guidelines recommend adults do at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week. It's never too late to begin, either. ""Even older people who have rarely done aerobic exercise before can still reap the benefits once they start,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Brain-healthy diet. There are several extensively studied diets that promote brain health, like the Mediterranean, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), and MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diets. ""These diets are linked to lower levels of brain-damaging chronic inflammation by reducing or eliminating red meat and processed foods and increasing the intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables and fatty fish high in omega-3 fatty acids,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Quality sleep. During sleep, the brain clears out harmful beta-amyloid proteins. But the cleaning process can't do a complete job if sleep is regularly disrupted — by insomnia, sleep apnea, or other issues that cause you to wake during the night. ""Eventually, this can cause or exacerbate abnormal protein buildup,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. If you regularly don't feel rested upon waking or have trouble falling and staying asleep, speak with your doctor. It's important to address any sleep disorder or other health issues that interfere with sleep, like acid reflux. Taking multiple medicines, depression, and changes in the bedroom environment (for instance, in temperature, noise level, smartphone usage, or light exposure) also can disrupt sleep. Engage your brain by socializing Another way to protect your brain from dementia is to socialize more. A study published online Oct. 24, 2023, by JAMA Neurology found that socially isolated older adults have a 27% higher chance of developing dementia than older adults who aren't isolated. ""Regular interactions activate mental processes, including attention and memory, which can bolster cognition,"" says neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Daneshvar with Massachusetts General Hospital. Here are some ways to increase your social engagement: Get into group dynamics.Join a group activity, such as a walking club, a golf or bowling league, a book or chess club, or a continuing education class at an adult education center. Schedule friend time.If you have a circle of friends but you don't see them regularly, take the initiative and schedule routine get-togethers. Designate a day, time, and place for coffee, lunch, or any type of gathering designed for easy conversation. Group video chats also are an option. Engage in ""weak ties."" Casual interactions, known as ""weak ties,"" also can provide stimulating engagement. For example, strike up a brief conversation with a stranger or employee at the grocery store or coffee shop. Even social media conversations and texting qualify. Image: © Pekic/Getty Images",6,0.3366236,-0.31826916
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/chest-pain-causes-other-than-the-heart,Chest pain: Causes other than the heart,1,"It's so clich' it's called the Holly­wood heart attack: people dramatically clutching their chests and crumbling to the ground. Unlike in the movies, however, many instances of chest pain — especially when it's fleeting — don't involve the heart at all. More than 6.5 million emergency department visits in the United States each year are due to chest pain, as are nearly four million outpatient clinic visits, according to the American Heart Association. Notably, however, most of these cases are not found to be heart-related. To be clear, chest discomfort of any kind — whether pain itself or tightness, pressure, squeezing, or burning — should never be ignored. And new chest pain should prompt a call to your doctor. But understanding its many possible causes can calm worst-case-scenario fears and help you find solutions, says Dr. Daniel Sands, a primary care doctor at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's been drummed into us that chest pain is a danger sign that should make you see a doctor,"" Dr. Sands says. This remains solid and safe advice. But chest discomfort more often arises for reasons other than the heart. Lengthy list of causes For women, cardiac causes account for ""only a very small proportion"" of chest pain, Dr. Sands notes. This depends, of course, on each woman's specific risk factors for heart disease. And, particularly in women, heart attacks don't always show up with chest pain at all. ""If a 25-year-old woman comes in with chest pain, and she's generally healthy with no prior heart disease, the likelihood she has cardiac disease is infinitesimal,"" he says. ""But if it's a 60-year-old woman who smokes and has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease, that person is so likely to have heart disease that I'd send her to the ER right away."" A long list of other conditions — some minor and others deadly serious — can trigger chest pain or discomfort. These include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) gallstones asthma anxiety or panic attacks ulcers COVID esophagus spasms costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the breastbone) pleurisy (inflammation of the tissue separating the lungs from the chest wall) pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lung) aortic dissection (a rupture of the aortic artery) pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart). Spot the clues How can you tell if chest pain is most likely not heart-related? Dr. Sands offers these clues: It's brief, lasting only a few moments. You can climb stairs or exercise without the pain worsening. It's triggered by eating, occurring just afterward or only when you eat certain foods. It happens only when you move in a certain way, such as bending or stretching. It occurs only when you're coughing or breathing deeply. It's localized to a small spot, or feels better or worse when you rub the area. Regardless of how it shows up, any chest pain should prompt you to follow up with your doctor, Dr. Sands says. You may need treatment for another issue. ""Don't panic,"" he says. ""Your doctor can evaluate you to see if something serious is going on and work with you to find a solution to feel better."" Conversely, a heart attack or other catastrophic problem ""usually shows up with chest pain that goes on for a long period, not something that just goes away,"" Dr. Sands says. Watch for chest pain lingering for more than a few minutes; shortness of breath; pain in the jaw, neck, or back; pain in one or both arms; and feeling nauseous, weak, faint, or dizzy. Call 911 or have someone drive you to an emergency room if you experience any of these signs. But anytime you're not certain why you're having chest pain or where it stems from, ""call your doctor immediately,"" Dr. Sands says. ""Sometimes answering a few questions, even over the phone, can determine whether you need to be evaluated or not."" Image: © Povozniuk/Getty Images",9,0.08627309,-0.29823917
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-healthy-is-sugar-alcohol-202312183002,How healthy is sugar alcohol?,1,"If you are trying to cut back on added sugar — and you should, because excess sugar increases risks for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease — you might be tempted by products advertised as low sugar, no sugar, or sugar-free. Many contain familiar low-calorie sugar substitutes like aspartame or sucralose instead of sugar. And as you're reading labels, you also may run across another ingredient: sugar alcohol, which is used in products like sugar-free cookies, candies, ice cream, beverages, and chewing gums. Are any of these sweeteners a better choice nutritionally? Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, weighs in below. Are low-calorie or no-calorie sweeteners any healthier than natural sugar? Also known as artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes, the list of low-calorie and no-calorie sweeteners you may see on product nutrition labels includes acesulfame-K, saccharin, sucralose, neotame, and advantame. These have a higher sweetness intensity per gram than natural sugar. So far research on them is mixed, although some observational studies have found that beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners are associated with a higher risk for diabetes and weight gain. What exactly are sugar alcohols and how can you spot them? Sugar alcohols may have the most misleading name, as they are neither sugar nor alcohol, according to Dr. Hu. ""They are a type of carbohydrate derived from fruits and vegetables, although most commercial sugar alcohols are synthetically produced."" You can usually spot many sugar alcohols on ingredient lists by ""-ol"" at the ends of their names. Examples include sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, mannitol, erythritol, and maltitol. Are sugar alcohols any healthier than other sugar substitutes or natural sugar? Here is a look at the pros and cons. The upside of sugar alcohols Sugar alcohols reside in the sweet spot between natural sugar and low-calorie sweeteners. They are not as overly sweet as sweeteners and don't add too many extra calories like sugar. ""Sugar alcohols are about 40% to 80% as sweet as natural sugar, whereas artificial sweeteners like aspartame are about 200 times sweeter,"" says Dr. Hu. ""And they have about 25% to 75% fewer calories per gram than sugar."" Another upside of sugar alcohols is that they break down slowly in the gut. Hence, your body only absorbs part of their overall carbohydrates. ""This keeps your blood sugar and insulin levels from spiking as they do with sugar,"" says Dr. Hu. ""That makes them a useful sugar substitute for people with diabetes."" The downside of sugar alcohols The main downside to sugar alcohols is this: when taken in high amounts they can cause gastrointestinal (GI) problems, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or loose stools. Because sugar alcohols are slowly digested, they have more time to feed bacteria in the gut, which can lead to fermentation and produce excess gas. Their slow digestion also can pull extra water into the colon and cause a laxative effect. People's tolerance for sugar alcohols depends on many factors, including body weight, health conditions, and the amount and types of sugar alcohols. ""Individual differences in digestion and metabolism, gut microbiome composition, and dietary habits can also make a difference,"" says Dr. Hu. ""For these reasons, we recommend introducing sugar alcohols into your diet gradually and observing how your body responds."" For people who experience GI symptoms caused by sugar alcohols, Dr. Hu says cutting back on the amount of foods and drinks made with them often can correct the problem. ""Sugar alcohols are commonly found in sugar-free or low-carb products, so pay attention to food labels"" he says. ""Because different sugar alcohols can have different effects, it might be useful to identify specific types of sugar alcohols that cause GI side effects."" Do sugar alcohols have health risks? Possible long-term health risks of sugar alcohol are still being explored. A 2023 observational study found a link between using erythritol as an added sweetener and cardiovascular disease events, such as stroke and heart attack, in people with heart disease or who had risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure. However, these findings have not been confirmed in subsequent studies. ""Sugar alcohols offer a healthier alternative to sugar because of their lower calorie content and reduced glycemic response, which is the effect food has on blood sugar levels,"" says Dr. Hu. ""But they also have potential drawbacks, especially for those with sensitive digestive systems, so it's best to consume them in moderation as part of an overall healthy eating pattern.""",3,0.36963204,0.21872503
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/foods-you-should-eat-to-help-fight-inflammation,Foods you should eat to help fight inflammation,1,"We typically think of inflammation as a result of an injury or disease. But diet also plays an important role in chronic inflammation. This is in part because the foods we eat influence the types of bacteria that populate our gut and their chemical byproducts. While some foods encourage the growth of bacteria that stimulate inflammation, others promote the growth of bacteria that help suppress it. That's why it's important to know which foods have anti-inflammatory properties and which can cause inflammation Foods that fight inflammation Fruits and vegetables. Most fruits and brightly colored vegetables naturally contain high levels of antioxidants and polyphenols. Polyphenols are potentially protective compounds found in plants. Studies have shown that polyphenols have multiple anti-inflammatory properties and may improve the function of cells that line blood vessels. Foods high in polyphenols include onions, turmeric, red grapes, cherries, and plums, as well as dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, and collard greens. Nuts and seeds. Studies have found that consuming nuts and seeds is associated with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Some oils and fatty fish. Olive oil, flaxseed oil, and fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel offer healthy doses of omega-3 fatty acids, which have long been shown to reduce inflammation. Coffee, cocoa and green tea. The polyphenols in coffee and the flavanols in cocoa are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea is also rich in both polyphenols and antioxidants. Foods that can fuel inflammation The foods that contribute to inflammation are the same ones generally considered bad for other aspects of health. These include: Sugary sodas Refined carbohydrates (like white bread and pasta) Red meat and processed meats Processed foods. Certain components or ingredients used in processed foods such as the emulsifiers added to ice cream, may have effects on inflammation. Such foods are also likely to contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation.. The key to reducing inflammation with diet To practice anti-inflammatory eating, it's best to focus on an overall healthy diet rather than singling out individual ""good"" and ""bad"" foods. In general, a healthy diet means one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils, and limits food loaded with simple sugars (like soda and candy), beverages that contain high-fructose corn syrup (like juice drinks and sports drinks), and refined carbohydrates.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-fiber-in-your-diet,How to get more fiber in your diet,1,"Diverticulosis is a very common colon condition in which small pouches form on the colon wall. Most people who have diverticulosis have no symptoms, However, sometimes one of the pouches gets inflamed, usually due to a bacterial infection. To reduce your risk of getting diverticulosis and diverticulitis, add high-fiber foods to each meal. Aim for up to half your plate to contain some fiber-rich food. Here are some tips that can help you make the transition to a higher-fiber diet. Eat a minimum of three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit every day. This makes up the five-a-day recommended by the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In general, one serving is a single piece of fruit or a half-cup of raw fruits or vegetables, or a cup of leafy greens. Include fruits, vegetables, or both with every meal. For instance, include fruit with breakfast and as a snack, and vegetables with lunch and dinner. Eat pulses (the seeds of plants in the legume family), such as beans, lentils, and peas, at least three times a week. You can include them either as a plant-based protein in meatless dishes, or as the starch side in place of grains. For example, you could have fish on a bed of lentils rather than rice. Rely on nuts, seeds, and fruit for snacks. Or add them to other items like yogurt, oatmeal, salads, and stir-fries. Replace refined grains like white rice with whole grains like brown rice, wild rice, or bulgur. For pasta, look for versions made from quinoa or pulses like chickpeas and lentils. Check nutrition fact labels for the amount of dietary fiber. Aim for at least 5 grams of fiber per serving. Be careful about eating a lot of fiber at once. Overdoing it can cause gas, bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps as your gut bacteria try to process all the new fiber. These problems go away after a while as your digestive system gets used to the higher fiber levels, but you can avoid them by adding extra fiber gradually to your diet. For example, try to add just one more serving of a high-fiber food to your daily diet for a week, then see how your body feels. Give yourself another week, if needed. If everything is okay, add another daily serving for a week. Continue this pattern until you reach your daily quota of fiber. Also, make sure to drink plenty of fluids each day—about 16 ounces of water, four times a day. Increasing the water you drink can help fiber pass through your digestive system and avoid stomach distress.

In others, physical tension is to blame. One way to quiet a racing mind or relax a tense body is a technique called progressive muscle relaxation. It involves gradually tensing and relaxing your muscles, beginning with your feet and working your way up your body. Try this when you have trouble falling asleep: Lie on your back in bed in a comfortable position. Put a pillow under your head or your knees to relax your back. Rest your arms with palms up, slightly apart from your body. Take several slow, deep breaths through your nose. Exhale with a long sigh to release tension. Focus on your toes and feet. Curl your toes and arch your feet. Hold this movement briefly to feel the sensation. Relax your muscles and let your feet sink into the bed. Feel them getting heavy and becoming totally relaxed. While breathing softly, move your attention slowly up your body, tensing then relaxing each area: calves, thighs, buttocks, lower back, abdomen, upper back, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, jaw, and forehead. Relax any remaining tense spots. If thoughts distract you, ignore them and gently return your attention to your breathing. Image: © Nicole S. Young/Getty Images",6,0.27291495,-0.24771969
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/can-weight-loss-slow-prostate-cancer,Can weight loss slow prostate cancer?,1,"You've had a biopsy and have been diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer, defined as a tumor that is confined to the prostate gland and unlikely to grow or spread. You decide to follow active surveillance, a protocol in which you regularly follow up with your doctor for routine PSA tests, prostate biopsies, and possibly MRI scans. If at some point it looks like the cancer has progressed, then you can consider treatment (radiation or surgery). For some men, this wait-and-see period lasts for years. But can you do anything to help slow your cancer's growth and delay treatment for as long as possible? Your bathroom scale might give you the answer. How monitoring works The reality is that most low-grade prostate cancer does not transform over time and become more aggressive, according to Dr. Mark Pomerantz, a medical oncologist with Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""Being on active surveillance is more about looking out for cancer that the original biopsy missed,"" he says. ""It's not necessarily that the original low-grade cancer becomes more aggressive — although that is possible in some cases — but rather, high- or medium-grade cancer is hiding and we're looking for changes in PSA levels that might suggest it's there and become aggressive."" About 45% to 60% of men on active surveillance will not need cancer treatment over the 10 to 15 years following their initial diagnosis, according to Dr. Pomerantz. While those are encouraging figures, they still leave the chance you may need treatment sooner. Controlling factors You can't control two factors that can increase the risk of undetected high- or medium-grade cancer from becoming aggressive: genetics and family history. But one aspect you may be able to change is your weight. ""While excess weight doesn't appear to increase the likelihood of low-grade prostate cancer, there appears to be a strong association between being overweight or obese and the risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. People with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are considered overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 or higher are classified as obese. Scientists reported in the Aug. 15, 2019, issue of Cancer that over a 10-year period, men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose waist size and BMI increased the most had greater risks of advanced and fatal prostate cancer compared with men who maintained a healthy weight. Specifically, a five-point increase in BMI was associated with a 50% higher risk for advanced or fatal prostate cancer, and a 4.1-inch increase in waist size was associated with a 40% higher risk. Where that extra fat lies also is a driving a factor. The same study discovered that extra visceral fat (the hidden kind that lies deep in the abdomen and surrounds the major organs) was linked with a 31% higher risk of developing advanced prostate cancer. Your past weight gain also may play a role in future cancer growth, suggests research presented at the European Congress on Obesity in May 2023. Researchers found that men who gained an average of 2.2 pounds each year from ages 17 to 29 increased their risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer later in life by 13%. ""So losing excess weight may be one way to possibly keep prostate cancer from growing more rapidly,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. The weight connection Experts don't fully understand the relationship between excess fat and prostate cancer growth. Some theories suggest that extra weight leads to higher levels of inflammation, which in turn acts like fuel to prostate cancer cells. Overweight and obese men also are more likely to have higher levels of blood sugar, which stimulates the pancreas to release more insulin. Some studies have shown a link between higher insulin levels and an increased risk of prostate cancer. ""This could be another factor raising the chance of more aggressive cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. While weight loss and weight management are never easy, Dr. Pomerantz says many men on active surveillance often embrace the situation as an opportunity to make overall health changes. ""Increasing exercise and adopting a healthy, plant-based diet, both of which can help men lose extra pounds, not only can help with their prostate cancer, but can reduce their risk of heart disease and other cancers,"" he says. ""Most men on active surveillance will die of something other than prostate cancer, so this can be a wake-up call for men to get serious about their health.""

Researchers followed more than 6,500 white-collar workers for 18 years and identified two job-related conditions linked to higher cardiovascular risks. One was job strain, defined as high demands (such as having a heavy workload and tight deadlines) coupled with low control (for example, having little say in decision making). The other, called effort-reward imbalance, occurs when a person's effort is high but their salary, recognition, or job security are low. Compared with people who didn't experience work stress, men who reported either of those stressors had a 49% higher risk of heart disease. But their risk doubled if they reported both types. Among women, the results were inconclusive, which the authors say might reflect the fact that women tend to develop heart disease later in life than men. The men were also more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, and other factors that raise heart disease risk.

Turmeric contains the naturally occurring chemical curcumin, which might have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. And now a small randomized trial has found that taking curcumin supplements (derived from turmeric) helps reduce symptoms of functional dyspepsia — recurring, unexplained stomach pain, bloating, or early feelings of fullness. Scientists randomly assigned 206 people (ages 18 to 70) with functional dyspepsia to one of three treatments: taking 500 milligrams (mg) of curcumin (two 250-mg capsules) four times a day, taking 20 mg of the medication omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid) once a day, or taking both treatments each day. After about a month of treatment, people in all three groups said their dyspepsia symptoms had improved. The results were even better after two months.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cpap-machines-and-masks-which-ones-are-right-for-you,CPAP machines and masks: Which ones are right for you?,1,"Your doctor says you need continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat your sleep apnea, and you're eager to begin treatment. You're also a little worried, since you've heard that using a CPAP system can be uncomfortable and challenging. How do you choose a system that will give you the best odds of success? Here are some tips to help. Understand the treatment CPAP is the first-line treatment for people with obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder marked by repeated pauses in breathing caused by a blocked airway. The CPAP system's job is to keep your airway open. It does that by pushing a forceful stream of air through a tube and into a mask you wear while you sleep. The air comes from a small bedside pump (an air compressor). Other forms of positive airway pressure (PAP) may be helpful for people with central sleep apnea, although pauses in breathing in this type of sleep apnea are related to garbled messages from the brain, not blockages (see ""What is sleep apnea?""). What is sleep apnea? Sleep apnea is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. The pauses last at least 10 seconds, lead to poor-quality sleep, and put a strain on your body. Untreated sleep apnea may increase your risk for high blood pressure or stroke. In obstructive sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the airway briefly becomes blocked. This can be caused by too much tissue in the airway (often due to excess weight), large tonsils, or a large tongue. In central sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the brain fails to deliver electrical impulses to the muscles that help you breathe. Trust your doctor Your physician will determine what kind of CPAP device you need. ""The device and its settings are by prescription, just like a medication,"" says Dr. Noah Siegel, director of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Surgery at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. With CPAP, a single fixed air pressure is used throughout the night. Other types of PAP therapies include auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP), which provides a range of preset pressures throughout the night bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides two different preset pressures — a more powerful one when you inhale and a less powerful one when you exhale adaptive servo ventilation (ASV), an advanced device that provides pressure based on breathing patterns throughout the night. ""Generally speaking, people with obstructive sleep apnea respond better to CPAP or APAP. People with central sleep apnea may respond better to BiPAP or ASV,"" Dr. Siegel says. Investigate face mask options You get to choose the face mask for your PAP system, and it's an important decision. Face masks often feel bulky, making people reluctant to wear them. Dr. Siegel recommends looking at mask options online and trying on a few before making a selection. That might happen at a medical supply store or during a home visit from your medical equipment supplier. The masks fall into two categories. Full-face masks. These cover the nose and mouth and deliver air to them both. They are ideal for someone who breathes through the mouth or has nasal or sinus problems. Nasal masks. These masks deliver air through the nose only. They are less bulky than full-face masks and come in styles that fit over, under, or in the nose. An important consideration for both mask types, Dr. Siegel says, is the site where the tube from the pump enters the mask. ""Traditional-style masks connect the tubing in the front of the mask, near the nose. That's not great for people who roll over a lot in bed or people who are claustrophobic,"" he says. ""Newer styles attach at the top of the mask. It's much less intrusive."" Give it time Adjusting to any PAP system takes time. You may need to try a few masks to find the right fit and comfort. ""And if allergies or frequent sinus congestion keep you from using a nasal mask, we have interventions — such as nasal sprays or surgery — that might make a nasal mask more tolerable,"" Dr. Siegel says. Also, your doctor may need to make adjustments to your machine, such as changes to settings for pressure and humidification. Just stick with it, and remember that using a PAP system, like taking a medication, is an ongoing therapy that needs regular evaluation. Image: © grandriver/Getty Images",6,0.07394339,-0.26667923
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/several-factors-may-cause-testosterone-levels-to-drop,Several factors may cause testosterone levels to drop,1,"Testosterone levels tend to slowly decline in middle-aged men, and often fall faster after age 70. In an analysis of 11 studies involving about 25,000 men in total, researchers looked at the possible factors for this more rapid decline in testosterone levels later in life. They found that having a body mass index higher than 27 and engaging in less than 75 minutes of weekly vigorous activity were each linked to lower testosterone levels. Other contributing factors were having ever smoked and health issues like high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Low testosterone levels can contribute to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and reduced sex drive. While the findings only showed an association, the researchers stressed the need for older men to continue engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors and managing chronic health issues, which could help maintain their body's testosterone production. Men also should address these areas before considering hormone therapy for low testosterone. The results appeared in the September 2023 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/statins-types-uses-side-effects-and-alternatives,"Statins: Types, uses, side effects, and alternatives",1,"If your doctor wants you to take a statin for high cholesterol, you're not alone. More than 40 million Americans take them, too. In fact, statins are the most prescribed drugs in the U.S. But you may have questions. You may be wondering about side effects of statins, types of statins, how statins work, and what your doctor may prescribe instead of statins to help lower your cholesterol. What are statins? Statins are prescription drugs you take as pills to lower cholesterol. Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes. However, when you have too much, it can build up inside the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Cholesterol-laden plaque contributes to heart disease in different ways. A buildup of cholesterol can make your arteries narrow and even block them. If a cholesterol plaque ruptures, a blood clot forms there and this can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Cholesterol also provokes inflammation in the arteries, which can contribute to the formation of artery-blocking clots. Sometimes, just changing what you eat and being more active can lower cholesterol. But if your cholesterol stays high, you may need a statin or other cholesterol-lowering medication. How do statins work? Statins interfere with how your liver makes cholesterol; most importantly, LDL, the ""bad"" kind. Triglycerides are a second kind of cholesterol that can contribute to plaque buildup. HDL has traditionally been referred to as the ""good"" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of LDL. However, changing HDL has not been seen to reduce the risk of heart disease, so this is no longer a focus of cholesterol management. Statins work to lower LDL levels. This slows the buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Statins also reduce inflammation in artery walls. If you do have plaque buildup inside your arteries, statins can help prevent them from breaking open and leading to blood clots. Once you start taking a statin (or any cholesterol lowering drug), you probably will stay on it for life. If you stop, your protection from the statin will wear off. Who might benefit from statins? You may benefit from statins if you have high LDL cholesterol levels have had a heart attack or stroke, or are at risk for having one have diabetes (a risk factor for heart disease) and are over age 40. Statins may help you live a longer and healthier life. But the degree to which you may benefit can vary. Your doctor can tell you about your personal risk and how much benefit to expect. People who are pregnant or who have liver disease should not take statins. What types of statins are available? Eight statins are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): atorvastatin (Lipitor) fluvastatin (Lescol) lovastatin (Mevacor) lovatstatin extended release (Altoprev) pitavastatin (Livalo) pravastatin (Pravachol) rosuvastatin (Crestor) simvastatin (Zocor). Your doctor picks which statin may work best for you by considering a few things. They include how much you need to lower your LDL by, and other medicines you are taking. Sometimes people will have a side effect with one statin but are able to tolerate another one. What are possible side effects of statins? More than three decades of research have shown that statins are safe and effective. But like all drugs, statins can have side effects. The most common side effects of statins are muscle aches and feeling tired. Other side effects that aren't as common are headaches, constipation, diarrhea, and sleep problems. A 2022 study published in The Lancet reviewed the records of over 150,000 people in randomized trials of statins, and analyzed those who had muscle aches after taking statins or placebo. The study found that more than 90% of those symptoms were not related to the statins. The researchers concluded that the risks of muscle problems are low compared to the health benefits of statins. How can I manage side effects of statins? Muscle soreness is the main reason why people want to stop using statins. Studies have evaluated many therapies for resolving statin muscle aches, including vitamin D, and coenzyme Q10, but have not found compelling evidence that any of them are effective. In many cases, side effects will go away as your body gets used to the statin. If they don't, your doctor may suggest switching to a different statin or taking a lower dose, and sometimes taking the low dose every other day, for example. What alternatives to statins might my doctor prescribe? Some people just can't tolerate the side effects of statins. Others still have high cholesterol even after taking statins for a while. Fortunately, there are different drugs to try and other ways to lower cholesterol. Non-statin drugs There are many classes of drugs to help lower cholesterol. These include ezetimibe (Zetia), bempedoic acid (Nexletol), and bile acid sequestrants, which have been seen to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke. Ezetimibe reduces the amount of cholesterol your body absorbs from food (or reabsorbs from what the liver releases). Large, randomized studies did not find any difference in side effects of ezetimibe compared with placebo. Bempedoic acid blocks the production of cholesterol in your liver, but the medication does not get into muscle cells, so it can be an effective option for people who have had problems with statins. It can be taken alone but is usually taken with other cholesterol-lowering medications. Side effects include gout (especially in those with a history of gout), mild worsening of creatinine (a measure of kidney function), and gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis). Bile acid sequestrants stop bile acid in your stomach from getting absorbed in your blood. Your liver then takes the cholesterol from your blood to make the bile acid it needs. Side effects include constipation, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle pain. PCSK9 inhibitors PCSK9 inhibitors are a newer type of cholesterol drug. These medicines are for people who have an inherited condition that causes very high levels of LDL. They also are for people with heart disease whose cholesterol has not been sufficiently lowered with a maximum dose of statins. PCSK9 inhibitors work by helping the liver remove cholesterol from the blood. PCSK9 is a naturally occurring protein that breaks down certain receptors in the liver that remove LDL from the blood as it passes through the liver. By reducing the number of these receptors, PCSK9 increases the level of LDL in the blood. By hampering PCSK9's ability to work, PCSK9 inhibitors allow more LDL receptors to remain active in the liver. With more receptors to sweep away LDL, a person's blood levels of LDL drop. These drugs are given by injection and are more expensive than statin pills. Side effects include flulike symptoms and pain from the injection. Nondrug ways to lower cholesterol Some people can lower their cholesterol without medicine by making lifestyle changes. Those changes include having a healthy diet. The DASH diet from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is one example. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish and poultry, beans, nuts, and low-fat dairy products. It limits sugary drinks, sweets, and foods high in saturated fat, like fatty meats and full-fat dairy products. If you are overweight, losing weight may lower your LDL. Having a healthy diet can help with that, too. Another way to lower cholesterol is through regular physical activity. Aim for 30 minutes each day. Other things to try include managing stress and quitting smoking. Both of those have an effect on cholesterol.",3,0.32417646,-0.11479655
https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/8-secrets-to-a-good-nights-sleep,8 secrets to a good night's sleep,1,"After a night spent tossing and turning, you wake up feeling like a couple of the Seven Dwarves: sleepy… and grumpy. Restless nights and weary mornings can become more frequent as we get older and our sleep patterns change. Later in life there tends to be a decrease in the number of hours slept. There are also some changes in the way the body regulates circadian rhythms. This internal clock helps your body respond to changes in light and dark. When it undergoes a shift with age, it can be harder to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night. We all have trouble sleeping from time to time, but when insomnia persists day after day, it can become a real problem. Beyond making us tired and moody, a lack of sleep can have serious effects on our health, increasing our propensity for obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. If you've been having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, you may have turned to sleep medications in search of more restful slumber. However, these drugs can have side effects, including appetite changes, dizziness, drowsiness, abdominal discomfort, dry mouth, headaches, and strange dreams. You don't need to avoid sleep aids if you absolutely need them, but before you turn to pills, try these eight tips to help you get a better night's sleep. 1. Exercise Going for a brisk daily walk won't just trim you down, it will also keep you up less often at night. Exercise boosts the effect of natural sleep hormones such as melatonin. Just watch the timing of your workouts. Exercising too close to bedtime can be stimulating. Morning workouts that expose you to bright daylight will help the natural circadian rhythm. 2. Reserve bed for sleep and sex Don't use your bed as an office for answering phone calls, texting, and responding to emails. Also, avoid watching late-night TV there. The bed needs to be a stimulus for sleeping, not for wakefulness. Reserve your bed for sleep and sex. 3. Keep it comfortable Television and your smartphone aren't the only possible distractions in your bedroom. Ambience can affect your sleep quality too. Make sure your bedroom is as comfortable as possible. Ideally you want a quiet, dark, cool environment. All of these things promote sleep onset. 4. Start a sleep ritual When you were a child and your mother read you a story and tucked you into bed every night, this comforting ritual helped lull you to sleep. Even in adulthood, a set of bedtime rituals can have a similar effect. Rituals help signal the body and mind that it's coming to be time for sleep. Drink a glass of warm milk. Take a bath. Or listen to calming music to unwind before bed. 5. Eat — but not too much A grumbling stomach can be distracting enough to keep you awake, but so can an overly full belly. Avoid eating a big meal within two to three hours of bedtime. If you're hungry right before bed, eat a small, healthy snack (such as an apple with a slice of cheese or a few whole-wheat crackers) to satisfy you until breakfast. 6. Avoid alcohol and caffeine If you do have a snack before bed, wine and chocolate shouldn't be part of it. Chocolate contains caffeine, which is a stimulant. Surprisingly, alcohol has a similar effect. It makes you a little sleepy, but it's actually a stimulant and it disrupts sleep during the night. Also, stay away from anything acidic (such as citrus fruits and juices) or spicy, which can give you heartburn. 7. De-stress The bills are piling up and your to-do list is a mile long. Daytime worries can bubble to the surface at night. Stress is a stimulus. It activates the fight-or-flight hormones that work against sleep. Give yourself time to wind down before bed. Learning some form of the relaxation response can promote good sleep and can also reduce daytime anxiety. To relax, try deep breathing exercises. Inhale slowly and deeply, and then exhale. 8. Get checked An urge to move your legs, snoring, and a burning pain in your stomach, chest, or throat are symptoms of three common sleep disrupters — restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, and gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD. If these symptoms are keeping you up at night or making you sleepy during the day, see your doctor for an evaluation. Taking sleep medicines safely If you've tried lifestyle changes and they aren't working, your doctor may prescribe hypnotic sleep medications. These drugs can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, but they also can have side effects. Here are some tips for ensuring that you're taking these medicines as safely as possible: Tell your doctor about all other medicines you're taking. Some drugs can interact with sleep medications. Take only the lowest possible effective dose, for the shortest possible period of time. Carefully follow your doctor's instructions. Make sure you take the right dose at the right time of day (which is typically just before bed). Call your doctor right away if you experience any side effects, such as excess sleepiness during the day or dizziness. While you're taking the sleep medicine, also practice the good sleep habits outlined in this article. Avoid drinking alcohol and driving while taking sleep aids. Sleep medications may make you walk unsteadily if you get out of bed in a drowsy state. If you routinely have to get out of bed during the night to urinate, be sure the path to your bathroom is clear of obstacles or loose rugs so you don't fall.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/stomach-troubles-with-no-clear-cause-heres-what-you-can-do,Stomach troubles with no clear cause: Here's what you can do,1,"Your stomach doesn't feel well. It's not heartburn, but you feel bloated, full, and nauseous. The discomfort started during a meal, or maybe a half an hour later. When this happens commonly, you should seek medical evaluation. Your doctor will make sure there are no worrisome symptoms or signs, and then likely diagnose you with functional dyspepsia. This is a type of chronic indigestion, or a stomachache and full feeling during and after meals. While most often there is no single medical solution to functional dyspepsia, different approaches might work. Here are some to try out: Eat Right Avoid foods that trigger symptoms. Common culprits are caffeine, chocolate, alcohol, and spicy, acidic, or fatty foods. Eat smaller, more frequent meals so your stomach does not distend and can empty quickly. Chew your food slowly and completely. Avoid activities that result in swallowing excess air, such eating quickly, chewing gum, drinking carbonated beverages, and smoking. Avoid lying down within two hours of eating. Keep your weight under control. Reduce Stress Use stress reduction techniques, including relaxation therapies. Exercise. In addition to being good for your overall health, it's a proven stress reducer. Try cognitive behavioral therapy. Reduce Fatigue Get enough rest. Try to go to bed and get up at the same times each day. Avoid caffeine after noon. Exercise Perform aerobic exercise three to five times a week for 20 to 40 minutes per session. Don't exercise immediately after eating. Learn more about gut health inThe Sensitive Gut, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/long-lasting-c-diff-infections-a-threat-to-the-gut-202311012987,Long-lasting C. diff infections: A threat to the gut,1,"If you've ever dealt with diarrhea, you know how quickly it leaves you feeling depleted. Now imagine a case that rages on and on — or comes back again and again. This is the reality for nearly 500,000 Americans each year who have the bacterial infection known as Clostridioides difficile, or C. diff. Virulent diarrhea and inflammation of the colon can even turn life-threatening. This primer will help you understand how C. diff spreads and releases toxins, what the common symptoms are, and who is most vulnerable. Dr. Jessica Allegretti, director of the fecal microbiota program at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, also touches on promising preventive strategies and treatments. How does C. diff spread? Like many bacteria, C. diff is present in our stool. It's carried by virtually everyone — on our skin and even on the soles of our shoes. When C. diff bacteria are outside the body, they are inactive spores. They only have a chance to become active when they're swallowed and reach the intestines. Even then, many people who swallow C. diff spores never become ill. The spores only sicken people whose gut microbiome — the trillions of organisms living in their intestines — becomes imbalanced for one of the various reasons described below. When an imbalance occurs, the spores start to multiply and create toxins that lead to a C. diff infection. ""Many of us are colonized with C. diff bacteria without any consequences,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""We're swallowing C. diff spores all the time. Only under the right circumstances will the spores germinate and release a toxin. It's the toxin that makes you sick."" What are the symptoms of a C. diff infection? The symptoms mimic those of many other types of gastrointestinal ailments. Initially, this may make it difficult to tell the infection apart from milder illnesses. Symptoms to watch for include persistent diarrhea lasting three or more days nausea fever stomach pain or tenderness appetite loss. ""C. diff isn't something that people in the general population should be walking around scared of,"" Dr. Allegretti says. ""But if you need to take an antibiotic, be on the lookout for diarrheal symptoms after finishing the course of antibiotics. Diarrhea that's associated with antibiotics alone should resolve once you finish taking the medication."" Who is most vulnerable? A few sobering facts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC): C. diff is the top cause of health care-associated infections in the US. It disproportionately strikes people in hospitals and nursing homes. Among people over 65, one in 11 of those diagnosed with a health care-associated case of C. diff dies within a month. However, other groups are also susceptible to the infection. Health care-associated C. diff infections are plateauing, Dr. Allegretti notes, while so-called community-based infections that occur among the general population are increasing. People most likely to experience such infections: Are taking antibiotics or have just finished a course of antibiotic therapy. People are up to 10 times more likely to get C. diff while on antibiotics or during the month afterward, according to the CDC. ""Not everyone who takes an antibiotic gets C. diff, and not everyone who gets C. diff gets recurrent C. diff,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""It has a lot to do with your host response, your gut microbiome, and your individual risk factors, such as immunosuppression or inflammatory bowel disease."" Have a weakened immune system due to cancer, organ transplant, or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (such as people with inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmune conditions). Have close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with C. diff. What prevention strategies help block the spread of C. diff? Hospitals try to prevent C diff. among patients in several ways. They impose scrupulous hand-washing requirements among staff members. Patients who develop new diarrhea are tested for C. diff infection. Those who have it are isolated in their own rooms to help prevent further spread. Outside of a hospital, you can help prevent this gut infection through a few commonsense measures. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water every time you use the bathroom and always before eating. Clean hands are especially important if you've had C. diff or know you've been exposed to someone with it. By the way, alcohol-based hand sanitizer isn't effective against C. diff because its organisms can form resistant spores. Take antibiotics only when strictly necessary and for the shortest period possible. ""The biggest thing we can do is advocate for ourselves,"" Dr. Allegretti says. ""During cold and flu season, we know a lot of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are written for infections that are most likely viral, not bacterial. Antibiotics do not kill viruses — and unnecessary antibiotics may upset the bacterial balance in your gut. Ask your doctor: Do I need this prescription? Is there an alternative?"" When you do need antibiotics, ask if a narrow-spectrum antibiotic would be effective for your type of infection. Why? Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill a wider array of bacteria. This may be overkill, depleting your gut microbiome unnecessarily and enabling C. diff bacteria to germinate. ""The caveat is, we don't want patients to not take antibiotics they need for an actual infection,"" she says. ""But have a conversation with your health care team."" The type of antibiotic prescribed also matters, according to a 2023 study in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases. Researchers compared more than 159,000 people who had C. diff infection with 797,000 healthy controls. Study findings suggest that using clindamycin and later-generation cephalosporin antibiotics pose the greatest risk for C. diff infection. Meanwhile, the antibiotics minocycline and doxycycline were associated with the lowest risk. ""But there are very few safe antibiotics with regard to C. diff risk,"" Dr. Allegretti says. Can probiotics help prevent or treat C. diff infection? Probiotics are live microorganisms that can help keep the gut healthy and are found in supplements, yogurt, and other fermented foods. Two familiar examples are various strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. However, probiotics haven't been found to prevent C. diff or its recurrence. Research performed in mice and humans suggests that giving probiotics after a course of antibiotics may slow the pace of microbiome recovery. ""You're potentially delaying the recovery of your microbiome with probiotics,"" she says. How is C. diff infection treated? Ironically, C. diff therapy typically starts with antibiotics, despite the infection's proliferation due to antibiotic use. The antibiotics of choice include fidaxomicin or oral vancomycin. However, about one in five people will suffer one or more recurrences –– and with each one, yet another recurrence becomes far likelier, Dr. Allegretti says. A repeat episode may happen because people haven't disinfected their homes effectively. That leaves them open to reinfection with the same strain of C. diff while still vulnerable. When C. diff recurs, fecal microbial transplants (FMT) are considered the gold standard treatment. FMT transplants fecal matter from a healthy donor into a patient's gut, placing it there using an endoscope, enema, or within an oral capsule. This year, the FDA approved two live fecal microbiota products aimed at preventing recurrent C. diff infections. ""We haven't gotten away from antibiotics yet to treat this disease,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""But we have a lot of preventative strategies now. It's certainly very exciting for people struggling with C. diff infections.""",9,-0.04991832,0.056324586
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-look-snap-and-connect-for-better-memory-recall,"Try this: Look, snap, and connect for better memory recall",1,"Mnemonics, named for Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, are techniques for recalling information. Mnemonics use cues — such as images, acronyms, rhymes, and easy-to-recall phrases — to reinforce memories. One type of mnemonic is called ""look, snap, connect."" It uses visualization, word association, and storytelling to help you solidify a memory so you can recall it later. It's a great tool for retaining details of new information. Here's an example of how it works: Look. Look refers to slowing down and noticing what you want to remember — for example, the fact that you parked your car in section 3B of the parking garage. Snap. Snap means taking a mental snapshot of the item. That could be an image of the actual parking garage sign, or a more elaborate image, such as that of three bumblebees (representing the 3B section where you parked). Connect. Connect involves connecting the image and the information you want to remember — in this case, the three bees and the garage section where you parked. Imagine the bees in your car.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-new-weight-loss-drugs,Understanding new weight-loss drugs,1,"Some people who struggle with weight loss have been able to find assistance from several FDA-approved weight-loss medications, such as bupropion plus naltrexone (Contrave), phentermine (Adipex-P), phentermine plus topiramate (Qsymia), and orlistat (Xenical, Alli). On average, such drugs can help people lose 5% to 7% of their body weight when paired with a healthy diet and exercise. Now a newer class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes has gained attention because of their impressive weight-loss results — in many cases, 10% to 20% of a person's body weight. They're called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Tale of two drugs Two of these GLP-1 receptor agonists are FDA-approved in formulations specifically designed for weight loss in people without diabetes: liraglutide (Saxenda) and semaglutide (Wegovy). Lower-dose versions of these same active ingredients, known respectively as Victoza and Ozempic, have been used for years to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels. ""They can lead to substantial weight loss when used in conjunction with healthy lifestyle changes in people who are overweight or have obesity with or without type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. A. Enrique Caballero, an endocrinologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But whether they can be safely used for all people who simply want to lose an extra 10 to 20 pounds is questionable."" New drugs on the horizon Other GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss may soon be available. A recent trial, funded by Eli Lilly, the company that makes tirzepatide (Mounjaro), found that around half of participants with both obesity and type 2 diabetes lost around 15% of their body weight on the medication. Also, initial research suggests that retatrutide, a triple hormone receptor agonist (acting on receptors for GLP-1, GIP, and CGCR), may lead to weight loss of up to 25% in people with diabetes. The FDA approved tirzepatide for treating type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and is now reviewing whether to approve it to treat obesity. How the new drugs work GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the GLP-1 hormone that is naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract in response to eating. ""The drugs prompt the body to produce more insulin after eating, limiting the elevation of blood sugar levels after meals, something particularly crucial for people with type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. Caballero. The drugs also regulate appetite by sending signals to the brain to tell the body it is full, which inhibits overeating. It is important to remember that these medications are only approved for people who meet certain criteria. Wegovy and Saxenda are for adults diagnosed with obesity — a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher — or those with a BMI of 27 plus at least one weight-related condition, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes. The other versions of these drugs—Victoza and Ozempic — are for people with type 2 diabetes. Still, that has not stopped some doctors from prescribing these medications ""off-label"" for weight loss, which means they are used for a different purpose than explicitly intended. ""But there isn't enough evidence to know whether these drugs might be beneficial or dangerous for people who fall outside of the FDA criteria,"" says Dr. Caballero. However, the larger issue is that many people see the new drugs as a quick-fix solution. ""It is paramount to remember that all weight-loss medications are recommended as an aid in the overall strategy that centers around a healthy meal plan and regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Caballero. ""In fact, people who stop taking these drugs will often regain the weight unless they have truly established a consistent and effective change in their eating and physical activity habits."" Know the downsides When discussing with your doctor whether GLP-1 receptor agonists are worth exploring, it's important to understand their potential downsides. You might develop various gastrointestinal side effects, including gas, bloating, indigestion, nausea, or irregular bowel movements. But these issues usually resolve within a few weeks, according to Dr. Caballero. ""The lowest doses of these medications are usually given at first and then gradually increased so people have less chance of developing side effects,"" he says. Another downside is the cost. The drugs are expensive — about $1,000 to $1,500 per month.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/check-out-your-skin,Check out your skin,1,"You probably look at your face in the bathroom mirror a couple times each day. But do you ever take a close-up look at your entire skin? Devoting time to regular full-body check-ups can help you identify abnormalities that may signal skin cancer. ""Many skin spots and growths are related to normal aging and are not cause for concern,"" says Dr. Abigail H. Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But you should note and monitor anything new or unusual."" Do a self-check Dr. Waldman recommends doing a head-to-toe self-exam every three to six months. Use a full-length mirror, plus a handheld mirror for hard-to-see spots, and a magnifying glass to examine smaller areas. ""If possible, have someone assist you so you don't miss anything,"" says Dr. Waldman. Here's how to do it. Look at your face, neck, ears (especially behind them), and scalp. Use a comb or a blow dryer to move your hair so that you can see better. Look at the front and back of your body in the mirror. Then, raise your arms and look at your left and right sides. Bend your elbows. Look carefully at your fingernails, palm and back of each hand, forearms (including the undersides), and upper arms. Check the back, front, and sides of your legs. Also, check the skin all over your buttocks and genital area. Sit and examine your feet, including the soles of your feet, the spaces between your toes, and your toenails. Note any new or questionable moles, sores, painful or itchy spots, raised or firm bumps, dark flaky patches, and black or brown lines along fingernails and toenails. Make sure to feel any suspicious areas for firmness, too. ""We often feel something troubling before we see it,"" says Dr. Waldman. Write down the date of your self-exams and record what you find, including the exact locations. Take photos with your phone to share with your doctor or dermatologist. ""After six to eight weeks, look at the trouble spots again, and get them checked out if they have not improved, or have changed color or size, have become painful, or easily bleed,"" says Dr. Waldman. Cosmetic changes Father Time brings us wrinkles, lines, bags under the eyes, age spots, raised rough lesions, and sagging skin. Many cosmetic treatments can treat these issues, such as botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, chemical peels, freezing liquid nitrogen sprays, laser treatments, prescription creams, and plastic surgery. Speak with your dermatologist about available options. Looking for skin cancer Melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer, and the earlier you can catch it, the better the outcome. The first sign of melanoma is usually a change in an existing mole. However, it also may appear as a new mole. Melanoma often appears on sun exposed areas, however, it also can occur in areas protected by the sun like nails. To recognize possible melanoma, follow the ABCDE guide: Asymmetry: the shape of one half doesn't match the other half Border: ragged or blurred edges Color: red, brown, blue, black, or white, and the shades may be uneven Diameter: about a quarter of an inch or larger, although some can be smaller Evolution: any changes in size, shape, or color. Here are some other skin issues to look out for during your self-exam: Freckles. Monitor large, irregular ones. If they grow or change appearance, this can be a prelude to a specific form of melanoma called lentigo maligna melanoma. Problem freckles often appear on the face, upper shoulders, chest, and arms. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). ""Both are types of skin cancer, but they are slow-growing, usually not life-threatening, and easy to treat if caught early,"" says Dr. Waldman. BCC may look like a bleeding pimple, an open sore, a red patch, a shiny pink growth, or a scar. SCC resembles a crusted, scaly red bump, patch, or wart. Both cancers appear in areas frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, rim of the ear, lower lip, balding scalp, neck, hands, arms, shoulders, back, and legs. Actinic keratoses (AKs). These growths are rough, gritty, and sometimes painful. They can be flat or slightly raised and appear in different colors, such as red, tan, pink, skin-colored, brown, or silver. AKs often appear on the face, tips of the ears, bald spots, and backs of the arms and hands. ""While AKs are not initially dangerous, get them looked at, as they may lead to squamous cell carcinoma if left alone,"" says Dr. Waldman.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/staying-regular,Staying regular,1,"Maybe you notice your spouse visits the bathroom every morning after a cup of coffee and marvel at his regularity. Perhaps you don't share that level of frequency — and wonder if you should. But what does ""staying regular"" really mean? The answer is different for every person, reflecting such factors as age, diet, physical activity, daily routine, and hydration levels, says Dr. Lawrence Borges, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Mt. Auburn Hospital. For some people, being regular means having a bowel movement once or twice a day. But it could also mean once or twice a week — or anything in between. ""Normal"" is whatever's normal for you. But many people still fret if they don't have frequent bowel movements, he says. ""People have in their minds that one perfect poop a day is the goal, but the reality is everyone's pattern may be different from that,"" Dr. Borges says. ""I try to stress that there's no single right answer, no perfect or correct pattern."" When routines change Stress alone is one negative offshoot of irregular bowel habits. Another is disrupted sleep, since people may awaken in discomfort or need to use the bathroom at odd hours. ""But being irregular, on its own, is common and not necessarily a sign of something wrong,"" Dr. Borges says. While how often you have a bowel movement doesn't matter, what does matter is that the pattern remains relatively consistent and you feel comfortable. With healthy bowel movements, you'll also feel you're completely emptying the rectum, not bloated or in pain, and don't have to strain hard to get the job done. Spotting a problem starts with noticing a dramatic change in what's normal for you. If you typically have one bowel movement a day and suddenly you're having them only once a week, for example — and you can't explain this change — you should see your doctor. That visit is even more pressing if you're also having other symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, unintended weight loss, blood in your stool, or a change in stool consistency. ""These are alarming changes that should prompt an evaluation,"" Dr. Borges says. Digestion direction Many people who ask Dr. Borges about being regular really want to know how to avoid constipation. Again, there's no single answer, with a menu of options to help keep digestion humming. In addition to mainstay advice such eating whole grains and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly (which keeps your colon moving, too), and drinking plenty of water, Dr. Borges offers this guidance. Maintain a toileting schedule. Try visiting the bathroom at the same time every day, such as in the morning after breakfast. This can help train your body to go at the same time in a place you're comfortable. ""If you're racing out the door for work and not leaving time to take advantage of that readiness, that's not helpful — you may not be able to take advantage of it later in the day,"" he says. Heed your body's signals. Along those lines, when you feel the urge to have a bowel movement, don't put it off until later. ""The opposite is also true: just because you haven't gone doesn't mean you should try to force it,"" he says. ""If your body's not ready, you may not be able to go because no stool is ready to be expelled."" Try a toilet stool. Toilet footstools have emerged as a quietly popular bathroom accessory, with devotees saying it helps them have more comfortable, effective bowel movements. ""The purpose is to change the angle and orientation of the rectum to make it more of a straight path to expel stool,"" he says. ""Some people find when they raise their feet six inches, they do have an easier time."" Image: © brizmaker/Getty Images",9,0.32005364,-0.10796879
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-do-i-have-white-spots-on-my-nails,Why do I have white spots on my nails?,1,"Q. My fingernails are sprinkled with tiny white spots. Why do these form? A. These nail spots are a common occurrence — and usually don't signal a serious problem — but it may take some sleuthing to figure out why you've developed them. The most likely cause of white spots on the nails is minor trauma of some sort, whether from a rough manicure involving filing and cuticle cutting or excessive tapping of the hands and fingers on a hard surface. Sometimes, dry, white areas on the nails form when you leave nail polish on for too long — weeks or longer — which doesn't allow the nail to shed cells normally. A fungal infection could also be the culprit, depositing a white film that may cover a few areas or even all of the nail. Certain more serious conditions can also cause half or more of the nail to appear white. These include low iron levels, kidney disease, or scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). If hand trauma or wearing nail polish for prolonged periods don't seem likely causes of your nail spots, ask your doctor for her assessment. Letting the spots disappear on their own could be a lengthy process, since it can take six or more months for fingernails to grow out. Image: © Nadya So/Getty Images",9,0.06779198,-0.067744166
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/uk-study-confirms-mediterranean-lifestyle-benefits,UK study confirms Mediterranean lifestyle benefits,1,"Living a Mediterranean lifestyle — eating a particular diet and getting enough sleep and physical and social activity — has been linked over and over to reduced risks for chronic disease and early death. But most studies have involved people in Mediterranean countries, such as Spain. Now an observational study published online Aug. 8, 2023, by Mayo Clinic Proceedings suggests what experts have long suspected: the lifestyle has benefits for people living in other parts of the world, too. Researchers, including some from Harvard, analyzed diet assessments and self-reported lifestyle habits of about 111,000 people (ages 40 to 75) in England, Wales, and Scotland. Participants were followed for up to nine years. People who adhered most closely to a Mediterranean lifestyle had a 28% lower risk of dying from cancer and a 29% lower risk of dying prematurely from any cause, compared with people whose lifestyles were most different from the Mediterranean pattern. The authors say the findings indicate that people outside Mediterranean countries can use their own locally available products to follow a Mediterranean-style eating pattern, which emphasizes olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish, poultry, cheese, and wine; and limited portions of red or processed meats.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/does-poor-sleep-diminish-the-cognitive-benefits-of-exercise,Does poor sleep diminish the cognitive benefits of exercise?,1,"Getting at least 150 minutes of exercise each week (such as brisk walking) is crucial to keeping your memory and thinking skills sharp. Exercise promotes the birth of new brain cells and increases the production of enzymes that break down amyloid proteins associated with dementia. Sleep also plays a role in cognitive health, flushing those amyloid proteins out of the brain. The right amount of sleep is so important that a lack of Z's may sabotage the cognitive perks of exercise, according to a study published July 2023 in The Lancet Healthy Longevity. Researchers evaluated the periodic memory test results and self-reported sleep and exercise habits of almost 9,000 dementia-free people (ages 50 and older) who were followed over 10 years. Among people who started the study at age 50 or 60 and reported the highest rates of exercise, those who said they got less than six hours of sleep per night had faster rates of cognitive decline than those who said they got six to eight hours of sleep per night. For people who started the study at age 70 and reported high rates of exercise, the amount of sleep they got didn't seem to affect their rate of cognitive decline. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that poor sleep quashes the brain benefits of exercise. Image: © TheGoodBrigade/Getty Images",6,0.32473946,-0.35347474
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-a-healthy-gut-helps-your-heart,How a healthy gut helps your heart,1,"Your gut microbiome — a collection of trillions of microorganisms inhabiting your intestinal tract — has wide-ranging effects on your health. Your unique mix of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses reflects your genes, your age, the medications you take — but most of all, what you eat. Over the past two decades, numerous studies have explored how gut microbes and their breakdown products (metabolites) affect factors linked with heart disease. For the most part, the findings support the same basic advice health experts recommend: Follow a mostly plant-based eating pattern, and cut back on highly processed foods. Doing so can help promote a more diverse, healthier microbiome. ""The standard American diet — appropriately called SAD — features a lot of processed foods that are high in sugar, artificial sweeteners, and unhealthy fats,"" says Dr. Uma Naidoo, director of nutritional and metabolic psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. This nutrient-poor diet can lead to dysbiosis, an overgrowth of harmful microbes. When bad microbes thrive in the gut, they form pro-inflammatory breakdown products and toxins, Dr. Naidoo explains. The resulting low-grade, bodywide inflammation contributes to obesity, poor mental health, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Animal vs. plant-based foods One metabolite of interest is trimethylamine (TMA), which is created when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). While some research suggests a link between TMAO and artery-clogging plaque, the evidence isn't consistent. Still, the advice to limit red meat consumption — the main source of TMA in the diet — makes sense. But according to Dr. Naidoo, there's no need to avoid those animal-based foods, which most Americans aren't especially keen on doing. Instead, people should focus more on what they're not eating — namely, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Fermented foods Eating fermented foods may help dampen inflammation in the body. When shopping, look for the words ""contains live cultures"" when choosing yogurt or kefir, a yogurtlike drink with a tart flavor and a thinner consistency than yogurt. While both products are usually made with dairy milk, they also come in nondairy versions made from almond, coconut, or oat milk. Another beverage, kombucha, is a fizzy, tart, slightly sweet drink made from fermented tea that's often flavored with fruits and herbs. Look for brands without added sugar. For fermented products made from vegetables, look in the refrigerated section and check for the words ""naturally fermented"" on the label. When you open the jar, check for telltale bubbles in the liquid, which signal that live organisms are inside. Most supermarket pickles are preserved with vinegar and not made with a natural fermentation process using water and salt. For sauerkraut (pickled cabbage), choose raw or nonpasteurized products. If you're a fan of spicy food, try kimchi, a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish from Korea made with a mix of garlic, salt, vinegar, and chili peppers. From Japan, there's miso (a strong, salty paste made from soybeans fermented with brown rice) and tempeh (a firm, chewy product made from fermented soybeans). Diversify your diet A woefully small percentage of adults — only about 10% — eats the recommended daily amount of fruit (one-and-a-half to two cups) or vegetables (two to three cups). Don't limit yourself to only a few favorites like apples or broccoli, says Dr. Naidoo. ""Eat a wide variety of different fruits and vegetables on a regular basis to bring biodiversity to your microbiome,"" she says. Despite a recent uptick, whole grains make up less than 16% of the average American's total grain intake. Whole grains such as oats, quinoa, spelt, and barley are healthier choices than most ""whole-wheat"" bread, which isn't always made with 100% whole grains. Other foods that promote gut health include beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds. Fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are good sources fermentable or prebiotic fiber, which gets broken down by bacteria in your colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds then circulate through the bloodstream and interact with receptors on cells that quell inflammation. These fatty acids also appear to play a role in keeping blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in check. You can also increase good gut bacteria levels by consuming probiotics, which are found in fermented foods (see box). ""Try adding a little bit of these foods to your meals and then grow from there,"" Dr. Naidoo suggests. Image: © marekuliasz/Getty Images",3,0.39023775,0.20794122
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-you-an-everyday-exerciser-or-a-weekend-warrior,Are you an everyday exerciser or a weekend warrior?,1,"The standard advice about exercise is to do about 30 minutes a day, most days of the week. But in terms of heart-related benefits, does it matter if you rack up most of your exercise minutes over just one or two days instead of spreading them out over an entire week? Earlier research has suggested that both patterns are equally beneficial. But those findings relied on people to self-report their exercise, which can be unreliable. Now, a study of nearly 90,000 adults who used wristband monitors to record their physical activity has reached a similar conclusion. ""The findings add to the body of literature showing that it doesn't matter when you get your exercise, as long as you get the recommended amount each week,"" says Dr. I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert on the role of physical activity in preventing disease. Volume matters more than pattern The study, published July 18, 2023, in JAMA, doesn't define the term ""weekend warrior"" in quite the same way as most people do, says Dr. Lee. ""Usually, weekend warriors are seen as people who don't exercise on weekdays but then take a long hike or play two hours of tennis on Saturday or Sunday,"" she says. Instead, researchers used participants' physical activity data, which were recorded over seven consecutive days, to categorize them into different groups. About two-thirds of them met the federal physical activity guidelines (see ""How much exercise?""). About 42% were deemed ""weekend warriors,"" meaning they met the guidelines but got half or more of their total physical activity — not just exercise — on just one or two days. Another 24% were ""regularly active,"" meeting the guidelines with activity spread out over the week. The remaining 34% didn't meet the guidelines. After roughly six years, the researchers found that participants who followed either activity pattern had a similarly lower risk of heart attack, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure compared with people in the inactive group. Historically, experts have encouraged people to be regularly active, mainly because anecdotal reports suggest that weekend warriors may be more prone to injuries. But this study didn't find any difference in injury rates between the two active groups. That's likely because of the definition used in the study: the ""warrior"" group wasn't necessarily doing the types of high-intensity activities or sports often associated with muscle sprains and related injuries, Dr. Lee says. Best time of day to exercise? Whatever works for you Are there any pros or cons associated with exercising at certain times of the day? Research results are all over the map, says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. I-Min Lee. The best strategy is to exercise when it's most convenient and comfortable for you, whether that's the first thing in the morning, early evening, or anytime in between. If you exercise early in the day, you can check it off your to-do list and can take advantage of the ""feel-good"" brain chemicals, serotonin and dopamine, that are released during exercise. But afternoon workouts also have some benefits. Your joints and muscles may be more limber later in the day, which may make exercise feel less taxing. If you experience a midafternoon lull, exercise can be a good way to reinvigorate yourself. If you can, find a buddy who likes to exercise at the same time, so you can go together and hold each other accountable. Likewise, there's little evidence to suggest that coordinating your exercise with respect to mealtimes has any good or bad effects. Some people find that vigorous exercise right before a meal curbs their appetite, while others find the opposite is true. A pre-breakfast workout works well for certain people. But having a small, carbohydrate-rich snack (like a banana or a slice of whole-grain toast) at least half an hour before exercising may provide a helpful energy boost, says Dr. Lee. Short bouts of activity count Wristband devices enable researchers to capture all the short bouts of activity people do throughout the day that they may not remember. ""If you do jumping jacks occasionally while watching television, you won't necessarily recall that activity the way you remember that you play tennis three times a week,"" says Dr. Lee. Similarly, people whose daily commutes include a few 10-minute bouts of walking may not consider that as counting toward their moderate-intensity activity minutes. But these small spurts of activity — sometimes referred to as exercise ""snacks"" — seem to be beneficial. If you're sitting for a long stretch, stand up and move around for a few minutes every hour. Activating your muscles even just briefly can help improve your body's ability to keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol in check. It's also worth noting that if you don't meet the physical activity guidelines, you'll still benefit from doing even small amounts of exercise — and every minute counts.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/saturated-fat-how-much-is-okay,Saturated fat: How much is okay?,1,"Q. I was very interested in the May 2023 Heart Letter feature about Dr. Ludwig's research, which suggests that eating fewer carbohydrates and more protein and fat can help with weight loss and lead to better health outcomes. But his menus and recipes include foods that contain saturated fat, such as meat and full-fat dairy products. For many years, we heard from reputable sources that we should aways limit saturated fat. This is very confusing! Can you explain? A. You're right about advice to limit saturated fat in your diet, which stems from the fact that eating too much saturated fat tends to raise levels of harmful LDL cholesterol. But not everyone agrees on what the limit should be. The American Heart Association advises a limit of 5% to 6% of your daily calories, while the Dietary Guidelines for Americans says 10% is fine. Registered dietitian Kathy McManus, who directs the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, suggests a happy medium of 7%. That happens to be the typical amount of saturated fat in the heart-friendly Mediterranean-style diet. She analyzed the nutrient composition of the sample menu in the feature you referenced (""Cut calories or carbohydrates for better heart health?"" in the May 2023 Heart Letter). The three meals and snack include about 1,900 calories, which is just below the 2,000 daily calories recommended for the average woman. About 12% of the calories in Dr. Ludwig's sample menu are from saturated fat, which isn't too much higher than the Dietary Guidelines limit of 10%. Also, a 1.3-ounce piece of dark chocolate contains about eight grams of saturated fat, which is close to one-third of the 25 total grams of saturated fat in this menu. If you omitted the chocolate, the saturated fat in this sample menu would be around 8% of the total calories. But here's the thing: Most people don't want to spend time calculating their calories or saturated fat, which is why McManus and many other nutrition experts recommend focusing more on eating mostly whole or minimally processed foods, which is also one of Dr. Ludwig's main messages. As she notes, his menu doesn't include refined, processed carbohydrates like white rice, white bread, sugary drinks, or other sweets. Muffins, cookies, pie, and other baked goods often contain quite a bit of saturated fat because they're made with butter, lard, vegetable shortening, or tropical oils such as palm or palm kernel oil. Finally, although dark chocolate has saturated fat, it also contains heart-protecting plant compounds known as flavanols, which appear to outweigh the risk from saturated fat, according to nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Image: © fcafotodigital/Getty Images",3,0.3522139,0.16916944
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-sleep-do-you-actually-need-202310302986,How much sleep do you actually need?,1,"On average, how many hours do you sleep each night? For most healthy adults, guidelines suggest at least seven hours of slumber. But these are general recommendations and not strict rules. ""Some people need less than seven hours, while others might need more,"" says Eric Zhou with the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Do you need more or less sleep time? We get it: you know people who swear they only need five hours of sleep per night, yet you feel foggy unless you log in eight to nine hours. The major reason for individual differences is that we often look at sleep the wrong way. ""Instead of focusing exclusively on the number of hours we sleep per night, we should also consider our sleep quality,"" says Zhou. Sleep quality means how well you sleep during the night. Did you sleep straight through? Or did you have periods where you woke up? If so, did it take you a long time to fall asleep? How did you feel when you woke up? ""If you awaken refreshed and feel like you have the energy to get through your day, then I would worry less about the exact number of hours you're sleeping,"" says Zhou. How does sleep quality affect your health? Sleep quality is vital for our overall health. Research has shown that people with poor sleep quality are at a higher risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression. And that's not all. ""Poor sleep also can increase daytime fatigue and make it more difficult to enjoy life,"" says Zhou. Yet it's normal for people's sleep patterns to change over time. ""Many people are not going to sleep in their 50s and 60s exactly like they did in their 20s,"" says Zhou. Many of these changes are age-related. For instance, your circadian rhythm — which regulates many bodily functions, including our sleep-wake cycle — can naturally get disrupted over time. This means people spend less time each night in restorative slow-wave sleep. Production of melatonin, the sleep hormone, also gradually declines with age. ""As a result of these changes, when we get older we may start to wake up earlier than we did when we were younger, or wake up more frequently during the night,"" says Zhou. How can you track sleep quality? How can you better understand the factors likely contributing to your sleep quality? One way is to keep a sleep diary where you track and record your sleep. Every day, record the time you went to bed, how long it took you to fall asleep, whether you had any nighttime awakenings (and if so, how long you were awake), and at what time you woke up. Also, keep track of how you feel upon awakening and at the end of the day. ""After a week or two, review the information to see if you can identify certain patterns that may be affecting your sleep quality, then make adjustments,"" says Zhou. For example, if you have trouble falling asleep, go to bed half an hour later than usual but maintain the same wake-up time. ""It is common for people struggling with their sleep to try to get more sleep by staying in bed longer, but this disrupts their sleep patterns and diminishes their sleep quality,"" says Zhou. Three key strategies to support the quality of your sleep Other strategies that can help support good sleep quality include: maintaining a consistent wake time, especially on weekends limiting daytime naps to 20 to 30 minutes, and at least six hours before the desired bedtime being physically active. When it comes to sleep quality, consistency is vital. ""People with good sleep quality often have a predictable sleep window where their sleep occurs,"" says Zhou. ""Good sleepers are likely to sleep around the same number of hours and stay asleep through the night."" The bottom line on getting restful sleep It's unrealistic to expect perfect sleep every night. ""If you have trouble sleeping one or two nights during the week, that can be related to the natural ebbs and flows of life,"" says Zhou. ""You may have eaten a big meal that day, drank too much alcohol while watching football, or had a stressful argument with someone. When tracking sleep quality, look at your overall sleep health week-to-week, not how you slept this Tuesday compared to last Tuesday."" If you are doing all the right things for your sleep but still do not feel rested upon waking, talk to your doctor. This can help you rule out a sleep disorder like sleep apnea, or another health issue that can interfere with sleep such as acid reflux or high blood pressure. Other factors that can affect the quality of your sleep include taking multiple medicines, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and environmental changes like temperature, noise, and light exposure.",6,0.22713651,-0.28892878
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-body-fat-percentage-determine-whether-you-are-overweight,Can body fat percentage determine whether you are overweight?,1,"On call Q. My fitness club recently measured my body fat at 14%. What are the normal ranges for older men, and is body fat percentage a good way to determine a healthy weight? A. A 14% body fat is considered excellent for a healthy male, but it may not indicate a ""healthy"" weight. Body fat percentage, just like weight, depends on multiple factors that can vary per person, such as overall health, metabolism (how your body burns excess calories for energy or stores them as fat), amount of activity, and musculature. Also, where you store body fat has a significant impact on health risks. Even if your weight is close to the normal range, a large waist size may mean you have an unhealthy amount of belly fat (visceral fat). Larger amounts of belly fat increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Therefore, it's possible that you could have a good overall body fat percentage yet still be at higher risk if the fat is concentrated at your waistline. Rather than just relying on one measurement like body fat percentage or body mass index (a calculation based on both weight and height) to determine if you are overweight, I suggest using two measurements: waist size and ratio of waist size to hip size. Waist size. Wrap a measuring tape just above your navel to find your waist size. Ideally men should strive for 35 inches or less. Ratio of waist size to hip size. Measure your hips around the widest part of your buttocks. Then divide your waist size by your hip size. The ideal waist-to-hip ratio for men is 0.9. If your number is higher, you may have too much belly fat. — by Howard LeWine, M.D. Editor in Chief, Harvard Men's Health Watch",3,0.3398081,0.005349025

Connection and cognition Many studies suggest that having strong social networks (friends who support or help you) or taking part in social activities is associated with a reduced risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. For example, a study of more 66,000 people in Europe and Israel (average age 70), published online Oct. 25, 2021, by Ageing & Society, found that people with the highest levels of social connectedness (good friends) and engagement (activities) had the highest scores on cognition tests, compared with people who had the lowest levels of social connectedness and engagement. And an earlier study of 1,100 adults (average age about 80) followed for five years found that the people who were the most socially active had 70% less cognitive decline compared with those who had the lowest rates of social activities. These studies were observational and don't prove conclusively that socializing protects cognition, but we know that it engages the brain in ways that promote better cognition. ""Social activities cause us to use our brains more than almost any other activity,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a neurologist and chief of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at VA Boston Healthcare System. ""All of our senses — vision, hearing, smell — are engaged during social activities. We process people's facial expression, body language, tone of voice, and speech content, and analyze what's being said and the emotions behind the words. In turn, that influences how we react: our facial expression, body language, tone of voice, speech, and actions. Putting the brain to work like that strengthens the connections between brain cells and creates new ones, too."" Other health benefits Beyond cognition, socialization also appears to help with the following aspects of health. Longevity. Being social protects us against loneliness and isolation, which are associated with chronic disease and premature death. Stress reduction. ""People are emotion regulators. When someone you trust listens to you, you can feel your body calm down. Your blood pressure returns to baseline, your levels of stress hormones decrease. It takes us out of 'fight or flight' mode, which can gradually break down the body if we're stressed all the time,"" says Dr. Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Mood. ""The way people react to you reminds you of aspects of yourself, aspects that you may forget. It gets you out of your own head and your worries, and reinforces your sense of being competent. That boosts your mood,"" Dr. Waldinger notes. ""And connecting with people you haven't spoken to in a long time can remind you that you have this history with these people, you belong to this group, and you matter. That also boosts mood."" Reach out to friends All of us tend to lose touch with old friends. People move; circumstances change. But it's worth the effort to have some social interaction in your life, even if it's not in person. How do you get the ball rolling? Dr. Waldinger suggests something low-key. ""Send a card, an email, a text, or a message on Facebook,"" he says. ""You just want to see if someone might reply."" What should you say in the initial contact, especially if it's been a long time? ""Just say you're thinking of the person and want to see how they're doing,"" Dr. Waldinger advises. Other icebreakers include saying you were thinking about how you used to do a particular activity together, or sharing a nice memory of something you both experienced, such as a graduation or a successful project. You might even include a one- or two-sentence update on how you're doing and what you've been up to lately. What happens next? ""See if the person reciprocates,"" Dr. Waldinger says. ""If so, build from there. Ask if the person would like to have coffee or take a walk with you sometime soon. If the person is far away, ask they're available for a catch-up phone call or video chat."" Keep up the connection It may take time to rebuild the closeness or the frequency of contact you once had with a friend, if that's what you both want. So be patient, and keep reaching out to the person. How much contact will it take to boost your cognition and health? ""We don't have an amount of social connection that is 'enough' or a lower amount that is 'not enough.' Studies suggest that more is better, and some is better than none for improving your thinking and memory,"" Dr. Budson says. So why not rekindle several friendships? If they bring you joy, and if they offer important, healthy side effects, then you have nothing to lose and much to gain. Image: © FatCamera/Getty Images",1,0.17112674,-0.23812507
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-bitter-truth-about-added-sugar,The bitter truth about added sugar,1,"Extra sugar can cause big health problems. Here's how you can reduce your intake. There's a good chance you eat way too much sugar every day — and don't even know it. American adults consume an average of 77 grams (almost 20 teaspoons) of sugar per day, which adds up to around 60 pounds of added sugar per year, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Added sugar refers to sugars and syrups that are included in food products and beverages to increase sweetness and texture and extend shelf life. (This is different from natural sugar found in fruit, vegetables, and dairy.) A little extra sugar may seem harmless, but ingested often, it can contribute to a variety of health issues, like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. ""There's consistent evidence that all that excessive added sugar intake is a significant threat to one's health,"" says Dr. Qi Sun, an associate professor of nutrition at Harvard-affiliated T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Where the sugar is Sugar-sweetened drinks are the largest source of added sugar in the American diet. They include any of the following: regular soda juice drinks, like fruit punch and juice cocktails energy drinks sports drinks sweet tea sweetened coffee drinks Whole (100%) juices, which contain only the sugars from the extracted fruit or vegetable are healthier, but you don't get the benefits of fiber and other natural ingredients as you do in whole fruit. Many food products also contain high amounts of added sugar, even if they are not always sweet-tasting. The most common are fruit-flavored yogurt, breakfast cereals, processed instant meals, soups, tomato sauces, snacks, and cured meats. Another source of added sugar is condiments, such as ketchup, relish, barbecue sauce, and salad dressings. Look closer at food labels Added sugars are identified on a product's ingredient label. They often are called by names other than ""sugar."" Here are the ones you should look for, according to the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015–2020: agave nectar brown sugar cane crystals cane sugar corn sweetener corn syrup crystalline fructose dextrose evaporated cane juice fructose fruit juice concentrates glucose honey invert sugar lactose malt sugar malt syrup maltose maple syrup molasses raw sugar sucrose Too much is too much Research has found that too much added sugar can affect your health in many ways. For instance, a study published online Sept. 3, 2019, by JAMA Internal Medicine looked at more than 450,000 people over a 16-year period and found that those who drank two or more 8-ounce glasses of sugar-sweetened soda a day had a higher risk of dying for any reason than people who drank less than a glass each month. Drinking large amounts of artificially sweetened sodas was also associated with earlier death. Consuming too much sugar also can increase chronic inflammation. And higher sugar consumption has also been linked to a higher risk of frailty as we age. A study in the May 2018 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that older adults who consumed more than 36 grams per day of added sugar were more likely to become frail compared with those who consumed less than 15 grams daily. One of the biggest threats from added sugar is weight gain. Your body doesn't know the difference between natural sugar and added sugar. They both get processed the same way. The important difference is how fast the body digests them. ""Foods with natural sugar — fruits and vegetables — also contain soluble fiber, which means your body digests the accompanying sugars more slowly,"" says Dr. Sun. In comparison, added sugar lacks fiber, so it's absorbed much faster. ""This can cause blood sugar levels to spike, leading to an insulin surge, which can increase hunger,"" says Dr. Sun. Substitutes for sugar Another way to avoid added sugar is to switch it out for other sweeteners. Add whole or frozen fruit to cereal or oatmeal, tea, and yogurt. Also, try antioxidant-rich spices like ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Manage your intake The AHA suggests men consume no more than 36 grams (about 9 teaspoons) of added sugar per day. This is approximately equal to what's in a 12-ounce can of soda. The best ways to control your intake of added sugar are to read food labels and cut out sugar-sweetened beverages, suggests Dr. Sun. ""For labels, note the number of grams of sugar per serving and the total number of servings,"" he says. ""The label might say 5 grams of sugar per serving, but you might eat three or four servings, so you end up consuming a lot more added sugar."" A good rule is to choose products that have less than 10 grams per serving and to monitor how many servings you eat. Instead of buying sugar-sweetened beverages, make your own healthier versions. Begin with plain or sparkling water and then add slices of fresh fruit or an ounce or two of 100% fruit juice for flavor. Image: © OcusFocus/Getty Images",3,0.38011995,0.06893124
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-certain-types-of-sugars-healthier-than-others-2019052916699,Are certain types of sugars healthier than others?,1,"Most people consume many different types of sugars from a variety of foods and beverages in their diet. A high intake of sugar is linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. But whether some sugars are healthier (or worse) than others remains a question of interest to many. Sugar basics Sugar provides energy that our cells need to survive. Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, a macronutrient that provides energy (in the form of calories) from foods and beverages we consume. Carbohydrates are classified into two subtypes of sugar: monosaccharides, or ""simple sugars"" (consisting of one molecule),` and disaccharides (two molecules). The monosaccharides include glucose, fructose, and galactose. The major disaccharides include sucrose (one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule), lactose (one glucose molecule and one galactose molecule), and maltose (two glucose molecules). Fructose, glucose, and sucrose are found naturally in fruit and some vegetables, while lactose is found in dairy and maltose is found in germinating grains. Fructose and glucose are also found naturally in honey, as well as in common table sugar. Added versus natural sugars An increasingly important distinction among sugars as they pertain to health is whether they occur naturally in foods such as fruit, vegetables, and dairy, or whether they are added sugars (added to foods and beverages during manufacturing, processing, or preparation). Sugary beverages are the greatest source of added sugar in the diet, followed by sweets and grains such as ready-to-eat cereals. Intake of added sugar, particularly from beverages, has been associated with weight gain and higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Natural and added sugars are metabolized the same way in our bodies. But for most people, consuming natural sugars in foods such as fruit is not linked to negative health effects, since the amount of sugar tends to be modest and is ""packaged"" with fiber and other healthful nutrients. On the other hand, our bodies do not need, or benefit from, eating added sugar. Are all added sugars created equal? Added sugars come from a variety of sources and go by many different names, yet they are all a source of extra calories and are metabolized by the body the same way. A common misconception exists that some added sugars such as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) are unhealthy, while others such as agave nectar (from the succulent plant) are healthy. The reality is that most added sugars are composed of glucose and fructose in varying ratios. For example, sucrose (common table sugar) is 50% glucose and 50% fructose; the most common form of HFCS (which is produced from corn starch through industrial processing) contains 45% glucose and 55% fructose; and some types of agave nectar contain up to 90% fructose and 10% glucose. Whether an added sugar contains more or less fructose versus glucose has little impact on health. Some types of added sugar — honey, for example — may also contain micronutrients or other bioactive compounds. But these properties have little benefit when it comes to metabolic health. In short, it's best to limit all sources of added sugar to within the recommended intake level. For most people, one type of sugar isn't better than another.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sleep-paralysis-causes-symptoms-and-treatments,"Sleep paralysis: Causes, symptoms, and treatments",1,"For many people, sleep paralysis is a distressing condition affecting their sleep and emotional health. While there is still much to learn about sleep paralysis, understanding the source of sleep paralysis symptoms can help with treatment and prevention. What is sleep paralysis? Sleep paralysis is a temporary sense of paralysis that occurs between stages of wakefulness and sleep. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you are conscious but unable to move or speak. One of the primary differences between sleep paralysis and other sleep states such as dreaming and nightmares is that you are awake during an episode of sleep paralysis. Types of sleep paralysis There are two types of sleep paralysis: Isolated sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis is isolated when it appears without any other signs of narcolepsy or other sleep disorders. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder in which a person may frequently fall into sudden episodes of deep sleep at any time. Recurrent sleep paralysis. This condition involves multiple sleep paralysis episodes over time. Recurrent sleep paralysis can be associated with narcolepsy. In many cases, both types of sleep paralysis occur together. In this case, you may experience recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (RISP). RISP involves ongoing instances of sleep paralysis without an association with narcolepsy. When does sleep paralysis typically occur? Sleep paralysis usually occurs when falling asleep waking from sleep at both times. Sleep paralysis is considered a parasomnia, or an abnormal behavior that occurs during sleep. Because it is linked to the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of the sleep cycle, sleep paralysis is considered a REM parasomnia. During REM, the eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming occurs, but the muscles of the body are relaxed to reduce movement. This muscle relaxation is controlled by the brain and called REM atonia. The purpose of atonia is to keep you from acting out your dreams, and typically ends when you wake up. However, during sleep paralysis you wake up suddenly from REM, regaining awareness even as your muscles are still relaxed, in atonia. For this reason, sleep paralysis may feel like temporary paralysis. In addition to atonia, the mental imagery of REM sleep also seems to persist even as you are in an aware state. How long does sleep paralysis last? An episode of sleep paralysis can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The episode usually ends on its own, or when someone moves or touches you or speaks to you. Making an intense effort to move can also end an episode. What does an episode of sleep paralysis feel like? An episode of sleep paralysis often involves hallucinations that can be frightening or cause anxiety. Hallucinations during sleep paralysis fall into three categories. Intruder hallucinations involve a sense of evil or a disturbing presence in the room, such as a bedroom intruder. Chest pressure hallucinations describe a sense of pressure on the chest, often accompanied by sensations of being choked or suffocated. Vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations can include feelings of movement, such as flying or out-of-body sensations. Can you die from sleep paralysis? Sleep paralysis can be frightening and can cause emotional distress for some people. However, it usually does not happen frequently enough to cause significant health effects, and is not a serious medical risk on its own. People who experience recurrent or frightening episodes may develop unhealthy sleep habits to avoid sleep, leading to sleep deprivation. This can have negative effects on a person's health. Symptoms of sleep paralysis Sleep paralysis may involve such symptoms as: inability to move the arms, legs, body, and head when falling asleep or waking up inability to speak full awareness of what is happening hallucinations. Episodes last from a few seconds to a few minutes, and may occur once in a person's life or repeatedly over their lifetime. What causes sleep paralysis? While the exact cause of sleep paralysis is not understood, research has linked certain sleep habits to the condition: inadequate sleep an irregular sleep schedule or a sleep schedule that often changes (this is often the case for shift workers) sleeping on your back. In addition, sleep paralysis has also been linked with sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep caused by a problem with the brain's ability to regulate sleep. some mental conditions, such as bipolar disorder, PTSD, or panic or anxiety disorders use of certain medicines, such as for ADHD substance use alcohol use. Many people report stressful events or an emotional experience preceding the episodes. In addition, research suggests there may be a genetic predisposition to this condition. How is sleep paralysis diagnosed? Sleep paralysis can affect men and women. It can be seen at any age, though it tends to first appear in the teen years. After appearing during the teenage years, episodes can occur more frequently in later years. If you experience episodes of sleep paralysis that make you feel anxious or if you have repeated episodes of sleep paralysis, speak with your doctor. It is possible that sleep paralysis may be due to another medical problem that needs further attention. To learn more about how sleep paralysis is affecting your health, your doctor may ask about your symptoms, sleep habits, and factors that affect your sleep. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your sleep, or even complete a sleep diary to help identify sleeping patterns. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may refer you to a sleep specialist for further diagnosis, testing, and treatment. Your doctor may have you do a sleep study called a polysomnography. In this procedure, small wafer-thin electrodes and other sensors are pasted on specific body sites to take a variety of readings during the night. The sensors will record muscle activity, movements, breathing, blood oxygen level, heart rate, and rhythm. Readings are collected on a single printout (called a polysomnogram) and analyzed by a technician and physician. If a breathing problem is detected early on, you may be awakened and given treatment, such as PAP, during the second half of the night. This allows the sleep experts to monitor how well the treatment works for you. Your doctor may also want you to take one or more daytime sleep tests as well. One test, called a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), measures how long it takes you to drift off while lying down in a quiet room. The procedure is usually repeated four or five times during the day at two-hour intervals. The test also determines what stages of sleep you experience during a brief nap. MSLT can help to show if your sleep paralysis is a sign of narcolepsy. Falling asleep within eight minutes each time indicates extreme sleepiness. A person who enters REM sleep very quickly (within about 20 minutes) during two or more naps may also have narcolepsy. How to prevent sleep paralysis If you experience occasional sleep paralysis, one of the best ways to prevent sleep paralysis episodes is to improve the quality of your sleep. Try any of these sleep hygiene techniques to help improve sleep quality and prevent sleep paralysis: Get adequate sleep. Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per night on a regular basis. Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at consistent times every day, including on weekends. Create an ideal sleep environment. Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet. Ensure your mattress and pillow suit your body's needs. Choose a pillow that keeps your neck and head naturally in alignment. Your mattress needs will depend on the level of firmness that feels best to your body. Memory foam mattresses boast the benefit of molding to your body's pressure points. Reduce distractions. Avoid using electronic devices before going to bed. Relax before bed by taking a bath, reading, or listening to soothing music. Try new sleeping positions if you sleep on your back. Sleep experts have found a correlation between sleeping on your back and sleep paralysis. Do what you can to ease stress in your life, especially just before bedtime. Curb substance use: avoid alcohol intake, especially in the evening, and steer clear of nicotine altogether. Reduce caffeine intake. If you can't or don't want to give up caffeine, avoid it after 2 p.m. If you are diagnosed with narcolepsy or another sleep disorder, a sleep doctor will work with you to find a treatment plan for your disorder. If you are diagnosed with a mental health condition such as anxiety or bipolar disorder, your doctor will oversee your ongoing treatment with medication and behavioral therapy to help treat your mental health condition. Treating your underlying mental health condition may help resolve sleep paralysis. Be sure to see your doctor if sleep paralysis routinely stops you from getting a good night's sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/eat-these-fruits-for-their-anti-inflammatory-benefits,Eat these fruits for their anti-inflammatory benefits,1,"They're nature's original desserts. And naturally sweet fruits are essential in protecting our bodies from disease. Eating at least one-and-a-half to two cups of diverse fruits every day can boost antioxidant activity. Fruits are particularly abundant in anti-inflammatory compounds, which are important in protecting our bodies from heart disease, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer and bowel disease. How to get enough healthful fruits in your diet? One strategy is to eat with the seasons, choosing grapes and stone fruits in the summer, apples and pears in the fall, persimmons and pomegranates in the winter, and citrus and cherries in the spring. While all fruits tend to be rich in disease-protective nutrients, some have received particular attention in the nutrition world for their anti-inflammatory benefits. Berries. From strawberries and blackberries to cranberries and blue­berries, these gemlike fruits are particularly potent in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Along with fiber and vitamin C, berries possess plant pigment phytochemicals, such as anthocyanins and ellagic acid, which may be behind their health benefits. Studies have linked increased berry consumption with lower risks of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Apples. Maybe it's true what they say about an apple a day. A study of nearly 35,000 women, found that consumption of this fruit — along with its relative, pears — was linked with a lower risk of death from heart disease. The star components of apples — fiber, vitamin C, pectin, and polyphenols — have been associated, primarily in animal studies, with anti-inflammatory effects and an increase in beneficial microbes in the gut. Stone fruits. Cherries, peaches, apricots, and plums are all examples of stone fruits. These fruits contain fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and a variety of phytochemicals associated with their colors. For example, cherries have garnered the lion's share of the research among stone fruits. Some studies suggest that cherries can reduce pain and soreness after exercise as well as a reduced risk of gout attacks. The high levels of phenolic compounds in cherries, which have been linked to reduced inflammation, may be behind those benefits. Citrus. Oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes are famously rich in vitamin C. They also contain fiber, potassium, calcium, B vitamins, copper, and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals such as flavonoids and carotenoids. Though there is little human research on citrus, the nutrients found in citrus fruits have been associated with heart-protective effects. Pomegranates. Those tiny pomegranate seeds contain big rewards of vitamins C and K, potassium, fiber, and potent phytochemicals such as anthocyanin and resveratrol. These nutrients may be behind the potential benefits of eating pomegranates. Grapes. These succulent fruits are burst­ing with fiber, vitamins C and K, and powerful phytochemicals.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/healthy-lifestyle-can-prevent-diabetes-and-even-reverse-it-2018090514698,Healthy lifestyle can prevent diabetes (and even reverse it),1,"The rate of type 2 diabetes is increasing around the world. Type 2 diabetes is a major cause of vision loss and blindness, kidney failure requiring dialysis, heart attacks, strokes, amputations, infections, and even early death. Over 80% of people with prediabetes (that is, high blood sugar with the high risk for developing full-blown diabetes) don't know it. And one in four people who have full-blown diabetes don't know they have it. Research suggests that a healthy lifestyle can prevent diabetes from occurring in the first place — and even reverse its progress. Can a healthy diet and lifestyle prevent diabetes? The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large, long-term study, asked the question: we know an unhealthy diet and lifestyle can cause type 2 diabetes, but can adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle prevent it? This answer is yes: the vast majority of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be prevented through diet and lifestyle changes, and this has been proven by 20 years of medical research. Researchers from the DPP took people at risk for type 2 diabetes and gave them a 24-week diet and lifestyle intervention, a medication (metformin), or a placebo (a fake pill), to see if anything could lower their risk for developing diabetes. The very comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention had the goal of changing participants' daily habits, and included: 16 classes teaching basic nutrition and behavioral strategies for weight loss and physical activity; lifestyle coaches with frequent contact with participants; supervised physical activity sessions; and good clinical support for reinforcing an individualized plan. Perhaps not surprisingly, the diet and lifestyle intervention was incredibly effective. After three years, the diet and lifestyle group had a 58% lower risk of developing diabetes than the placebo group. Participants ages 60 and older had an even better response, with a whopping 71% lower risk of developing diabetes. The diet and lifestyle effect lasted: even after 10 years, those folks had a 34% lower risk of developing diabetes compared to placebo. Men, women, and all racial and ethnic groups had similar results (and almost half of participants represented racial and ethnic minorities). These results are not surprising to me or to other doctors, because we have all seen patients with prediabetes or diabetes get their sugars down with diet, exercise, and weight loss alone. Meanwhile, the medication group had a 31% lower risk of diabetes after three years, and an 18% lower risk after 10 years, which is also significant. It's perfectly all right to use medications along with diet and lifestyle changes, because each boosts the effect of the other. Studies looking at the combination of medication (metformin) with diet and lifestyle changes have shown an even stronger result. Dietary recommendations to prevent diabetes (and even reverse it) Decrease intake of added sugars and processed foods, including refined grains like white flour and white rice. This especially includes sugary drinks, not only sodas but also juices. The best drinks are water, seltzer, and tea or coffee without sugar. Swap out refined grains for whole grains. Whole grains are actually real grains that haven't been stripped of nutrients in processing. Foods made from 100% whole grain (like whole wheat) are okay, but intact whole grains (like farro, quinoa, corn, oatmeal, and brown rice) are even better. Increase fiber intake. High-fiber foods include most vegetables and fruits. Legumes are also high in fiber and healthy plant protein. Legumes include lentils, beans, chickpeas, peas, edamame, and soy. People who eat a lot of high-fiber foods tend to eat fewer calories, weigh less, and have a lower risk of diabetes. Increase fruit and vegetable intake. At least half of our food intake every day should be nonstarchy fruits and vegetables, the more colorful the better. Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, and high-fiber fruits like berries of all kinds, are especially healthy. Eat less meat, and avoid processed red meat. Many studies have shown us that certain meats are incredibly risky for us. People who eat processed red meat are far more likely to develop diabetes: one serving a day (which is two slices of bacon, two slices of deli meat, or one hot dog) is associated with over a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Eating even a small portion of red meat daily (red meat includes beef, lamb, and pork), like a palm-sized piece of steak, is associated with a 20% increased risk of type 2 diabetes. In fact, the less meat you eat, the lower your risk of diabetes. People who don't eat red meat at all, but do eat chicken, eggs, dairy, and fish, may significantly lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes, by about 30%; those who eat only fish, 50%; those who eat only eggs and dairy, 60%; those who are vegan, 80%. Eat healthier fats. Fat is not necessarily bad for you. What kind of fat you're eating really does matter. Saturated fats, particularly from meats, are associated with an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. Plant oils, such as extra-virgin olive oil and canola oil, carry less risk. Omega-3 fats, like in walnuts, flax seeds, and some fish, are actually quite good for you. Diet and lifestyle changes that can help prevent diabetes The CDC's Diabetes Prevention Program, used in many clinics, is a free tool to help you learn and stick with the healthy diet, physical activity, and stress management techniques that reduce your risk of diabetes. Another helpful tool is the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Nutrition Source Healthy Eating Plate, which shows you what your daily food intake should look like: half fruits and vegetables, about a quarter whole grains, and a quarter healthy proteins (plant protein is ideal here), with some healthy fats and no-sugar-added beverages.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-skin-creams-are-most-effective-for-eczema-202310122981,Which skin creams are most effective for eczema?,1,"Quelling the discomfort of atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, can be a daily quest. This inflamed, itchy skin condition can interfere with sleeping, socializing, and many other activities. If home remedies such as gentle cleansing and regular moisturizing don't provide relief, your doctor might recommend a prescription treatment to apply to your skin. Which prescription cream is most effective? A new study boils it down to a few overall winners. What is atopic dermatitis and the itch-scratch cycle? Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The areas commonly affected include the face, hands, feet, or the skin folds of the elbows or behind the knees. We don't know exactly what causes atopic dermatitis. Genes, the environment, and an overactive immune system all seem to play a role in creating inflammation, which feels itchy. Scratching the itch creates more irritation and inflammation, which causes more itching. As the itch-scratch cycle continues, the rash gets worse. The skin might tear, ooze, and crust over, which can be painful. Which skin treatments were more effective in the study? Some prescription topical skin treatments for atopic dermatitis are more effective than others, according to a 2023 study published online by The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Scientists evaluated more than 200 randomized trials involving more than 43,000 people with atopic dermatitis (average age 18). The researchers compared almost 70 different prescription creams or ointments, which are broadly called topical treatments and are designed to be applied to affected areas of skin. These treatments fall into five categories. If you have eczema, their generic names may or may not be familiar to you, but your medical team is likely to know them well: topical corticosteroids, divided into seven classes ranging from the most to the least potent, decrease the release of an inflammatory chemical called phospholipase A2 topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors interrupt inflammatory signals as they enter cells topical PDE4 inhibitors raise the production of a chemical called phosphodiesterase-4, or PDE4, and lower the body's inflammatory response topical calcineurin inhibitors help suppress the production of chemical messengers that tell the body to ramp up its defenses other topical treatments, including antibiotics and prescription moisturizers. Researchers looked at which medications had outcomes important to patients, including which were best at improving quality of life were best at reducing eczema-related severity, itch, sleep disturbances, or flare-ups caused the fewest serious side effects were discontinued least often due to serious side effects. Which atopic dermatitis medications proved to be most effective? The study yielded some predictable results and a surprise. The overall winners were two calcineurin inhibitors: pimecrolimus (Elidel) and tacrolimus (Protopic) moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, a large group that includes fluocinolone acetonide (Synalar cream 0.025%) and triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog cream/ointment 0.1%). What did these medications improve? Pimecrolimus improved six of seven outcomes, and was among the best at reducing sleep disturbances and eczema flares. High-dose tacrolimus (0.1%) improved five outcomes, and was among the best at reducing itch and eczema flares. Moderate-potency steroids improved four to six of the seven outcomes, and were best at reducing eczema itch, flares, and serious side effects. ""That's in line with what we often prescribe,"" says Dr. Connie Shi, a dermatologist who often treats people with eczema at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""The strongest topical steroids appeared to be the most effective at reducing eczema severity in the study. However, for longer-term maintenance we may consider switching to a moderate-potency steroid, or one of the nonsteroid options, to minimize the risk of thinning the skin, which can occur with long-term use of topical steroids."" The surprise finding: the study found little to no effectiveness from using a topical cream twice daily versus just once daily. ""The traditional advice is twice daily,"" Dr. Shi says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heart-disease-risk-partnering-on-lifestyle-change-can-help-202108042562,Heart disease risk: Partnering on lifestyle change can help,1,"After a heart attack, changing longstanding behaviors that affect heart health can be challenging. Many people have developed habits over 20, 30, or 40 years that are ingrained and can take a significant effort to modify. Does having a partner who is supportive and participatory help? A recent study demonstrated it can. The RESPONSE-2 Trial is a lifestyle intervention study that enrolled patients with coronary artery disease. More than 800 study participants were randomized into either a nurse-coordinated referral of patients and their partners to three widely available community-based lifestyle programs, or to usual care. The community-based intervention programs targeted weight reduction, increasing physical activity, and smoking cessation. Both the intervention and control groups continued to receive visits to their cardiologist, participate in cardiac rehab programs, and attend general counseling sessions on healthy lifestyles, risk factors, and medication adherence. Success was defined as improvement in one of the three risk factors without deterioration in the other two after 12 months. Results showed the proportion of successful patients who improved at least one of the lifestyle risk factors was 37% in the intervention group compared with 26% in the control group. Weight loss was the most successful component, with almost two times the number of patients achieving significant weight loss (at least 5% of starting weight) in the intervention group compared to the control group. Patients whose partner participated in the community-based program had the highest proportion of success. Modifiable lifestyle risk factors for heart disease It is well established that obesity puts you at risk for high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes — all factors that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. By managing your weight through physical activity and healthy eating, you can reduce these risk factors, and thus decrease heart disease risk. How can a partner help? There are many challenges to improving our diet: what we eat, how much we eat, and where we eat, to name a few. What we eat: What is put on the table will translate into what we eat. A partner can develop a shopping list with you to determine what is brought into the house. You can create a menu together that is consistent with healthy eating guidelines. Limiting food brought into the house that is not heart-healthy can play a major role in someone's success. Once food is readily available, it is even more challenging for someone trying to modify their food intake. Making sure there are plenty of vegetables, fresh fruit, and lean protein, along with healthy fats, some low-fat dairy, and whole grains, can contribute to your success. How much we eat: Some people may eat mostly healthy foods, but they eat too much and therefore may struggle with their weight. A partner can help support you in preparing a reasonable amount of food so that there are not many leftovers. When plating food, you and your partner can use the ""balanced plate"" guidelines of 1/2 the plate with lower-calorie vegetables, 1/4 plate with lean protein, and 1/4 plate with whole grains or a healthy starch. Where we eat: Prior to the pandemic, Americans allocated a fair amount of their food dollar to consuming food away from home — as takeout, fast food, and in restaurants. With the shutdown of many establishments in 2020 and early 2021, cooking at home rose significantly. However, now that dining out has reopened, many Americans are resuming pre-pandemic habits. This can result in some meals being higher in overall calories, saturated fat, and sodium than home-cooked meals. A partner can help in the decision regarding how often and where to eat out. In addition, a partner can help choose restaurants where healthy options are readily available. Tips on healthy eating out Don't start out famished. Skipping meals or starving yourself can cause you to overeat! You may also find it difficult to avoid all those tempting foods. Don't feel like you have to eat everything on your plate. Send back what you don't want. Better yet, bring it home in a doggy bag and you'll enjoy the meal twice as much. Avoid nibbling. Listen to your body when it tells you it's full. Have the waiter or wait staff remove extra food from the table. The longer it stays, the more apt you will be to nibble. Eating is not meant to be a race. Eating too fast can lead to overeating, as it takes 20 minutes for your body to know it's full. So, take your time, put your fork down between bites, and focus on the social aspect of eating. Order a la carte. Who says you must order an entree? Make your own. You can choose any combination of appetizers, soups, salads, and side dishes. This allows more variety, and gives you more control over what and how much you eat. Longstanding habits are hard to change, but you can make small changes every day. A partner who is willing and able to support you in the change process may be a helpful resource for your success.",1,0.21924436,-0.18080448
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/handling-hypoglycemia,Handling hypoglycemia,1,"Hypoglycemia is a potentially dangerous condition in which blood sugar falls too low. Too much exercise, too little food or carbohydrates, a missed or delayed meal, or a combination of these factors can bring on hypoglycemia. Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the reaction, but commonly include nervousness sweating feeling cold and clammy trembling or shakiness rapid heartbeat lightheadedness hunger irritability. If early symptoms aren't recognized and treated quickly, blood sugar levels may continue to fall, resulting in drowsiness weakness blurred vision slurred speech confusion clumsiness personality change or strange behavior such as belligerence or silliness. At its worst, hypoglycemia can cause seizures or coma. Most people with type 2 diabetes don't have to worry about hypoglycemia. It may, however, occur in those who use insulin or take a diabetes medication known as a sulfonylurea. Changes in eating habits, such as dieting— especially if carbohydrates are reduced—or increased exercise can lead to hypoglycemia. Talk with your doctor before making any changes in your diet or increasing your exercise. The 15/15 Rule to treat a low blood sugar Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of hypoglycemia, so that if it occurs, you can take steps to treat it appropriately and prevent the problem from recurring. If you think you're having an episode of low blood sugar, don't ignore your symptoms. If possible, test your blood sugar with a finger-stick test. If it is low, follow the 15/15 rule. Eat 15 grams of carbohydrate and wait 15 minutes. Here are some foods that will provide about 15 grams of carbohydrate to lower blood sugar: eat three glucose tablets or four dextrose tablets drink 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice drink 5 to 6 ounces (about half a can) of regular soda, such as Coke or Pepsi eat five to seven Life Savers eat 2 tablespoons raisins eat six jelly beans. Don't eat foods containing chocolate, peanut butter, nuts, or fats. Fat slows the body's absorption of carbohydrates, so foods with fat won't raise your blood sugar quickly enough. After the carbohydrate is eaten, wait about 15 minutes for the sugar to get into your blood. If you do not feel better within 15 minutes, more carbohydrate can be consumed. Your blood sugar should be checked to make sure it has come within a safe range.

The tasty green fruit is great in salads, smoothies, and desserts. And it might have an added bonus of helping to ease chronic constipation, according to a small randomized trial. Scientists asked more than 180 adults (some with constipation, some without) in Italy, Japan, and New Zealand to take part in two four-week courses of treatment. In one regimen, they ate two peeled kiwifruits per day. In the other, they took 7.5 grams of psyllium (a natural ingredient found in fiber supplements such as Metamucil or Fiberall) daily. The order of the two regimens was randomly assigned, and participants took a four-week break in between. The results: both treatments seemed to help constipated participants produce more bowel movements and experience less straining and abdominal pain, with kiwi being slightly more effective than psyllium. Scientists say kiwi contains not only fiber (about 3 grams per half-cup serving), but also raphides (natural needle-shaped crystals), which both help improve bowel function. The findings were published in the June 2023 issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology. Image: © Roman Samokhin/Getty Images",0,0.27146655,0.28483155
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-closer-look-at-alcohols-effect-on-heart-health,A closer look at alcohol's effect on heart health,1,"Along with many major health organizations, the American Heart Association (AHA) warns about the dangers of excessive drinking, which can contribute to high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke. It also discourages people from drinking alcohol to improve their health, although the AHA maintains that moderate drinking (no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks or fewer per day for men) is acceptable. This complex advice stems from conflicting studies about the health effects of light to moderate alcohol consumption. While some research focusing on inherited factors (see ""Using genetics to explore drinking's effects"") has hinted that even light drinking may be harmful, other studies have looked for mechanisms through which moderate drinking could benefit the heart. Limited evidence suggests that alcohol may raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels, boost antioxidant levels, or enhance blood flow. But none of these explanations has proven very convincing. A recent report raised another possibility: reduced stress. You might also be interested in... Harvard Health Publishing’s 6-Week Plan for Healthy Eating This week-by-week plan, The Harvard Medical School 6-Week Plan for Healthy Eating, will help you transform your eating habits into a program of nutritious and delicious food choices that can last a lifetime. Applying the latest results from nutrition science, Harvard experts take you by the hand and guide you to create an eating plan to improve heart health, longevity, energy, and vitality. LEARN MORE Using genetics to explore drinking's effects One well-known problem of observational studies is that they can't prove cause and effect. Light to moderate drinkers tend to be educated and relatively wealthy, which often enables healthy habits and good medical care. Also, people who are ill or taking certain medications are often advised to avoid alcohol. If you compare these abstainers to drinkers, the drinkers appear healthier by comparison, but that's not necessarily due to the alcohol. In an attempt to adjust for these and other confounding factors, researchers have looked at genetic factors that influence alcohol use. But the studies — which found that even small amounts of alcohol might increase heart disease risk — relied on gene variants linked to alcohol use disorder or binge drinking. A predilection to heavy drinking, which has many damaging health effects, isn't necessarily a good way to assess the effects of light to moderate drinking, says Dr. Kenneth Mukamal, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In addition, genetic factors are multifaceted and complex (see ""Genetic profiling for heart disease: An update""). The stress connection A study published in the June 20, 2023, Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that brain scans of people who reported light to moderate drinking showed less activity in the part of the brain that responds to stress, compared with the scans of people who abstained or drank very little. Stress not only raises blood pressure and heart rate but also triggers inflammation that causes plaque buildup, which contributes to heart attacks. The finding is limited by the fact that the brain scans were commonly done for cancer surveillance or diagnosis, says Dr. Ken Mukamal, an internist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who studies how alcohol and other lifestyle factors affect health. ""The stress level of someone in the midst of a cancer workup is likely quite high and may not reflect the typical stress level of an average person,"" he notes. Still, he says it's an intriguing finding that merits further study. In the moment, alcohol can help people feel relaxed, and that's especially true when people drink in social situations. It's possible that light to moderate drinkers have stronger social ties, which in turn provide resilience against stress. The study authors are now focusing on other interventions — such as meditation or exercise — that might lower the brain's stress activity without the potentially harmful effects of alcohol. How is drinking linked to diabetes? A 2022 study showed a link between moderate drinking (eight to 16 drinks per week) and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, but specifically among people who drank alcohol with meals. Many short-term trials that randomly assign people to drink either alcohol or a nonalcoholic beverage show lower blood sugar levels and better insulin sensitivity among people who drink moderate amounts of alcohol. While these biomarkers aren't a perfect representation of diabetes risk, they're pretty close, says Dr. Mukamal. People with diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease as people without the condition. You might also be interested in...

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/hidden-causes-of-weight-gain,Hidden causes of weight gain,1,"The reason for gaining weight isn't always a mystery. For example, you might know you've been eating more and exercising less, a potent combo that often results in extra pounds. But sometimes the cause isn't quite so obvious. And you might not be aware of many of the other factors that can contribute to weight gain. Age-related causes Getting older brings physiological changes that can affect weight. Chief among them is muscle loss. Starting in middle age, we lose about 1% of muscle mass per year, which affects strength and metabolism (how fast we burn calories). ""Smaller muscles use fewer calories. If your diet doesn't change, you'll consume more calories than you need. The excess is stored as fat,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist and co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Here are other age-related changes that can affect weight. Chronic stress. It's harder to manage stress as we get older. And if you're constantly under stress, you might have consistently high levels of the stress hormone cortisol. One job of cortisol is helping the body replenish energy stores. In some people, that might indirectly promote weight gain by increasing appetite (since the body thinks it needs energy) and increasing the storage of unused energy as fat. ""But mostly, stress leads to compulsive behaviors, such as eating 'comfort' foods, which are often full of sugar, unhealthy fat, extra calories, and salt,"" Dr. Apovian says. Poor sleep. Age-related changes affect our ability to sleep well. ""If you're a chronic 'short sleeper,' getting six hours or fewer each night, it might affect hormones that regulate appetite. Short sleep is associated with higher levels of hormones that make us hungry, lower levels of hormones that tell us we're full, and higher levels of cortisol,"" Dr. Apovian says. Sex hormone changes. Older men and women experience reductions in certain sex hormones. In women, low estrogen levels are associated with sleep problems and increased body fat. In men, reduced testosterone levels are linked to less muscle mass. Underlying conditions Weight gain, especially if it's new, can signal a number of health conditions. For example, someone with heart failure might experience weight gain from fluid retention—which might appear as swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, or belly. ""This would likely be accompanied by symptoms such as fatigue or shortness of breath,"" Dr. Apovian says. Other underlying conditions associated with weight gain include diabetes certain kidney diseases sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep) thyroid problems. Medication side effects Taking certain medications regularly can lead to weight gain. Some drugs, such as prednisone, can make you retain fluid and increase your weight. And many medications affect brain chemicals that regulate appetite, which might make you hungrier than usual, so you might eat more and gain weight. Examples include antidepressants such as paroxetine (Paxil) or phenelzine (Nardil) antihistamines that contain the ingredient diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl) antipsychotics such as clozapine (Clozaril) or olanzapine (Zyprexa) beta blockers such as the drug atenolol (Tenormin) or metoprolol (Lopressor) sleep aids that contain the drug diphenhydramine, such as Sominex, Unisom SleepGels, or ZzzQuil. Other potential causes Some potential causes of weight gain aren't yet well understood and are currently being studied. One possibility is late-night eating. Some evidence, including a 2022 Harvard study, suggests that eating late at night might make us hungrier in the daytime, slow metabolism, and increase body fat. Another suspected factor in weight gain is the population of microbes that live in your gut (their genes are called your microbiome). Considerable evidence suggests gut microbes might influence appetite, metabolism, blood sugar, and fat storage. The strongest support comes from studies of animals. In humans, the evidence is less clear. ""Studies have found that the gut microbes of people with obesity are different from those of people who are lean,"" Dr. Apovian explains. ""But we don't know if this causes people to develop obesity. It could be that people who are genetically programmed to gain weight have a certain microbiome,"" she notes. ""Or it could be that people with obesity are eating a different way than lean people are eating, which may change the microbiome. We need more research for better answers."" What you should do Any recent or excessive weight gain warrants a visit to your doctor, who can hunt for new underlying conditions and check if your medications might be influencing your weight. Getting those two aspects of health under control are essential. It might also help to see a dietitian to determine the right calorie intake for your current needs. Beyond that, Dr. Apovian says the best way to control weight as we age is clean living: eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, limited amounts of whole grains and starchy vegetables, and ample amounts of lean protein to help build muscle; avoiding late-night eating; getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night; exercising briskly every day for at least 20 minutes; and strength training at least twice a week. ""You can rebuild muscle,"" Dr. Apovian says, ""but it takes a combination of healthy lifestyle habits to control weight."" Image: © Westend61/Getty Images",3,0.40974137,-0.03740438
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/testosterone-therapy-may-be-safe-for-men-at-risk-for-heart-attack-and-stroke,Testosterone therapy may be safe for men at risk for heart attack and stroke,1,"Does testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) raise men's risk for heart attacks or stroke? A new study suggests not, although with some caveats. Researchers enrolled 5,246 men ages 45 to 80 with testosterone levels of less than 300 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). (Normal levels range from 300 to 1,000 ng/dL.) More than 50% had existing cardiovascular disease, while the others were considered at increased risk because of such factors as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and an imbalance of lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides). For an average of 22 months, the men applied a gel to their skin daily. For half of the men, the gel was a placebo (inactive). For the others, it contained enough testosterone to maintain their hormone levels between 350 and 750 ng/dL. At the three-year follow-up, the researchers found no difference in the rate of heart attacks, strokes, or death from cardiovascular problems between the TRT and placebo groups. However, compared with the men using the placebo, those using TRT were more likely to have developed atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that can increase the risk for stroke and heart failure) and pulmonary embolism (in which a blood clot travels to a lung artery and blocks blood flow). The researchers pointed out that their findings do not apply to men who do not have a testosterone deficiency. Men considering TRT should discuss possible risks with their doctor, especially if they have any cardiovascular disease risk factors. The results were published in the July 13, 2023, issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. Image: © ljubaphoto/Getty Images",1,0.09719063,-0.1286496
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-take-a-tactical-breather,Try this: Take a tactical breather,1,"Next time you feel overwhelmed by stress or need to stay mentally sharp in a high-stress situation, try tactical breathing. This breathwork (sometimes referred to as box breathing) is used by military and law enforcement personnel to remain calm and collected in dangerous situations. It works like this: Gradually take a full inhalation through the nose while counting one, two, three, four. With each count, draw in more air, so when you reach the count of four, you inhale to your maximum. Hold your breath as you count one, two, three, four again. Then slowly exhale through the mouth, again counting from one to four. Release some air with each count, fully exhaling when you reach four. After full exhalation, hold your breath again for a count of four. Repeat the breathing cycle several times. Tactical breathing can damp down the body's sympathetic nervous system, which directs our response to dangerous or stressful situations. It also engages the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls the body's ability to relax. Tactical breathing also can be used to calm a racing mind when you're trying to sleep and to help soothe pain. Image: © Zinkevych/Getty Images",6,0.15319803,-0.2422644
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/lending-a-helping-hand,Lending a helping hand,1,"The Greek philosopher Plato once said, ""Happiness springs from doing good and helping others."" Almost 2,500 years later, research shows that Plato was correct — people who devote time to helping others are often happier than those who don't. There are many ways lending a hand helps our minds and moods. One way is to turn our attention away from our own problems. ""Too much self-focused attention is linked with more negative thinking and a higher risk of anxiety and depression,"" says Robert Drozek, a psychotherapist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital who specializes in the use of ethics in psychotherapy. ""But serving redirects our energy and helps us realize that we have something to offer people, and they sometimes need our help."" Serving others helps brain health in other ways, too. It increases social connections, which can protect against loneliness and depression, and improves executive function skills like planning, attention, and remembering tasks. And when you help others, your brain releases feel-good chemicals like serotonin and dopamine. You don't need to devote much time to reap these benefits. A study in the August 2020 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that older adults who did any kind of service work for two hours a week felt more optimistic and had a greater sense of purpose compared with those who performed no service. How can you help yourself by helping others? Here are a few ways. Volunteering Volunteering provides a sense of purpose and an emotional boost as you support a cause or organization you believe in. You could also volunteer in professional fields or industries that match your life or work experience, like education, health care, or the arts. ""Volunteering in this way also offers opportunities to find structured and defined roles that fit your schedule, skills, and comfort levels,"" says Drozek. You can even volunteer from home. For instance, thanks to computers, being a ""virtual"" volunteer is common. You can provide administrative, accounting, or marketing assistance via computer or video chat. Telephones are still crucial for volunteer work. For example, you can make calls to help raise money for nonprofits, answer a hotline, or make check-in calls to homebound adults. Finding opportunities Search online for volunteering opportunities in your ZIP code on websites such as Volunteer Match (www.volunteermatch.org) or Idealist (www.idealist.org). You can look for local mentoring programs at the website of the National Mentoring Partnership (www.mentoring.org). Mentoring Mentors share their knowledge, wisdom, and experience with people who need direction. Many times, this is a child or young adult. A good place to begin is with a national program like Big Brothers, Big Sisters of America or the United Way. Also, many high schools, senior centers, churches, and faith-based organizations have mentoring opportunities. If you are more interested in sharing your professional expertise, contact your area Junior Achievement program or the local business community, or service clubs. Random acts of kindness Look for opportunities to serve others in daily life. For example, write to a friend saying you are thinking about them. Order takeout food for a neighbor. Send a gift in the mail. For an additional benefit, do the act anonymously, and don't tell anyone about it. ""This further takes the focus away from you and your worries,"" says Drozek. Different perspective An indirect way to serve others is to see things from their point of view. When you interact with someone — whether a friend, acquaintance, or stranger — focus the interaction entirely on the other person. What is going on with them? What issues do they face? Are they in pain or feeling conflict? Avoid injecting yourself — for instance, by describing how the same situation happened to you (unless they ask for feedback or advice). ""By lending an ear, you can provide emotional support they may need in that moment,"" says Drozek. ""Even if the exchange is generic and friendly, placing emphasis on the other person can boost their mood, and in the process, yours, too.""

The suit, which was filed by the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, maintains that the Environmental Protection Agency violated the Clean Water Act by not disclosing the presence of more than 18 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in treated sewage sludge that was spread across the families’ farmland in the Fort Worth area. In addition, they claim that the EPA was neglectful in its failure to develop regulations that would control the PFAS chemicals that they have previously acknowledged are present in sewage sludge. Instead, the EPA has sat by and allowed “millions of acres"" of land to be contaminated with these toxic chemicals and exposed the surrounding communities to their harms. In a press release, an attorney for PEER, Laura Dumais, said: “ PFAS poisoning of farmlands is fast becoming a national agricultural emergency. Farmers whose lands have been decimated by biosolids consistently ask, ‘why does EPA allow this?’ And they’re absolutely right. EPA needs to act immediately to protect farmers and our food supply from this toxic mess.” The plaintiffs also filed a suit earlier this year against the company Synagro, claiming their farms were contaminated after toxic sewage sludge was spread on a neighboring property.

This caused their livestock to become sick and compromised the farmers’ health. A liver sample from one of the farms' stillborn calves showed that it contained 610,000 parts per trillion of one of the most toxic types of PFAS, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). To put this number in perspective, consider the fact that the EPA proposed limiting PFOS in drinking water to just 4 parts per trillion. Moreover, because the PFAS pollution leached into their land, their property values dropped significantly. The suit alleges that Synagro failed to warn users of its fertilizer about negative health effects of PFAS exposure such as impaired liver and immune system function and cancer, instead marketing them as “safe and organic.” Right now, there's just one state that systematically tests its farmland for the presence of PFAS: Maine. They have found these toxins on at least 70 farms there, and their presence have been attributed to sewage sludge that was spread on farmland in the state in the past. Maine set up a $65 million fund to support farmers impacted by PFAS contamination. The state has also banned the land application of biosolids. 2.4 Million tons of sewage sludge are applied to American land each year According to the EPA, 60 percent of the sewage sludge that is produced each year by wastewater treatment plants in America is spread on farm fields, and there are no requirements in place at the federal level to test for PFAS. The agency estimates that more than 2.4 million tons of sewage sludge are applied to land each year in the form of fertilizer on farms, home gardens, parks, pastures and other types of land. Although biosolids are routinely treated to remove pathogens, the treatment process does not remove PFAS. Known as forever chemicals because they do not break down readily in the environment and bioaccumulate in the human body, PFAS are a class of around 15,000 man-made chemicals that have been linked to a slew of health problems ranging from reproductive issues to cancer. They have been used in a range of consumer products for decades, most notably in nonstick cookware, industrial products and food packaging. As a result, they are now found throughout the environment and are present in biosludge that is used to fertilize farmland.",4,-0.17811148,0.28004745
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/overcoming-heart-health-obstacles,Overcoming heart health obstacles,1,"Prevention is the best medicine, but many men wait for a problem to arise before seeking help. For heart disease — the No. 1 cause of death among men — it could be runaway blood pressure, escalating cholesterol levels, or even a heart attack. Even when faced with the reality of heart disease, men often encounter obstacles that keep them from managing their condition or lowering their risk. What can they do? To find out, we asked two cardiologists — Dr. Haider Warraich and Dr. Dale Adler with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital — what they hear from their male patients and the advice they offer. Think about the future. During consultations, Dr. Warraich asks his patients about how they define longevity. ""When they reflect on what they hope to achieve as they age, most say they value a high quality of life and independent living rather than simply living a few years longer than normal,"" he says. Getting men to focus on their future helps them define goals and then determine if they are on the path to meet them. ""It helps them understand their shortcomings, like needing to be serious about weight loss or managing cholesterol, and can motivate them to make lasting changes,"" says Dr. Warraich. Monitor your blood pressure. Men sometimes don't feel in control of their heart health, says Dr. Warraich. One way they can play an active role is to regularly monitor their blood pressure. ""The heart health risks of high blood pressure are far-reaching, and even if men are not taking medication to manage high levels, keeping tabs on their numbers can be a proactive way to look out for potential problems,"" says Dr. Warraich. Men can easily do this by investing in a home blood pressure monitor. Record weekly readings and alert your doctor about sudden changes. Confront suspicions about medication. Dr. Adler has found that many men who need blood pressure medicine, statins to manage cholesterol, or other medications are hesitant to take them. ""They often focus too much on potential side effects and less on the benefits,"" he says. Much of this may reflect a general mistrust of medicine and the idea they have to take the pills indefinitely. But Dr. Adler says men can overcome this resistance by realizing they have a say in how the drugs are used. ""I tell my patients that by making diet and lifestyle changes, they can possibly take lower doses or even eventually stop taking them,"" he says. ""When they understand their power, they are more open to taking medication they need for better heart health."" Schedule time for health. Consistency is vital for maintaining heart-healthy exercise. But one of the top complaints Dr. Adler hears is lack of time. ""In general, men are receptive to routine and schedules, but they often don't do well when it gets disrupted,"" he says. Dr. Adler advises his patients to find a few blocks of time that work with their schedule and daily energy levels so they have multiple options. For instance, in the morning as soon as you wake up, or in the evening before dinner (exercise before a meal also curbs appetite). Also, treat workout sessions as critical meetings, and always have a backup plan in place. ""This way, if you miss your scheduled workout, you can automatically go to plan B."" For example, take a quick walk, do five minutes of squats and push-ups, or stop by the gym. Make weight loss a group effort. One of the greatest threats to heart health is weight gain. ""Weight loss is not easy, but studies have found that sharing your weight-loss efforts through friendly competitions or online community forums is a tool for staying motivated and overcoming setbacks,"" says Dr. Adler. You could also enlist friends and begin your own weight-loss club, where you share your daily or weekly weigh-ins, exchange tips and strategies, talk about challenges, and encourage each other. Learn portion control. ""People are generally not great at estimating food portions,"" says Dr. Adler. This is one reason weight-loss programs like Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers are effective, he adds. ""They give you the exact portions you are supposed to eat, which is what you need to feel satisfied."" He tells his patients trying to eat healthier or lose weight to always plan their meals in advance and get in the habit of measuring portions. ""This way, you can take the guesswork out of what to eat and avoid consuming extra calories."" Image: © AaronAmat/Getty Images",1,0.15394856,-0.26352656
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/statin-alternative-lowers-heart-related-deaths,Statin alternative lowers heart-related deaths,1,"For people who can't take statin drugs, a cholesterol-lowering drug called bempedoic acid (Nexletol) can also lower the risk of heart attacks and related problems, a new study shows. Published July 11, 2023, in JAMA, the study included about 4,200 people with high LDL (bad) cholesterol who couldn't take statins because of side effects. Their average age was 68, and about two-thirds had diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to take either bempedoic acid or a placebo. Over a follow-up period of about 40 months, those taking the drug were 30% less likely to die of a heart-related condition, have a heart attack or stroke, or need an artery-opening stent compared with the people who took placebos. Bempedoic acid reduced LDL levels by 21%. About 5% to 10% of people who try statins have to stop taking them, mostly because of muscle-related symptoms. This problem is less likely with bempedoic acid, although the drug has other side effects, including a slightly increased risk of gout and gallstones. Still, bempedoic acid can be a good alternative for people at high risk of heart disease who can't take statins. Image: © TimRobberts/Getty Images",8,0.21385384,-0.13042504
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/higher-bmi-associated-with-greater-odds-of-joint-disease,Higher BMI associated with greater odds of joint disease,1,"A higher body mass index (BMI) is one of the major risk factors for developing osteoarthritis. But a new study suggests that carrying extra weight also makes it more likely a person will experience an inflammatory joint condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The study, published online May 23, 2023, by the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology, involved nearly 362,000 adults participating in the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database. Researchers analyzed how participants' BMI — a calculation of body size that considers height and weight — related to their likelihood of developing any of five joint conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and inflammatory spondylitis (a type of spinal arthritis). Other than osteoarthritis, most other joint diseases are driven by inflammation. Participants with higher BMIs (significantly greater than the ""normal"" BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9) had higher rates of rheumatoid arthritis (52%), osteoarthritis (49%), psoriatic arthritis (80%), gout (73%), and inflammatory spondylitis (34%) compared with people in the normal BMI range. Weight control can help reduce the risk of developing a joint disease, the study authors concluded. Image: © SimpleImages/Getty Images",1,0.20552436,-0.17707226
https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/hormone-therapy-linked-to-higher-risks-of-gerd,Hormone therapy linked to higher risks of GERD,1,"Women who have used hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms may be more likely to develop gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, a new analysis suggests. The study, published online June 27, 2023, by the journal Menopause, analyzed data from five earlier studies involving more than one million women, none of whom had been diagnosed with GERD before the study's start. Researchers found that participants who were current or past users of hormone therapy for relieving menopausal symptoms were 29% more likely over all to develop GERD, which is characterized by heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and chest pain. Women who used estrogen alone had a 41% higher odds of GERD, while progesterone-only hormone therapy was linked to a 39% higher risk. Hormone therapy combining estrogen and progesterone was associated with only a 16% higher risk for GERD. The study was observational, meaning it couldn't prove that hormone therapy causes GERD, only that an association exists. Female hormones are believed to relax the muscles that control the lower esophageal sphincter (the valve between the bottom of the esophagus and top of the stomach), allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. Women considering hormone therapy should review their other risk factors for GERD and make necessary lifestyle changes to prevent it, including quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and not lying down after eating heavy meals, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-bumpy-truth,The bumpy truth,1,"Noticing a new lump or bump on your skin is never a happy discovery, especially if it's something unfamiliar — not your garden-variety wart, mole, or hives — and you're not sure whether to worry. Even the term ""lump"" or ""bump"" can be confusing. Located on or just under the skin, these growths can be almost flat or ""cause the skin to pooch out over them,"" says Dr. Rachel Reynolds, interim chair of dermatology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Beyond that, their characteristics run the gamut: soft and squishy or rock-hard, movable or fixed in place, round or irregularly shaped, or growing slowly or quickly. Regardless, they seldom signal something serious. ""People feel a lump and often immediately think it's cancer,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""But that's quite rare."" Most common types Aside from highly common basal and squamous cell skin cancers — which can appear as shiny or wartlike domes — the vast majority of other skin bumps are either epidermal cysts or lipomas, Dr. Reynolds says. What are their qualities? Epidermal cysts often appear on the face or back and ""may feel like a marble under the skin,"" she says. They grow as benign ""buds"" off hair follicles, filling with a cheesy protein called keratin. (Pilar cysts are another version, but on the scalp.) As they grow, epidermal cysts can become inflamed or infected. ""Sometimes, even after being present for many years, they act like a boil, enlarging and becoming red and tender,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""If that happens, see a doctor, since some will require drainage or antibiotics."" Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that often appear on the trunk or shoulders. They usually grow slowly and can run in families. ""You can't see most lipomas unless they get really big,"" she says. ""But if you are able to feel them, they're really squishy, without any sharp edges."" A lipoma can become uncomfortable if it presses on surrounding nerves. In this case, your doctor can remove it surgically or with liposuction, or dissolve it by injecting it with a drug called deoxycholic acid (Kybella). Diverse list Other types of skin growths are defined by a variety of diverse features. Cherry angiomas are smooth, red bumps representing an overgrowth of superficial blood vessels in the skin. They can range in size from a tiny dot to the diameter of a pencil eraser. Cherry angiomas tend to appear suddenly, especially on the torso, and are more common in people over 40. Dermatofibromas are small, firm, brown or pink spots that contain scar tissue, sometimes appearing after a skin injury or insect bite. They might itch or pucker inward if you pinch them, but they aren't painful. Keloids occur when scar tissue continues to grow beyond an injured area. These large bumps aren't harmful, although ""they can become itchy and unsightly,"" she says. Sarcomas are cancerous tumors that can appear deceptively similar to cysts or lipomas, but typically grow more quickly. ""A sarcoma may feel firmer under the skin, but not like a marble, as an epidermal cyst does,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""It's a little more ill-defined, and sometimes it's painful."" If the lump hurts even when it's left alone, that's a particularly concerning sign. When to act While sarcomas are one of the few types of skin lumps that are dangerous, Dr. Reynolds urges caution about any lump appearing near lymph nodes — immune system nodules located in the armpits, groin, and neck. While lymph nodes can enlarge from a cold or other infection, swollen nodes sometimes signal cancer. Other symptoms might also be present, including weight loss, fever, and chills. ""Get checked,"" she says. ""Some lymph nodes become temporarily inflamed, enlarge, and then go back down, but it's something that should be monitored."" A dermatologist can usually diagnose a skin bump or lump on sight alone. Occasionally, imaging tests or a biopsy may be needed to determine the culprit. You can be proactive by doing the following: Pointing it out. At your next primary care appointment, ask your doctor to take a look. ""Seek a more urgent visit if something is growing quickly, bleeding, feels painful, looks infected, or is red or tender,"" Dr. Reynolds says. Speaking up. Your doctor might not focus on a benign bump unless you mention that it's painful, irritating, or cosmetically unappealing. Image: © jarabee123/Getty Images",9,0.0071489327,-0.054296855
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mastering-memory-maintenance,Mastering memory maintenance,1,"You know something's important to you when you can't seem to get it out of your mind. For many of us as we age, staying sharp seems to be that thing — a priority that becomes increasingly pressing as we hear frightening projections that dementia will affect nine million Americans ages 65 and older by 2030 and 12 million by 2040. ""There's more focus on this now because medical science has done a relatively good job of treating heart disease and cancer, but made fewer strides in addressing memory disorders such as dementia,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""I think more people are worried about this than ever."" But concern need not feed a sense of helplessness. Indeed, research is revealing we may possess more power against brain decline than once believed. A large new study zeroes in on the potent influence a healthy lifestyle exerts on memory maintenance, even in older adults with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. ""Just because you have a family history of a medical condition or neurocognitive disorder like dementia doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be stricken with it,"" says Lydia Cho, a neuropsychologist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Our genetics don't completely define our physical and neurocognitive health. We have a choice for how to improve our bodies and minds to live the healthiest life we can."" Healthy habits matter The new study, published online Jan. 25, 2023, by The BMJ, involved more than 29,000 people in China without dementia (average age 72). Participants initially underwent cognitive testing, as well as genetic testing a variant of the APOE gene, APOE4, which is known to raise the risk for Alzheimer's. Participants also reported how stringently they stuck to six good lifestyle habits: eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, not smoking, not drinking alcohol, being socially active, and engaging in brain-challenging activities. Over the next 10 years, participants periodically reported their lifestyle habits and had additional cognitive tests. By the study's end, people who stuck with at least four healthy habits exhibited significantly slower memory decline than those who didn't practice any healthy habits — and this was true even among participants with the Alzheimer's-related gene. Dr. Budson wasn't surprised by the findings, noting that earlier studies reported similar results. ""But I'm thrilled that additional evidence has shown that by making these healthy lifestyle changes, people really are able to reduce their risk of developing dementia,"" he says. ""I think the study's message is clear: your fate, to a large extent, is in your own hands."" The central six Let's dissect the six lifestyle habits that appear to stem memory decline and why practicing each is important to our brain health. 1. Eat a healthy diet. Doing so reduces the risk of clots and other blood vessel problems in the brain, thereby cutting the risk of stroke — the second leading cause of memory problems. ""What's bad for the brain? One important example is eating simple sugars and carbohydrates in processed foods, which causes glucose and insulin spikes that can damage brain cells,"" Dr. Budson says. 2. Exercise regularly. Defined in the study as at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, consistent exercise boosts brain health through two pathways: reducing the risk of stroke and generating growth factors that help spawn new brain cells. ""Plus, there are more new brain cells produced in a structure called the hippocampus — which is critical for learning and memory — than in any other part of the brain,"" Dr. Budson says. 3. Don't smoke. ""By not smoking, you're doing two very important things: reducing the risk of stroke and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of your red blood cells,"" Dr. Budson says. 4. Limit drinking. ""There's no evidence that having a single alcoholic beverage a day causes permanent damage to the brain, but there's increasing evidence that having more than one drink per day can,"" Dr. Budson says. ""We all should be aware that with even a single drink, our memory performance will simply not be as good as if we abstained."" 5. Stay socially active. This can mean regularly visiting friends or relatives, attending parties, participating in meetings, traveling, and chatting online. (See ""Enjoy time online? It may stave off dementia."") Scientists don't fully understand why this tactic keeps brains healthier. ""I think it's because social interactions activate very large areas of the brain,"" Dr. Budson says. ""It's important to keep your mind active, and social interactions are truly one of the best ways to do that."" 6. Challenge your brain. This can include both fun pursuits and more serious ones — reading, writing, playing chess and card games, taking a course, learning a new language, and the like. ""Crossword puzzles are especially good because they force people to think about concepts and the relationships between words and ideas in new, flexible, creative ways,"" Dr. Budson says. Enjoy time online? It may be linked to lower dementia risk Whiling away a few hours online by posting on social media, playing games, and surfing websites can certainly feel relaxing. But if you're wary that it's just a time sink, think again: using the Internet regularly may be linked to a lower risk of dementia, according to a new observational study. The study, published online May 3, 2023, by the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, tracked more than 18,000 people (average age 55, 54% women) for an average of eight years. Every other year, researchers asked participants about their Internet use and administered cognitive testing. Nearly 65% of study participants reported being regular Internet users. People who connected online for about two hours a day were about half as likely to develop dementia than those who didn't use the Internet regularly. The Internet users also maintained better verbal reasoning and memory. The benefits disappeared at high levels of Internet use — defined as six to eight hours a day. The study authors speculated that online engagement could develop and maintain what's called cognitive reserve — the brain's ability to resist decline and find alternate ways to function efficiently. This could compensate for brain aging. But the study was observational — meaning it couldn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between Internet use and dementia risk — and participants' Internet use was self-reported. ""If we take the findings at face value, this would mean Internet use is another cognitive activity that can keep your brain active and healthy, which can potentially increase thinking and memory skills in the short term and reduce the risk of dementia over the long term,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. More study is needed to determine if specific types of online activity might be related to health outcomes. Image: © Ariel Skelley/Getty Images",1,0.11497113,-0.33868262

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/healthy-eating-for-blood-sugar-control,Healthy eating for blood sugar control,1,"If you have diabetes, your healthy eating plan should not be that different from a healthy eating plan for someone without diabetes. In fact, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) echoes the dietary guidelines recommended for the general public: A diet centered on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (peas and beans), and low-fat dairy products. How carbs fit in However, you'll want to pay special attention to your carbohydrate intake. For most people with diabetes, carbohydrates should account for about 45% to 55% of the total calories you eat each day. Make sure you choose your carbohydrates wisely — ideally, from vegetables, whole grains, and fruits. Try to avoid highly refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, and rice, as well as candy, sugary soft drinks, and sweets. Refined carbohydrates tend to cause sharp spikes in blood sugar, and can boost blood triglyceride levels. The facts on fiber Vegetables, fruits, and whole grains not only provide more nutrition per calorie than refined carbohydrates, they also tend to be rich in fiber. Your body digests high-fiber foods more slowly — which means a more moderate rise in blood sugar. Fiber comes in two forms: insoluble fiber, the kind found in whole grains, and soluble fiber, found in beans, dried peas, oats, and fruits. Soluble fiber in particular appears to lower blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity, which may mean you need less diabetes medicine. In addition, a number of studies suggest that eating plenty of fiber reduces the chances of developing heart disease — and people with diabetes need to do all they can to lower their risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-your-daily-nap-doing-more-harm-than-good,Is your daily nap doing more harm than good?,1,"A midday snooze can be helpful, but the need for one might signal chronic sleep deprivation. In many cultures, napping in the afternoon is not only common, but a regular part of daily life. In the United States, as many as a third of adults regularly partake in a midday catnap, according to the National Sleep Foundation. If you are in good health, these short daytime sleeps can bring benefits: helping you catch up on a late night, making you feel less cranky, or ensuring you're well rested if you do a job that falls outside traditional daytime work hours. They can also keep you safe on the road, protecting you from drowsy-driving accidents. ""In addition to reducing sleepiness, naps have been shown to improve memory in the laboratory setting. But the research on napping isn't all rosy. There have been some large epidemiology studies that have suggested both benefits and harms with napping on a population level. It is difficult to draw conclusions on the individual level. The pros and cons of naps For example, some studies have found that adults who take long naps during the day may be more likely to have conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and depression. The urge to sleep during the day may be a sign that they are not getting enough sleep at night, which is associated with a higher risk of developing those chronic conditions. Daytime drowsiness may also be a sign that you are getting low-quality sleep, which may indicate a sleep disorder. In some instances, napping sets up a vicious cycle. You sleep during the day to make up for lost sleep at night, but then you have a harder time falling asleep at night because you slept during the day. Limiting naps is one potential strategy to improve overall nighttime sleep. How to nap well If you do plan to take a nap during the day, here are some guidelines you can follow to help ensure that it won't interfere with your nighttime slumber. Time it right. The best time to sleep is the early afternoon, when your body experiences a natural circadian dip. If you take a nap in the late afternoon or evening, it will likely be harder to fall asleep later. Keep it short. Abbreviated sleeps, around 20 minutes, may be best to avoid grogginess when you wake up. Shorter naps can also help to prevent you from having trouble falling asleep that evening. Time it right by setting an alarm. Get comfortable. For a high-quality rest, be sure to find a quiet, cozy spot where you won't be distracted. Examine your motivation. If you need to nap during the day, it is important to assess why you may be sleepy enough to fall asleep during the day, especially if you nap regularly. Track how much sleep you are getting at night. If you aren't getting enough, try to improve your sleep habits (see ""Tips for better nighttime sleep""). If you are already getting at least seven or more hours of sleep at night and are still tired during the day, discuss this with your doctor. Tips for better nighttime sleep If you find yourself tossing and turning at night, here are some strategies you can use to rest more soundly. Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Avoid alcohol and caffeine late in the day. These can both interfere with sleep quality. Turn off electronics at least one hour before bedtime. Blue light from screens, such as your television or phone, can make it harder for you to fall asleep. So shut them down at least an hour before you turn in. Exercise regularly. Daily workouts during the day can help promote better nighttime sleep. Set the stage. You'll get the best sleep if your room is cool, dark, and quiet. Be alert to signs of a sleep disorder. Pay a visit to your doctor if you are sleeping for the recommended seven to eight hours a night and are still feeling fatigued. Image: © kali9/Getty Images",6,0.21474576,-0.20849442
https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/barium-swallow-upper-gastrointestinal-series-or-upper-gi-series-a-to-z,Barium swallow (upper gastrointestinal series or upper GI series),1,"What is the test? A barium swallow, or upper GI series, is an x-ray test used to examine the upper digestive tract (the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine). Because these organs are normally not visible on x-rays, you need to swallow barium, a liquid that does show up on x-rays. The barium temporarily coats the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine, making the outline of these organs visible on the x-ray pictures. This test is useful to help evaluate potential problems in the esophagus, stomach and first part of the intestine. Images may suggest conditions such as an ulcer, narrowing of the esophagus, or an abnormal mass that could be a benign tumor or cancer, How do I prepare for the test? Tell your doctor and the x-ray technicians if there is any chance you could be pregnant. If you have diabetes or take an SGLT2 inhibitor for weight loss, let your doctor know because medication adjustment may be necessary prior to the test. Stop eating and drinking the night before your test. This is important because food in your stomach or intestine could prevent the doctors from seeing a clear outline of these structures on the x-rays. Usually it isn't a problem for you to take most of your regular pills, but you should check with your doctor. What happens when the test is performed? You wear a hospital gown for the test. At the start of the test, you drink barium, a liquid that looks like a milk shake but does not taste nearly as good (most patients say it tastes like chalk). You might also be asked to swallow some tablets that ""fizz,"" causing air-bubbles to be released in your stomach. This might make you feel like burping, but try not to. You will get better pictures if you can keep yourself from burping. The x-ray technician may ask you to stand or lie in different positions over the next few minutes, to help spread around the liquid you have swallowed. Most often, the x-ray pictures are taken while you lie on your back on a table. The x-ray machine or the table is moved a few times so it can take pictures of all of the internal structures. You are asked to hold your breath for each picture so that your breathing movement does not blur the image. What risks are there from the test? There are no significant risks. You are exposed to a small amount of radiation during the test, but the amount of radiation is too small to be likely to cause any health problems. Must I do anything special after the test is over? After the test, you can eat normally and do your normal activities. You should drink more water than usual to help clear out the barium and to prevent constipation, which might be a side effect of the test. Your stool may appear light in color for a couple of days. How long is it before the result of the test is known? Typically you can get the results within a day or two.",9,0.16672143,0.06363289
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/when-and-how-should-you-be-screened-for-colon-cancer-202309202975,When — and how — should you be screened for colon cancer?,1,"Colon cancer is the second-deadliest form of cancer after lung cancer. If recent messages about colon cancer screening have left you a little confused, that's understandable. In August, the American College of Physicians (ACP) released updated guidance for colon cancer screening that differs from other major organizations, including recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the US Preventive Services Task force (USPSTF). So, what do you need to know? How does the advice differ? First, please note that this advice applies only to people at average risk without a family history of colon cancer. If you have family history, or if other health issues put you at higher-than-average risk for colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor about the best course of action for you. The main point of disagreement relates to the age at which people should start getting screened. The new ACP guidance says 50, while the other two organizations recommend 45. That earlier age is endorsed by the U.S. Multisociety Task Force on Colorectal Cancer. It's also endorsed by many physicians, including Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist and director of epidemiology at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, who helps explain key facts below. Why do experts suggest starting screening earlier? ""We're facing an unexplained and alarming increase in the incidence of colon cancer in people younger than 50,"" says Dr. Chan. Overall, deaths from colon cancer dropped by 2% per year from 2011 to 2020. But that's not the case among people younger than 50. In that age group, deaths from colon cancer rose between 0.5% and 3% during the same time period, according to statistics published in 2023. The rising rates of colon cancer in younger people are occurring in all racial and ethnic groups, with the steepest rises seen among Alaskan Natives and Native Americans. Overall, Blacks and African Americans are more likely to get and die from colon cancer than whites, and early-onset cases are higher in Black individuals than whites. Efforts to encourage colon cancer screening began in the mid-1990s. Today, about 60% of adults over 50 follow the advice to receive a colonoscopy (described below) on a regular basis. This track record, while not perfect, likely explains the decline in deaths from colon cancer in older adults. ""I think that promoting earlier screening will help stem the rise in early-onset cases, at least for those in their 40s. We've also seen that earlier colonoscopies may be associated with lowering incidence of colon cancer even later in life, ""says Dr. Chan. What are the different screening tests for colon cancer? The two most widely used screening tests are a standard colonoscopy and various stool-based tests. Colonoscopy. For this test, a gastroenterologist or surgeon snakes a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end through your rectum and beyond to inspect the entire length of your colon. Considered the gold-standard test, this procedure can detect precancerous polyps called adenomas, and allow for their removal. The test requires taking laxatives and drinking lots of fluids beforehand to clean all the fecal material (stool) out of your colon. Serious complications, which include perforation or bleeding, are rare, occurring in about three in 1,000 procedures. If no polyps are found, a repeat colonoscopy isn't recommended for another 10 years. If you have polyps, or your risk or symptoms change, this interval will be shorter. Stool tests. The more worrisome colon polyps (adenomas) often shed tiny amounts of blood and abnormal DNA into the stool. This can be detected from samples you collect yourself at home. Two tests, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical test (FIT), check for blood. They require small stool samples that you put on a card or in a tube that's then mailed to a lab. These tests should be done every year. A third option, the FIT-DNA test, checks for both blood and abnormal DNA; it's usually repeated every three years. Additionally, the guidelines from the American College of Physicians suggest another option: flexible sigmoidoscopy, which inspects only the lower part of the colon, once every 10 years, combined with a fecal FIT testing every two years. However, doctors in the United States rarely order sigmoidoscopy today. If flexible sigmoidoscopy or any of these stool tests show evidence of a problem, a colonoscopy is needed to check for adenomas or cancer. Why might stool-based screening make sense for younger adults? Colonoscopy isn't necessarily the best initial screening test for everyone, says Dr. Chan. That's especially true for younger people, mainly because it's time-consuming and inconvenient. ""Maybe you just can't find time in your schedule or are worried about having a colonoscopy,"" he says. If that's the case, a stool-based test — which is noninvasive and takes very little time — is an appropriate option. ""The worst option is not doing anything, because early detection and treatment can prevent deaths,"" he says.",1,-0.038909007,-0.07052398
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/got-expendable-body-parts-202309182974,7 organs or glands you may do just fine without,1,"There was a time when pediatricians routinely recommended tonsil removal, even for healthy children — including me. As far as I can tell, I suffered no ill effects — plus, I got extra ice cream! That practice is no longer routine. But it does raise an interesting question: Why do we have body parts that can be safely removed? If they're not needed, why do humans have them in the first place? One theory is that these nonessential organs and glands once served important roles in the lives of our evolutionary ancestors but now represent anatomic remnants. For example, it was long thought that the appendix helped our predecessors digest food, but over thousands of years became obsolete. And some organs are supremely useful during certain stages of life, but then become expendable. Seven (mostly) unnecessary body parts Here are seven removable parts of the body: Appendix This organ is about the size of your little finger and hangs from the lower right side of your colon. For reasons that aren't clear, this part of the intestinal tract sometimes becomes blocked, infected, or inflamed. Aptly enough, the word appendicitis means inflammation of the appendix. While it may settle down with antibiotic treatment, emergency surgical removal (an appendectomy) is often necessary. Tonsils A network of lymph nodes throughout the body is part of the immune surveillance system that helps trap dangerous invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Consider your two tonsils as larger, specialized lymph nodes watching out for these intruders. They are located at the back of the throat just to the sides of and behind the uvula, the dangling piece of tissue above them. Now, removing the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is only recommended for people with repeated bouts of bacterial throat infections such as strep throat, a condition common in children. Once removed, other lymphoid tissue, including the actual lymph nodes, can take over the job of the tonsils. Adenoids Situated in the back of the nose where the nasal passages meet the mouth and throat, adenoids are similar to tonsils. They can also become inflamed, infected, and swollen. So when the tonsils are removed, the adenoids are generally removed at the same time. The combined procedure is called tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. As is true for the tonsils, other lymphoid tissue takes over when the adenoids are gone. Gallbladder The gallbladder sits just under the liver in the upper right part of the abdomen. It stores bile made in the liver and releases it into the digestive tract when needed to help digest fatty foods. The gallbladder may need to be removed (a cholecystectomy) if it becomes inflamed, a condition called cholecystitis. Most often this occurs due to infection or gallstones, which are a hardened collection of bile. In some cases, rest and antibiotics can control gallbladder inflammation so removal can be delayed or even avoided. Uterus This remarkable reproductive organ has a single purpose: to support fetal growth until birth. When necessary, the uterus can generally be removed (hysterectomy) without impairing health. Common reasons for removal include painful or excessive menstruation, benign growths called fibroids that cause pain or bleeding, or cancer. Thymus gland This small gland sits high in the upper chest behind the breastbone. In a fetus or newborn, it's quite important in the development and maturation of the immune system. But adults can live well without it. Surgery to remove the thymus (a thymectomy) may be recommended if the thymus becomes cancerous, or if a person develops the autoimmune condition myasthenia gravis. Spleen Like adenoids and tonsils, the spleen is made up of lymphoid tissue. It filters the blood, removing infectious organisms, aging blood cells, and other abnormal cells traveling through the bloodstream. But sometimes the spleen becomes overactive and begins removing healthy cells. For example, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) may develop when platelets (clotting blood cells that prevent excessive bleeding) are removed from circulation. With few platelets left in the bloodstream, bruising and bleeding may be life-threatening. Although medications can help, removal of the spleen (a splenectomy) may be necessary. Or sometimes trauma to the spleen, especially after sports injuries and car accidents, causes internal bleeding, which may lead to splenectomy. People who lack a spleen are more prone to certain infections, so if removal isn't urgent, a number of vaccinations are recommended before splenectomy. The bottom line I've heard it said that at least half of all body parts are unnecessary. That's a myth. But as with most myths, there is some truth to it: there are indeed many body parts that can be safely removed. That said, it's generally best to avoid unnecessary surgery and keep the parts you were born with if you can. Sure, you can survive and thrive despite having your appendix removed. But it's worth keeping in mind that our understanding about so-called spare parts may change over time. The appendix is a good example: researchers have discovered that the appendix may play a role in immune development and stores ""good bacteria"" to repopulate the gut in case of future illness. And there is evidence that removing the thymus may slightly increase the risk of cancer, autoimmune disorders, and death. Someday we may discover important functions for other body parts we now consider expendable. And maybe then I'll wish I had my tonsils back.",9,0.070892796,0.13222787

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/treating-stomach-bugs-best-solution-may-simplest-one-201606149799,"When treating stomach bugs, the best solution may be the simplest one",1,"Follow me at @drClaire If you've got a vomiting kid, you don't need to rush out to the drugstore and buy those oral rehydration solutions. Just add some water to the juice you have in the refrigerator, and you're all set. That's the bottom line of a study published in JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association). Researchers studied about 600 children who came to the emergency room with stomach flu and minimal dehydration. Half of them were given dilute apple juice, and half were given an oral rehydration electrolyte solution (like Pedialyte), colored to look like apple juice and sweetened to make it taste better. The families whose children got the apple juice were told to give them whatever fluids they would take once they got home, while the ones who got the electrolyte solution were told to continue giving the solution at home. The children that got apple juice were less likely to need intravenous fluids or end up back in the emergency room. There are a few reasons why doctors have recommended the special solutions. The major reason is that they worry that fluids that have a lot of sugar in them, like juice or Gatorade, can worsen diarrhea. The other reason is that when you have a lot of vomiting or diarrhea, you can lose electrolytes like sodium that are crucial for your body's function. And certainly, in children with severe dehydration or in very small infants, these are real worries. But for the average child sick with stomach flu who has only mild dehydration, these aren't big worries. Those kids generally do just fine as long as they get fluids into them — pretty much any fluids. And as any parent knows, kids are most likely to drink fluids that are familiar to them, and that taste good. Solutions like Pedialyte are not familiar to most children — and while they don't taste bad, they can have an odd taste that many children don't like. Here are some important tips when giving fluids to children with vomiting and diarrhea: Start with clear fluids, like the diluted apple juice used in the study. Once they are keeping that down well, you can try milk or other fluids. The ""dilute"" part is also a good place to start. A little extra water, and a little less sugar, is easier on the stomach. Once they are keeping fluids down, it's less important to add the water. When children are vomiting, give them little bits at a time (an ounce or two) to be sure it stays down. Sometimes kids will be thirsty and want to take more — but their stomach can't handle it yet. Keep giving the small amounts until they are keeping fluids down. If your child can't keep anything down or is having repeated diarrhea, goes more than 6 hours without urinating, seems excessively tired to you, has a high fever, or has really bad pain of any kind, call your doctor. You should also call for advice if your child is less than 6 months old or has any ongoing medical problems.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-best-ways-to-manage-heartburn,The best ways to manage heartburn,1,"On call Image: © Juanmonino/Getty Images Q. I have about three episodes of heartburn per month and it often lasts all day. What do you suggest? A. Heartburn is caused by stomach acid moving up and out of the stomach and into the lower part of the esophagus. Reducing the overall acidity in the stomach protects the esophagus from irritation when the stomach contents back up (reflux). The fastest treatment is to neutralize the acid already in the stomach and lower esophagus by taking an over-the-counter antacid. While antacids work within minutes, they often don't last, so you may have to take repeated doses until symptoms subside. For longer-lasting relief, you can try an H2 blocker, which stops stomach cells from making acid. There are several over-the-counter brands of H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Generic versions also are available. H2 blockers come as a pill, liquid, or chewable or effervescent tablet. Most people react well to all of them. H2 blockers begin to act within an hour and last for another 10 to 12 hours. (If you still need the occasional antacid, wait 30 to 60 minutes after taking one before adding an H2 blocker.) Proton-pump inhibitors are even stronger acid blockers. Over-the-counter brands include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR), omeprazole (Losec, Omesec, Prilosec OTC), and omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid). If your heartburn doesn't respond to these drugs or lasts for more than 10 days, see your doctor. — by Howard LeWine, M.D. Editor in Chief, Harvard Men's Health Watch",9,0.19523577,0.040922824

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/fighting-inflammation-at-the-meal-table,Fighting inflammation at the meal table,1,"A healthy diet goes a long way in keeping inflammation—a process that underlies most serious diseases—at bay. Image:Monticelllo/Thinkstock We all benefit from inflammation, the process by which our immune system detects and disables foreign molecules or microbes. Although we may not enjoy the runny nose and scratchy throat of a winter cold—the signs of our immune system at work—inflammation eventually rids us of the virus responsible. However, when inflammation persists at low levels after the invader is eradicated, it can become our enemy. Many major diseases that plague us—including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer's—have been linked to chronic inflammation. Our diets play an important role in chronic inflammation because our digestive bacteria release chemicals that may spur or suppress inflammation. The types of bacteria that populate our gut and their chemical byproducts vary according to the foods we eat. Some foods encourage the grow of populations of bacteria that stimulate inflammation, while others promote the growth of bacteria that suppress it. That's why one of the most powerful tools to combat inflammation comes not from the pharmacy, but from the produce counter. Many experimental studies have shown that components of foods or beverages may have anti-inflammatory effects. You may be interested in... Fighting Chronic Inflammation Chronic inflammation plays a central role in some of the most challenging diseases of our time, including rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and even Alzheimer’s. This report will examine the role that chronic inflammation plays in these conditions, and will also provide information on the breadth of drugs currently available to alleviate symptoms. Drug choices range from simple aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that’s been available for more than a century, to disease-modifying drugs and so-called biologics that promise more targeted treatments. LEARN MORE Choose the right foods, and you may be able to reduce your risk of illness. Consistently pick the wrong ones, and you may promote chronic inflammation, which sets the stage for a host of degenerative diseases Inflammation-promoting foods Not surprisingly, the foods that contribute to inflammation are the same ones generally considered bad for our health, including sodas and refined carbohydrates, as well as red meat and processed meats. Some of the foods that have been associated with an increased risk for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease are also associated with excess inflammation. It's not surprising, since inflammation is an important underlying mechanism for the development of these diseases. Such unhealthy foods are also likely to contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation. Yet in several studies, even after researchers took obesity into account, the link between foods and inflammation remained, which suggests weight gain isn't the sole driver. Mounting evidence suggests that certain components or ingredients in processed foods, like the emulsifiers added to ice cream, may have independent effects on inflammation. Inflammation-fighting foods Fortunately, you are probably already enjoying many of the foods and beverages that have been found to reduce the risk of inflammation, and with it, chronic disease. They include the following: Fruits and vegetables. Most fruits brightly colored vegetables contain high levels of natural antioxidants and polyphenols—protective compounds found in plants. Nuts and seeds. Studies have also associated nuts and seeds with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Beverages. The polyphenols in coffee and the flavonols in cocoa are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea is rich in both polyphenols and antioxidants. Anti-inflammatory eating It's best to focus on an overall healthy diet rather than singling out individual ""good"" and ""bad"" foods, so you won't need bookkeeping software to balance your intake of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory foods. In general, a healthy diet means one high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. If your plate is dominated by unprocessed plant-based foods and bursting with color, you're on the right track. In addition to lowering inflammation, a more natural, less processed diet can have noticeable effects on your physical and emotional health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/when-your-colonoscopy-reveals-that-you-have-diverticulosis-hemorrhoids-or-both,"When your colonoscopy reveals that you have diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, or both",1,"In most cases, you won't know they're there. But if things change, home remedies often help. Image: © ttsz, JFalcetti/Thinkstock You received good news after your last colonoscopy: no cancer or precancerous polyps. But with the good news came with another finding: though you don't have symptoms, you do have diverticulosis and hemorrhoids. The news may be puzzling, but don't worry. Both conditions are common and usually don't cause any problems. Diverticulosis Diverticulosis is the term used to describe the presence of diverticula — pouch-like structures that sometimes form in the muscular wall of the colon and bulge outward. Between 40% and 60% of people have them, and they get more common as we age. They tend to cluster in the sigmoid colon, just above the rectum. Diverticulosis only causes symptoms if one of the diverticula bleeds or gets infected. When bleeding does occur, it tends to be intense for a short period, but usually stops on its own. We don't know the cause of the diverticular bleeding, only that something injures a blood vessel in the pouch. Even if bleeding stops on its own, you can still lose a considerable amount of blood, so you should see a doctor. In some people, diverticula can get infected. That's called diverticulitis. It's not clear why or how diverticulitis develops. Age, obesity, a lack of exercise, and a low-fiber diet are risk factors for the condition. Typical symptoms of diverticulitis include lower abdominal pain, more often on the left side; fever; and change in bowel habits, either loose stools or constipation. Mild cases might not even need antibiotics. But most often doctors will treat will oral antibiotics initially to prevent it from getting worse. People with more severe disease, such as an abscess (pocket of infection) or pus that needs drainage, often need hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics. Preventing problems It's not clear yet if we can prevent diverticulosis or diverticulitis. Exercising, controlling your weight, and eating less red meat and more fiber may help. Some data suggest that more fiber reduces the risk of both developing diverticula and getting symptoms if you already have them. Adults should get 25 to 30 grams of dietary fiber every day from foods such as beans, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. A fiber supplement may also help. But add fiber to your diet slowly, since you can get gas and bloating if you increase your fiber intake too fast. What about the warning that eating foods with small seeds can add to diverticulitis risk? There used to be a theory that seeds, nuts, and popcorn increased the risk of diverticulosis and diverticulitis, because they might lodge in the pouches and cause irritation or infection. However, that's never been proved. Seeds and nuts are an important source of fiber. Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids have a bad rap, but we all have these pillow-like clusters of veins in the lining of the lower part of the rectum and anus, which help play a role in preventing stool leakage. When they become enlarged, however, they are anything but helpful and can even contribute to some leakage in addition to pain, itching, and bleeding. What causes hemorrhoids to swell? The veins are anchored by connective tissue. If the tissue is weakened, the hemorrhoids bulge out. The weakened tissue may be caused by a combination of genetics and pressure from sitting on a toilet too long or straining to have a bowel movement. Pregnancy is also a common trigger. When hemorrhoids in the lower rectum (internal hemorrhoids) swell, they may bleed, and you may see bright red blood in the toilet. But you won't feel the hemorrhoids unless they extend beyond the anus and become itchy. The hemorrhoids most people complain about (called external hemorrhoids) are located outside the anus. If they become swollen, the overlying skin becomes irritated, erodes, and may itch or hurt. A clot can form inside the hemorrhoid, which can be very painful. Treatment and prevention Hemorrhoids are typically diagnosed from a medical history and physical exam. Home remedies are usually effective to treat external hemorrhoids. Sitting in a warm bath may help soothe an irritated hemorrhoid. And lifestyle changes can also make a difference. Avoid sitting and straining on the toilet for long periods, and make sure stool moves along. He suggests increasing dietary fiber intake; using stool softener, such as docusate (Colace); or using a gentle laxative if you're constipated, such as polyethylene glycol 3350 (Miralax). Internal hemorrhoids that are bothersome are usually resolved with minimally invasive procedures performed in a doctor's office.",9,0.110256955,-0.14308698
https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/upper-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy-or-egd-a-to-z,Upper endoscopy (eophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD),1,"What is the test? This test inspects your esophagus, stomach and the first section of intestine (the duodenum) using an endoscope. An upper endoscopy allows the doctor to explore the cause of such symptoms as difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, vomiting up blood, or passing blood in the stool. It can also diagnose irritation, ulcers, and cancers of the lining of the esophagus and stomach. During this type of endoscopy, the doctor can also take biopsy samples of tissue. How do I prepare for the test? Don't eat or drink anything for eight hours before this test. It's also best to stop taking aspirin and other NSAIDs for several days beforehand, to reduce the chances of bleeding should your doctor need to take a biopsy. Ask your doctor if you should avoid taking any other medicines on the day of the test. If you have diabetes, talk with your doctor about ways to avoid low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) since you will be fasting. If you wear dentures, remove them before the test. Arrange for a ride home because the medicine given for this test will make you drowsy. What happens when the test is performed? The nurse will place an intravenous catheter into your arm. During the procedure, the nurse will be monitoring your heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen content of your blood. You'll probably be given a sedative through an IV. This medicine may prevent you from remembering the test; it might even make you sleep through it. The doctor will spray a local anesthetic into your throat to prevent you from gagging when the endoscope is inserted. The endoscope used in this test is about half an inch in diameter and long enough to reach from your mouth through your stomach and into the first part of your small intestine. When the doctor places the endoscope in your throat, he or she asks you to swallow. This helps guide the endoscope into your esophagus. You are likely to feel pressure against your throat while the tube is in place and you might experience a ""full"" feeling in your stomach. The doctor gently advances the tube through your esophagus into your stomach. He or she will then move the scope into the duodenum. The camera at the end of the scope takes pictures that appear on a video screen. Your doctor will watch for any suspicious spots on the lining of your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. If any appear, your doctor might use some small clippers on the end of the scope to remove a tiny piece of tissue for a biopsy. Though the exam itself takes only 10-15 minutes, you will probably be in the exam room for 40 minutes or more because of the time it takes to set up. Your throat will feel numb, but this will wear off about 30 minutes later. The sedative will make you sleepy for an hour or more. What risks are there from the test? Complications are rare. One possible complication is aspiration (accidentally inhaling saliva into the lungs), which can cause pneumonia. If a biopsy is taken, or if the endoscope injures the wall of the esophagus or stomach, it can cause bleeding. If severe, internal bleeding can require a transfusion. In rare cases, perforation of the lining of the stomach, esophagus, or intestine can also occur, requiring surgery. The sedative given can sometimes cause an allergic reaction. Must I do anything special after the test is over? Medical personnel will probably watch you for half an hour or more after the test. Although you may eat an hour after the test, you shouldn't drive or drink alcohol for the rest of the day due to grogginess from the sedative. Call your doctor if you experience dizziness, chest pain, difficulty or pain with swallowing, fever, black stools, or vomiting material that looks like coffee grounds. The last two symptoms can indicate that you are bleeding from your stomach lining. How long is it before the result of the test is known? Your doctor can tell you right after the test what was seen in your upper digestive tract. If biopsies were taken, it can take several days to a week before the results are back.",9,0.13973089,-0.033116903

https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/percutaneous-transhepatic-cholangiography-ptca-a-to-z,Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCA),1,"What is the test? Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is an x-ray test that can help show whether there is a blockage in the liver or the bile ducts that drain it. Since the liver and its drainage system do not normally show up on x-rays, the doctor doing the x-ray needs to inject a special dye directly into the drainage system of the liver. This dye, which is visible on x-rays, should then spread out to fill the whole drainage system. If it does not, that means there is a blockage. This type of blockage might result from a gallstone or a cancer in the liver. How do I prepare for the test? Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to lidocaine or the numbing medicine used at the dentist's office, or to x-ray dye. Also tell your doctor if you could be pregnant, since x-rays can harm the developing baby. If you have diabetes and take insulin, discuss this with your doctor before the test. Most people need to have a blood test done some time before the procedure, to make sure they are not at high risk for bleeding complications. If you take an anticoagulant drug (blood thinner), aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other medicines that affect blood clotting, talk with your doctor. It may be necessary to stop or adjust the dose of these medicines before your test. You will be told not to eat anything on the morning of the test so that your stomach is empty. This is a safety measure in the unlikely case you have a complication, such as bleeding, that might require surgery. What happens when the test is performed? You lie on a table wearing a hospital gown. An IV (intravenous) line is inserted into a vein in case you need medicines or fluid during the procedure. An area over your right rib cage is cleaned with an antibacterial soap. Then the radiologist may take a picture of your abdomen with an overhead camera. Medicine is injected through a small needle to numb the skin and the tissue underneath the skin in the area where the dye is to be injected. You may feel some brief stinging from the numbing medicine. A separate needle is then inserted between two of your ribs on your right side. The needle is advanced into your liver. A small amount of x-ray dye is injected, and some pictures are taken that are visible on a video screen. Your doctor adjusts the placement of the needle until it is clear that the dye is flowing easily through the ducts (drainage tubes) inside your liver. Because taking the x-ray pictures sometimes requires a significant amount of time, the doctor replaces the needle with a softer plastic tube. First, the syringe holding the dye is detached from the top of the needle, leaving the needle in place. The doctor then gently pushes a thin wire through the needle and into the duct where the needle has been sitting. Next the needle is pulled out, sliding over the outside end of the wire. The wire is left with one end inside the liver to hold the position where the needle had been. The doctor then slides a thin plastic tube similar to an IV line along the wire, like a long bead on a string, until it is in the same place where the needle was. The wire is then pulled out, and the syringe with the dye is reattached to the tube. Then more dye is injected through the plastic tube, and pictures are taken with the video camera as the dye spreads inside the liver. If there is no blockage, the dye drains out of the liver through the bile ducts and begins to show up on the x-ray in your small intestine. Once all of the needed pictures have been taken, the plastic tube is pulled out, and a small bandage is placed over your side. The whole test usually takes less than an hour. What risks are there from the test? It is possible to have serious bleeding from this test. In some cases, blood leaks to the outside surface of the liver and causes a buildup of blood there. In other cases, blood can leak directly into the liver's drainage system, in which case it might start showing up in your intestine, causing a bloody bowel movement. It is possible that you could develop an infection after the test, although this is rare. The only soreness you are likely to have is at the skin surface where the needle went in. This should last for only a day or two. In rare cases, the dye used in the test can damage your kidneys. This kidney effect is almost always temporary, but some people have permanent damage. Because x-rays are used, there is a small exposure to radiation. In large amounts, exposure to radiation can cause cancers or (in pregnant women) birth defects. The amount of radiation from the video x-ray in this test is very small—too small to be likely to cause any harm. (The people performing the test will wear lead shields, since they would otherwise be exposed to this radiation over and over.) Must I do anything special after the test is over? Call your doctor right away if you have pain in your right abdomen or shoulder, fever, dizziness, or a change in your stool color to black or red. How long is it before the result of the test is known? You may be told some early results of your test as soon as the test is done. It takes a day or two for the radiologist to review the x-rays more thoroughly and to give your doctor a full report.",9,0.050516892,-0.014133289
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/will-digestive-enzyme-supplements-help-your-heartburn-2018041313643,Digestive enzyme supplements for heartburn?,1,"My love affair with spicy food came to a sad end a few years ago. Age — and I'm guessing too many jalapenos — have left me prone to heartburn if I eat meals with a fiery flare. My doctor says there's no underlying condition causing the problem, and advises me to avoid the foods that seem to trigger symptoms. But that's tricky sometimes. So I was particularly interested when a friend suggested that an over-the-counter (OTC) digestive enzyme supplement might help. I learned pretty quickly that there are lots of ads for the pills and powders. It's a booming business, with sales for OTC digestive enzymes of all kinds expected to reach $1.6 billion by 2025. About the supplements touted for heartburn relief OTC digestive enzymes claim they can help you break down food, just like digestive enzymes your own body makes (mostly in the pancreas). For example, the enzymes produced by the pancreas include: lipase, which breaks down fats amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates proteases and peptidases, which break down proteins. The supplement versions of these enzymes come from plants and animals. Plant sources include bromelain, derived from pineapples; papain, derived from papayas; and lactase that's obtained from purified yeasts or fungi. Animal sources include enzymes from the pancreases of pigs, cows, or lambs. But there's no way to know what's really in supplements. The FDA does not regulate them, therefore you can't be sure what the pills are really made of or the exact amounts of enzymes they may contain. ""It's buyer beware,"" warns Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Do supplements help heartburn? Sometimes the body doesn't make enough digestive enzymes. This can slow the digestion process and lead to uncomfortable symptoms. Would a digestive enzyme supplement help treat the symptoms of occasional heartburn, caused by acid reflux, slow stomach emptying, or an unknown reason (like I have)? The answer is that we don't know. ""Unfortunately, there is little evidence that OTC digestive enzymes are helpful for heartburn,"" says Dr. Staller. But we do know that OTC digestive enzymes can help manage other conditions. For example, if you don't make enough of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase, needed to digest the sugar in beans, you may benefit from taking an alpha-galactosidase supplement (Beano, Bean Relief). Or if you don't make enough of the enzyme lactase, needed to digest lactose — the sugar in milk and milk-based products — you may benefit by taking a lactase supplement (Lactaid, Lactrase). ""If you don't have lactase, the undigested lactose goes to the colon, which leads to more fluid entering the colon and more gas produced by bacteria in the colon. That creates bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea,"" explains Dr. Staller. ""A supplement might help."" What about prescription enzymes? Sometimes doctors recommend taking prescription-strength digestive enzymes. These may be necessary when digestion enzyme levels are low because of a health condition such as chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. Taking prescription digestive enzyme medications helps bring levels back to normal. ""People with known deficiencies clearly get a benefit,"" says Dr. Staller. But these medications are not appropriate treatments for heartburn. The rest of my story Because I am persistent, I asked if it would hurt to try an OTC digestive enzyme for occasional heartburn. Both my doctor and Dr. Staller had the same answer: ""In most cases, it's unlikely to be harmful. But don't spend a lot of money on them,"" Dr. Staller advised. In other words, it won't hurt, but we don't know if it will help. So don't make a big investment in the treatment. With that dubious green light and a lot of curiosity, I tried an OTC enzyme made from papaya. And guess what — it helped! But as a health reporter I know that this could have been the result of my own personal hope (the placebo effect) or just a happy coincidence. I also know that ignoring my doctor's orders to avoid spicy foods (which is my heartburn trigger, but may not be someone else's) would be foolish, and could cause damage to my esophagus. So would using digestive enzymes as a crutch to eat anything I want. The lesson for me is that the OTC digestive enzyme supplement is there if I need it in a pinch, and that it might or might not work. But I won't make a habit of using it. I'll keep the spice factor dialed down to a lower heat, and l'll just have to learn to love being symptom-free the way I once loved those jalapenos.",0,0.23137611,0.26384613
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fermented-foods-for-better-gut-health-201805161607,Fermented foods for better gut health,1,"Naturally fermented foods are getting a lot of attention from health experts these days because they may help strengthen your gut microbiome — the 100 trillion or so bacteria and microorganisms that live in your digestive tract. Researchers are beginning to link these tiny creatures to all sorts of health conditions from obesity to neurodegenerative diseases. Fermented foods are preserved using an age-old process that not only boosts the food's shelf life and nutritional value, but can give your body a dose of healthy probiotics, which are live microorganisms crucial to healthy digestion, says Dr. David S. Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. Not all fermented foods are created equal The foods that give your body beneficial probiotics are those fermented using natural processes and containing probiotics. Live cultures are found in not only yogurt and a yogurt-like drink called kefir, but also in Korean pickled vegetables called kimchi, sauerkraut, and in some pickles. The jars of pickles you can buy off the shelf at the supermarket are sometimes pickled using vinegar and not the natural fermentation process using live organisms, which means they don't contain probiotics. To ensure the fermented foods you choose do contain probiotics, look for the words ""naturally fermented"" on the label, and when you open the jar look for telltale bubbles in the liquid, which signal that live organisms are inside the jar, says Dr. Ludwig. Try making your own naturally fermented foods Below is a recipe from the book Always Delicious by Dr. Ludwig and Dawn Ludwig that can help get you started. Spicy pickled vegetables (escabeche) These spicy pickles are reminiscent of the Mediterranean and Latin American culinary technique known as escabeche. This recipe leaves out the sugar. Traditionally, the larger vegetables would be lightly cooked before pickling, but we prefer to use a quick fermentation method and leave the vegetables a bit crisp instead. 2 cups filtered water 1 to 1-1/4 tablespoons sea salt 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 jalapeño or a few small hot chiles (or to taste), sliced 1 large carrot cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds or diagonal slices 1 to 2 cups chopped cauliflower or small cauliflower florets 3 small stalks celery (use only small inner stalks from the heart), cut into 1-inch-long sticks 1 bay leaf 1 cabbage leaf, rinsed Warm the water (no need to boil). Stir in the sea salt until it dissolves completely. Set aside to cool (use this time to cut the vegetables). Add the vinegar just before using. The brine can be made ahead of time and stored in a sealed glass jar on the counter to use when ready to pickle. Set a quart-size canning jar in the sink and fill it with boiling water to sterilize. Empty the jar and tightly pack the vegetables and bay leaf inside to within 1 to 2 inches from the top of the jar. Pour the brine over the vegetables to fill the jar to within 1 inch from the top. Wedge the cabbage leaf over the top of the vegetables and tuck it around the edges to hold the vegetables beneath the liquid. Set jar on the counter and cover with a fermentation lid. (Alternatively, use a standard lid and loosen it a bit each day for the first few days, then every other day, to allow gasses to escape.) Let pickle for three to five days, depending on the indoor temperature. Check the taste after a couple of days, using clean utensils. Vegetables will pickle faster in warmer climates. Make sure the vegetables stay packed beneath the level of the liquid and add salted water (2 teaspoons sea salt dissolved in 1 cup warm filtered water) as needed. When the vegetables are pickled to your liking, seal the jar with a regular lid and refrigerate. Vegetables will continue to slowly pickle in the refrigerator. They will keep for about one month. Taste for saltiness before serving and, if desired, rinse gently to remove excess salt.

Should I be concerned?There are several different types of pancreatic cysts. A pseudocyst is not a true cyst and is caused by inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). It is never cancerous, but it can become enlarged and cause pain. The most common actual cysts — serous cysts and mucinous cysts — are defined by the fluid inside them. Serous cysts have clear thin fluid while mucinous cysts have thicker fluid. Most serous cysts are benign and don't require treatment or close follow-up.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/6-self-help-tips-for-hemorrhoid-flare-ups-201307196496,6 self-help tips for hemorrhoid flare-ups,1,"Getting older has its benefits—and its drawbacks. Included in the latter are hemorrhoids. These swollen blood vessels on the outer rectum and anus can turn bowel movements into intensely painful experiences. Classic symptoms include rectal pain, itching, bleeding, and possibly prolapse (protrusion of hemorrhoids into the anal canal). Although hemorrhoids are rarely dangerous, they can be a painful recurrent bother. Hemorrhoids come in two varieties. The internal type sprout from within the rectum. External hemorrhoids develop on the anus itself. Either way, stools passing by them can cause pain and bleeding. But simple self-help measures can ease the ordeal of most hemorrhoids and allow healing. Here are effective steps you can take to care for hemorrhoids—and when it's time to seek out a procedure to remove them. What helps hemorrhoids Here are six self-help tips to ease hemorrhoid pain and promote healing: Step up the fiber. The most important thing is to add fiber to your diet. This is best done with foods that help hemorrhoids, but some people find they need to take a fiber supplement to get 20 to 30 grams of fiber per day. To start, try a psyllium husk fiber supplement, such as Metamucil or a generic equivalent. If psyllium causes gas or bloating, try a supplement containing wheat dextrin or methylcellulose. Lubricate the process. Mixing a tablespoon of mineral oil with applesauce or yogurt and eating it at breakfast or lunch allows stool to slide by the hemorrhoid more easily. But don't do this for a long period (if you try this, you may want to place a liner in your undergarments to absorb any oil leakage.) Don't delay. When you feel the urge, go to the bathroom immediately; don't wait for a more convenient time. Putting off bowel movements can worsen constipation, which then aggravates hemorrhoids. Try elevation. Elevating your feet a bit with a step stool as you sit on the toilet changes the position of the rectum in a way that may allow for easier passage of stools. Off-the-shelf remedies. Over-the-counter products are available for hemorrhoids. These include witch hazel infused pads and soothing creams, like Preparation H and its generic equivalents. If these don't work, ask your doctor about prescription preparations. Sit in a sitz. Don't overlook the relief offered by sitz baths. Using a basin that fits under the toilet seat, soak the inflamed area in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes, two to three times a day. If hemorrhoids persist no matter what steps you take to make them go away, or they begin to bleed, interfere with bowel movements, or make life difficult, ask your doctor about medical procedures to remove or reduce hemorrhoids.",9,0.26694068,-0.09104669
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/leaky-gut-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-you-2017092212451,"Leaky gut: What is it, and what does it mean for you?",1,"Before the medical community had better understanding of the mechanisms that cause disease, doctors believed certain ailments could originate from imbalances in the stomach. This was called hypochondriasis. (In Ancient Greek, hypochondrium refers to the upper part of the abdomen, the region between the breastbone and the navel.) This concept was rejected as science evolved and, for example, we could look under a microscope and see bacteria, parasites, and viruses. The meaning of the term changed, and for many years doctors used the word ""hypochondriac"" to describe a person who has a persistent, often inexplicable fear of having a serious medical illness. But what if this ancient concept of illnesses originating in the gut actually holds some truth? Could some of the chronic diseases our society faces today actually be associated with a dysfunctional gastrointestinal system? What exactly is leaky gut? Inside our bellies, we have an extensive intestinal lining covering more than 4,000 square feet of surface area. When working properly, it forms a tight barrier that controls what gets absorbed into the bloodstream. An unhealthy gut lining may have large cracks or holes, allowing partially digested food, toxins, and bugs to penetrate the tissues beneath it. This may trigger inflammation and changes in the gut flora (normal bacteria) that could lead to problems within the digestive tract and beyond. The research world is booming today with studies showing that modifications in the intestinal bacteria and inflammation may play a role in the development of several common chronic diseases. Who gets a leaky gut (and why)? We all have some degree of leaky gut, as this barrier is not completely impenetrable (and isn't supposed to be!). Some of us may have a genetic predisposition and may be more sensitive to changes in the digestive system, but our DNA is not the only one to blame. Modern life may actually be the main driver of gut inflammation. There is emerging evidence that the standard American diet, which is low in fiber and high in sugar and saturated fats, may initiate this process. Heavy alcohol use and stress also seem to disrupt this balance. We already know that increased intestinal permeability plays a role in certain gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The biggest question is whether or not a leaky gut may cause problems elsewhere in the body. Some studies show that leaky gut may be associated with other autoimmune diseases (lupus, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis), chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis, allergies, asthma, acne, obesity, and even mental illness. However, we do not yet have clinical studies in humans showing such a cause and effect. A path toward a healthier gut Although it is unusual to hear the term ""increased intestinal permeability"" in most doctors' offices, alternative and integrative medicine practitioners have worked on gut healing as an initial step to treat chronic diseases for decades. Other cultures around the world often recommend specific diets to make people feel better. Even in the United States, it is common to see people changing their diets after getting sick. A common initial step some practitioners take is to remove foods that can be inflammatory and could promote changes in the gut flora. Among the most common are alcohol, processed foods, certain medications, and any foods that may cause allergies or sensitivities. Controversy still exists on whether leaky gut causes the development of diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract in humans. However, it is always a good idea to eat a nutritious, unprocessed diet that includes foods that help quell inflammation (and avoids foods known to trigger inflammation), which may, at least in theory, help to rebuild the gut lining and bring more balance to the gut flora. This recipe could make you feel better, without any side effects. It is definitely worth a try.",9,0.12170416,-0.10261212

It normally relaxes only when you swallow, to let food into your stomach. However, sometimes the muscle fails to tighten enough to prevent acid reflux. When acid hits the inner lining of the esophagus, it injures the lining and causes pain — heartburn.

Each of us has a flat plate of muscle just beneath our lungs, separating our chest from our abdomen. It's called the diaphragm, and it helps us breathe: when it moves downward, it causes the lungs to pull in air through the nose and mouth. And when it moves upward, it forces air out of our lungs. The movement of the diaphragm is directed by the brain, which sends signals down nerves that end in the diaphragm. A hiccup occurs when the brain sends a signal for the diaphragm to shift forcefully downward, suddenly pulling a lot of air into the back of the throat. The sudden change in pressure causes a narrow area in the throat to temporarily snap shut, causing the ""hic"" sound of a hiccup.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/weak-kidneys-pay-attention-but-dont-worry-excessively,Weak kidneys? Pay attention but don't worry excessively,1,"You often hear older people say I have weak kidneys. That doesn't mean they can't do their job or are destined to fail. But it does indicate you have some form of chronic kidney disease. The kidneys — the body's blood-filtering urine factory — have less capacity to filter toxins from the blood and excrete them in the urine. How the kidneys work Every day, a healthy kidney filters a total of about 200 quarts of blood, removing waste products, excess water, and certain chemicals. If the kidneys didn't keep things in balance, you would slowly poison yourself. The kidneys have a remarkable ability to keep working despite changing conditions, like drops in blood pressure. The tiny filtering tubes in the kidney, called glomeruli, adapt in various ways. In a serious health crisis, the kidneys may shut down completely as a defensive move to keep fluids in the body. That's called an acute kidney injury, and it happens frequently to people who are hospitalized. What causes low kidney function? Half of U.S. adults over 75 may have below-normal kidney function. Most of them will never get sick from it. Several conditions or factors can injure the kidneys, leading to lower kidney function and possible chronic kidney disease. These include: diabetes smoking excessive alcohol consumption uncontrolled hypertension high cholesterol in addition, some medications can injure the kidneys. If you are leading a heart-healthy lifestyle (regular exercise and a nutritious plant-based diet), that will help protect your kidneys. How low is low? A healthy kidney filters wastes from the blood at a rate of 90 milliliters (ml) per minute or more. This is known as the glomerular filtration rate, or GFR. With time, many men's kidneys start to slip, but function must decline quite a lot before you start to really feel the impact. You feel fine up to the point that kidney function is almost gone, which means you can lead a normal life with reduced kidney function. On the other hand, lack of early warning from symptoms can deny you the chance to slow the slide. Most people don't start feeling really ill until kidney function is under 10%. How is kidney function tested? As part of standard blood tests, your doctor can check the creatinine level to assess kidney function. Creatinine is released from muscle cells into the bloodstream. Creatinine is one of the things that the kidneys filter from the blood. If the kidneys start to lose some function, blood creatinine level rises. The creatinine level is used to calculate an estimate of the GFR and provide an estimate of your kidney function. Most people who have a minor reduction in kidney function can take steps to not keep the kidneys from getting worse. If the function is somewhat low but stable, you may need to see your doctor only once per year. If the GFR is declining or it is already under 50, it's best to see a kidney doctor. How high blood pressure damages the kidneys High blood pressure can cause tiny cracks in the lining of arteries, which provide a breeding ground for fatty deposits that hamper blood flow. As the arteries that feed blood to the kidneys narrow, the body produces renin, a hormone that makes small arteries narrow further. This worsens high blood pressure, causing even more kidney damage. Over time, restricted blood flow can damage or destroy the nephrons, the tiny filtering units inside your kidneys. How to protect your kidneys and improve kidney function If kidney function begins to decline, you can take the following steps. Keep your blood pressure and blood sugar within norms This will help slow the decline in kidney function. In particular, keep blood pressure below 130/80. Lower your cholesterol Taking a statin medication to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol may help to protect the kidneys. Also, individuals with reduced kidney function are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, so reducing cardiac risk factors is important. Consider medication Certain prescription medications can protect the kidneys. The ones that physicians often use for this purpose are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and SGLT2 inhibitors. These drugs lower pressure in the kidney filters and limit further damage. Eat a plant-based diet; limit protein intake Plant-based proteins rather than animal-based proteins may put less strain on weak kidneys. Use NSAIDs with caution Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, interfere with kidney function. Taking them when you are also depleted of fluids can lead to kidney shutdown and possibly hospitalization. For pain relief, acetaminophen (no more than 3,000 milligrams per day) is safer. If you must take an NSAID, be sure to drink plenty of water. Image: Undefined Undefined/Getty Images",9,0.25165978,-0.18942907
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/should-i-worry-about-the-side-effects-of-proton-pump-inhibitors,Should I worry about the side effects of proton-pump inhibitors?,1,"Q. I have had intermittent heartburn for years. My doctor ordered an upper endoscopy to look at my esophagus and stomach. My esophagus is inflamed due to acid reflux. I was told to stay on prescription-strength pantoprazole indefinitely. But I worry about side effects. If I eat less acidic foods and don't experience heartburn, is it necessary to take this drug to keep my esophagus healthy? A. Pantoprazole (Protonix) is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Drugs in this class are the most potent acid inhibitors. Examples of other PPIs include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), and rabeprazole (AcipHex). Most are available in low doses and less expensive generic formulations over the counter. Doctors can prescribe higher doses if needed. There is no simple yes-or-no answer to your question, but here is how I approach this common situation. First, I would ask these questions: Did you have the endoscopy because the heartburn was more frequent or severe? Were you taking any acid blockers before the endoscopy, and if yes, at what dose and for how long? These questions are to understand the severity of your esophageal inflammation (esophagitis). If your reflux was severe, or if you had been on treatment for a few weeks before the endoscopy and still had visible esophagitis, your doctor's recommendation sounds correct. Treating esophagitis with a high-dose PPI is not just about controlling symptoms. Persistent severe esophagus inflammation from acid reflux can lead to scarring and narrowing of the lower esophagus. It also increases your risk of developing a condition called Barrett's esophagus, which can lead to cancer. Most people who take PPIs have minimal, short-term side effects. PPI use is associated with a slightly increased risk of infections. It's possible to develop lower blood levels of vitamin B12 or magnesium. Studies looking at other long-term concerns regarding bone thinning, dementia, and kidney disease have provided some reassurance that PPIs are not the cause. Many people with acid reflux and esophagitis can use less potent anti-acid therapy. Your doctor may advise a repeat upper endoscopy before making any changes, or you might begin to taper down first. If you and your doctor decide it's the right time to transition, you will want to do it gradually. Never stop the acid blocker abruptly, as this could lead to rebound heartburn, since your body is used to the medication. It's also important to maintain lifestyle changes to reduce acid reflux, including losing weight if needed, not lying down after eating, and avoiding foods that typically cause heartburn.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/after-the-baby-grows-up-how-will-your-heart-fare,"After the baby grows up, how will your heart fare?",1,"Pregnancy is seldom a walk in the park. But if yours was marked by complications such as high blood pressure or diabetes, you probably hoped those hurdles were behind you after your baby was born. Hope isn't a strategy, however, when it comes to protecting your health. And it's becoming increasingly evident that certain pregnancy and reproductive factors raise red flags about your cardiovascular health years or decades down the line. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine equates pregnancy to a ""cardiovascular stress test,"" noting that certain complications point toward higher risks for heart attack or stroke later in life. ""We now understand that pregnancy is a window into a woman's future health,"" says Dr. Brett Young, an OB/GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. For example, women who had high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia (a condition marked by high blood pressure that can impair function of the heart, kidneys, and other organs) while pregnant later develop chronic high blood pressure at least twice as often as women whose blood pressure remained normal in pregnancy. Women who had these blood pressure problems also have 70% higher rates of diabetes and 30% higher rates of elevated cholesterol later in life, according to a Harvard-led 2018 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Diabetes or blood pressure complications, estimated to affect 5% to 10% of pregnancies, are on the rise as obesity rates climb and more women decide to have babies later in life. ""While they often resolve soon after, those conditions can translate into long-lasting increased risks for heart disease for these women,"" says Dr. Nicolas-Sonny Nguyen, a Boston-area family medicine doctor and clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School. ""Once you've finished having children, years or decades may go by where these health issues may not come up."" Common disease features New research magnifies these revelations. Pregnancy and childbirth complications can pose deadly implications as long as 50 years later, according to a study published online March 8, 2023, by Circulation. The analysis, which used long-term data from more than 46,000 women who gave birth between 1959 and 1966, tracked participants' deaths from any cause until 2016. Pregnancy-related high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, and preterm delivery were all linked to a greater risk of death in the decades following childbirth. Meanwhile, problems such as infertility, miscarriage, and stillbirth may be associated with greater stroke risks later in life, according to an analysis published online June 22, 2022, by The BMJ. Researchers reviewed data on nearly 619,000 women ages 32 through 73 from seven countries. Infertility was associated with a 15% higher risk of stroke, while repeated miscarriages were linked to a 37% higher risk. Women who'd had recurrent stillbirths were 44% more likely to die of a hemorrhagic stroke, characterized by uncontrolled bleeding in the brain. What's the link? Pregnancy and reproductive difficulties can share common features with cardiovascular disease, including blood vessel problems and fat deposits in blood vessel walls, Dr. Young says. ""Pre-eclampsia is a systemwide condition that affects many organs,"" she says. ""We think of it as a disease of the placenta, but the consensus is that it's actually a blood vessel disease that also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain."" Similarly, diabetes during pregnancy may signal simmering problems with a woman's insulin production or how efficiently her cells use energy. ""Even if you had gestational diabetes for only a few months of your life in a span of five, six, or more decades, those few months may have made a difference in your risks,"" Dr. Nguyen says. The need for check-ups The mounting research drives home the importance of preventive care and screenings for women who had complicated pregnancies and deliveries — especially at midlife and beyond, when heart disease risks already increase. ""The risks become less silent when women who had these pregnancy conditions reach menopause or beyond,"" Dr. Nguyen says. But even younger women — including those whose pregnancies weren't marked by complications — shouldn't skip regular primary care visits. A 2022 study in the journal Hypertension suggests that limited medical follow-up in the year after childbirth may miss high blood pressure in one of 10 new mothers whose blood pressure wasn't elevated during pregnancy. If you've dealt with pregnancy or reproductive difficulties, tell your primary clinician and your other doctors. Your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels should be monitored regularly, and any irregularities should be ""treated aggressively,"" Dr. Young says. ""Even if a woman had problems during only one of her pregnancies many years ago, that history is very important. It should be part of a conversation for the rest of her life,"" Dr. Nguyen says. Also don't ignore even mild symptoms that might be heart disease trouble signs, such as chest pain, unusual fatigue, neck or jaw pain, or shortness of breath. ""Talking about symptoms that pop up is important because early recognition is key,"" Dr. Nguyen says. ""Create a platform to have these conversations with your clinicians instead of waiting years, when coronary artery disease has perhaps been brewing for a while."" High blood pressure during pregnancy also endangers the brain Cardiovascular health isn't the only thing that might suffer in the aftermath of pregnancy-related high blood pressure. A new analysis suggests this complication is linked with later cognitive problems as well. The study, published online May 9, 2023, by Neurology, involved more than 2,200 women (average age 73), 83% of whom had at least one pregnancy. Every 15 months over an average of five years, participants took nine tests of memory and thinking that evaluated aspects such as processing speed, executive function, language, and overall cognition. After assessing the women's medical records for pregnancy-related data, researchers found that those who'd had high blood pressure during pregnancy experienced a greater decline in many aspects of thinking skills compared with women who maintained normal blood pressure while pregnant. The effects were even more pronounced among women who'd had pre-eclampsia, a more severe pregnancy-related blood pressure disorder. The findings aren't surprising, given that blood vessel problems that may contribute to pregnancy complications can also affect vessels that carry blood to the brain, says Dr. Brett Young, an OB/GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The results also suggest monitoring and managing blood pressure during and after pregnancy could pay important dividends for brain health later in life. The findings are consistent with the understanding that pregnancy can illuminate a woman's future health risks, including many conditions that affect the blood vessels, Dr. Young says. ""The brain,"" she says, ""requires healthy blood vessels just like the placenta does — it's a system based on blood vessels."" Big-picture risks Pregnancy complications, of course, are far from the only factor that influences a woman's future pregnancy risk. Also important are family history, race, diet, weight, and physical activity levels. ""It's important to know that heart disease affects one in five women, regardless of age,"" Dr. Nguyen says. ""Some women may think, 'I'm 35 and had my kids, I'm healthy, and there's no way for me to get heart disease.' But that's not true. I emphasize this to encourage women to optimize their lifestyle."" ""When you see your health care providers, be honest and thorough about your medical history, especially relating to your pregnancies,"" says Dr. Nguyen.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-apple-cider-vinegar-curb-appetite,Can apple cider vinegar curb appetite?,1,"Q. My friend says she drinks apple cider vinegar at bedtime to help her eat less and lose weight. Could it work? A. Scientific evidence doesn't support drinking apple cider vinegar to dampen appetite or help with weight loss. But even on a commonsense level, it's not likely. Here's why: changing only a single part of our routine — such as drinking a shot of apple cider vinegar each evening — can't help us shed excess pounds as effectively as broader efforts that include changing our overall diet and exercising more often. Beyond that, apple cider vinegar's high acidity level makes bedtime a less-than-ideal time to drink it. Anyone prone to heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should avoid eating or drinking anything acidic at least 30 to 60 minutes before sleep to lessen the odds of uncomfortable burning in the chest. Over time, drinking undiluted vinegar can also erode your tooth enamel. People who still want to consume apple cider vinegar can do it more safely and comfortably if they mix a small amount into a large glass of water or combine it with other ingredients in salad dressings.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/eating-junk-food-may-affect-deep-sleep,Eating junk food may affect deep sleep,1,"Want better-quality sleep? Cut back on junk food. Researchers found that eating an unhealthy diet high in processed food can affect people's deep sleep (also known as slow-wave sleep). During this sleep stage, the pituitary gland in the brain releases a burst of growth hormone, which helps build and repair muscles, bones, and other tissues. Deep sleep also boosts cognitive function and memory. The study, published online May 28, 2023, by Obesity, looked at 15 healthy men with normal sleep habits (sleeping an average of seven to nine hours per night). The participants ate either a healthy or unhealthy diet for one week. The two diets contained the same number of calories, adjusted to each individual's daily requirements. However, the unhealthy diet had a higher content of sugar and saturated fat and included many processed foods. After a week on the diet, the participants spent two nights at a sleep laboratory where their slow-wave brain activity was measured. They first slept a regular night that matched their usual sleep schedule. The next night they were kept awake past their regular bedtime and then allowed to catch up on their sleep to mimic disrupted sleep. After several weeks, the study was repeated, with everyone switching to the other diet and revisiting the sleep lab. The researchers found that when participants followed the unhealthier diet they had poorer-quality deep sleep (indicated by a decrease in slow-wave activity). This was true for both normal and disrupted sleep. They noted that it is difficult to draw conclusions from only one week of poor eating. Still, the findings suggest there may be important ways diet can influence sleep quality. Image: © JGI/Jamie Grill/Blend Images LLC/Getty Images",6,0.36463764,-0.038945813
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/chronic-stomach-pain-in-children-whats-the-most-common-cause-202308232964,Chronic stomach pain in children: What's the most common cause?,1,"The most common cause of chronic stomach pain in children isn't anything you can find on a test or cure with a medicine. And that can make it very challenging to diagnose — and treat. You may not have ever heard of functional abdominal pain. Yet it ranks as the most common cause of stomach pain lasting two months or more in children and teens. What is functional abdominal pain? The mind and the body are tightly connected in ways that we are still working to understand, and this is particularly true of the mind and the gastrointestinal tract. Stress — particularly chronic stress, depression, and anxiety — can lead to pain that is very real. Sometimes the pain is the only symptom of stress, especially in children who are high-achieving or tend to hide their emotions. Sometimes the pain doesn't start from stress but from an infection or other illness, and stays once the illness is gone or adds additional pain to the illness while it is being treated. Worry about the pain and its possible cause can make things worse. The nervous system of the gut can go into overdrive. What are common symptoms of functional abdominal pain? Children with functional abdominal pain can have mild symptoms that just show up occasionally, or they can have more severe symptoms that interfere with daily life. Along with stomachaches, they can have nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea — or some combination of all of them. They may have a poor appetite or complain of feeling full very quickly. When should you contact your child's doctor? It's important to check in with your doctor if your child is having chronic stomachaches. They should have a physical examination, and your doctor may want to do some testing, such as blood or stool tests, as there are many medical conditions that can cause chronic stomachaches. It's particularly important to call your doctor if your child is losing weight has blood in their stool has severe pain has fever, rashes, sore joints, or other signs of illness. If your doctor finds that your child's examination and tests are normal, and they aren't losing weight, chances are that your child has functional abdominal pain. For some families, getting this diagnosis sounds like the doctors are saying that it is all in the child's head. But nothing could be further from the truth. It is very real pain — but it is not being caused by something dangerous, which is very good news. How can you help a child diagnosed with functional abdominal pain? There are many ways to help a child who has functional abdominal pain once the diagnosis is made. They include: Understanding and managing stressors in the child's life, if there are any Medications recommended by your health care team can help with symptoms, such as laxatives for constipation Cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a kind of therapy that teaches strategies for managing pain, as well as managing any stress or sadness that can be contributing Meditation, yoga, and other ways for a child to relax and regulate how they react to their world For some children, a low-FODMAP diet can be helpful Probiotics, peppermint oil preparations, and some other supplements are sometimes used to help soothe and prevent pain. Most children with functional abdominal pain can receive care from their pediatrician. Regular visits are a good idea, to check in to see how things are going and adjust any treatments. If things aren't getting better, a referral to a gastroenterologist can be helpful. Follow me on Twitter @drClaire",9,0.1993746,-0.07870509
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/8-ways-to-get-constipation-relief,8 ways to get constipation relief,1,"Most healthy adults have bowel movements three times a day to three times a week. Constipation refers to bowel movements that occur less often than expected or when the stool is hard, dry, and difficult to pass. Though constipation may be a common problem, it is still uncomfortable and stressful when it strikes. The good news is that most people with simple constipation can get relief with at-home treatments such as diet changes, hydration or judicious use of laxatives. Here are top ways to get constipation relief: 1. Dietary fiber One of the first steps you can take to relieve constipation is to increase your intake of fiber through your diet. Fiber needs vary by age and sex, but generally adults should get 22 to 34 grams of fiber a day. There are two different types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Both types of fiber are important for health, digestion, and preventing diseases. But they act differently in the body. Soluble fiber absorbs the water in your food. In doing so, it turns to gel, which slows digestion. Some types of soluble fiber may help lower cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. Soluble fiber is found in the following foods: Oat bran Barley Nuts Seeds Beans Lentils Peas Some fruits and vegetables Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, doesn't absorb water and adds bulk to your stool. It can help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestine, relieving constipation. Insoluble fiber can be found in foods such as: Wheat bran Vegetables Whole grains You can check the fiber content of common foods and drinks on the USDA food sources of dietary fiber page. Tip: Leave the skin on fruits and vegetables to increase fiber. 2. Fiber supplements Because dietary fiber provides a host of health benefits, you should aim for getting as much of your daily fiber as you can through foods. However, only about 5% of the U.S. population achieves the recommended level of dietary fiber consumption. For individuals who are not obtaining their daily fiber needs through diet, fiber supplements are a convenient way to enhance a low-fiber diet. Popular fiber supplements include the brand names Metamucil, All-Bran, and Citrucel. Fiber supplements vary in their active ingredients. Metamucil's active ingredient is the soluble fiber, psyllium. Citrucel's active ingredient, methylcellulose, is also a soluble fiber. However, the active ingredient in All-Bran is the insoluble fiber, wheat bran. Fiber supplements are among the safest ways to promote regular bowel movements, though they do act slowly and can cause gas and bloating. You should drink plenty of fluids when taking supplements. Because there are many different types of fiber supplement to choose from, with some offering other health benefits, you should speak with your doctor about the right fiber supplement for you. 3. Hydration Keeping hydrated is an important action to take for constipation relief. Water, other liquids, and foods with a high water content can help fiber work better, making stool softer and easier to pass. Good fluid choices include: Water Naturally sweetened fruit juices Vegetable juices Clear soups Staying hydrated is good for your overall health and can help you avoid getting constipated in the first place. How much water should you drink? Most people need about four to six cups of plain water each day. But it may be surprising to learn that optimal water intake is an individualized number. 4. Osmotic laxatives The name may sound technical, but osmotic laxatives are a class of medicines that include products you may be very familiar with, such as milk of magnesia. These laxatives use natural salts, magnesium salts, or undigested sugars to draw water into the large intestine, softening and loosening the stool. MiraLax is another example of an osmotic laxative. 5. Stool softeners Stool softeners add moisture to stools to make them softer and easier to pass. Docusate is one example of a stool softener. Stool softeners are often recommended for people who should avoid straining, such as people who have hemorrhoids or have recently had abdominal surgery. 6. Lubricants Lubricants, such as mineral oil, help stools slide out with more ease. They may be a good choice if your stools feel stuck low in your bowels, if you have an internal tear or ""fissure,"" or if you have pain from hemorrhoids during bowel movements. Mineral oil is taken by mouth and can cause pneumonia if aspirated into the lungs. 7. Stimulant laxatives Stimulant laxatives provide constipation relief by causing the intestines to contract more frequently or more forcefully, encouraging stool to move through the colon. Stimulant laxatives that contain senna, cascara, or bisacodyl, are more aggressive. These medicines may relieve constipation that is severe or has not responded to other treatments. Because of side effects, as well as the possibility of the large intestine becoming dependent on their use, stimulant laxatives should only be used as directed and only for brief periods. Stimulant laxatives can be taken by mouth or inserted into the rectum as a suppository. When taken as a suppository, stimulant laxatives can work in 15-60 minutes. Taken by mouth, stimulant laxatives can cause a bowel movement in 6 to 8 hours, 8. Enema Enemas are another option for constipation relief. They mechanically flush stool from the rectum and lower part of the large intestine. An enema works by loosening the stool in the rectum, thereby triggering the rectal muscles to squeeze as a reaction to their being stretched. A traditional enema is done with a bag of liquid (usually a mixture of salt and water) attached to a plastic tube with a tapered tip. After the tip is inserted into the anus, the enema fluid can be emptied into the rectum. The fluid is then expelled, washing stool out with it. When to call your doctor If self-care treatments don't work, you should see your doctor for constipation relief. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to treat your constipation. If you have fecal impaction (a large lump of dry, hard stool that stays stuck in the rectum), the hard stool may have to be removed by a doctor or nurse using a lubricated, gloved finger inserted in the rectum. This procedure can be painful, so a topical anesthetic is often applied. Some people may need to be sedated. Typically, an enema is given after the hard stool is removed. A high-fiber diet, stool-softening medication, or laxative may be recommended to promote regular bowel movements.",9,0.40175068,0.01877614
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-celiac-disease-symptoms,Common celiac disease symptoms,1,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract. In people with celiac disease, an allergic reaction is triggered when gluten (a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley) is ingested. Over time, the immune reactions triggered by gluten inflame and damage small structures on the surface of the intestine. Unmanaged celiac disease can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms, as well as symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Some symptoms result from inflammation in the intestines, while other symptoms stem from a lack of nutrients, due to the failure of the damaged intestine to digest food properly. The symptoms of celiac disease vary so widely that there is no such thing as a typical case. Some people with celiac disease experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which can delay a medical diagnosis. Digestive symptoms Digestive symptoms of celiac disease are more common in children than adults. Children generally develop symptoms only after they start eating foods that contain gluten. Digestive symptoms of celiac disease may include: bloating diarrhea constipation gas lactose intolerance loose, greasy, bulky, foul-smelling stools nausea or vomiting abdominal pain. Non-digestive symptoms Some people with celiac disease experience symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Problems associated with celiac disease or caused by poor absorption of nutrients include: bone or joint pain iron-deficiency anemia weight loss arthritis fatigue bone loss tingling or numbness in the hands or feet dermatitis herpetiformis (a skin condition characterized by extremely itchy bumps or blisters) depression, irritability, or mood changes delayed start or missed menstrual periods infertility or repeated miscarriages symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores liver disease. How long after eating gluten can symptoms start? The reaction and reaction time varies among individuals. Some people will have a reaction within two to three hours of gluten consumption. Others may not feel anything until the next day or a few days after, and some not at all. Common symptoms after exposure to gluten include: nausea vomiting (very severe in some cases) gas/bloating cramps abdominal pain diarrhea constipation tiredness brain fog muscle and joint pain. Diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease Celiac disease should not be self-diagnosed. If you suspect you or your child has celiac disease, see a doctor. Treatment for celiac disease is focused on eliminating gluten from the diet, which should be done in consultation with a doctor. After a person begins eating a gluten-free diet, symptoms typically improve and may go away. However, if a person consumes small amounts of gluten, symptoms may flare up.",9,0.2632568,0.033343047
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/celiac-disease-diet-avoiding-foods-that-contain-gluten,Celiac disease diet: Avoiding foods that contain gluten,1,"Celiac disease is a chronic digestive and immune disorder in which consuming foods containing gluten triggers an immune reaction that causes gastrointestinal discomfort and, over time, damages the small intestine. If enough damage is done, the intestine may no longer be able to properly absorb nutrients, leading an individual with celiac disease to become nutrient-deficient. This could affect systems throughout the body. For this reason, it's important for people with celiac disease to follow a strict diet that excludes gluten. What is the connection between gluten and celiac disease? Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. In celiac disease, the immune system mistakenly recognizes gluten as ""foreign."" When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, the immune system attacks the gluten when it gets into the small intestine. The attacks damage villi, which are small, fingerlike projections in the small intestine that help the body absorb nutrients from food. As villi become eroded and flattened, they have trouble absorbing nutrients. In the short term, this can lead to diarrhea and other digestive symptoms. Left unchecked, the inability of the small intestine to absorb nutrients can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, seizures, and nerve problems. Diet and treatment of celiac disease While there is no ""cure"" for celiac disease, avoiding gluten can prevent recurring symptoms. A gluten-free diet can also relieve celiac disease symptoms and even allow damage to the small intestine to heal. Because avoiding gluten is the only way to prevent symptoms and intestinal damage from celiac disease from returning, people with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet for life. Foods to avoid with celiac disease If you have celiac disease, you should seek the advice of a doctor or a registered dietitian for ways to maintain a balanced diet while avoiding gluten. Many foods can contain gluten — including many you wouldn't expect, like canned soups, sour cream, and cold cuts. That's why a person with celiac disease has to be vigilant about reading labels and asking questions about food ingredients. In general, avoid the following foods if you have celiac disease: Cereals, breads, or other grain products that include wheat, rye, barley, or oats. This includes white or whole-wheat flour (including cookies, crackers, cakes, and most other baked goods), semolina, couscous, bread crumbs, most pastas, and malt. Processed cheese, cheese mixes, low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese, or sour cream. Dairy products such as yogurt or ice cream that contain fillers or additives. Canned soups or soup mixes. Creamed vegetables. Products that contain modified food starch, food starch, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stabilizers, or fat replacers or substitutes. (Examples of fat replacers include cellulose, gelatin, dextrins, gums, modified dietary fibers, whey protein, microparticulated egg white, and milk protein.) Check the label for these ingredients. Prepared or processed meats. Beer, gin, and whiskey. Flavored coffee, malted milk, or herbal tea with malted barley. What happens if you are celiac and keep eating gluten? Avoiding gluten is not easy. Gluten is common in foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, and cake. Consuming anything containing wheat, barley, or rye, even in small amounts, can trigger a celiac flare-up. Research has shown that the total daily gluten consumption that seems to be safe for most people with celiac ranges from just 10 to 50 milligrams (mg) of gluten; a slice of wheat bread contains 2,000 mg. Individuals with celiac disease should be aware of the risk of cross-contact in their food. Cross-contact is when a gluten-free food or food product is exposed to a gluten-containing ingredient or food — making it unsafe for people with celiac disease to eat. Cross-contact can happen at home, in restaurants, and in other food service locations. Cross-contact can occur when the same appliances or cleaning supplies are used for both gluten-containing and gluten-free foods. Cross-contact can also occur during the growing, processing, and manufacturing processes. Manufacturers can be contacted to ask if they batch-test their product for gluten, if they know how their raw materials were sourced and produced, and what procedures they go through to prevent cross-contact in the factory. What are good foods to eat if you have celiac disease? While the list of foods to avoid on a celiac diet seems long, you can follow a gluten-free diet and still enjoy many healthy foods. When you're shopping, look for products marked ""gluten-free."" If you have celiac disease, focus on foods you can enjoy that do not contain gluten. These include: fruits vegetables meat and poultry fish and seafood dairy beans legumes nuts chia corn flax millet potato quinoa rice soy tapioca wine gluten-free oats. (Oats are naturally gluten-free, but processing increases the risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing grains. Therefore, oats without a gluten-free label are not considered safe for individuals with celiac disease.) What happens if celiac disease is left untreated? It is important to adhere to a gluten-free diet if you have celiac disease. If left untreated, celiac disease can lead to severe malnutrition and can put you at risk of serious consequences, including osteoporosis (thin bones), anemia, infertility, liver disease, neuropathy (damaged nerves), and seizures.",9,0.247672,0.09213795
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/calm-your-anxious-heart,Calm your anxious heart,1,"Managing anxiety can improve your quality of life and take stress off your heart. A wave of dread overcomes you—your chest hurts, your heart flutters, and you can't catch your breath. These classic anxiety symptoms are often mistaken for a heart attack—and for good reason. Emotional turmoil triggers the release of stress hormones, which act on the same brain areas that regulate cardiovascular functions such as heart rate and blood pressure. A toxic mix Anxiety most often travels in the company of its henchmen—stress and depression. In fact, anxiety and depression are likely different expressions of a shared underlying biology. As many as two-thirds of people with anxiety disorders also suffer from depression at some point in their lives, and over half of people with depression also have an anxiety disorder. Long-term, unrelenting stress can be a precursor to both conditions. Stress, anxiety, and depression can be viewed as one family of related problems. It's hard to tease them out. For example, two people may have similar biology, but one of them is anxious, while the other is more depressed. Heart effects The relationship between heart health and depression is well documented. There is mounting evidence for an independent anxiety–heart disease link as well. In particular, people who have generalized anxiety disorder (see ""Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder"") seem to suffer higher rates of heart attack and other cardiac events. The effect is more pronounced in people who already have a diagnosis of heart disease, and the risk rises with the intensity and frequency of anxiety symptoms. There are several theories about how constant anxiety of this type may affect the cardiovascular system. Anxiety disorders can change the body's stress response, the combination of hormonal and physiological reactions that helps all animals fight or flee from a real threat. People with anxiety disorders have inappropriate ups and downs that can cause high blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances, or heart attack. A malfunctioning stress response promotes inflammation, which damages the artery linings and sets the stage for the buildup of coronary plaque. People with anxiety also have low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, and lower levels may be linked to a higher risk of heart disease. The presence of anxiety and depression also appears to make platelets ""stickier,"" so blood is more likely to clot. The connection between anxiety and heart health also travels in the other direction. A diagnosis of heart problems is likely to raise a person's baseline anxiety. In addition, people who are anxious may also have adopted unhealthy habits (like smoking or overeating) that add to cardiac risk. There's still much to be learned about how anxiety affects the heart. But its harmful effects—along with stress and depression—should not be ignored. Treating anxiety The choice of treatment for anxiety depends on a number of factors, such as its severity, which symptoms are dominant, and other health conditions. The primary approaches for treating anxiety entail talk therapies and medications. Very often, doctors recommend a dual approach that combines psychotherapy and medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy, the most studied technique, helps you identify automatic negative thoughts, understand why they aren't rational, and come up with ways to limit destructive thoughts and reinforce positive ones. Depending on an individual's needs, other types of psychotherapy may be recommended. Relaxation exercises, biofeedback, and meditation are other pill-free techniques for managing anxiety. Many people find relief by taking antidepressant medicines, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). These are especially useful in people also burdened by depression. However, when seeking medication for anxiety, be sure to discuss your cardiovascular condition with your doctor to avoid adverse effects and undesirable drug interactions. Don't forget regular exercise, after your doctor gives you the go-ahead. It's good for your heart and also helps to boost your mood and calm your nerves.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/thyroid-hormone-how-it-affects-your-heart,Thyroid hormone: How it affects your heart,1,"Image: Sciero/Getty Images The thyroid gland, which wraps around the windpipe, releases hormones that have wide-ranging effects on the body. Too little or too much of this crucial hormone can contribute to heart problems. Located at the base your throat, the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland releases hormones that affect every organ in your body—especially your heart. Thyroid hormone influences the force and speed of your heartbeat, your blood pressure, and your cholesterol level. As a result, a malfunctioning thyroid gland can cause problems that masquerade as heart disease or make existing heart disease worse. An estimated 6% of people in the United States have thyroid disease. Most of them—about 80%— have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism. When thyroid levels drop, all the systems in the body slow down, triggering a range of symptoms that include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry skin. But these symptoms are very common in people as they grow older, including those with normal thyroid levels. More than half of people with normal thyroid function have symptoms of hypothyroidism. In addition, some people over age 60 with low thyroid levels don't have the classic symptoms. That's why recognizing hypothyroidism can be particularly tricky, he adds. Certain factors make people more likely to have thyroid problems. Hypothyroidism: The cardiac connection Hypothyroidism can affect the heart and circulatory system in a number of ways. Insufficient thyroid hormone slows your heart rate. Because it also makes the arteries less elastic, blood pressure rises in order to circulate blood around the body. Elevated cholesterol levels, which contribute to narrowed, hardened arteries, are another possible consequence of low thyroid levels. Another noncardiac symptom—muscle aches—may also be relevant. Muscle aches can be a symptom of hypothyroidism as well as a side effect of cholesterol-lowering statin medications, a condition known as statin-related myalgia. In fact, research suggests that hypothyroidism is more common in people who can't tolerate statins. Sometimes treating hypothyroidism helps relieve statin-related myalgia. Hyperthyroidism: Excess thyroid hormone The opposite problem, hyperthyroidism, or too much thyroid hormone, is far less common, affecting less than 1% of the population. But it, too, can harm the heart. The classic symptoms include sleeplessness, heat intolerance, excess sweating, weight loss, extreme hunger, and loose bowels. Excess thyroid hormone also causes the heart to beat harder and faster and may trigger abnormal heart rhythms. One is atrial fibrillation, a disorganized rhythm in the heart's upper chambers. A related symptom is palpitations, a sudden awareness of your heartbeat. People with hyperthyroidism may also have high blood pressure. In a person with clogged, stiff heart arteries, the combination of a forceful heartbeat and elevated blood pressure may lead to chest pain or angina. Who's at risk for thyroid problems? The following factors affect your odds of having a thyroid problem: The following factors affect your odds of having a thyroid problem: Family history. People whose first-degree relatives (parents or siblings) have an underactive or overactive thyroid face a higher risk of a similar problem. Gender. Women are five to eight times more likely to have thyroid problems than men. Age. The prevalence of hypothyroidism rises with age, especially after age 60. Race. Whites have higher rates of hypothyroidism than Hispanic Americans and African Americans. Health history. Thyroid problems are more likely among people with a personal or family history of certain conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, premature gray hair, radiation treatments to the head and neck, and vitiligo.",9,0.30988738,-0.21873799
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-we-reduce-vascular-plaque-buildup,Can we reduce plaque buildup in arteries?,1,"Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body, High blood levels of cholesterol encourage the formation and growth of vascular plaques that put you at risk for heart attack and stroke. What causes arterial plaque? Plaque forms when cholesterol lodges in the wall of the artery. To fight back, the body sends white blood cells to trap the cholesterol, which then turn into foamy cells that ooze more fat and cause more inflammation. That triggers muscle cells in the artery wall to multiply and form a cap over the area. But the soft plaque beneath the cap is dangerous. For example, if your blood pressure spikes, it puts pressure on the thin wall of the plaque, which can break open, form a clot, and cause a heart attack. Most major heart attacks occur when plaques rupture. Plaques that gradually enlarge over time are often covered by thick, fibrous caps that can resist breaking apart. They can still block blood flow, causing angina (chest pain brought on by exertion or emotional stress). These blockages can also lead to different type of heart attack. Can you unclog your arteries, or reduce plaque buildup? Making plaque disappear is not possible, but with lifestyle changes and medication they can shrink and stabilize. Doctors especially want to target the softer plaques before they rupture. For example, if you have a 30% blockage in the artery from soft plaque, the goal is to try to suck out the cholesterol from the inside, so the plaque shrivels down to 15% and leaves nothing inside it. How do you get the cholesterol out of the plaque? By lowering levels of cholesterol in the blood, where it travels inside particles called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) deposits cholesterol into blood vessel walls. The drugs used most often to reduce LDL cholesterol levels are statins — such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Statins block the liver enzyme that promotes cholesterol production. Very intensive lifestyle changes have also been shown to shrink plaque. Those lifestyle modifications include: Eating a Mediterranean diet It can reduce heart disease risk by 30%. It is rich in olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts and fish; low in red or processed meats; and moderate in the amounts of cheese and wine you can consume. Kicking the habit Smoking damages the lining of the arteries. Quitting can help raise HDL levels. Exercising Aerobic exercise can raise HDL, lower blood pressure, burn body fat, and lower blood sugar levels. Exercise combined with weight loss can also lower LDL levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise. Busting the cholesterol myth Why you can't live without this tricky substance. Cholesterol is often vilified as the bad guy, but we need this waxy, fatty substance to make vitamin D, hormones, bile that aids digestion, and the coverings of our cells. The liver produces 75% of the body's cholesterol, but all cells have the ability to make it. When cells need more cholesterol, the liver sends it via the bloodstream in packages made of cholesterol on the inside and protein on the outside. These cholesterol-laden particles are known as low-density lipoprotein, or LDL. Too much LDL in the blood can cause cholesterol to lodge in the artery walls and form plaques. That's why LDL is known as ""bad"" cholesterol. Whereas LDL particles deposit cholesterol into plaques of atherosclerosis, some high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles help remove cholesterol from plaques. That's why it's often referred to as ""good"" cholesterol. How much HDL and LDL should you aim for? An HDL of 60 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or greater is associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Your personal goal for LDL depends on your cardiovascular risk profile. For people who have coronary artery disease or other evidence of cardiovascular disease, the goal is an LDL of less than 70 mg/dL and some doctors are now aiming for an LDL of less than 55 mg/dL.

The aching, throbbing pain can be debilitating and result in missed appointments, work, or time with family and friends. Regardless of whether you are prone to migraines, tension headaches, or cluster headaches (see ""Is this your headache?""), you may be able to reduce their frequency by identifying what brings them on. Here's a look at the most common triggers for each of these kinds of headaches. Stress Stress can cause tight muscles in the shoulders and neck, which often leads to tension headaches. When tension headaches become frequent, the pain in shoulder and neck muscles is felt by the brain as pain in the head. Hunger itself can trigger a migraine or tension headache. But eating certain foods may trigger migraines. It could be just one type of food — like beans or nuts — or many foods, such as avocados, bananas, cheese, chocolate, citrus, herring, dairy products, and onions. Processed foods with nitrites, nitrates, yellow food dyes, or monosodium glutamate can be especially problematic. Alcohol intake Alcohol is a common migraine trigger. For some people, a few ounces of red wine are all it takes to provoke a headache, although any kind of alcohol can be a trigger. It's not clear if the alcohol itself is to blame or if another component in the drink causes the problem. Environment Environmental factors such as bright light, smoke, humidity, intense scents, or cold weather are associated with migraine headaches. People with cluster headaches often note that their headaches occur with specific seasonal changes. Hormones Changes in estrogen levels are associated with migraines in women, and women suffer from migraines more often than men. Menstrual cycles may be tied to migraine in younger women. Varying estrogen levels during perimenopause can sometimes start migraines in women who never experienced them before. Estrogen therapy may also be a migraine trigger. Menopause does seem to end migraines in most women. Caffeine withdrawal If you normally consume caffeine in coffee or tea, stopping intake abruptly may trigger a migraine. This may be because caffeine causes blood vessels to constrict; without caffeine, the blood vessels widen and bulge out with each heartbeat — a chief reason for the pounding pain of migraines. Lack of sleep A lack of sleep is associated with migraines and tension headaches. For people with migraine, falling asleep can often stop an attack or at least decrease the severity of pain. Is this your headache? Here are three common types of headaches and their symptoms. Tension headache. Pain often starts in the neck and back and works its way up to feel like a tight band around your head. It often goes away with rest. Migraine headache. Pain typically begins on one side of the head, throbs or pounds, and makes you sensitive to light and sound. It may cause nausea. A migraine can last for hours or days. Cluster headache. A cluster headache feels like a stabbing pain in the eye. It may cause eye tearing or redness, runny nose, or nasal congestion. It may last for a few minutes or hours, go away, and come back several times per day. These headache clusters can occur for months, disappear, and reappear a long time later. What you can do Understanding your headache triggers can help you avoid getting headaches in the future. But identifying triggers can be tricky, especially if you have more than one (like several kinds of food). Try keeping a diary to note the day, time, symptoms, and circumstances surrounding a headache (what had you eaten? where did it happen?). If avoiding triggers isn't enough to keep headaches at bay, talk to your doctor. There are many prescription medications as well as pill-free treatments (acupuncture, meditation, biofeedback, relaxation therapy) that can help reduce headache frequency. And you'll need to go a step further: Make sure you get enough sleep, exercise, eat a healthy diet, limit alcohol intake, and reduce stress. Headaches are a condition of hypersensitivity, so you need balance in your system to fight triggers. Image: © peterschreiber.media/Getty Images",9,0.37372413,0.06701921

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-lowdown-on-glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load,The lowdown on glycemic index and glycemic load,1,"What are the facts about the glycemic load of foods? If you have diabetes, you probably know you need to monitor your carbohydrate intake. But different carbohydrate-containing foods affect blood sugar differently, and these effects can be quantified by measures known as the glycemic index and glycemic load. You might even have been advised to use these numbers to help plan your diet. But what do these numbers really mean — and just how useful are they? Glycemic index vs. glycemic load The glycemic index (GI) assigns a numeric score to a food based on how drastically it makes your blood sugar rise. Foods are ranked on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure glucose (sugar) given a value of 100. The lower a food's glycemic index, the slower blood sugar rises after eating that food. In general, the more processed a food is, the higher its GI, and the more fiber or fat in a food, the lower it's GI. But the glycemic index tells just part of the story. What it doesn't tell you is how high your blood sugar could go when you actually eat the food. To understand a food's complete effect on blood sugar, you need to know both how quickly it makes glucose enter the bloodstream and how much glucose per serving it can deliver. A separate measure called the glycemic load does both — which gives you a more accurate picture of a food's real-life impact on your blood sugar. Watermelon, for example, has a high glycemic index (80). But a serving of watermelon has so little carbohydrate that its glycemic load is only 5. Glycemic load diet Some nutrition experts believe that people with diabetes should pay attention to both the glycemic index and glycemic load to avoid sudden spikes in blood sugar. The total amount of carbohydrate in a food, rather than its glycemic index or load, is a stronger predictor of what will happen to blood sugar. But some dietitians also feel that focusing on the glycemic index and load adds an unneeded layer of complexity to choosing what to eat. The bottom line? Following the principles of low-glycemic-index eating is likely to be beneficial for people with diabetes. But reaching and staying at a healthy weight is more important for your blood sugar and your overall health. Image: © designer491 | GettyImages",3,0.33745986,0.11011326
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-fats-so-bad,Are fats so bad?,1,"For years, fat was a dirty word in the dietary world. After World War II, large studies established links between saturated fat and heart disease. Most dietary experts advised people to reduce their fat intake, not only because of the heart connection, but also because fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbohydrate and was assumed to contribute more to weight gain. Many people did so, but they often replaced the lost calories with large amounts of carbohydrates— especially refined carbohydrates. They also stopped eating healthy fats, like olive and canola oils. Instead of helping us slim down, the decline in fat consumption was accompanied by higher rates of overweight and obesity. What went awry? As it turns out, the ""all fat is bad"" message was wrong. Foods that contain fat help fill you up, so you stop eating earlier. More important, not all fats are alike. Saturated fat, found mainly in meat and dairy foods, contributes to clogged arteries and cardiovascular disease. But monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in plants and healthful oils, actually protect your health by improving your cholesterol profile. Fat has little direct effect on blood sugar levels. It is a major energy source for your body, and it helps you absorb certain vitamins and nutrients. Another type of fat needed for a variety of vital physiological functions is the family of omega-3 unsaturated fats. Your body can't make these on its own; it must get them from food. Good sources of omega-3s include fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, and mackerel. Flaxseeds, walnuts, wheat germ, canola oil, unhydrogenated soybean oil, and flaxseed oil are also rich in omega-3s. Trans fats are the worst fats for your health. These fats are made when hydrogen is added to healthy unsaturated fats to solidify them and make them less likely to spoil. Trans fats raise harmful LDL cholesterol, lower beneficial HDL cholesterol, increase inflammation, and make blood more likely to clot. The FDA has ruled that ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, the main source of trans fats in the American food supply, are no longer ""generally recognized as safe."" By now, most food companies have stopped using them. But to be sure, look for products that have a zero on the ""trans fat"" line in the Nutrition Facts box.",3,0.3850989,0.17410809
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/surprising-causes-of-neck-pain,Surprising causes of neck pain,1,"A sore neck can dog you in every position — lying down, sitting, standing, or walking — and the discomfort can be debilitating. The pain might come from structural neck problems such as arthritis (worn cartilage at the ends of your neck bones) or degenerated discs (worn cushions between your neck bones). But often the cause is related to strains in the neck muscles, triggered by something subtle in your daily routine. Here are some surprising culprits behind neck pain and strain, plus quick fixes to feel better. Binge-watching a TV show Like to watch back-to-back episodes of your favorite program? You might be holding your neck in an awkward position for hours at a time. ""A lot of people lean way back while they watch TV, extending the neck backward. Or they lean to the side, forcing the neck too far sideways. Both positions can strain neck muscles,"" says David Evangelista, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. You might also be interested in... Rheumatoid Arthritis: How to protect your joints, reduce pain, and improve mobility This Special Health Report, Rheumatoid Arthritis: How to protect your joints, reduce pain and improve mobility, gives you the information you need to work with your physician to design a treatment plan. You’ll learn how rheumatoid arthritis affects joints and how it is diagnosed and treated, as well as the variety of symptoms that may occur. You'll find information on established medical therapies as well as complementary treatments such as acupuncture, yoga, and dietary supplements. A special section provides advice about how to care for yourself through adaptations in your personal and work life, useful gadgets, and smoking cessation. LEARN MORE Quick fixes: ""Use a horseshoe-shaped travel pillow that goes around your neck when you lean back to watch TV. If you lean to the side, use more pillows to fill the gap between your head and shoulders. And change your position every 15 or 20 minutes to give your neck a break, so it doesn't get stiff,"" Evangelista says. Leaning forward You might lean forward throughout the day, whether that's toward a computer monitor that's hard to see or toward another person during a conversation. If you extend your neck each time, that can strain the muscles and cause pain. Quick fixes: If you're going to lean, keep your back straight and tilt forward at your hips. If you can't see your computer monitor well, pull it closer to you or increase the font size. If you have eyeglasses for reading or distance vision, see if they help. If they don't help enough, you can get glasses just for using a computer. If you don't use eyeglasses, get an eye exam: you may need a pair. Similarly, if you lean forward a lot to hear people in conversation, consider getting a hearing test. Wearing a flimsy bra Wearing a bra with little support makes your muscles and ligaments do all the heavy lifting. For someone with heavy breasts, the extra weight can pull the neck forward and stress the neck and shoulder muscles, leading to neck and back pain. Quick fixes: Get a better bra. Make sure both the underwire and middle section of the bra lie flat against your body, the cups aren't too tight or too loose, and the band is level across your back and doesn't ride up. Or try a sports bra or posture bra that brings the weight of the breasts closer to your ribcage and distributes it across your torso. Sleeping in risky positions Sleeping seems harmless, but some sleep positions pose big risks for the neck. When you sleep on your stomach, for example, you rotate your head to the side. Sleeping on your side without the right support pushes your neck toward your shoulder. Staying in these positions for hours can cause neck muscle strain and pain. You might also be interested in...

If you have osteoarthritis, you can take steps to protect your joints, reduce discomfort, and improve mobility — all of which are detailed in this Special Health Report, Living Well with Osteoarthritis: A guide to keeping your joints healthy. If you don't have osteoarthritis, the report offers strategies for preventing it. Read More Quick fixes. Avoid sleeping on your stomach. And if you're a side sleeper, check the support under your neck. ""Lie on your side with your head on your pillow. If you can easily slide your hand in the space between your head and shoulders, you're not getting enough support at night. Get a new pillow to fill the gap. Any material will do,"" Evangelista says. Sitting ""comfortably"" For many people, sitting comfortably means slouching, which is bad for your neck and back. ""Poor posture puts abnormal strain on the spine, including the neck and the ligaments holding it together, and that can cause pain,"" Evangelista says. Quick fixes: Sit up straight: pull your chin back, lower your shoulders, and arch your back. If that's challenging at first, sit on the edge of your chair for a few minutes, which makes sitting up straight a little easier, and then sit farther back on the seat. If your budget allows, get an ergonomic desk chair with low-back support, adjustable height, and a thick seat cushion. Looking at electronic screens We all spend a lot of time looking at electronic devices. For example, you might be looking up at a TV mounted on a wall, or down at a smartphone or laptop. The trouble is that your head is heavy; angling it up or down for a long time leads to muscle strain and pain. Quick fixes: Keep TVs, smartphones, and computer screens at eye level. Consider lowering the height of your TV, elevating your computer screen by putting it on a small stand, or raising your smartphone screen by putting it on a stand or a pillow on your lap. ""Wearing a travel pillow around your neck can add neck support,"" Evangelista says. Lifting heavy dumbbells Evangelista says many people lift dumbbells that are too heavy. ""That throws off your body mechanics. Your trapezius muscles in the back overcompensate. They're connected to the neck, and the overuse can cause neck pain,"" he says. You might also be interested in... The Joint Pain Relief Workout: Healing exercises for your shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles Is joint pain holding you back?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-almost-last-word-on-alcohol-and-health,The (almost) last word on alcohol and health,1,"New information has again opened the debate about what role, if any, alcohol plays in health. Is a moderate amount good for your heart? Can you still enjoy the occasional beverage, or should you become a teetotaler as you age? Like so much in life, it's complicated. ""There's good evidence that, in general, moderate drinkers who average one to two drinks a day tend to live longer,"" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition and director of the Program in Cardiovascular Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Whether that is directly linked with alcohol, other lifestyle factors, or some combination is still being explored."" Different findings Why might alcohol be healthy? It's thought that moderate intake helps raise levels of ""good"" HDL cholesterol, higher amounts of which are associated with a lower risk for heart disease. Alcohol also may discourage the formation of small blood clots that can lead to heart attacks and stroke. Still, new studies have cast doubt on the connection between alcohol and good health. For instance, a meta-analysis (that is, a study based on data collected in multiple earlier trials) published in March 2023 in JAMA Network Open concluded that low-volume drinkers (1.3 to 24 grams of alcohol daily, or less than two standard drinks) did not live longer than people who never drank. Medium-volume drinking (25 to 44 grams, about two to three daily standard drinks) also didn't offer significant health protection. Rimm is quick to pump the brakes on this and similar conclusions based on data from multiple studies. ""New findings do not mean that everything else that came before is wrong,"" he says. ""The problem with these studies is that they combine good and poor research. So, it's difficult to make a conclusion with information where alcohol is assessed so differently. For many studies they completely ignored measuring drinking patterns."" Another issue is that most alcohol-related studies are observational — that is, they can show an association, but not cause and effect. Other factors linked with alcohol intake may contribute to drinkers' well-being. For instance, a study published in March 2022 in JAMA Network Open found that moderate drinkers had the lowest heart disease risk compared with nondrinkers, suggesting that some alcohol intake may benefit heart health. Yet the research team also discovered that light-to-moderate drinkers had healthier lifestyles than abstainers. They were more physically active, ate more vegetables and less red meat, and didn't smoke as much. Glass half full What seems clear in most research supporting the health benefits of alcohol is that the amount is key. Light to moderate intake remains the best advice. The CDC classifies moderate alcohol intake for adult men as two standard drinks or fewer on days when they drink. A standard drink is approximately 12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol by volume, or ABV), 8 to 9 ounces of malt liquor (7% ABV), 5 ounces of wine (12% ABV), or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits (40% ABV). (See ""What is a standard drink?"".) Of course, most people don't drink daily, and some may go for long periods without alcohol. ""But even occasional drinkers may still receive some benefits,"" says Rimm. Does the type of alcohol matter? Not really. Your body reacts to alcohol the same way whether it comes from a California wine, Scotch whiskey, or craft beer. ""The differences between beverages are the percentage of alcohol,"" says Rimm. (To more accurately analyze your drink's alcohol content per serving size, use this drink calculator from the National Institutes of Health: /size.) Your choice of beverage can have adverse health effects unrelated to the alcohol. For instance, a gin-and-tonic cocktail contains high amounts of sugar, and most beer is high in carbohydrates and calories. One part of the alcohol debate everyone agrees on is not drinking too much. ""Studies have found that regularly drinking beyond the recommended amount can raise a person's risk for numerous health problems, like liver failure, high blood pressure, heart failure, and several types of cancer,"" says Rimm. Also, avoid regular excessive drinking and binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on one occasion). Last call So what is the conclusion? According to Rimm, if you don't drink, there is no reason to begin. If you only occasionally drink, don't increase your intake for health reasons. But for the casual or regular drinker, it's fine to enjoy an alcoholic beverage — in moderation. But you should also weigh your alcohol intake with your overall heart health, adds Rimm. For example, if you have high blood pressure, you may want to drink less or abstain from drinking and focus on getting your blood pressure under control. ""If you have any health issues, it's best to speak with your doctor about what is the proper amount of alcohol for you,"" says Rimm. Image: © Chris Ryan/Getty Images",1,0.28667575,-0.19248512
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-are-you-coughing-at-night,Why are you coughing at night?,1,"Some people don't cough during the day, but then start hacking once they're in bed. Several conditions can cause this, and some have a common culprit: gravity. Common triggers Several health issues are associated with nighttime coughing. These are some of the most common: Postnasal drip. Postnasal drip describes a constant trickle of mucus from the upper airways — the sinuses and throat. ""In the daytime, when you're upright, these fluids drain naturally with the help of gravity, and you swallow and clear them. When you lie down, you lose the help of gravity, and mucus collects at the back of the throat. If mucus lands on the vocal cords in the throat, or if you inhale some mucus and it enters the lungs, it triggers a wet cough that produces phlegm or mucus,"" explains Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (otolaryngologist) at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Stomach acid generally is squeezed down into the intestine when the stomach contracts, or is pulled down by gravity. However, when the circular muscle between the stomach and the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) fails to tighten properly, acid can squirt back up, irritating the lining of the esophagus and structures in the throat. This backwash is called reflux. When you lie down, acid doesn't flow naturally into the intestine and can reflux even more easily. ""When acid gets on the vocal cords, you start to cough. In severe cases, acid gets into the windpipe and causes wheezing,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. GERD can cause a dry cough that may or may not be accompanied by a burning feeling (heartburn) or pain in your chest. Medication side effects. Some drugs — for example, ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril, others) or enalapril (Vasotec), which are used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease — can cause a frequent, dry cough as a side effect. ""In the daytime it might feel more like a need to clear your throat. At night, it's much worse,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. Heart failure. Heart failure is the term for a gradual decline in the heart's ability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. ""When the heart isn't pumping well, fluid backs up and seeps into other tissues. In the daytime, when you're upright, gravity forces the fluid into the lower extremities. When you lie down, some fluid builds up in the lungs, which makes you cough,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. ""A dry cough at night may be one of the first signs of heart failure."" What you should do When a new nighttime cough lasts more than a few weeks, see your doctor to rule out the most dangerous causes, like heart failure. Your doctor can also review your prescriptions for potential side effects that might lead to a cough, and swap out a medication if necessary. Those causes aren't too hard to suss out. ""But it can take a bit of trial and error to figure out if GERD or postnasal drip is causing nighttime coughing. I'll typically recommend a month of treatment for one or the other, depending on symptoms, and see if the person gets better,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. ""If one avenue doesn't work, we can try the other. It's better than doing an expensive diagnostic test that requires anesthesia."" GERD treatment involves dietary modifications (avoiding foods and drinks that seem to make your GERD symptoms worse) plus drugs that suppress acid, such as omeprazole (Prilosec). For postnasal drip, treatment involves medication that either thins mucus secretions (so they flow more easily and don't go in wrong places) or dries up mucus production (to decrease the volume of secretions). Other things you can do In addition to medical treatment, these strategies might help reduce nighttime coughing: Sleep on a wedge pillow. The elevation helps you swallow secretions better and makes it harder for stomach acid to reflux. Use a room humidifier. ""This is especially helpful in the winter, when dry air makes secretions thicker. A humidifier can break them up and thin them out,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. Stay upright after eating. Wait an hour or two before you lie down. Keep cough drops handy. If you wake up coughing, sit up and (when possible) suck on a cough drop to calm an irritated throat. Try some honey. Have a teaspoon of honey, or put some in a cup of decaffeinated tea. Some people find that honey can soothe a sore throat and suppress a cough. And at the very least, it can be a comforting treat.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/does-coffee-help-or-harm-your-heart,Does coffee help or harm your heart?,1,"Many people can't imagine starting their day without a cup or two of coffee. Despite its popularity, however, coffee has been a bit controversial when it comes to heart health. ""The thinking about coffee's effects on the heart has swung in both directions,"" says Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In the 1960s, coffee was considered a risk factor for coronary artery disease, although later research suggested that only heavy coffee consumption (more than five or six cups a day) might harm the heart. But people who drink excessive amounts of coffee often differ in many other ways from those who enjoy modest amounts, Dr. Gaziano notes. A java jolt? Because coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant, people have long wondered whether drinking coffee might ""jazz up"" the heart, triggering palpitations (the odd sensation of a skipped, missed, or strong heartbeat) or atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm problem marked by a rapid, irregular heartbeat). However, people who drink moderate amounts of coffee (one to three cups per day) actually appear to have a lower risk of atrial fibrillation, according to a 2019 study co-authored by Dr. Gaziano. Those who drank either more or less coffee were no more or less likely to develop atrial fibrillation, the study found. Like a lot of dietary research, that study was observational: people reported what they consumed and researchers tracked their health over many years. But a new study took a different approach — it directly measured the short-term effects of drinking coffee (see ""The coffee connection: More steps, less sleep, possible palpitations?""). The coffee connection: More steps, less sleep, possible palpitations? Many coffee drinkers appreciate the energizing buzz from a morning cup of joe. But does that boost have any short-term effects on the heart or other heart-related behaviors or risk factors — namely, exercise, sleep, and blood sugar levels? To find out, researchers put wearable sensors on volunteers for a two-week period. Their study, the Coffee and Real-time Atrial and Ventricular Ectopy (CRAVE) trial, was published March 23, 2023, in The New England Journal of Medicine. (Atrial and ventricular ectopy refers to premature contractions of the heart's upper or lower chambers. People typically experience these as strong, fast, or irregular heartbeats, known as palpitations.) Who: 100 healthy men and women, average age 39. What: Participants wore three separate devices: one that tracked activity levels and sleep, one that measured blood sugar, and one that monitored heart rhythm. They were also tested for common genetic variants that affect how quickly people metabolize caffeine. How: Researchers directed participants to drink as much caffeinated coffee as they wanted for two days and to activate the heart monitor after every cup they drank. They were then to abstain from coffee for two days. They repeated this cycle for 14 days. Key findings: On the days people drank coffee, they took an average of 1,000 extra steps per day. But they slept about 36 fewer minutes per night, on average. Coffee drinking had no apparent effect on blood sugar levels. And while coffee consumption did not increase premature atrial contractions, it did appear to slightly increase the incidence of premature ventricular contractions. Genetic differences in caffeine metabolism had no meaningful effects on any of these outcomes. Steps and sleep ""This new trial provides an important piece of the puzzle,"" says Dr. Gaziano. One finding — that people took more steps on coffee-drinking days — upholds other research showing that caffeine can slightly enhance physical performance. On the other hand, caffeine's adverse effects on sleep are also well known, and insufficient sleep is increasingly recognized as a risk to cardiovascular health. It's hard to know whether the extra exercise balances out the decreased shut-eye people may get from drinking coffee. Most people know how they react to coffee and adjust their intake accordingly, says Dr. Gaziano, who enjoys a daily cup that contains half decaffeinated coffee. Limitations of the study But like all studies, the new study has limitations. For instance, it included only relatively young, healthy coffee drinkers. So the findings may not apply to older people, who tend to be more likely to have palpitations. In fact, people who avoid coffee (and so weren't part of the study) may avoid the beverage because they notice it triggers palpitations. Other heart-related effects The study also discovered that drinking coffee led to a slight increase in premature ventricular contractions. These brief rhythm disruptions (which can feel as though the heart is pounding or flip-flopping) are common and usually harmless, especially in healthy people. However, people with heart disease who notice persistent, odd heart rhythms should talk to their doctor. Earlier research has investigated coffee's effects on other common heart-related risks. Although drinking coffee raises blood pressure, the effect is temporary and doesn't make you more likely to develop high blood pressure; it may even lower your risk. Unfiltered coffee, such as French press coffee and espresso, contains compounds that may raise harmful LDL cholesterol. But the effect is likely trivial compared with the rest of your diet, especially if you drink no more than two cups of unfiltered coffee daily. ""The question I have is, what is the overall impact on the outcome I care most about, which is cardiovascular disease?"" says Dr. Gaziano. When you look at the evidence as a whole, coffee doesn't seem to have a positive or negative effect, he says. If you like coffee, enjoy up to a few cups per day — as long as it's not interfering with your sleep. And don't dump a lot of cream and sugar into your coffee, since that adds saturated fat and empty calories, he adds. Image: © PeopleImages/Getty Images",1,0.2384881,-0.13996027
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/keep-midday-naps-to-less-than-30-minutes,Keep midday naps to less than 30 minutes,1,"The health benefits of taking afternoon naps are well documented. They can improve mood, reduce fatigue, and increase alertness. But how long should they last? A study in the May 2023 issue of Obesity suggested the ideal duration is less than 30 minutes. The observational study included 3,275 healthy adults. Baseline health measurements were taken, and participants completed a questionnaire on their napping habits and other lifestyle factors like diet and sleep. The results found that compared with people who did not nap, those who took midday naps lasting 30 minutes or longer had a higher body mass index and levels of cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. By contrast, those who had shorter naps (less than 30 minutes) did not share these risks and were even less likely to have elevated blood pressure than those who never napped. According to the researchers, some of these risks may be the result of long naps disrupting daily circadian rhythms, which can lead to insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes). Another possible connection could be overeating, as many people who napped for longer than 30 minutes reported feeling hungry and craving sweet foods afterward. Does it matter how often you nap? All afternoon nappers, no matter how long they slept, averaged about four naps per week, but the researchers found no link between frequency and higher health risks. So, enjoy your afternoon naps, but keep them under 30 minutes, and don't nap too late in the afternoon, as it could interfere with your night's sleep.

You misplace your phone (which was just in your hand). You lose your train of thought during a conversation. You forget directions five minutes after being told. You can't remember the day, but then it pops into your head. These memory slips can be embarrassing and stressful, but are they normal mental lapses — or early signs of dementia? ""The brain is like any other part of the body, and over time, it may not function as well,"" says Ana Trueba Yepez, a psychologist with the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Brain regions involved with memory — like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex — can shrink, which makes it more difficult to multitask, stay focused, and hold on to information."" The good news is that these kinds of memory lapses are not automatic red flags for dementia. ""These episodes can be alarming, but for the most part, they are not something to worry about,"" says Trueba Yepez. Look for warning signs Senior moments may come and go. It's when they become more frequent or severe or if new cognitive issues emerge that they may signal a problem. For example, during conversations, you now have difficulty following conversations. Or you cut off people when they talk or begin discussing something unrelated to the conversation. Another warning sign is when memory lapses begin to interfere with daily life. For instance, you miss scheduled appointments, forget to pay bills, or fail to take regular medication. You may also have difficulty making decisions and forget regular grooming. ""Many times, people are not aware that memory issues have worsened,"" says Trueba Yepez. ""If you suspect any changes, no matter how innocent, it's best to ask family or friends to look for and point out changes in your memory, with examples."" Still, even these changes are not an automatic indicator of dementia. Sometimes, other factors like diet, alcohol use, medication, and mental problems (such as depression and anxiety) affect your memory. ""Many times, these issues show up in other ways besides memory problems, such as eating more unhealthy foods, showing less interest in your favorite activities, and not keeping up with hygiene and personal appearance,"" says Trueba Yepez. Manage your memory with DANCERS Enhance your memory and protect against dementia with DANCERS: D: Disease management. Control your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. A: Activity. Cardio exercise improves oxygen and blood flow to the brain. N: Nutrition. Poor nutrition leads to poor brain health. Adopt a plant-based diet. C: Cognitive stimulation. The more you engage your brain, the more likely you can retain memory. E: Engagement. Social isolation is linked to lower cognitive function. R: Relaxation. Your brain needs downtime. Do relaxing activities like yoga, meditation, or reading. S: Sleep. Sleep is when your brain cleans out toxins. Get seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Seeking help A primary care doctor is your first point of contact if you, or someone else, suspects a problem. As scary as it may seem to confront changes in memory, there are many benefits to taking a proactive approach, including these: Ruling out other causes. A medical evaluation can help determine if symptoms are related to a condition, like depression, anxiety, or insomnia. Other factors also can affect memory, such as an infection, a new medication, or an unintended interaction between a prescription drug and an over-the-counter product. Addressing the underlying problem may lead to improved memory. Discovering a problem early. Memory issues could be related to a series of tiny strokes that produce only subtle symptoms, such as short episodes of confusion. In these episodes, small arteries in the brain become narrowed or clogged with fatty deposits, decreasing blood flow. ""The brain damage is often so small and subtle that most people don't notice it or shrug it off,"" says Trueba Yepez. It's important to spot this problem as early as possible to prevent it from progressing to a condition called vascular dementia. Certain medications, such as statins and low-dose aspirin, and lifestyle changes may help prevent further cognitive decline. Getting help sooner. If your doctor may refer you for a neuropsychological evaluation to assesses other cognitive skills, such as attention, executive function, and language. If you are diagnosed with early dementia, it's best to catch it sooner than later, so you can begin to manage the condition. Image: © LaylaBird/Getty Images",1,0.12731224,-0.30529323

The international study, published online April 5, 2023, by Neurology, involved nearly 4,500 people (average age 62). About half of the group had already experienced a stroke. Participants were asked about their sleep behaviors over the prior month, including how many hours they usually slept, impaired sleep quality, and napping habits, as well as snoring, snorting, and other breathing problems during sleep. Too little sleep was defined as less than five hours nightly, while too much sleep was defined as more than nine hours. Each of the sleep symptoms raised stroke risk, but participants who reported five or more symptoms were five times likelier to have had a stroke compared with those who had no sleep issues. The results held even after the researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect stroke risk, such as smoking, physical activity level, depression, and alcohol consumption. The results suggest sleep problems should be factored into stroke prevention efforts, the study authors said. You might also be interested in...

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/9-gerd-symptoms-to-know,9 GERD symptoms to know,1,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic medical condition that occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus — the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. This usually happens because the ringlike muscles that prevent backflow don't work properly. Common symptoms of GERD Two of the most common symptoms of GERD are heartburn and regurgitation. Many people experience both symptoms. However, some people can experience one without the other. Heartburn Heartburn can feel like a sharp, painful burning in the upper abdomen or middle of the chest, behind the breastbone. This is the most common symptom of GERD, and can rise up from the lower tip of the breastbone toward your throat. Heartburn may be worse when you eat, bend over, or lie down. Regurgitation Regurgitation is the backflow of stomach contents through your esophagus and into your throat or mouth. This may cause you to taste food or stomach acid. Other symptoms of GERD While chronic heartburn and regurgitation are common symptoms of GERD, you may experience one or more less common symptoms of the disease. Not all adults with GERD experience heartburn or regurgitation. Other symptoms of GERD may include: nausea difficulty swallowing (food sticks going down) or pain while swallowing (as food goes down) recurring sour or bitter taste in the mouth chronic cough hoarseness sore throat chest pain, or tightness in your chest or upper abdomen that may wake you up in the middle of the night. What health conditions can be mistaken with GERD? Pain that feels like heartburn also can be a symptom of a heart attack. In fact, the classic symptom of both heartburn and heart disease is discomfort in the center of the chest. Of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn (GERD) accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out. While heartburn is more likely to appear after a large or spicy meal, heart attacks are more common after physical exertion or stress. But if you're unsure, seek medical help right away. When should I see a doctor about GERD? You should see a doctor if you think you have GERD, or if your symptoms don't get better with over-the-counter medicines such as antacids or lifestyle changes. By seeing your doctor early, the physical cause of GERD can be treated, and more serious problems avoided. Always see a doctor if you have symptoms that could indicate GERD complications or other serious health problems, such as: chest pain loss of appetite persistent vomiting problems swallowing or pain while swallowing signs of bleeding in the digestive tract, such as vomit that contains blood or looks like coffee groundsstool that contains blood or looks black and tarry unexplained weight loss. If you think you may be having a heart attack, go to the emergency room. Up to 20% of the US population has GERD. GERD is more common among older adults, obese persons, and pregnant women.",9,0.32276884,-0.031957112
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/gerd-diet-foods-to-avoid-to-reduce-acid-reflux,GERD diet: Foods to avoid to reduce acid reflux,1,"One of the most effective lifestyle changes you can make to prevent the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is to ensure your diet and eating habits do not trigger symptoms. Foods to avoid for GERD While people with acid reflux were once instructed to stick to bland foods, that's no longer the case. There are many healthy and delicious foods you can eat if you have GERD, as well as many interesting ways to prepare them. Still, some foods are more likely to trigger reflux and heartburn. Reflux-triggering foods include: Fatty and fried foods, which linger longer in the stomach, making it more likely that stomach acid leaks back up into the esophagus, causing uncomfortable GERD symptoms. Spicy foods, citrus, tomato sauces, and vinegar, which may intensify heartburn. Chocolate, caffeine, onions, peppermint, carbonated drinks, and alcohol, which are all common heartburn triggers. If you eat any of these foods regularly, try eliminating them to see if doing so reduces your reflux. Then you can try adding them back one by one. Best foods for GERD When making food choices, some foods have been found to be less reflux-triggering. The following foods may help you ease or avoid symptoms. Non-citrus fruits. While you should avoid citrus fruits, you can enjoy non-citrus fruits such as bananas, melons, apples, and pears, among others. Vegetables. Try to eat your vegetables raw. While tomato sauce may bother you, a fresh tomato may not. Lean meats. Lean meats that are grilled, poached, broiled, or baked are your best options. Try using fresh herbs, rather than spices, to make them flavorful. Oatmeal, whole-grain bread, rice, and couscous. These are all good sources of healthy complex carbs and fiber. Unsaturated fats from plants and fish. Replace saturated fats and trans fats with oils such as olive, sesame, canola, sunflower, and safflower; avocados; nuts and seeds; soybean; and fatty fish such as salmon and trout. Best GERD eating habits Besides specific types of foods, changes to eating habits can also help to prevent repeated bouts of heartburn and acid reflux. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Do not lie down after eating. This means no naps right after lunch. When you're standing or sitting, gravity helps keeps acid in the stomach, where it belongs. Do not eat during the three to four hours before you go to bed. So, no late suppers or midnight snacks. Avoid vigorous exercise for a couple of hours after eating. A strenuous workout can send acid into your esophagus. If you're taking medication to help control your symptoms, it's probably okay to have a ""trigger"" food occasionally. But you should generally avoid foods that once caused heartburn.",0,0.38657016,0.14732206
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercise-and-your-arteries,Exercise and your arteries,1,"More than 300 years ago, the great English physician Thomas Sydenham observed, ""A man is as old as his arteries."" It's as true today as it was then. And in a 21st-century update on 17th-century wisdom, we might add that your health is only as good as your arteries, since these blood vessels carry vital oxygen-rich blood to all your body's tissues. Today we also know that regular exercise is one of the best ways to maintain artery health. Your arteries Doctors used to think of arteries as passive conduits for blood, working for your body the way a garden hose works for your lawn. Wrong! In fact, arteries are complex structures with crucial regulatory functions, and they are in the front line of the battle for cardiovascular health. Every artery has three layers in its wall. The inner layer, or intima, is composed of a thin layer of endothelial cells that are in direct contact with the bloodstream. The middle layer, or media, is composed chiefly of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers. The outermost layer, or adventitia, is made up of supporting tissues that are dense and strong in larger arteries but nearly absent in the delicate blood vessels of the brain. Endothelial cells have a crucial role in vascular health, and exercise has an important effect on endothelial cells. If all the endothelial cells in your body were placed side by side, they would cover a football field; together, they weigh more than three pounds. Among other things, endothelial cells produce a molecule called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has two crucial functions. It keeps the arterial lining smooth and slippery, preventing white blood cells and platelets from latching on and causing damaging inflammation and artery-blocking blood clots. In addition, it relaxes the smooth muscle cells of the artery wall's middle layer, preventing spasms and keeping arteries open. Movement improves artery health Exercising muscles need more blood. And in response to regular exercise, they actually grow more blood vessels by expanding the network of capillaries. In turn, muscle cells boost levels of the enzymes that allow them to use oxygen to generate energy. More oxygen-rich blood and more efficient metabolism: It's the formula that explains why people who exercise regularly enhance their endurance and strength. To find out if exercise can affect arterial aging, scientists in Italy studied four groups of healthy people: young exercisers, young non-exercisers, elderly exercisers, and elderly non-exercisers. Comparing sedentary youths with sedentary senior citizens, they found that age took a substantial toll on endothelial function and nitric oxide production. But in people who exercised regularly, age had a much smaller effect; endothelial function still declined over the years, but there was a much smaller and more gradual drop in nitric oxide production. Indeed, exercise helped keep arteries young. The Italian researchers studied people who biked, ran, or swam at very high levels. But you don't have to be a triathlete to help your arteries stay young; just 2–3 miles of brisk walking nearly every day is a giant step in the right direction. And it's never too late to start. Scientists from the University of Colorado enrolled 20 sedentary men with an average age of 53 in an exercise program that consisted primarily of walking. At the end of three months, the men had improved their endothelial function so much that they achieved results similar to those of middle-aged and older men who had exercised for years. True, the Colorado volunteers were all healthy, but similar studies of patients with coronary artery disease have demonstrated that exercise can produce important gains in endothelial function, even in people who already have atherosclerosis.",1,0.23537503,-0.19610086

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/brain-gut-connection-explains-why-integrative-treatments-can-help-relieve-digestive-ailments-2019041116411,Brain-gut connection explains why integrative treatments can help relieve digestive ailments,1,"During the 20th century, medicine became very good at compartmentalizing different systems of the body in order to understand them better. However, today we are increasingly realizing that different systems of the body are interconnected and cannot be completely understood in isolation. The brain-gut connection is one very important example of this phenomenon. Anatomy of the brain-gut connection What exactly is the connection between brain and gut? The brain sends signals to the digestive, or gastrointestinal (GI), tract via the sympathetic (""fight or flight"") nervous system and the parasympathetic (""rest and digest"") nervous system. The balance of signals from these two inputs can affect the speed at which food moves through the digestive system, absorption of nutrients, secretion of digestive juices, and level of inflammation in the digestive system. The digestive system also has its own nervous system, the enteric nervous system, consisting of approximately 100 million nerve cells in and around the GI tract. The enteric nervous system receives inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems but can also function independently of them. The enteric nervous system is also intimately interconnected with millions of immune cells. These cells survey the digestive system and convey information, such as whether the stomach is bloated or whether there is infection in the GI tract or insufficient blood flow, back to the brain. Thus, the brain and GI system communicate with one another in both directions. Effects of stress and negative emotions on the gut Because of this strong brain-gut connection, stress and a variety of negative emotions such as anxiety, sadness, depression, fear, and anger can all affect the GI system. These triggers can speed up or slow down the movements of the GI tract and the contents within it; make the digestive system overly sensitive to bloating and other pain signals; make it easier for bacteria to cross the gut lining and activate the immune system; increase inflammation in the gut; and change the gut microbiota (the types of bacteria that reside in the gut). That's why stress and strong emotions can contribute to or worsen a variety of GI conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and food allergies and sensitivities. The negative changes in the GI system can then feed back on the brain, creating a vicious cycle. For example, new research is demonstrating that increased gut inflammation and changes in the gut microbiome can have profound effects throughout the body and contribute to fatigue, cardiovascular disease, and depression. Mind-body approaches to GI ailments Given this strong mind-body/brain-gut connection, it should come as no surprise that mind-body tools such as meditation, mindfulness, breathing exercises, yoga, and gut-directed hypnotherapy have all been shown to help improve GI symptoms, improve mood, and decrease anxiety. They decrease the body's stress response by dampening the sympathetic nervous system, enhancing the parasympathetic response, and decreasing inflammation. Other integrative approaches We've also learned that certain kinds of foods can trigger specific reactions in the gut of sensitive individuals. In those cases, specific diets, such as low-FODMAP for IBS or avoiding acidic foods for GERD, can be helpful for managing symptoms. Diet also profoundly affects the gut microbiome. For example, eating a more plant-based diet with few refined carbohydrates and little or no red meat often leads to a healthier microbiome. These dietary changes in turn reduce intestinal inflammation and may help reduce systemic symptoms such as fatigue or depression and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although each person's situation is unique, a combination of integrative approaches can be helpful for reducing GI symptoms and reestablishing both a healthy gut and a healthy mind.",9,0.27568012,0.047112834
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/treating-constipation-with-biofeedback-for-the-pelvic-floor-2019051616638,Treating constipation with biofeedback for the pelvic floor,1,"Constipation is often clinically defined as having three or fewer bowel movements a week. Sometimes this is about expectations; people generally feel like they're not ""healthy"" if they don't have a bowel movement every day. But three bowel movements a week can be normal for some people, especially if that has been their pattern for a long time. There are many other factors that affect how people perceive bowel movements. According to the Rome IV criteria of constipation often used in research, frequency alone doesn't explain all complaints of constipation. Patients complaining of two or more of the following also qualify for a diagnosis of constipation: feelings of incompletely evacuating (not getting everything out) straining lumpy or hard consistency of the stool sensation of blockage using a finger to dislodge the stool. When constipation is a problem, there are two main reasons for it: slow movement of the colon and pelvic floor dysfunction. Treatment for slowed movement of the colon is usually laxatives and drugs to move your colon. But getting your pelvic floor evaluated is worthwhile, because a diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunction typically involves nondrug treatment. Pelvic floor dysfunction The pelvic floor is a muscular bowl that encompasses the rectum, bladder, and (for women) the uterus. There is a complex interaction among these different organs. In the act of defecating, or having a bowel movement, the anal sphincter (the group of muscles at the end of the rectum) has to relax, and the abdominal muscles need to contract. A common analogy I give is that it's like getting toothpaste out of a tube. When you want the toothpaste to come out, you loosen the cap and press on the tube. However, if you leave the cap on or even tighten it, pressing is not going to get the toothpaste out. In the same way, some people who have constipation fail to relax, or actually tighten, their anal sphincter, while using their abdominal muscles to contract the colon when they are trying to defecate. This leads to feelings of incompletely evacuating; hard, small stools; or even feeling like you have to use your finger to get the stool out. These uncoordinated pelvic floor dynamics are usually diagnosed with a test called anorectal manometry, which uses a thin tube to measure pressures, sensations, and reflexes in the rectum and anal sphincter. Biofeedback-based physical therapy to treat pelvic floor dysfunction The good news is that treatment typically does not involve medications. Instead, treatment involves physical therapy in the form of biofeedback. Currently, the best way to undergo physical therapy is in a private setting, with the help of a trained physical therapist who coaches you on the dynamics of defecating. During these sessions, the physical therapist inserts a probe into your anal sphincter and places sticky pads on your abdomen, to detect the movement of your anal sphincter and abdominal wall as you simulate defecation. By doing this, you receive feedback (either visual or verbal) on what you are doing with your abdominal wall muscles and anal sphincter during a bowel movement. The physical therapist will lead you through breathing exercises, as well as muscle strengthening and relaxation exercises, in order to help you retrain the movement and coordination of your pelvic floor. There are currently no devices available for at-home training, but such devices are undergoing research and development. The physical therapist will also discuss dietary recommendations including increased water and fiber consumption, positioning techniques (like using a Squatty Potty), or massaging your abdomen to stimulate the gut. The usual time commitment is about four to eight sessions, one session a week. Like physical therapy for your shoulder or your back, learning what you have done in physical therapy takes time and also practice at home. Some people understand and incorporate these techniques right away, and others take more time and practice. Retraining your body to change the way you have a bowel movement takes time. But it could potentially help with all of the symptoms of constipation.",9,0.2846777,-0.110865235
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/hemorrhoid-help-preventing-and-treating-flare-ups,Hemorrhoid help: preventing and treating flare-ups,1,"The best way to keep hemorrhoid flare-ups at bay is to maintain healthy lifestyle habits. Preventing constipation is key. Make sure your diet always includes enough fiber to promote healthy bowel movements, and be mindful about staying well hydrated. If you need help with your water intake, keep a water bottle by your side at all times as a reminder to drink. Jazz up your water with a slice of lemon, lime, or orange. Also, regular exercise supports good bowel function, so if you do not exercise on a regular basis, this is a good time to begin. Don't try to immediately reach the goal of at least 150 minutes per week of exercise. Begin with short periods of walking. Over time, you can increase your speed and duration of activity. Get your doctor's okay if you have any reservations about exercising or you plan to begin a vigorous routine. There are other simple, everyday habits you can develop to help with relief when a hemorrhoid flare-up arises. For example: Less strain, more gain. Don't delay bowel movements during flareups. Always go when you feel the urge, as putting off bowel movements can cause stool to back up, leading to increased pressure and straining, which aggravates your hemorrhoids. Also, try not to sit on the toilet for long periods; this tends to make hemorrhoids push out and swell up. A way to make going to the bathroom easier—and faster—is to elevate your feet with a step stool as you sit on the toilet. This changes the position of the rectum in a way that could allow for easier passage of stools. Keep the area clean. After every bowel movement, clean the anal area with a witch hazel pad, a soothing baby wipe, or a cotton cloth soaked in warm water. Be thorough but gentle. Aggressive rubbing and scrubbing, especially with soaps or other skin cleansers, can irritate the skin and make your hemorrhoids worse. Applying petroleum jelly or aloe vera gel to the anal area can soothe irritation after a bowel movement. Take a soft seat. Sitting on a cushion rather than a hard surface helps reduce the swelling of existing hemorrhoids and prevents the formation of new ones.",9,0.27496353,-0.12542245
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/take-control-of-your-heartburn,Take control of your heartburn,1,"A muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) separates the esophagus from the stomach. Normally, the LES works something like a gate. The muscle relaxes when you swallow, opening the passage between the esophagus and stomach and allowing food to pass into the stomach. When the sphincter tightens, it closes the passage, keeping food and acidic stomach juices from flowing back into the esophagus. In people with acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD), the LES relaxes when it shouldn't or becomes weak and doesn't close tightly. Either problem allows the contents of the stomach to rise up into the esophagus. The LES is controlled by various nerves and hormones. As a result, foods, drugs, and certain emotions such as anxiety or anger can impair its function, causing or worsening acid reflux. The following factors are under your power to change: Certain foods. Coffee, tea, cocoa, cola drinks, and other caffeine-containing products loosen the LES and stimulate gastric acid production. Mints and chocolate, often served to cap off a meal, can make things worse by relaxing the LES. Fried and fatty foods contribute to heartburn. Some people say that onions and garlic give them heartburn. Others have trouble with citrus fruits or tomato products, which irritate the esophageal lining. Eating patterns. How you eat can be as important as what you eat. Skipping breakfast or lunch and then consuming a huge meal at day's end can increase pressure in the stomach and the possibility of reflux. Lying down soon after eating will make the problem worse. Smoking. Smoking can irritate the entire gastrointestinal tract. In addition, frequent sucking on a cigarette can cause you to swallow air. This increases pressure inside the stomach, which encourages reflux. Smoking can also relax the LES. Overweight and obesity. Being overweight or obese increases the odds of having GERD and experiencing heartburn. Actually, any weight gain increases the risk of frequent GERD symptoms. In addition, eating larger meals distends the stomach, pushes the contents up toward the esophagus and loosens the LES. Certain medications. Some prescription drugs can add to the woes of heartburn. Oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone preparations containing progesterone are known culprits. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) can irritate the stomach lining. Other drugs—such as alendronate (Fosamax), used to prevent and treat osteoporosis—can irritate the esophagus. And some antidepressants, bronchodilators, tranquilizers, and calcium-channel blockers can contribute to reflux by relaxing the LES.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/living-with-lactose-intolerance,Living with lactose intolerance,1,"Food intolerance and food allergies often produce similar symptoms, but they're not the same. If dairy products leave you feeling gassy and bloated or cause diarrhea or nausea, you may have either condition. What's the difference? A dairy allergy is an immune system response to milk protein. In addition to feeling bloated or causing diarrhea, symptoms of a dairy allergy can include hives, wheezing, vomiting, cramps, and skin rashes. Dairy intolerance results from inadequate levels of lactase, the enzyme that breaks down milk sugar. While lactose intolerance can cause a lot of discomfort, it isn't life threatening, while a milk allergy can be. The severity of lactose intolerance varies. For some people, consuming any dairy product causes their digestive tracts to rebel. Others can enjoy yogurt, ice cream, or even an occasional glass of milk. The most successful approach to coping with lactose intolerance is to first avoid all dairy products. If you are lactose intolerant and love milk in all its forms, try experimenting with small amounts of dairy. In general, yogurt, cheese, and sour cream may be easier to tolerate because they contain less lactose than milk. However, several studies suggest that many people who are lactose intolerant can consume the equivalent of eight ounces of milk with no ill effects, and somewhat more when the lactose-containing food is part of a meal. Supplements containing enzymes produced by lactose-digesting bacteria (Lactaid, Lactrase, others) can be taken as tablets or added to foods. Some milk products (Lactaid) to which lactase has been added may contain little or no lactose, and they may taste sweeter than untreated products, because the milk sugar has already been broken down. The response to these products is highly individual. What works for your will depend on the amount of lactase your body produces, the type of intestinal bacteria that inhabit your colon, and the product itself. Finding the right approach for you can be a trial-and-error process. While this may take some time and expense, experimenting isn't likely to be harmful. Image:iStock",9,0.25717387,0.15476437
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/11-stomach-soothing-steps-for-heartburn,11 stomach-soothing steps for heartburn,1,"Heartburn, that uncomfortable burning sensation that radiates up the middle of the chest, is the most common digestive malady. It's the result of a condition known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often called acid reflux, in which stomach acid leaks upward from the stomach into the esophagus. While heartburn should not be ignored, there are many stomach-soothing steps you can try before going to a doctor. These can help cool your symptoms and prevent bigger problems later on. Eat smaller meals, but more often. A full stomach puts pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a valve-like muscle that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus. Eat in a slow, relaxed manner. Wolfing down your food fills your stomach faster, putting more pressure on the LES. Remain upright after meals. Lying down increases pressure on the LES, which makes acid reflux more likely. Avoid late-night eating. Eating a meal or snack within three hours of lying down to sleep can worsen reflux and heartburn symptoms. Leave enough time for the stomach to clear out. Don't exercise immediately after meals. Give your stomach time to empty; wait a couple of hours after eating before exercising. Tilt your torso with a bed wedge. Raising your torso up a bit with a wedge-shaped cushion reduces the pressure on the LES and may ease nighttime heartburn. Wedges are available from medical supply companies. Don't just prop your head and shoulders up with pillows, which can actually worsen reflux. Stay away from carbonated beverages. They cause belching, which promotes reflux of stomach acid. Find the foods that trigger your symptoms and avoid them. Some foods and drinks increase acid secretion, delay stomach emptying, or loosen the LES — conditions that set the stage for heartburn. Common offenders include fatty foods, spicy foods, tomatoes, garlic, milk, coffee, tea, cola, peppermint, and chocolate. Chew sugarless gum after a meal. Chewing gum promotes salivation, which neutralizes acid, soothes the esophagus, and washes acid back down to the stomach. Avoid peppermint flavors, which may trigger heartburn. Check your medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of the medications you take could worsen acid reflux or inflame the esophagus. For example, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline loosen the LES and tetracyclines such as doxycycline can cause esophageal inflammation. Lose weight if you need to.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-a-multivitamin-improve-your-memory-202307242957,Can a multivitamin improve your memory?,1,"We're bombarded with advertisements that tout all sorts of health benefits for vitamins and supplements, including improved memory. A May 2023 study of older adults suggests that a daily multivitamin can do just that — improve your memory enough such that it can function as if you were three years younger. So, should you take that daily multivitamin? Let's take a close look at the study. Who took part in this multivitamin study? This research is part of a larger study examining the effects of a multivitamin and/or cocoa (the main ingredient in chocolate) on cardiovascular and cancer outcomes. A prior sub-study found that a daily multivitamin improved thinking and memory — at least when evaluated with cognitive testing completed by phone. For this study, 3,562 participants were willing and able to perform some tests of thinking and memory on a home computer. Half received a multivitamin; the other half received a placebo. The participants identified as 93% white, 2.5% African American, and 1.4% Hispanic, so the results may not be generalizable. They were also well educated: more than half had completed college. In both groups, the average age was 71. How did the researchers test memory? The investigators evaluated the participants' thinking and memory at baseline and after one, two, and three years. For the memory test, participants were asked to memorize 20 words shown consecutively on a computer screen. Immediately after viewing these words, they had to type in as many words as they could remember (this was the primary measure of memory). Fifteen minutes later, they also typed in all the words they recalled (a secondary measure of memory). Other secondary measures included: a novel object discrimination test (is this object the same or different from one recently shown?) an executive control test (in an array of nine arrows, is the central arrow red or blue?). The participants repeated all of the tests one, two, and three years later. What were the results of this study? The two groups differed in immediate recall at year one: Those who took a placebo went from immediately recalling an average of 7.21 words at baseline to 7.65 words (a difference of 0.43 words) Those who took a daily multivitamin group went from 7.10 words at baseline to 7.81 words (a difference of 0.70 words). This result was statistically significant. Additionally, these small effects held up at years two and three. By year three, the placebo group immediately recalled an average of 8.17 words and the multivitamin group immediately recalled 8.28 words. No differences occurred between the two groups on secondary memory and executive function tests. How can a multivitamin improve memory? The authors note that low levels of vitamins B12 and D have been linked to cognitive decline and dementia. In a subset of participants who had their blood drawn, the levels of these vitamins did rise in the multivitamin group. It seems plausible that a few of the 3,562 participants had low levels of these or other vitamins that are important for thinking and memory. In the placebo group, the few who had vitamin deficiencies would likely show less improvement in memory after their baseline tests, or a small decline. By contrast, those few participants in the multivitamin group with deficiencies would have them corrected by the supplements and, therefore, would perform relatively better. Although this is just speculation, it would explain the small but seemingly real results — results that replicate the researchers' prior study, which used a telephone cognitive test to show thinking and memory benefit from a daily multivitamin. It's also worth noting that practice on memory tasks — the so-called practice effect — could contribute to small improvements shown from baseline to year one and year three. Should you take a multivitamin to improve your memory? The authors admitted that the effect of the multivitamin on immediate memory was small and may not be noticeable. However, they pointed out that this small effect could be important at the level of an entire population. My opinion? You shouldn't bother taking a multivitamin to try to improve your immediate recall of 20 words from 8.17 to 8.28 words. But it is worth speaking with your doctor about whether you could have a vitamin deficiency in B1, B6, B12, D, or any other important vitamins. I see several patients in my clinic every week who have startlingly low levels of vitamin D and B12. Your doctor may want to measure these levels. Or they may suggest simply taking a multivitamin daily. If, after reading this article, you've decided to take a multivitamin, please check with your doctor or pharmacist about which one would be best for you. Make sure that they review any other vitamins, supplements, and medications you take to avoid rare but serious interactions.",1,0.18764186,-0.01010263
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/understanding-triglycerides,Understanding triglycerides,1,"Q. I just got the results of my lipid profile. My cholesterol is high, but so are my triglycerides. What exactly are triglycerides, and how are they different from cholesterol? A. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the bloodstream. They consist of three fatty acid chains linked by a molecule called glycerol. When you eat food, enzymes in your gut break down fats into their component fatty acids, which are then reassembled to create triglyceride particles. These fatty particles can't move freely through the watery bloodstream. So they combine with cholesterol and protein to form lipoproteins. Your lipid profile lists two of these lipoproteins: low-density lipoprotein (better known as LDL cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (also called HDL cholesterol). But there are actually several other types of lipoproteins, including some that contain mainly triglycerides. Triglycerides can provide energy to fuel your body, while the extras are deposited in fat tissue. After a very heavy, fatty meal, your bloodstream may contain so many triglyceride particles that a blood sample may have a milky tint. But within a few hours, they're mostly cleared out. When you need energy between meals, hormones release the stored triglycerides into the bloodstream. Your liver also converts carbohydrates into triglycerides. When you eat extra calories — especially from carbohydrate-rich foods such as sweets and white bread — your liver churns out extra triglycerides. Other things that can raise blood levels of triglycerides include being overweight or obese, smoking, or heavy drinking. Certain medical conditions —including diseases affecting the liver, kidneys, or thyroid, and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes — can also lead to high triglycerides. For healthy adults, normal triglyceride levels are under 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Values of 151 to 200 mg/dL are considered borderline high; those 201 to 499 are high, and those 500 and higher are very high (and increase the risk of inflammation of the pancreas gland, called pancreatitis). Growing evidence suggests that above-normal triglyceride levels can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of cholesterol levels. To get your triglycerides back into a normal range, start with lifestyle changes. Aim for a healthy weight, get regular exercise, and eat more whole, unprocessed grains. Eat fewer refined carbohydrates, and cut back on saturated fat from meat. Ideally it's best to avoid alcohol, but at the minimum, limit it to no more than one drink on any given day.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/looking-for-a-mellow-form-of-exercise-try-tai-chi,Looking for a mellow form of exercise? Try tai chi,1,"This ancient Chinese practice may help lower blood pressure and offer other heart-related benefits. Tai chi is a slow, flowing form of exercise that's sometimes described as ""meditation in motion."" The practice involves a series of choreographed moves with evocative descriptions, such as ""grasp the sparrow's tail"" or ""wave hands like clouds."" As your body moves, your mind has to focus. But tai chi also encourages relaxation, which helps ease stress. Those features are all important aspects of mind-body therapies, many of which seem to benefit heart health, says Dr. Gloria Yeh, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""On a simple level, tai chi is a very accessible form of exercise,"" she says. The movements are easy to adapt to different levels of intensity, and you can even do certain movements while seated in a chair. Tai chi doesn't require fully extending or stretching your joints, so it's also fine for people who are not so flexible. A gateway exercise Tai chi can be a good gateway exercise for people who cannot or will not engage in more conventional exercise. Even people who are out of shape can do tai chi, which can help build strength and confidence, both physically and mentally. And if you practice more vigorously or sink deeper into the poses, tai chi can provide a moderate aerobic workout. But the meditative aspects of tai chi that teach body awareness, slowing down, and stress management are also important, says Dr. Yeh, who directs the Mind-Body Research program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. People prone to heart disease can benefit from holistic approaches that address their overall well-being, she adds. Protecting the heart Studies exploring the health benefits of tai chi — which also include reduced pain and improved mood — date back to the 1950s. Tai chi may help lower cholesterol levels and dampen inflammation, both of which are linked to better heart health. But the best evidence seems to be for improving blood pressure, according to a 2008 review of 26 studies co-authored by Dr. Yeh in the journal Preventive Cardiology. In people with high blood pressure, systolic blood pressure (the first number in a blood pressure reading) fell seven to 32 points, while diastolic pressure (the second number) fell by two to 18 points. Healing the heart Tai chi may be a promising addition to cardiac rehabilitation, a multiweek program of structured exercise paired with lifestyle and nutrition education. Cardiac rehab, which is covered by Medicare, improves quality of life and survival after a serious heart-related problem, procedure, or surgery. But according to the American Heart Association, only about a quarter of eligible Medicare recipients participate in these programs. Studies by Dr. Yeh and others suggest that for people who decline cardiac rehab, tai chi can help them ease into exercising more, losing weight, and enjoying a better quality of life. As this research continues to grow, tai chi may become a more popular option in conjunction with cardiac rehab, says Dr. Yeh. Many academic medical centers, including Harvard Medical School, have integrative medicine programs that offer tai chi classes. Getting started with tai chi You also can find local tai chi classes at martial arts studios, community centers, health clubs, Y's, and senior centers. Costs vary widely, ranging from about $7 to $18 for an hourlong class. Wear loose, comfortable clothing, and supportive shoes like sneakers (or no shoes, if you prefer). During the class, the instructor will demonstrate graceful, slow arm and leg movements, often done with a slight bend in the knees. ""You might learn to let go of extra muscle tension, take deep breaths, and pay attention to how your body feels,"" says Dr. Yeh. You can learn tai chi from a watching a DVD, which you can also use to practice at home. But going to a class has certain advantages. It may be easier to grasp the concepts with a live instructor with whom you can interact, and being in a group provides both camaraderie and motivation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/they-found-colon-polyps-now-what,They found colon polyps: Now what?,1,"Follow-up exams at the right time are essential to prevent cancer from developing. Colorectal cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer—if you are screened for hidden warning signs while you are still healthy. Screening finds precancerous growths on the colon wall, called polyps, which the doctor can then remove. They are not cancer, and most of them have not started to change into cancer. If you get them at the precancerous phase, they don't have a chance to grow and turn into cancer. But you will need to come back for follow-up testing to see if more polyps turn up in the future. Here is what to expect. What are polyps? A colonoscope, the flexible device used to inspect the colon, can grab and snip off polyps if they are relatively small. The timing of follow-up depends on what kind of polyps the doctor finds, how many, and how big they are. Hyperplastic polyps: These polyps are not precancerous. Doctors generally remove them anyway, just to be safe. Adenomas: Many colon polyps are the precancerous type, called adenomas. It can take seven to 10 or more years for an adenoma to evolve into cancer—if it ever does. Overall, only 5% of adenomas progress to cancer, but your individual risk is hard to predict. Doctors remove all the adenomas they find. Sessile serrated polyps: Once thought harmless, this type of adenoma is now known to be risky. These are also removed. When to return for follow-up After polyps are removed, you will need to return for an additional colonoscopy. There is a 25% to 30% chance that a repeat colonoscopy will find additional polyps. How soon you need to return for follow-up depends largely on the size of the polyps found in the first exam. If the colonoscopy finds one or two small polyps (5 mm in diameter or smaller), you are considered at relatively low risk. Most people will not have to return for a follow-up colonoscopy for at least five years, and possibly longer. If the polyps are larger (10 mm or larger), more numerous, or abnormal in appearance under a microscope, you may have to return in three years or sooner. If the exam finds no polyps, you can usually wait 10 years for the next screening if you are at average risk for colon cancer. How a colon polyp progresses to cancer Get the best exam you can Whenever you have a colonoscopy, you should have the highest quality exam possible so the doctor can find all the polyps. During the colon-cleansing ""prep"" before the colonoscopy, follow the instructions to the letter. Eating a low-fiber diet for four to five days may improve the quality of the prep. That's because fiber gets stuck in the nooks and crannies of the colon wall and can block the doctor's view. For colonoscopy to prevent cancer, the doctor must find and remove as many precancerous growths as possible. Reducing your risk After polyp removal, certain steps may lower your risk of colon cancer: Eat less meat: Eat a healthy diet, with minimal red meat—especially processed or cured meats. Studies suggest that people with meat-rich diets tend to have higher rates of colon cancer. Aspirin: Some research suggests that taking aspirin may reduce overall colon cancer risk, but the evidence is not definite. If you need to take aspirin for your heart, then it may offer some protection for the colon. Calcium: Research has also linked a calcium-rich diet to lower colon cancer risk, but this, too, is uncertain. If you are already eating a healthy calcium rich diet to preserve bone health, you might get an extra ""bump"" of cancer prevention. Image: SciePro/Getty Images",9,-0.01035884,-0.059049558
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/3-surprising-risks-of-poor-posture,3 surprising risks of poor posture,1,"America, we have a posture problem. Whether it's the result of sitting at a desk all day, looking down at a smartphone, or lounging on a couch, poor posture is dogging people of all ages. And health experts are worried. ""It's a common and important health problem among Americans, and it can lead to neck pain, back problems, and other aggravating conditions,"" says Meghan Markowski, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Other posture-related problems While back and neck conditions top the list of potential posture woes, there are many others — such as poor balance, headaches, and breathing difficulties. ""Researchers are also looking into whether posture affects mood, sleep, fatigue, and jaw alignment,"" Markowski says. Three other problems linked to poor posture may surprise you. 1. Incontinence. Poor posture promotes stress incontinence — when you leak a little urine if you laugh or cough. ""Slouching increases abdominal pressure, which puts pressure on the bladder. The position also decreases the ability of the pelvic floor muscles to hold against that pressure,"" notes Markowski, who specializes in helping people overcome bladder, bowel, and pelvic floor problems. 2. Constipation. Poor posture on a toilet — hunched over with your knees lower than your hips — can promote constipation. ""That position closes the anus somewhat and makes it harder for the abdominal muscles to help move feces out,"" Markowski says. Constipation is characterized by fewer than three bowel movements per week; hard, dry stools; straining to move the bowels; and a sense of an incomplete evacuation. 3. Heartburn and slowed digestion. Slouched posture after a meal can trigger heartburn caused by acid reflux (when stomach acid squirts back up into the esophagus). ""Slouching puts pressure on the abdomen, which can force stomach acid in the wrong direction,"" explains Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""And some evidence suggests that transit in the intestines slows down when you slouch. In my opinion, it probably does play a small role."" What you can do Markowski recommends seeing a physical therapist if you suspect you have poor posture that is causing problems for you. The therapist will customize a program of exercises and stretches to improve your core muscle strength and flexibility. The core muscles (in the abdomen, pelvic floor, and back) support the spine. The goal is a neutral, upright spine position — not flexed too far forward or backward. A neutral spine is also important when it's time to move your bowels. ""Keep your back straight and lean forward at the hips. Keeping your knees higher than your hips — by placing your feet on a footstool — mimics a squatting position, which is best for helping to open the anus so you can pass feces without straining,"" Markowski says. To reduce the risk of stress incontinence leakage, Markowski recommends strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. ""We teach people how to control their pelvic muscles when they cough,"" she says. ""The proper neutral spine alignment will also help minimize abdominal pressure."" Move of the month: Seated knee lift Builds abdominal strength. Sit on a stability ball or chair with your feet hip-width apart and your hands at your sides. Exhale as you lift your right knee and left hand straight toward the ceiling. Return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times. Repeat the process by lifting with your left knee and right hand. Exercise image by Michael Carroll Some general posture pointers To attain the neutral spine position, Markowski advises you to put your shoulders down and back, pull your head back, and engage your core muscles. ""Bring your belly button in toward your spine, as if you're zipping up a snug pair of jeans. This will help to engage the transverse abdominis muscle, which acts like a corset around the spine,"" Markowski explains. Other tips: Use a low back (lumbar) support pillow to remind you to sit upright in a chair, and change your position every 30 to 60 minutes. ""We don't want people in fixed postures for hours at a time,"" Markowski says. ""Be vigilant, and good posture will contribute to many aspects of health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-to-eat-when-you-have-chronic-heartburn,What to eat when you have chronic heartburn,1,"Avoid spicy foods, and keep some dazzle in your diet with low-fat sauces and fresh herbs. The fiery feeling of heartburn is the last way you want to remember a great meal. But when your doctor says you have chronic heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (see ""What is GERD?""), you may worry that a bland and disappointing menu is in your future. But the foods that trigger your heartburn may or may not be on the usual lists. That's why keeping a journal to determine which foods cause symptoms helps. Common culprits Some foods and ingredients may intensify heartburn, such as spicy foods, citrus, tomato sauces, and vinegar. Fatty and fried foods linger longer in the stomach, making it more likely that stomach acid leaks back up into the esophagus. Other common heartburn triggers include chocolate, caffeine, onions, peppermint, carbonated drinks, and alcohol. What's for dinner? You can still enjoy lean meats, fish, poultry, vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains. The trick is making them flavorful. If spices bother you, try using only small amounts, and be mindful of blends that contain cayenne or chili powder. Or use fresh herbs instead. Fresh herbs are less concentrated and may be less irritating. Instead use fresh parsley, oregano, and basil. Another tip: roast your food. This makes vegetables sweeter. The natural sugars come out and caramelize. Carrots, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, squash, and Brussels sprouts work well. Broiling, saut'ing, or grilling food also brings out intense flavor. Eat vegetables raw. Tomato sauce may bother you, but a fresh tomato may not. Use sauces but cut the fat. Blend low-fat yogurt with cucumber and basil, or saut' mushrooms in a little olive oil. Or make a pesto. Blend basil, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and a dash of olive oil or water. Use a tablespoon of it on food. Breakfast and lunch Avoid fatty meats like ham or bacon. Oatmeal is a great option. Throw in bananas, raisins, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. Other possibilities: low-fat yogurt with fruit or nuts, any kind of eggs, whole-grain toast, or a side of chilled whole grains like quinoa mixed with fruit or topped with a dollop of yogurt. For lunch, think salads with protein such as chicken or beans. But maybe use a yogurt-based dressing, to avoid vinegar and citrus. What is GERD? One of the most common causes of heartburn is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, usually because the ring-like muscles that prevent backflow stop working properly. In addition to heartburn, GERD may cause nausea, a sour taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, a sore throat, coughing, and tightness in the chest. Medications to treat GERD reduce stomach acid. Antacid pills and liquids have been around the longest. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or lansoprazole (Prevacid), and H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) or famotidine (Pepcid), are available over the counter. Don't fool yourself into thinking medication allows you to frequently eat foods that once caused heartburn. If medication controls your symptoms, then it's probably okay to have a 'trigger' food occasionally. But if you do that too often, the heartburn will return. You can limit and perhaps avoid medication to control GERD symptoms by losing weight if necessary, eating smaller meals and avoiding food triggers (see accompanying article).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heartburn-vs-heart-attack,Heartburn vs. heart attack,1,"The symptoms of these two health problems may overlap — and sometimes, so do the treatments. During your regular after-dinner walk around the neighborhood, you feel a painful sensation in the center of your chest. Could it be your heartburn flaring up again, or something more serious? Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often called acid reflux. Acid from the stomach bubbles up into the esophagus, causing a painful burning just behind the breastbone. Not surprisingly, it's often mistaken for a heart attack. In fact, of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out. Chest pain caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart (angina) or a heart attack is often described as a feeling of tightness, constriction, or pressure, rather than a burning sensation (see ""Heartburn or heart attack?""). But it's not always easy to tell the difference. ""Chest discomfort brought on by exercise is more likely to be a heart-related problem,"" says Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, cardiovascular specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But you can also have angina that's not related to physical activity, she notes. If you have any symptoms you're not sure about, see a doctor. And call 911 if you feel chest tightness, have trouble breathing, break into a sweat, turn pale, or become very weak. GERD and heart disease are both common, and many people take medications to prevent or treat both conditions. Heartburn or heart attack? The symptoms of heartburn may mimic those of angina or a heart attack (or vice versa). If you're uncertain, don't hesitate to get to an emergency room for an evaluation as soon as possible. COMMON SYMPTOMS Angina or heart attack Tightness, pressure, squeezing, stabbing, or dull pain, most often in the center of the chest Pain that spreads to the shoulders, neck, or arms Irregular or rapid heartbeat Cold sweat or clammy skin Lightheadedness, weakness, or dizziness Shortness of breath Nausea, indigestion, and sometimes vomiting The appearance of symptoms with physical exertion or extreme stress Heartburn (GERD) Burning chest pain that begins at the breastbone Pain that moves up toward your throat but doesn't typically radiate to your shoulders, neck, or arms Sensation that food is coming back into your mouth Bitter or acidic taste at the back of your throat Pain that worsens when you lie down or bend over The appearance of symptoms after a large or spicy meal Avoiding clots Many people take daily, low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks, which works by discouraging the formation of blood clots. Doctors prescribe clopidogrel (a more potent clot-preventing drug) with aspirin, mainly for people who receive stents, the tiny metal mesh tubes placed in clogged blood vessels to improve blood flow. But there's a downside. ""Aspirin can increase the risk of bleeding from the stomach and the intestines, both by directly irritating the stomach lining and by making existing areas of irritation more prone to bleeding,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Taking clopidogrel with aspirin can further increase that risk. Preventing bleeding People with heartburn often take proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). They include over-the-counter drugs such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and prescription drugs such as pantoprazole (Protonix). These drugs reduce the release of acid from the stomach lining. In addition to causing heartburn, excess stomach acid can also cause bleeding sores (ulcers) in the stomach; these, too, are treated with PPIs, among other drugs. Thanks to these stomach-protecting effects, doctors sometimes prescribe PPIs for people who take drugs that increase the risk of bleeding — even if they don't have heartburn. ""I usually recommend PPIs for people who are taking long-term aspirin or clopidogrel if they have ever had a bleeding stomach ulcer or are at high risk of developing one,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Factors that can boost your odds include an infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria and routine use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Motrin, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox, others). Clopidogrel concern? Some research suggests a possible problem with taking both a PPI and clopidogrel. Two popular PPIs, omeprazole and esomeprazole (Nexium), inhibit a liver enzyme that helps convert clopidogrel to its active form. In theory, this could make clopidogrel less effective for heart attacks and stroke prevention. But large clinical studies have not revealed any meaningful differences. Still, anyone with lingering concerns about a possible interaction could take a different PPI, such as pantoprazole, which does not affect the liver enzyme.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/natural-ways-to-relieve-constipation,Natural ways to relieve constipation,1,"A few at-home tips can help you avoid the need for harsh laxatives. We often make light of constipation, but it's no laughing matter. When you can't go to the bathroom for days on end, you feel bloated and miserable. Straining day after day can also lead to more serious problems, like hemorrhoids or even prolapse (bulging) of rectal tissue. An estimated 40% to 60% of older adults regularly deal with constipation, although the aging process itself is not to blame. It's what goes along with aging. It's things like less physical activity, which helps the bowels move more regularly. It's the medications many older adults take. Constipation causes One of the biggest factors in constipation is diet. Eating high-fiber foods, such as raw fruits and vegetables and whole grains, helps to keep you regular. Drinking enough fluid is essential too. The fiber holds the water in the bowel so it can mix with the stool and make it softer. If you're getting plenty of fiber and fluids and you're still not regular, one of these constipation causes may be to blame: medicines such as narcotic pain relievers, antidepressants, aluminum-containing antacids, blood pressure medications, drugs for Parkinson's disease, and iron supplements lack of exercise regularly ignoring the urge to have a bowel movement diseases such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Getting going again Laxatives may seem like the quickest and simplest solution, but they're not a good idea If people go right to stimulant laxatives, there is a risk that they'll become physically dependent on them. Before taking any laxative, try these diet and lifestyle tips for managing constipation: Stay hydrated. Drink at least four to six glasses of fluids a day. Water and fruit juices are best for preventing constipation. Limit caffeinated beverages such as soda and coffee, which can actually leach more fluid from your body. Bulk up on fiber. Try to get at least 25 grams of fiber daily from your diet. Good food sources include Brussels sprouts, apples, figs, bran cereal, and black beans. Get on a daily schedule. The longer stool sits in your intestines, the harder it becomes, and the more difficult it is to push out. That's why having a regular bowel habit is important. Because the emptying reflex works best after a meal, a useful habit is to head to the bathroom after breakfast and see if you get the urge. Try not to strain. It could lead to hemorrhoids, anal fissures (tears in the skin around the anus), or rectal prolapse (when part of the intestinal lining pushes out through the anal opening). Add more fiber and fluid to your diet or try a stool softener to make bowel movements easier. If you simply can't go and you want to try a laxative, start with the osmotic type (such as MiraLAX or Geri Care). The osmotic laxatives are reasonably safe. They work gently by pulling water into your intestines, making the stool softer and easier to pass. If you've tried everything and you still aren't regular, see your doctor, who can evaluate you for a medical problem. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a bowel obstruction, which can include abdominal pain, vomiting, a swollen belly, or the complete inability to have a bowel movement.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/what-to-do-about-gallstones,What to do about gallstones,1,"Gallstones are one of the most common digestive problems treated in women. More than 25 million people in the United States have gallstones, and 65% to 75% of them are women. Fortunately, for most people, gallstones are ""silent"" — they don't cause major symptoms. When they do act up, there are effective ways to address the problem. What are gallstones? Gallstones begin with bile, a substance that helps with the digestion of fats and the absorption of certain vitamins. Bile is made in the liver and carried to the gallbladder, a small, pear-shaped organ that concentrates and stores it. The fat in food triggers the release of a hormone that causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the intestine. Gallstones are solid lumps that develop when the stored bile crystallizes. Most are less than an inch in diameter, but they can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball. Most gallstones are composed mainly of cholesterol. The rest — known as pigment stones — are made of calcium salts and bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells. Cholesterol stones form when liquid bile in the gallbladder contains more cholesterol than the bile salts can dissolve. Cholesterol stones may also develop if the gallbladder doesn't contract and empty as it should. Pigment stones are associated with certain medical conditions, including liver disease, some types of anemia, and infection of the bile ducts. Gallstone trouble Gallstones cause problems when they block any of the ducts carrying bile from the liver or gallbladder (or digestive enzymes from the pancreas) to the small intestine. Why are women at greater risk? It's the effect of female hormones. Estrogen increases cholesterol in the bile, and progesterone slows the emptying of the gallbladder. That may explain why the risk for women, relative to men, decreases with age. Before age 40, women are diagnosed with gallstones almost three times more often than men are (pregnancy, for example, increases the risk), but by age 60, their risk is just slightly greater. Estrogen therapy increases the risk, especially when taken as a pill rather than a patch. Oral contraceptive pills also increase the risk slightly, but only in the first decade of use. Obesity is another risk factor because bodies with more fat produce more estrogen. Paradoxically, rapid weight loss also increases the risk, because very low-calorie diets interfere with bile production and therefore cause more crystallization of cholesterol. Gallstones are so common after weight-loss surgery that patients may be advised to have their gallbladders removed at the same time. Gallstones are also more likely to occur in people with diabetes or any condition that decreases gallbladder contractions or intestinal motility, such as a spinal cord injury. Finally, there's some evidence for genetic vulnerability to gallstone formation. What are the symptoms? Most people who have gallstones don't know it. Their gallstones stay silent and may only be discovered incidentally, through an ultrasound or CT scan performed for other reasons. Symptoms arise mainly when stones pass through a bile duct or obstruct it, causing biliary colic — better known as a gallbladder attack. These attacks occur when the gallbladder contracts (usually in response to a fatty meal) and presses the stones so as to block the gallbladder duct. The main symptom is pain, usually in the right upper or middle abdomen (just below the rib cage), which builds to greatest intensity within an hour and can persist up to several hours. It can be either sharp and knifelike or a deep ache; sometimes it radiates to the back or the right shoulder. There may also be nausea and vomiting. The pain subsides as the gallbladder relaxes. A stone lodged in a duct can also cause more serious problems, including acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), or cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts in the liver). Any of these conditions can cause severe pain and other symptoms, including jaundice, high fever, chills, and vomiting. Treatment usually requires hospitalization and often surgical removal of the stone. If you think you're having a gallbladder attack, your clinician will probably order several blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound (after you fast for at least eight hours). Ultrasound is particularly helpful in diagnosing acute cholecystitis because it also picks up any thickening of the gallbladder wall and indicates the presence of fluid, which may suggest inflammation. Other diagnostic techniques include cholescintigraphy, a radioactive injection used to view a possible blockage of the cystic duct; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bile ducts; endoscopic ultrasonography, which introduces an ultrasound device through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) to get images of the area; and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses a scope inserted through the mouth to the duodenum to view the biliary ducts. How are gallstones treated? Typically, gallstones are treated only if they cause symptoms. For recurrent gallbladder attacks, the most effective treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder, or cholecystectomy. In the past, the standard procedure was surgery requiring a five-inch incision and a hospital stay of up to a week. This approach has largely been replaced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in which the gallbladder is removed with instruments inserted through small incisions in the skin. This procedure requires only an overnight hospital stay and a week of recovery at home. However, there's a slight risk of injuring the bile ducts, and in a small percent of cases, the surgeon may have to switch to an open surgery with a larger incision because of complications. You can easily live without a gallbladder. The liver produces enough bile for normal digestion. When the gallbladder is removed, bile simply flows directly into the small intestine through the common bile duct. When no food is present, loose stools may result, but you can treat that with a bile acid–binding medication, such as cholestyramine (Questran). Medical options If you can't or don't want to undergo surgery and your gallstones are small, one option is to take ursodiol (Actigall, Urso), a naturally occurring bile acid that helps dissolve cholesterol stones when taken by mouth two to four times a day. It's also used to prevent the formation of gallstones in people who are losing weight quickly. Ursodiol dissolves only those gallstones made of cholesterol, and it may take several months before it has an effect. Drug therapy is occasionally combined with lithotripsy, in which sound waves from outside the body are used to break gallstones into pieces that dissolve more easily or are small enough to safely pass through the bile duct. Unfortunately, stones are likely to recur after medical treatment. How can I reduce my risk for gallstones? There's no proven way to prevent gallstones, but eating a well-balanced diet, maintaining a normal weight, and exercising regularly (at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week). Avoiding fatty foods won't prevent or get rid of gallstones, but it may reduce the frequency of attacks. Image: rob_lan/Getty Images",9,0.3270824,0.12267855
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart?",1,"The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection? Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease. The gut-heart connection The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects. ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse. One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque. Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO. In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less. The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat. Fiber at work Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels. But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health. Other supporting foods It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health. The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw. ""And if your gut is healthy, there is a greater chance your heart is healthy, too."" Image: © CareyHope/Getty Images",3,0.34324154,-0.019962277
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/stomachs-growl-noses-run-and-yawning-is-contagious-ever-wonder-why-202307192955,"Stomachs growl, noses run, and yawning is contagious: Ever wonder why?",1,"There are certain things our bodies do so often and so automatically that we barely notice them. Yawning, growling stomachs, and runny noses are good examples. Each is a universal part of our daily human experience. But did you ever wonder why? Below are a few things we know and a few we suspect. Why do you yawn? Perhaps you associate yawning only with being tired or bored. While we don't know exactly why people yawn, there's no shortage of theories. Yawning may stretch out our lungs and nearby tissues, preventing tiny airways in the lungs from collapsing distribute a chemical called surfactant, a gooey liquid that coats the tiny air pockets in the lungs and helps keep them open help prepare our bodies for transitions between wakefulness and rest: For example, yawning often occurs after a period of relaxation and when awakening from sleep. And it may serve as an internal signal that it's time to sleep, or time to take a break from activities (such as driving). play a role in maintaining proper brain temperature: Our brain functions best within a narrow range of temperatures. Some experts believe yawning can help cool the brain through complex effects on nearby circulation and the sinuses. It's also unclear why yawning is contagious. In the animal kingdom, it's common to see contagious yawning among members of a group, perhaps as a signal for collective behavior (such as moving from activity to rest). Why does your stomach growl? That rumbling in your stomach is known medically as borborygmi — an excellent Scrabble word if you have the right letters. We usually assume it reflects hunger. And it's true that the experience of hunger can make itself heard in anticipation of a meal. But your stomach may also growl after a meal, when the stomach and intestines propel liquids and food through the digestive tract. Stress can also trigger stomach rumbling. What's causing all that noise — and is it ever a problem? It may be due to gas moving around in response to muscular contractions of the intestinal walls. Occasionally, noises from the abdomen may be a sign of an intestinal infection or other trouble. If you're experiencing other symptoms, such as pain or fever, check in with your doctor. But the vast majority of noises are harmless and a sign that your gut is working normally. Why does your nose run? Sometimes it can seem like your nose is running for no reason. But there are some well-known triggers, such as: Infection. When you have a cold, mucous membranes produce more mucus as part of your defense system: more mucous flowing out means fewer germs getting in. Allergies. Pollen, ragweed, or other triggers stimulate immune cells that produce histamine. Histamine opens up blood vessels just beneath the mucous membranes, and that leads to increased production and release of fluid and mucus. As with infection, this response may be helpful to dilute the offending trigger and rid it from the area. Cold, dry air. The inside surface of the nose is covered with mucous membranes that warm and humidify air well before it reaches the lungs. When you inhale dry, cold air through your nose, these membranes humidify the air by secreting water and mucus. Spicy foods. Spices like capsaicin act as an irritant to the sinuses and mucous membranes, which release fluid in response. The bottom line Some of the most common everyday human experiences are also some of the least understood. There are many other examples, of course: Why are we ticklish? What purpose do hiccups serve? What's the deal with brain freeze? Perhaps topics for another day. It may seem like a leap of faith, but it's likely there are very good reasons for the way our bodies work — even when we don't know what those reasons are.",6,0.19370548,-0.18066731
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-irritable-bowel-syndrome-the-same,Are inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome the same?,1,"Ask the doctors Q. I was recently diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. Is this the same thing as inflammatory bowel disease? A. No, they are not the same. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are caused by a malfunctioning immune system. In these diseases, the immune system misfires, causing the lining of the digestive tract to become chronically inflamed and irritated. Both can lead to long-term digestive tract damage. In Crohn's disease, this inflammation can occur anywhere in the digestive tract, while colitis affects only the colon and the rectum. IBD triggers a number of symptoms, including abdominal pain and cramping, fevers, ­diarrhea, and bloody bowel movements, among others. While people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may experience some of the same symptoms as people with IBD, there is no obvious inflammation within the digestive tract. The underlying cause of IBS is unknown, but symptoms may arise due to uncoordinated intestinal contractions that affect bowel movements and hypersensitive nerves in the gut. People with IBS commonly have diarrhea, constipation, or both, as well as abdominal pain and cramping. While IBS can cause significant distress and discomfort for those affected, people don't typically experience severe complications as a result of the condition or need to have surgery. It's most often managed through lifestyle change or medication. Image: © Mono/Getty Images",9,0.19251446,-0.10513021
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection,The gut-brain connection,1,"Pay attention to your gut-brain connection – it may contribute to your anxiety and digestion problems The gut-brain connection is no joke; it can link anxiety to stomach problems and vice versa. Have you ever had a ""gut-wrenching"" experience? Do certain situations make you ""feel nauseous""? Have you ever felt ""butterflies"" in your stomach? We use these expressions for a reason. The gastrointestinal tract is sensitive to emotion. Anger, anxiety, sadness, elation — all of these feelings (and others) can trigger symptoms in the gut. The brain has a direct effect on the stomach and intestines. For example, the very thought of eating can release the stomach's juices before food gets there. This connection goes both ways. A troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain can send signals to the gut. Therefore, a person's stomach or intestinal distress can be the cause or the product of anxiety, stress, or depression. That's because the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) system are intimately connected. This is especially true in cases where a person experiences gastrointestinal upset with no obvious physical cause. For such functional GI disorders, it is difficult to try to heal a distressed gut without considering the role of stress and emotion. Gut health and anxiety Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it becomes easier to understand why you might feel nauseated before giving a presentation, or feel intestinal pain during times of stress. That doesn't mean, however, that functional gastrointestinal conditions are imagined or ""all in your head."" Psychology combines with physical factors to cause pain and other bowel symptoms. Psychosocial factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as symptoms. In other words, stress (or depression or other psychological factors) can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract. In addition, many people with functional GI disorders perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains are more responsive to pain signals from the GI tract. Stress can make the existing pain seem even worse. Based on these observations, you might expect that at least some patients with functional GI conditions might improve with therapy to reduce stress or treat anxiety or depression. Multiple studies have found that psychologically based approaches lead to greater improvement in digestive symptoms compared with only conventional medical treatment. Gut-brain connection, anxiety and digestion Are your stomach or intestinal problems — such as heartburn, abdominal cramps, or loose stools — related to stress? Watch for these and other common symptoms of stress and discuss them with your doctor. Together you can come up with strategies to help you deal with the stressors in your life, and also ease your digestive discomforts. Image: © ChrisChrisW | GettyImages",9,0.33713585,0.007976919
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/dont-take-back-pain-sitting-down,Don't take back pain sitting down,1,"Sitting down is supposed to be a way to relax after a long day on your feet. But for many people, sitting for any length of time is painful. It aggravates pain in the back instead of relieving it. What causes lower back pain when sitting? Although the specific reason for back pain often cannot be identified, muscle spasms are probably the most common cause. While there isn't proof from medical studies that sitting leads to more spasms, people often report tighter and more painful back muscles with prolonged sitting. A long car ride is a typical example. Sometimes people attribute the pain to the jarring and bouncing around that occurs on the road, but often it's just pressure from sitting that triggers the problem. If you experience lower back pain when sitting, the problem could be one of several common conditions, says Dr. Steven J. Atlas, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Herniated discs Herniated discs refers to a problem with one of the discs that act as pads between the vertebrae in your back. In particular, a disc can become herniated, meaning it develops a bulge that can pinch a nearby spinal nerve, causing pain. ""There have been some studies that measured the amount of pressure on the discs,"" says Dr. Atlas. ""Not surprisingly, the pressure is lowest when you're lying down."" But there is more pressure on the discs when you're sitting than when you're standing. ""In fact, if I come into the exam room and a patient is standing, rather than sitting, my suspicion that the person has a disc herniation goes up a lot,"" he says. Sciatica Disc problems can cause back pain alone, but when the pain moves into the legs, this may be the nerve pain known as sciatica. Sciatica sometimes occurs when a herniated disc pinches one of your sciatic nerves. These are the longest nerves in your body, running from the lower back into each leg. People with sciatica typically report a burning pain that involves the lower back, the leg, and sometimes the foot. When lower back pain is eased by sitting There is one common condition in older women that is eased by sitting. This is a type of arthritis of the lower back called spinal stenosis. ""In cases where the arthritis is severe enough to pinch nerves going to the buttocks and legs, people often report that the pain is better when sitting than standing. This is because when you sit, you bend forward a little bit at the lower back, and this may spread out the arthritic bones enough to relieve the pain temporarily,"" says Dr. Atlas. Pain relief may also occur when you lean forward while using a shopping cart or a walker. When to see a doctor In most cases, you should be able to manage back pain by yourself. Modify your activity and slowly work toward regaining function, says Dr. Steven J. Atlas, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. However, you should see a doctor if the pain isn't improving after you've modified your activity for a few weeks. (It can take up to four to six weeks to see improvement in sciatica from a herniated disc.) You should see a doctor right away if your pain is extremely severe, if it gets better but comes back, or if it occurs after an injury — such as falling down a flight of stairs, being in a car accident, or slipping on a patch of ice. That's different from back pain that begins during the course of regular movements, says Dr. Atlas. In other words, if your back starts to hurt when you lean over to tie your shoe, that's not an injury. How to relieve the pain If you're experiencing back pain when sitting, your impulse may be to lie down and then try to slowly progress back to sitting, says Dr. Atlas. But this is the wrong approach. You should lie down to relieve the pain, but the goal should be not to return to sitting, but rather to regain your ability to stand and move. ""The goal isn't to get into the chair. The goal is to start moving. Walking is better than sitting,"" he says. Movement is often the best medicine when it comes to relieving pain. Treating back pain If you can't manage your back pain yourself and opt to see a doctor, it's likely she or he will order treatments that follow a course similar to what you can do at home. ""There has been a shift away from medical intervention for back pain and an increased emphasis on treatments that don't focus on medication,"" says Dr. Atlas. ""There is also an increased appreciation that even medicines such as acetaminophen have risks, particularly in older adults."" A typical course of treatment starts with activity modification, progressing to exercise. ""For patients with severe symptoms, the first line of therapy might be manual treatment, such as massage, chiropractic, or physical therapy,"" says Dr. Atlas. Preventing problems Movement is the best way to ward off back pain. Regular physical activity can make the back stronger to reduce future episodes of pain. Exercises should focus on increasing strength and improving range of motion — as well as ensuring balance on both sides of the body, as some back pain can start when one side of the body is stronger than the other. In addition, whenever possible, avoid prolonged sitting. If you sit at a desk in the office all day, get up periodically — at least every 30 minutes — and walk around. Walk to get a drink of water or to pick up your mail. Take breaks throughout the course of the day to prevent future bouts of pain. Simple exercises for a healthy back Some simple exercises (done with the approval of your doctor) can help keep back pain at bay. These exercises build not only strength, but also flexibility.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthier-aging,"Healthy gut, healthier aging",1,"Support beneficial microbes in the gastrointestinal tract with these healthy lifestyle habits. Trillions of microbes — bacteria, viruses, fungi — call your gut home. They do more than just help you digest food. They fight harmful pathogens; make vitamin K and other important chemicals; affect the way medications work; and may influence your immune system, heart health, and cancer risk. It also appears gut microbes may play a role in healthy aging and longevity. The genes of all your gut microbes are collectively called the gut microbiome. Encouraging findings In a study published online Feb. 18, 2021, by Nature Metabolism, scientists observed that older adults whose mix of gut microbes changed the most over time lived longer than those people with less change in their gut microbiome. The study didn't prove that an eclectic microbiome directly caused people to live longer. However, such a microbiome was also associated with lower cholesterol levels, faster walking speeds, and higher levels of beneficial blood chemicals — all factors that lengthen the life span. How do you make your gut microbiome more diverse and achieve health benefits? It mainly comes down to lifestyle factors. Indeed, one of the reasons that a healthy lifestyle may protect your health is through the impact of your lifestyle on your microbiome. Eat a healthy diet Eating the right foods is one of the best ways. Your gut microbes like to eat, too, and their favorite foods are the ones that are healthiest for us: fruits, vegetables (especially dark, leafy greens), legumes (beans, peas), and whole grains (quinoa, whole wheat, brown rice). ""Those foods contain fiber. Our bodies don't break down fiber for food; fiber passes through to the gut and microbes feed on it. It gives them a good environment to grow,"" explains April Pawluk, strategic program manager at the Harvard Chan Microbiome in Public Health Center. But when you eat an unhealthy diet with lots of processed, fatty, sugary foods, it makes it harder for helpful microbes to survive. ""In the absence of diversity-promoting nutrients like fiber in our diets, the genes of our gut microbiome can produce chemicals that could increase our risk for developing different diseases,"" Pawluk says. Exercise Exercising appears to promote gut microbiome diversity, but the way it works is a matter of speculation, ­Pawluk says. Several ways are plausible. ""It could be that exercise changes the rate at which material moves through the intestines. Or perhaps exercise reduces inflammation in the gut. Or exercise might alter our appetite, and alter the way that our bodies process the food we eat. All of these could affect the microbiome environment,"" Pawluk says. Get a dog Dogs are always tracking things in from outside — like dirt, grass, and insects — exposing their human families to more microbes. That might help counteract the effect of a modern world on the microbiome. ""Over the past century, there's been a decrease in the diversity of the human microbiome, possibly because of sanitation and modern medicine,"" Pawluk says. ""Studies looking at young children growing up in a house with a pet show their microbiome becomes more diverse and they have less risk of allergies. We don't know if this helps older adults, but it wouldn't hurt."" Don't smoke Cigarettes contain lots of chemicals and toxins that are harmful to the whole body, including your gut and its residents. ""Smoking can kill some microbes and decrease microbe diversity. Smoking also puts physical stress on the body, including microbes. And when microbes are under stress, they change their function; they sense that they're in a bad situation and in some cases attack each other — or us. That can cause imbalance in the gut microbiome,"" Pawluk says. Consider probiotics One last suggestion that may affect the gut microbiome is to ingest colonies of ""good"" bacteria known as probiotics, which come in pills or powders or occur naturally in fermented foods (such as yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut). ""The intention is to boost the amount of beneficial bacteria in the gut,"" Pawluk says. ""If you've recently taken antibiotics, which kill both harmful and beneficial bacteria, probiotics may help re-establish a diverse microbiome. The thing is, if you already have a diverse gut microbiome, adding more of one species probably isn't going to promote any significant change."" But Pawluk says there's no evidence probiotics are harmful, especially when they come from food. And there are many reasons why you might want to eat healthy probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, which has lots of calcium, or try any of the lifestyle habits we've laid out here. They all benefit health in numerous ways. Image: © wmaster890/Getty Images",3,0.33995578,0.054123808
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/want-probiotics-but-dislike-yogurt-try-these-foods-202107142918,Want probiotics but dislike yogurt? Try these foods,1,"The top item on my grocery list is always yogurt: unsweetened, organic, made with almond milk. I'm always afraid I'll run out since I use it all the time. I put two tablespoons in every smoothie, switch it out for mayo, and nothing beats a cool cup on a hot day as an afternoon snack. Besides healthy doses of calcium and protein, yogurt is a prime source for probiotics, the ""good"" live bacteria and yeasts. Why are these helpful? Having a proper balance of bacteria in your gut improves digestion, blocks dangerous organisms that can cause infections, and boosts your immune system. It also helps your body absorb vital nutrients from food. What to know about probiotics Unlike vitamins, there is no recommended daily intake for probiotics, so there is no way to know which type of bacteria or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add some foods with probiotics to your daily diet. Hundreds of ingestible bacteria are classified as probiotics. The two found in most probiotic foods are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, each of which contains various strains. On food labels, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are often abbreviated as L. or B. and then combined with name of a specific strain. So, the strain acidophilus within the Lactobacillus bacteria is written as L. acidophilus. Probiotics in yogurt This brings us back to yogurt, which often contains L. acidophilus. Yogurt is a popular probiotic food because it's widely available, and there are different ways to consume it. Some brands include a Live & Active Cultures (LAC) seal from the International Dairy Foods Association to verify probiotic content. Otherwise, look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label. (Also, many fruit or sweetened varieties have too much sugar, so check labels for that, too.) Looking beyond yogurt for probiotics What if you are not a yogurt enthusiast, or simply want more options? Luckily, many other foods also serve up a good dose of good bacteria. They come in various flavors and textures, so odds are you will find a few to your liking. Kefir. This yogurtlike drink has a tart flavor, with a thinner consistency than yogurt. The beverage is usually made with dairy milk, but also comes in non-dairy alternatives, like coconut water, coconut milk, and rice milk. Kefir also comes in fruit and vegetable flavors, or you can add flavors yourself like cinnamon, vanilla, and pumpkin spice. It is also an excellent base for smoothies. Kimchi. Kimchi is a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish made with a mix of garlic, salt, vinegar, and chili peppers. It's often served alone or mixed with rice or noodles. You can also add it to scrambled eggs or on top of potatoes. You can find it at most grocery stores or Asian markets. Kombucha. This fermented tea drink has a tangy-tart flavor. Kombucha contains caffeine comparable to some other tea drinks. Some brands have added sugar, so check the label and avoid anything with more than 5 grams of sugar per serving. Miso. A popular paste in Japanese cuisine, miso is made from soybeans fermented with brown rice. It has a strong, salty flavor, and a little goes a long way. Use it as a dipping sauce, spread over your toast, or add it to marinades for fish, meats, and vegetables. Pickles. Not every type of pickle will do. Look for brands brined in water and sea salt instead of vinegar. Sauerkraut. Sauerkraut is pickled cabbage and may be an acquired taste. (I am a fan thanks to my German-born grandmother, who made me Reuben sandwiches as a kid.) Use it as a hot dog topper, mix it into salads, or combine it with your regular side vegetables. Always choose raw or non-pasteurized sauerkraut. It contains more probiotics than commercial sauerkraut, which loses much of its bacteria from pasteurization. Tempeh. Tempeh is a cake made from fermented soybeans, with a firmer texture than tofu. It is a popular meat substitute — try it as a veggie burger patty, or add to pasta sauce. Tempeh often comes precooked and ready to eat, but some brands may need cooking.",0,0.29327518,0.28898236
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-causes-of-constipation,Common causes of constipation,1,"Many factors can dispose a person to constipation. Some can easily be prevented by changing habits and lifestyle, but often the reason(s) are not so obvious. Following are the more common causes of constipation: Lack of exercise. People who exercise regularly generally don't develop constipation. Basically, the colon responds to activity. Good muscle tone in general is important for regular bowel movements. The abdominal wall muscles and the diaphragm all play a crucial role in the process of defecation. If these muscles are weak, they're not going to be able to do the job as well. But exercise is not a cure-all. Increasing exercise to improve constipation may be more effective in older people, who tend to be more sedentary, than in younger people. Opioids. The digestive tract has receptors for opioids, and constipation can occur (or worsen) when people take opioid pain medications. Opioid-induced constipation occurs in roughly 90% of cancer patients taking opioids for pain and 40% of people taking opioids for chronic noncancer pain. Other medications. Constipation is a side effect of many prescription and over-the-counter drugs. These include antacids that contain aluminum, antispasmodics, antidepressants, tranquilizers and sedatives, bismuth salts, iron supplements, diuretics, anticholinergics, calcium-channel blockers, and anticonvulsants. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some people who suffer from IBS have sluggish bowel movements, straining during bowel movements, and abdominal discomfort. Constipation may be the predominant symptom, or it may alternate with diarrhea. Cramping, gas, and bloating are also common. Over use of laxatives. Laxatives are sometimes used inappropriately, for example, by people suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia. But for people with long-term constipation, the extended use of laxatives may be a reasonable solution. In the past, long-term use of some laxatives was thought to damage nerve cells in the colon and interfere with the colon's innate ability to contract. However, newer formulations of laxatives have made this outcome less common. Changes in life or routine. Traveling can give some people problems because it disrupts normal diet and daily routines. Aging often affects regularity by reducing intestinal activity and muscle tone. Pregnancy may cause women to become constipated because of hormonal changes or because the enlarged uterus pushes on the intestine. Ignoring the urge. If you have to go, go. If you hold in a bowel movement, for whatever reason, you may be inviting a bout of constipation. People who repeatedly ignore the urge to move their bowels may eventually stop feeling the urge. Not enough fiber and fluids in the diet. A diet too low in fiber and fluids and too high in fats can con-tribute to constipation. Fiber absorbs water and causes stools to be larger, softer, and easier to pass. Increasing fiber intake helps cure constipation in many people, but those with more severe constipation sometimes find that increasing fiber makes their constipation worse and leads to gassiness and discomfort. Other causes. Diseases that can cause constipation include neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis; metabolic and endocrine disorders, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease; bowel cancer; and diverticulitis. A number of systemic conditions, like scleroderma, can also cause constipation. In addition, intestinal obstructions, caused by scar tissue (adhesions) from past surgery or strictures of the colon or rectum, can compress, squeeze, or narrow the intestine and rectum, causing constipation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-a-hiatal-hernia,What is a hiatal hernia?,1,"Ask the doctors Q. My partner just got diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. What is it, and is it dangerous? A. Hiatal hernias are very common. They occur when part of the stomach pokes through a natural gap (called a hiatus) in the diaphragm, which is a muscle separating your chest from your abdomen. Normally the esophagus connects with the stomach through this hole, but in some cases, the upper part of the stomach slides upward through the hiatus. The most common cause is weakened musculature that surrounds the hiatus, which can be aggravated by straining during bowel movements, intense coughing, pregnancy, or heavy exertion. While many people who have a hiatal hernia have no symptoms, acid reflux is common. The hernia can change the position and function of the lower esophageal sphincter — a circular muscle at the base of the esophagus that normally keeps acid inside the stomach. The sphincter does not always close when it should, allowing irritating stomach acid to escape into the esophagus, which can cause heartburn. The good news is that most people with a hiatal hernia don't need treatment, and fewer than 5% of people with a hiatal hernia need surgery to fix the problem. If you are experiencing acid reflux symptoms, such as heartburn, it may be helpful to eat smaller meals and avoid eating within two hours of bedtime at night. If your doctor thinks it's necessary, you may also want to take an antacid. Illustration by Michael Linkinholker",9,0.17238666,-0.12191126
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-impact-of-stress-on-your-gut,The impact of stress on your gut,1,"Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it might seem obvious that the pair often influence each other. Some people feel nauseated before giving a presentation; others feel intestinal pain during times of stress. In any case, emotional and psychosocial factors play a role in functional gastrointestinal disorders. Treating the whole body Stress-related symptoms felt in the gastrointestinal tract vary greatly from one person to the next, and treatment can vary as well. For example, one person with gastroesophageal reflux disease might have an occasional, mild burning sensation in the chest, while another experiences excruciating discomfort night after night. As the severity of symptoms varies, so should the therapies, medications, self-help strategies, or even surgeries used to relieve them. Many people have mild symptoms that respond quickly to changes in diet or medications. If your symptoms do not improve, your clinician may ask you more questions about your medical history and perform some diagnostic tests to rule out an underlying cause. For some people, symptoms improve as soon as a serious diagnosis, like cancer, has been ruled out. Your doctor may also recommend symptom-specific medications. But sometimes these treatments are not enough. If symptoms persist, it's common to experience psychological distress. Some people are reluctant to accept the role of psycho-social factors in their illness. But it's important to know that emotions cause genuine chemical and physical responses in the body that can result in pain and discomfort. Cognitive behavioral therapy and stress reduction techniques such as meditation and relaxation therapies can help manage pain and improve other symptoms in ways that are different from how drugs act. The goal of all therapies is to reduce anxiety, encourage healthy behaviors, and help people cope with the pain and discomfort of their condition.

Is cheese a good source? A. Probiotics, good bacteria that can contribute to gut and overall health, can be found in some types of cheese as well as in dietary supplements, fermented foods, and yogurt. Typically, probiotics are in cheeses that have been aged but not heated afterward. This includes both soft and hard cheeses, including Swiss, provolone, Gouda, cheddar, Edam, Gruyère, and cottage cheese. Adding probiotics to your diet can potentially improve your health by helping to foster the growth of good bacteria inside your gut. Your gut contains some 100 trillion bacteria, but in some cases, the balance between the helpful and harmful bacteria falls out of balance. When this occurs, experts believe it may be linked to a host of conditions, such as allergies, mood disorders, and arthritis. Eating foods that contain probiotics, such as cheese, can help restore this natural balance. The only caution when it comes to cheese is to not overdo it. Cheese tends to be high in calories, saturated fat, and sodium.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/looking-out-for-diverticulitis-202108162572,Looking out for diverticulitis,1,"Most people don't have much in common with Pope Francis. But about 200,000 Americans each year can say they share an experience with the head of the Catholic Church: they had surgery for diverticulitis. Although Pope Francis recovered well from his procedure in July, it shed light on this potentially serious condition of the colon. If you have questions about why diverticulitis occurs, the most common signs of this condition, and how it is treated, read on. What is diverticulitis? Diverticulitis arises from a condition called diverticulosis, which occurs when weak areas in the inner wall of the colon bulge outward and form tiny pouches. Many people get diverticulosis as they age. In fact, diverticulosis affects about 58% of US adults over age 60. Getting enough fiber in your diet can help protect against diverticulosis. Most people are unaware they even have this condition. Often the diagnosis of diverticulosis is first mentioned in a report when a person has a colonoscopy or had an abdominal CT scan for another reason. Diverticulosis doesn't cause symptoms, but people who have irritable bowel syndrome or who are prone to constipation, bloating, and abdominal discomfort after eating are more likely to have it. ""While diverticulosis is very common, only a small percentage of people who have it will ever develop diverticulitis caused by inflammation or infection of one of the pouches,"" says Dr. Matthew Hamilton, a gastroenterologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Know the signs of diverticulitis The most common symptoms of diverticulitis are abdominal pain (usually on the lower left side) and fever. The pain is distinct and sharp, and may strike over a few hours. Other symptoms may include a combination of loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and cramping, and not passing gas or stool. A mild case of diverticulitis that causes only minimal pain in the lower abdomen can resolve on its own within a day or two. However, you should seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms are not going away or you are feeling worse, such as having increasing pain, fever, bloody stools, or abdominal bloating with vomiting. Treatment depends on whether you have uncomplicated or complicated diverticulitis. Your doctor can determine this by using a combination of blood tests and imaging studies, such as a CT scan. How is uncomplicated diverticulitis treated? As the name implies, uncomplicated diverticulitis is the less serious of the two. It means that the inflammation or infection is confined to one section of the colon, and that there is no evidence of complicating factors. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is typically treated at home with oral antibiotics. You'll also be prescribed ""bowel rest"" for a few days, which often includes a clear liquid diet. This gives your bowel a chance to rest and heal, and may reduce pain. Additionally, you'll follow a low-fiber diet (about 10 to 15 grams of fiber a day) until your symptoms improve. Some people may need to be hospitalized to receive intravenous (IV) antibiotics. A hospital stay is more likely if you're 65 or older or have other medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. People usually begin to feel improvement from treatment after about three days. If you feel well enough and the symptoms have subsided, you can gradually resume your regular diet. If symptoms haven't responded to antibiotics after a week, you probably will undergo CT scans and other tests to see if you have complicated diverticulitis. How is complicated diverticulitis treated? Complicated diverticulitis means you have a specific complication that requires a longer course of IV antibiotics, and possibly surgery. Pope Francis had scarring in a segment of colon where he previously had diverticulitis, which had caused a narrowing in the colon called stenosis. In a case like this, the unhealthy part of the colon is removed, and the remaining colon is then reconnected. Other types of complications that may occur during an active diverticulitis infection include: Abscess. A diverticular abscess is a collection of pus (a fluid that can form at the site of infection) outside of the intestinal wall. If the abscess doesn't get better with antibiotics, a doctor will need to drain the pus using a needle, under guidance through images on a CT scan. Perforation. Diverticulitis can cause a hole in the colon that allows bowel contents to spill into the abdominal cavity. If you have a perforation, your abdomen may feel tender to touch, hard, or enlarged. Surgery repairs the hole. Sometimes part of the colon around the hole must be removed. Fistula. A fistula is an abnormal connection between the inflamed and infected segment of the colon and adjacent organs, such as other parts of the intestine or the bladder. Surgery consists of colon resection and removing the fistula. Can diverticulitis be prevented? Eating a high-fiber diet and managing stress may lower the risk of developing pouches in the colon known as diverticula. So it makes sense that these lifestyle interventions might help make diverticulitis less likely to occur. However, once you have diverticulosis, there is no proven way to prevent one of the diverticula from becoming infected or inflamed.",9,0.17296831,-0.05327038

Sometimes, these strokes cause temporary balance problems or clumsiness in an arm or leg that people attribute to another cause. In addition, people can experience a series of silent strokes, which can manifest as memory lapses or subtle changes in mood. When people experience a number of silent strokes over time, it can lead to a condition called multi-infarct dementia.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-you-should-move-even-just-a-little-throughout-the-day,Why you should move — even just a little — throughout the day,1,"Sitting for long, uninterrupted periods of time may leave you more prone to cardiovascular problems. How much time do you spend sitting each day? If you're like most people, more than half of your waking hours are spent parked on a chair or sofa. Even if you dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to structured exercise (such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming), it's still important to get up and move for at least a few minutes, many times throughout the day. ""The more you sit, the more your large muscles are not using glucose, the body's main energy source. Uninterrupted sitting can cause blood sugar levels to rise, triggering the release of insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar,"" says Dr. Hicham Skali, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Over time, sedentary habits cause the body to become less sensitive to insulin. The resulting insulin resistance promotes inflammation, a key player in the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries, he explains. Preliminary evidence from studies in rats suggests that sedentary behavior may change the activity of dozens of genes, including the gene responsible for making lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This enzyme helps break down fat so it can be used for energy or stored in the body. When rats were prevented from moving, LPL levels decreased, a change that may also contribute to raising heart disease risk, Dr. Skali explains. Don't just sit there The evidence about the harms of uninterrupted sitting (and the benefits of breaking it up) has been piling up for years, aided by tools such as fitness trackers that reveal people's typical activity patterns. Here are just a few examples of supportive studies: More than 2,600 people ages 60 and older reported their typical sitting habits (including a weekday and weekend) and were followed for nine years. Those who sat for an average of about three hours a day were 33% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease during the follow-up period than people who sat for an average of about seven hours a day. Among 8,000 people followed for 10 years, those who did light activity instead of sitting for 30 minutes each day had a 17% lower risk of dying in that period, even if they split up that half-hour of activity into periods as brief as a minute each. In more than 5,600 women followed for five years, reducing sedentary time by one hour per day was linked to a 26% lower risk of heart disease. Again, the hour of non-sedentary time didn't have to occur all at once. Short, light-intensity interruptions to sitting were just as effective. Making the moves There are many ways you can add short bursts of movement to your daily routine. Whenever you notice you've been sitting for a while, do a short set of exercises — say five to 10 squats or leg lifts, Dr. Skali suggests. You can also keep a stretchy exercise band near your favorite chair to get some arm exercises in as well. Here are some other ideas: Set a reminder. Many fitness trackers feature alerts that remind you to get up at least once an hour. But you can also use a smartphone or a regular kitchen timer; use it during periods when you tend to sit for long stretches. Take care of your chores less efficiently. Put your groceries or other purchases in small bags and make multiple trips from your car to your home. Stand up while folding laundry, and put just a few items of clothing away at a time to get more steps in. Pace or tidy up during phone calls. Whenever you're on the phone, stand up. Try to walk back and forth or in circles while you talk. Or use a hands-free headset and do some light housework while you chat. Move a little while you watch TV. The average American watches close to five hours of television a day, and that amount increases as people age. At least once an hour, stand up and march in place, swing your arms, or do some easy stretches. Take the long way. Whenever you drive somewhere, park in a spot farther from the door to get in some extra steps. Take the stairs instead of the escalator or elevator, even if you climb only one or two of the total flights. Image: © SeventyFour/Getty Images",6,0.42933887,-0.23818512

Two-thirds were taking statins, mostly simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin (Lipitor). The group participated in a walking event in which they trekked either 18, 25, or 31 miles on each of four consecutive days. Muscle pain, fatigue scores, and levels of enzymes associated with muscle injury were measured before and after the event. The researchers found that pain, fatigue, and enzyme levels increased similarly for all participants whether or not they took statins or had existing muscle pain. According to the researchers, the new findings suggest that the drugs won't exacerbate usual pain symptoms from moderate-intensity exercise.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/taming-travelers-tummy,Taming traveler's tummy,1,"Travel is meant to transport you far from the same-old, same-old. But when you're not eating the same foods and sleeping on the same schedule (or even in the same time zone), the ripple effects on digestion can be fierce. With more nerve cells than many parts of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord, our gut knows when we're off our routine, says Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Our bodies, including our gastrointestinal tract, respond to circadian rhythms — day-and-night cues,"" he says. ""Your colon will sleep when you sleep and wake up when you do. If those times are shifted by travel and changing time zones, digestion can get thrown off."" Factor in heavy meals, too much alcohol, or dehydration from flying, and ""it's sort of a perfect storm to cause digestive problems,"" Dr. Staller says. ""Even the stress of travel itself can trigger them."" The result? Diarrhea, constipation, and indigestion — the trifecta of travelers' tummy troubles — can potentially derail your trip. Foodborne dangers Travel took a hiatus during the pandemic, but today's packed airplanes, rental car shortages, and booked-solid hotels signal a turnaround. According to U.S. Travel Association predictions, pent-up demand will fuel a surge over the next few years in all types of travel, including to destinations across the globe. Far-off locales, however — especially in developing countries — pose the biggest threat of delivering an unpleasant souvenir dubbed traveler's diarrhea. Its abdominal cramps and loose stools stem from eating or drinking germ-laden foods and beverages. Traveler's diarrhea affects an estimated 30% to 70% of travelers, according to the CDC. It can occur anywhere, but the highest-risk destinations are in most of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America. The condition typically results from poor hygienic practices in food handling and preparation or a lack of refrigeration. You're also more likely to get it if you're an older adult or — as with traveler's tummy in general — if you already have a digestive problem, such as irritable bowel syndrome, that changes how you eat or eliminate food. Microbes aren't the only culprit. ""Some people get so-called adjustment diarrhea, when they haven't ingested anything that's infectious but they're adjusting to new foods or spices,"" Dr. Staller says. Keep digestion humming The first step in warding off traveler's tummy is to learn from past mistakes, especially if you're prone to digestive upsets. ""The tendency is to arrive somewhere new and embrace it in all aspects,"" Dr. Staller says. ""Instead, keep your food choices more in line with things you eat at home, drink plenty of water, and eat moderate portions."" Beyond that, Dr. Staller offers additional strategies to keep indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation at bay: Plan ahead. Scope out restaurants and menus beforehand to make sure at least one item seems both palatable and easy to digest. ""This is more difficult, though, if you're more of a spontaneous traveler or staying in someone's home,"" he says. Assemble a ""control kit."" Rather than scrambling to purchase remedies in unfamiliar locations, bring along a variety of over-the-counter products to counteract digestive woes on the road. Good choices include antacids (such as Tums) for heartburn; bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate) for indigestion or diarrhea; docusate sodium (Colace, Surfak), psyllium (Metamucil), or bisacodyl (Dulcolax) for constipation; and loperamide (Imodium) for diarrhea. But don't use loperamide if you also have signs of infection such as fever or blood in your stool, Dr. Staller says. Instead, see a doctor. Pack familiar snacks. Whether that's granola bars, nuts, trail mix, or dried fruit, these items should be filling. ""There's no one-size-fits-all recommendation, but pick things you might eat at home as a quick snack or even a meal substitute in case you notice that everything at your location is going to disagree with you,"" he says. Eat street food with caution. Local delicacies or food truck cuisine are more apt to contain harmful bacteria, especially in developing regions. ""This isn't fun, because some of the tastiest food is street food,"" Dr. Staller says. ""But if you indulge, know you're taking that risk. If you're easily derailed by digestive issues, street food is a no-go."" Skip local water and ice. ""In the developing world, assume the water isn't safe unless it's from a bottle,"" he says. Instead, drink only what comes in cans or bottles. Image: © Science Photo Library/Getty Images",9,0.3480123,-0.05181927
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-mouth-taping-help-my-snoring,Can mouth taping help my snoring?,1,"Q. My daughter heard on social media that taping our mouths closed during sleep could improve snoring and lessen bad breath. Is this true? A. Unfortunately, social media is rife with so-called medical advice that has no basis in science, and this sounds like yet another example. While intentional nose breathing during waking hours can offer many benefits — including slowing breathing, filtering allergens, and easing anxiety — taping your mouth while sleeping to achieve this can prove risky, leading to hampered breathing, disrupted sleep, or skin irritation. There's no research to support the measure, which, in certain cases, could significantly reduce a person's oxygen levels while sleeping. If you find you consistently can't breathe through your nose while sleeping, you may have some type of nasal obstruction, such as a deviated septum or a nasal polyp. (Research has linked nasal obstruction with snoring.) You may also have allergies, asthma, or sleep apnea (meaning you briefly and repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/understanding-statin-intensity,Understanding statin intensity,1,"Q. I'm 71 and have taken 20 milligrams (mg) of atorva­statin (Lipitor) since 2010, after an angiogram showed a 90% blockage of a small coronary artery. But I've never had angina or a heart attack. My LDL is 70 mg/dL. Should I switch to 20 mg of rosuvastatin (Crestor), which I understand is a higher-intensity statin? A. You're correct — a 20-mg dose of rosuvastatin is considered high-intensity statin therapy. Before getting into my advice, let me first explain what we mean by statin intensity. Currently, there are eight different cholesterol-lowering statins on the market, each available in different dosages. In general, the higher the dosage, the more they lower your LDL cholesterol. However, some statins (especially rosuvastatin) lower LDL cholesterol better than others. So experts have classified statin therapy into three categories (low, moderate, or high intensity) based on how much they can lower LDL. As you can see by the table below, a statin can fall into more than one intensity category, depending on the dosage. For example, 10 or 20 mg of atorvastatin daily is considered moderate intensity, while 40 to 80 mg is high intensity. The choice of a statin depends on a person's risk. For someone with high LDL but no other risk factors or evidence of coronary artery disease, moderate-intensity therapy makes sense. But for someone like you, with known coronary artery disease, the guidelines recommended high-intensity therapy, as several trials have documented a lower risk of heart attack and stroke for people on high-intensity therapy compared with moderate-intensity therapy. The guidelines also recommended lowering LDL by 50% or aiming for an LDL of less than 70 mg/dl.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dont-bomb-the-bowel-with-laxatives,Laxatives: What to know about choosing the right one,1,"Occasional irregularity is a fact of life, but you can minimize it with some basic steps. You should be sure you are eating a fiber-rich diet, drinking adequate fluids, and staying physically active. But when you have constipation, the best laxative is the gentlest and safest option, like a bulk-forming laxative. If laxatives don't work, ask for help. You should see your doctor and discuss it if you are constantly needing to take laxatives. How do stool softeners work? Stool softeners work by softening stools to make them easier to pass. They can be in capsule, tablet, liquid, and syrup form and are usually taken at bedtime. Be sure to take stool softeners exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. First choice: bulk-forming laxatives Bulk-forming laxatives draw water into stool, making it softer and easier to pass. But don't expect instant gratification: these can take a half-day to several days to provide relief. They are safe to use daily. They contain various ingredients, and you may have to try more than one to find the product that helps you with minimal side effects, such as flatulence and bloating. They may be marketed as laxatives or as fiber supplements. For stuck stools... Stool softeners add moisture to stools to make them softer and easier to pass. Mineral oil, a lubricant, helps stools ""slide on by"" if the stools feel stuck low in your bowels, if you have an internal tear or ""fissure,"" or if you have pain from hemorrhoids during bowel movements. Don't take mineral oil at the same time as stool softeners. Take 1 tablespoon at breakfast or lunch. But don't use it for more than a few days, because mineral oil interferes with absorption of some vitamins and if inhaled it can cause pneumonia. Consider wearing a protective pad in your undergarments to absorb any leakage. Other laxative options If stool softeners aren't providing enough help, the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX or a generic version) is good next step. These products hold water in stool to soften it and increase bowel movements. Common side effects are gas, bloating, and nausea. Another option that works for some people is diet candies containing the sweetener sorbitol. These essentially trigger a mild case of the runs. You may experience bloating and gas along with the laxative effect, however. Another option would be a magnesium-based laxative, such as milk of magnesia or magnesium citrate. These are members of a larger class of laxatives called saline osmotics, which draw water into the bowels and trigger bowel movements. The active ingredients include magnesium, sulfate, citrate, and phosphate. But don't take more than the recommended amounts of these laxatives, or use them long-term, because they can throw off your chemistry. Combined with an underperforming kidney or heart failure, saline osmotic laxatives can be dangerous. Common laxatives and brands Active ingredient Common brands Bulk forming bran cereals and other foods calcium polycarbophil FiberCon dextrin Benefiber methylcellulose Citrucel psyllium Metamucil Stool softeners docusate Colace, Correctol, Peri-Colac e, Surfak Lubricants mineral oil Various branded and generic products Osmotics magnesium magnesium citrate, milk of magnesia polyethylene glycol MiraLAX or generic versions sodium phosphate Fleet Phospho-Soda sorbitol or lactulose ingredients in various products Stimulants Bisacodyl Correctol, Dulcolax, Ex-Lax Ultra Casanthranol Dialose Plus, Peri-Colace Cascara Naturalax castor oil various brand and generic products Senna Ex-Lax, Fletcher's Castoria, Senokot Stimulant laxatives Stimulant laxatives such as senna and bisacodyl trigger contractions in the bowels that push the stool along. But if you take stimulant laxatives too often, you could become dependent on them to have a bowel movement at all — possibly because the bowel has stopped functioning normally. When to talk to a doctor If you find yourself trying one laxative after another, see your doctor for an evaluation. Additional testing can lead to better therapy and rule out any possible serious malfunctions. And if it is just constipation, your doctor can offer other medications to you that may be more helpful than over-the-counter laxatives. Image: Wavebreakmedia/Getty Images",9,0.32988325,0.080200315
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ibd-and-lgbtq-how-it-can-affect-sexual-health-202306282949,IBD and LGBTQ+: How it can affect sexual health,1,"Everyone who lives with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) knows their illness has a major impact on daily life. Many people are diagnosed in their 20s or 30s, a time when we might hope for few health challenges. Medications, and sometimes surgery, may be used to treat IBD. If you identify as LGBTQ+, you might wonder how all of this may affect you — your physical health, of course, but also your sexual health and pleasure. Below are a few things to understand and consider. What is inflammatory bowel disease? IBD is a condition that causes inflammation along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The two main types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: Crohn's disease: inflammation can occur anywhere along the GI tract (from the mouth to the anus) Ulcerative colitis: typically affects the large intestine (colon) only. IBD can cause diarrhea, bloody stool, weight loss, and abdominal pain, and is typically diagnosed with blood and stool tests, imaging, and colonoscopy. A diagnosis of IBD may increase the risk of developing anxiety or depression, and can also have an impact on sexual health. People with IBD may require long-term medical treatment or surgery for their condition. The starting point: Talking to your doctor Talking to your medical team about IBD and sexual health may not be easy. This may depend on how comfortable you feel disclosing your LGBTQ+ identity with your health care providers. Ideally, you should feel comfortable discussing sexuality with your medical team, including what types of sexual partners and activities you participate in and how IBD may affect this part of your life. Be aware that health care providers may not be able to address all LGBTQ+-specific concerns. Optimal care for people with IBD who identify as LGBTQ+ is not fully understood. However, this is an active area of research. How might medicines for IBD affect sexual health? Many effective IBD medications subdue the immune system to decrease inflammation. These immunosuppressive medicines may raise your risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV, chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea. What you can do: Discuss these concerns with your doctor so you can take appropriate protective measures. This might include: ensuring that your vaccinations, such as hepatitis B and HPV, are up to date. engaging in sex using barrier protection to prevent STI transmission. taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This safe and effective medicine helps prevent the spread of HIV. Ask your primary care doctor or gastroenterologist if PrEP is appropriate for you. How might surgery for IBD affect sexual health? For some people with IBD, gut inflammation is severe enough to require surgery to remove part of the intestine. For example: Abscesses or fistulas (abnormal connections between two body parts) sometimes form when someone has Crohn's disease around the anus. This may require surgical treatment. Active inflammation in the rectum or anus may make sex painful, particularly for people who engage in anal receptive sex. We don't yet know whether anal receptive sex is safe for people who have had surgery to remove the colon and create a J-pouch, which is formed from small intestine to create an internal pouch that enables normal bowel movements. What you can do: Discuss your concerns with your gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeon. If you engage in anal sex, you may be confused about whether it is safe to do so. While you may feel uncomfortable discussing this concern and others with your doctor, try to be as honest and open as you can. That way, you'll receive the best information on how to engage in safe and enjoyable sex after an IBD diagnosis or surgery. What else to consider if you are transgender People with IBD who are transgender may have additional concerns to address. For example, there may be a risk for sexual side effects from gender-affirming surgery. These procedures may include vaginoplasty (surgical creation of a vagina) for transgender females, or phalloplasty (surgical creation of a penis) for transgender males. The safety of these procedures in people with IBD is not currently well understood. What you can do: If you identify as transgender, ask your doctor if any gender-affirming surgeries you've had or medicines you take, such as hormones, might affect your IBD, recommended treatments, or sexual health. If you're considering gender-affirming surgery, discuss your options with your medical team. Be aware that gender-affirming surgery may be more challenging, or may not be advisable, for people with complex or active IBD. It's important to discuss your specific risks with your doctor when pursuing gender-affirming care. Having access to a team of physicians, including a surgeon and a gastroenterologist, may improve outcomes. The bottom line Try to talk to your gastroenterologist about how your sexual practices and gender identity may affect — and be affected by — your IBD. A conversation like this may feel uncomfortable, but being candid about your symptoms and concerns will help you receive the best possible care. Often, a multidisciplinary approach to care is helpful. Your health care providers, including your gastroenterologist and surgeon, may suggest seeing additional specialists. Much remains unknown about sexual health and practices in LGBTQ+ people with IBD. While more research is needed, open communication on the impact of medications, surgery, and other aspects of living with IBD can do a lot to improve your quality of life.",9,0.21801999,-0.11112183
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/irregular-sleep-patterns-linked-to-atherosclerosis,Irregular sleep patterns linked to atherosclerosis,1,"Go to sleep at 11 p.m. one night, and 2 a.m. the next? You may want to rethink that pattern. A study published online Feb. 15, 2023, by the Journal of the American Heart Association suggests that sleep irregularity — night-to-night variations in sleep duration and timing (when you sleep) — are linked to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arteries). Researchers from Harvard and other institutions asked a diverse group of more than 2,000 people (average age 69), without any known atherosclerosis, to wear sleep trackers and keep sleep diaries for one week. Participants also underwent assessments of artery plaque and one night of sleep testing. Scientists found that people with the most variation in sleep duration (more than two hours a night in a week) and sleep timing (more than 90 minutes in a week) were more likely to have atherosclerosis, compared with people whose sleep was the most consistent. This is an observational study, and we can't make definitive conclusions about cause and effect. But we already know that other sleep problems, such as interrupted sleep and poor sleep quality, are associated with cardiovascular disease. So the connection is plausible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-best-sun-protective-clothing,The best sun-protective clothing,1,"Summer officially starts this month, and in addition to using a strong sunscreen when you go outside, it's a good idea to wear sun-protective clothing. That's not just any hat or long-sleeved shirt in your closet; sun-protective clothes are made of materials that effectively shield your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Protective fabrics Loosely woven fabrics of summer (such as gauze and linen) do very little to keep UV radiation from reaching your skin. The best defense comes from tightly woven fabrics with high thread counts, in dark or bright colors (which absorb light). Examples include polyester, nylon, lightweight wool, or canvas. Many clothing manufacturers now use high-tech fabrics for sun-protective garments. High-tech fabrics offer at least as much protection as regular densely woven fabrics, and maybe more. Often these fabrics wick away moisture and dry quickly. Some are even embedded with chemicals used in sunscreens (such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide). Note, however, that such chemical protection may last for only a limited amount of wash cycles, such as 20 to 40. UPF protection You'll know for sure if clothes are sun-protective if they have an Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) rating on the label. That's a measure of how much UV radiation penetrates the fabric. ""Look for a UPF rating of 50, which should block about 98% of the sun's rays. It's comparable to sunscreen with a sun protection factor [SPF] of 30, so wearing the clothes is consistent with actually putting sunscreen on,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Can you skip sunscreen if you're wearing UPF-rated clothes? ""Yes, but only for areas covered by the clothes,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""Any exposed skin still needs sunscreen, such as your neck, ears, hands, and feet."" And keep in mind that all clothes, UPF-rated or not, provide less UV protection when they get wet or if they're stretched and light can peek between the fibers. ""So make sure clothing fits loosely. And it's not a bad idea to wear a waterproof sunscreen beneath sun-protective clothes if you know you'll be perspiring a lot or going into water,"" Dr. Waldman says. Options and costs If you're looking to buy UPF-rated clothing, you'll find a wide range of options to shield every inch of your skin, including hats, scarves, gloves, face masks, neck gaiters, shirts, hoodies, dresses, skirts, shorts, pants, leggings, shawls, swimwear, unitards, and more. Which items do you really need? ""The more skin you cover, the better, especially if you're doing yard work or going to the beach,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""A hat, long-sleeved shirt, and pants are preferable. That can be a challenge on a really hot day, so make sure the fabric feels breathable and has moisture-wicking properties."" UPF-rated clothing can be pricey. A man's long-sleeved tee from some of the largest retailers (such as Coolibar Sun Protective Clothing, Columbia Sportswear Company, Lands' End, or L.L. Bean) goes for about $50. Brimmed hats for men and women also start at about $50. To save some money, Dr. Waldman recommends using a laundry aid that adds sun-protective chemicals to densely woven clothes you already own (dry-fit nylon or polyester-blend tees are good candidates). The laundry aid is called Rit SunGuard, and it can give clothes a UPF of 30. ""It's a powder. You just throw it in with normal washing, and it lasts for 20 washes. The clothes look the same,"" Dr. Waldman says. A word about hats You need a hat that protects more than just the crown of your head from UV rays, and that means you need a wide brim. ""A lot of people fall short by using a baseball cap. But it doesn't cover the ears, the chin, or the back of the neck. So get as wide a brim as possible, at least three inches,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""If you're not wearing a hat with a wide brim, apply sunscreen on exposed areas. And that goes for when you wear bike helmets, too. They have slits that allow for sunburns."" A hat's materials and construction are also important considerations. ""You don't want a lot of mesh or large holes in the hat, because UV rays can reach your skin. The best material would be canvas, polyester, or nylon. They'll provide more protection than a straw hat,"" Dr. Waldman says. Remember why you're doing this Taking the time to wear protective clothes outside has a big payoff for your skin. ""Even one sunburn can result in skin cancer in a few years,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""If you can cover up and avoid burning now, you'll be better off later."" Image: © Westend61, Calin Hanga/Getty Images",4,0.05640766,0.056477915

A new study by Harvard researchers suggests that one in five people with cardiovascular disease or diabetes declines to take a recommended statin drug. The study, which spanned 19 years, included more than 24,000 people who had suffered a stroke or had heart disease, vascular disease, diabetes, or very high cholesterol. Over all, about two-thirds of people advised to take statins eventually started them, but the other third never did. Over the entire course of the study, women were more likely than men to never start a statin.

More than 1,900 participants were infected with the virus during that time, and 44% of those developed long COVID, with symptoms persisting beyond four weeks after the initial infection. Women who practiced five or six of a list of healthy lifestyle habits — including weight control, not smoking, regular exercise, adequate sleep, high-quality diet, and moderate alcohol consumption — were 49% less likely to develop long COVID compared with women who practiced none. Of the six lifestyle factors, healthy body weight and adequate sleep (defined as seven to nine hours nightly) were most strongly linked with lower risk.

But sometimes it seems elevated for no apparent reason. Why might this happen? A. When at rest, the average adult's heart beats between 60 and 100 times each minute. Your heart can speed up for many different reasons — including, as you've noted, physical activity. Other triggers are also temporary, such as stress, smoking, or caffeine or alcohol use. Certain medications, including those that treat colds, asthma, mood disorders, and high blood pressure, can also elevate your heart rate. But a higher-than-normal heart rate can also result from a serious health condition such as anemia, overactive thyroid, or heart disease. Seek immediate medical care if your heart rate seems high and you're also short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded, or weak, or if you have chest pain. In the absence of urgent symptoms, make an appointment to talk to your doctor about what else might be contributing to a higher heart rate. You might also be interested in...

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/managing-stress-and-eating-leafy-vegetables-may-protect-the-brain,Managing stress and eating leafy vegetables may protect the brain,1,"Scientists continue to examine what causes people's brain health to decline. While natural aging and genetics are part of the equation, lifestyle factors can play a significant role. Two recent studies further explored this connection by looking at how stress and diet might affect cognitive function and protect against Alzheimer's disease. One study found that perceived stress — the degree of stress people feel about their life — was linked to poor cognitive health among older adults. Researchers recruited more than 24,000 people (average age 64). They measured stress and cognitive function with the Perceived Stress Scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination. The results showed that people who scored highest on the stress level scale were more likely to have low cognitive test scores. The reverse was also true — lower stress levels went hand in hand with higher test scores. The results were published online March 7, 2023, by JAMA Network Open. In another study, published online March 8, 2023, by Neurology, researchers explored whether certain dietary habits may lower the risk of Alzheimer's. The researchers analyzed data on 581 people from the Rush Memory and Aging Project cohort, a prospective study of older adults who agreed to undergo annual evaluations and to donate their brain at death. Participants reported on their dietary habits and completed annual food questionnaires. The researchers found that people who regularly followed plant-based diets had lower amounts of beta-amyloid buildup in their brains, a marker for Alzheimer's. Among this group, people with the highest intake of green leafy vegetables — seven or more weekly servings — had less buildup than those who ate only one or two servings a week.

Even the basics of getting through your day, like getting into the car or carrying laundry to the basement, can become sharp reminders of your limitations. Keep on moving It is tempting to avoid the motions that cause you pain. But limiting your movements can weaken muscles and make compound joint trouble worse. And actually movement— in the form of the right exercises performed properly —can be a long-lasting way to subdue ankle, knee, hip, or shoulder pain. For some people, the right exercise routine can even help delay or sidestep surgery. Your goal should be to pair gentle, targeted joint workouts with a simple walking routine. Your doctor should advise you before you begin a new exercise program. Simple stretching tips If you start targeted joint exercises, these simple stretching tips are important to any workout: Warm up first. Muscles stretch more easily when warm. Try doing warm-ups before a workout, or take a warm shower or bath first. Feel no pain. Stretch only to the point of mild tension, never to the point of pain. If a stretch hurts, stop doing it. Reset your position carefully and try again. With time and practice, your flexibility will improve. Breathe. Breathe comfortably when stretching. Practice often. You'll see the best gains if you do gentle stretching frequently—several times a day on as many days of the week as possible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-worry-about-high-triglycerides,Should you worry about high triglycerides?,1,"Triglycerides are a type of fat that gets stored in adipose tissue and circulates in blood. Your body makes triglycerides or gets them from the foods you eat. High triglycerides Your body needs some triglycerides. However, high triglycerides in your blood is linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. Until recently, triglycerides tended to get less attention when looking at cardiovascular risk compared to LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. There's no question that extremely high levels (1,000 mg/dL or more) spell trouble and can lead to acute pancreatitis. What level of triglycerides is dangerous? But what about treating lower levels of triglycerides? Recent evidence suggests you should work to reduce triglyceride levels if they are higher than normal, especially if you have heart disease or have other risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure or smoking. Triglyceride levels Normal Less than 150* Borderline high 150–199 High 200–499 Very high 500 or higher *All values in milligrams per deciliter Source: National Cholesterol Education Program. Triglycerides can be one of the signs of metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk for having a heart attack or stroke. People with metabolic syndrome are several times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. The risk of eventually developing diabetes is even greater. A syndrome is, by definition, a group of signs and symptoms that occur together because of an underlying condition. For metabolic syndrome, that group includes abdominal obesity (as measured by waistline), high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low HDL cholesterol — and, yes, high triglyceride levels. Triglycerides and HDL Triglycerides and HDL are metabolically connected and are often inversely related: As triglycerides go up, HDL tends to go down — and vice versa. But that isn't always so. People can have ""isolated"" high triglycerides without low HDL levels, and research is now showing that high triglycerides are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, no matter what the HDL is. What causes high triglyceride levels? Factors that can raise your triglyceride level include: Being overweight or having obesity Diabetes Cigarette smoking Excessive alcohol use Certain medicines An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) Some genetic disorders How to lower high triglyceride levels Many of the steps you should take to lower triglycerides are the same ones you should take to protect your heart and health overall. Your doctor will advise you of measures you can take to lower high triglycerides. Some of these steps may include: Exercise regularly Lose weight Avoid sugar/refined carbs Limit alcohol intake Quit smoking Get enough sleep Manage stress levels. How to lower triglyceride levels with medication If you're taking a statin to lower your LDL, one side benefit may be reduced triglyceride levels. Depending on the dose, statins can lower triglycerides by 20%–40%. The omega-3 fats in fish and fish oil capsules are another triglyceride-lowering option. For a very high triglyceride level, your doctor can prescribe a high-dose omega-3 medication. Image: udra/Getty Images",3,0.3537901,-0.024946392
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/lifestyle-changes-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-attacks,Lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of gout attacks,1,"Lifestyle measures, such as dietary changes, can help lower levels of uric acid, the chemical that causes gout by forming crystals that deposit in joints. However, for most people, changes in diet alone are not enough to prevent gout. To reduce uric acid levels enough to stop attacks, medication is usually needed. Still making changes in what you eat can lead to fewer gouty flares. In the past, doctors often handed their patients a list of foods high in purines and instructed them not to eat those foods. By itself, that hasn't been shown to be particularly helpful. More recently, experts have begun thinking about diet differently. Instead of trying to figure out which individual foods you should avoid, the focus is on following a healthy diet and trying to lose weight if you're overweight or obese. Just losing weight can lower uric acid levels. Drinking plenty of fluids is also helpful. It's also important to limit sweetened drinks and alcohol, as these can increase uric acid levels. In general, a healthy diet emphasizes plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Whole grains are preferred over processed grains. Intake of fat, especially saturated fat (found in red meat), should be reduced. Lean sources of protein, including chicken, turkey, fish, and tofu, are better choices than beef or pork. Fish, which contains omega-3 fatty acids, is part of a healthy diet. But some seafood also contains high amounts of purines. People with gout don't have to steer completely clear of fish. But try to limit the amount of shellfish, sardines, and anchovies you eat, because they have the highest amounts of purines. A better choice is flaky white fish, such as cod, tilapia, or flounder. One pattern of healthy eating is the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. One study found that people following the DASH diet for eight weeks lowered their uric acid levels 0.25 mg/dL on average. The higher the starting uric acid level, the greater the decline. There are a few foods people with gout should limit as much as possible or avoid entirely. And some foods may be beneficial. For example, multiple studies have found lower uric acid levels among people who consume low-fat dairy products. Studies have found that vitamin C may lower uric acid levels. People with gout may be helped by adding citrus fruits and other foods rich in vitamin C (such as strawberries and peppers) to their diet. Some evidence suggests that eating cherries can reduce gout attacks and improve pain. These findings are not conclusive, but there's no harm in adding cherries to your diet. Remember: You aren't to blame for gout because you overdid the steak and lobster dinners or drank too much alcohol. Gout is a chronic form of arthritis caused by the effects of too much uric acid in the bloodstream. Certain factors can raise your risk of gout and contribute to triggering gout attacks. These include certain foods and alcohol. But just eliminating purine-rich foods and alcohol is not enough to prevent attacks for most people with gout. Medications are used to treat an acute attack, and you can take other medications over the long term to prevent further attacks. When it comes to diet, focus on an overall healthy eating pattern, drink plenty of fluids, and try to lose excess weight. Image: © GettyImage",3,0.4381769,0.13747783

Participants initially underwent cognitive testing as well as genetic testing for genes known to raise risk for Alzheimer's, and reported how well they stuck to six healthy lifestyle habits (eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, not drinking alcohol, being socially active, and engaging in brain-challenging activities). Participants were followed for 10 years, periodically reporting their lifestyle habits and undergoing cognitive testing. At the end of the study, people who stuck to at least four healthy habits showed significantly slower memory decline than people who didn't practice any healthy habits. This was true even among people with Alzheimer's-related genes. The habits associated with the biggest effects were diet, cognitive activity, exercise, and social contact. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that a healthy lifestyle protected memory. But a healthy lifestyle has many health benefits, and you'll only win by improving yours.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/appreciating-golfs-cardiovascular-perks,Appreciating golf's cardiovascular perks,1,"Golf is jokingly described as a good walk spoiled. But that walk is loaded with cardiovascular health benefits — maybe even more than you'd get from an hour of brisk walking or Nordic walking, suggests a small, randomized study published online Feb. 6, 2023, by BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine. Researchers asked 25 healthy, experienced golfers (men and women ages 65 or older) to complete three different types of exercise within a five-day period (just one activity per day). The exercises included one 18-hole round of golf on foot (pulling golf clubs), one hour of brisk walking, and one hour of Nordic walking (which involves the use of poles). On exercise days, participants ate identical breakfasts and snacks; had their blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol measured before and after exercise; and wore activity trackers. All three activities lowered blood pressure and levels of blood sugar and cholesterol. But golf seemed to have slightly more effect on blood sugar and cholesterol, at least in the short term. Scientists speculate it's because of the game's long duration (three to four hours) and the extra energy required to drag heavy clubs around a golf course. In fact, golfing burned more than twice as many calories as the walking activities. Because the study was small, a larger, longer-term study would be needed to confirm the results.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-be-tested-for-sleep-apnea,Should you be tested for sleep apnea?,1,"Getting a good night's sleep on a regular basis is essential for cardiovascular health. That means everyone — especially people with heart problems — should address any issues that keep them from getting at least seven hours of restorative sleep every night. One common problem is obstructive sleep apnea, a condition marked by brief pauses in breathing, often triggering loud snoring, grunts, gasps, and choking noises. These repeated breathing disruptions cause your heart rate and blood pressure to rise, putting stress on your heart and circulation. ""Somewhere between 40% and 80% of people with cardiovascular disease may have sleep apnea,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Yet sleep apnea frequently goes undetected and untreated. Why? Often, people don't realize they are periodically gasping for air throughout the night unless a bed partner or family member notices. In addition, many people with sleep apnea (particularly those who have cardiovascular disease) don't report excessive daytime sleepiness, one of the most common symptoms of the disorder, says Dr. Javaheri. ""Some people are so accustomed to sleep deprivation that they don't realize they're sleepy,"" she says. Causes, risks, and other symptoms Sleep apnea occurs when tissue in the tongue or throat temporarily narrows or blocks the airway during sleep, sometimes as many as 100 times an hour. While people of all ages and sizes can develop sleep apnea, it's most common in older people and those who are overweight or obese, as well as people with heart problems, hard-to-control blood pressure, and diabetes. One way that doctors assess the likelihood of sleep apnea is with the STOPBANG questionnaire (see box). Other symptoms that may be caused by sleep apnea include nighttime restlessness; trouble with concentration or memory; mood changes; morning headaches; vivid, strange, or threatening dreams; and nighttime waking to urinate. Test yourself for sleep apnea with STOP-BANG A ""yes"" answer to three or more of these questions suggests possible sleep apnea. Ask your doctor if you should have a sleep study. S Snore: Have you been told that you snore? T Tired: Do you often feel tired during the day? O Obstruction: Do you know if you briefly stop breathing while asleep, or has anyone witnessed you do this? P Pressure: Do you have high blood pressure or take medication for high blood pressure? B Body mass index (BMI): Is your BMI 30 or above? (For a calculator, see /bmi.) A Age: Are you 50 or older? N Neck: Is your neck circumference more than 16 inches (women) or 17 inches (men)? G Gender: Are you male? Diagnosing sleep apnea If you think you might have sleep apnea, check with your doctor about an evaluation. If possible, start with a sleep specialist (or ask for a referral to one), as these experts are often better able to navigate insurance issues and recommend appropriate, timely testing and treatment. In the past, diagnosing sleep apnea always required an over-night stay in a sleep lab. Today, home-based tests (which are more convenient and less expensive) are the norm. They're recommended for people whose symptoms suggest they have moderate to severe sleep apnea and who have no other significant medical problems. For a home sleep study, you'll get a small, lightweight monitor; a belt you slip around your midsection; a small finger clip; and a sensor to place under your nose. These devices measure your oxygen saturation (the amount of oxygen in your blood), heart rate, and airflow, as well as the movements of your chest and abdomen and your position while you sleep. If you need to use the bathroom, you just take the equipment with you. Treating sleep apnea Lifestyle changes that can improve sleep apnea include losing weight if needed avoiding alcohol within three hours of bedtime not taking medications that relax your muscles in the evening treating nasal congestion with medications or home remedies sleeping on your side or elevating your head. People with moderate to severe apnea often need positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, which uses a small machine to deliver pressurized air through a mask covering your nose (and sometimes your mouth) to keep your airway open as you sleep. Even people with mild sleep apnea who feel sleepy during the day may benefit from PAP, which can help people feel more alert and rested and may also improve their mood and quality of life, says Dr. Javaheri.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/yoga-a-flexible-way-to-enhance-heart-health,Yoga: A flexible way to enhance heart health,1,"We tend to think of exercise as movement that either raises your heart rate (aerobic exercise) or builds muscles (strength training). But two other factors — flexibility and balance — are also important for a well-rounded fitness program, especially for older adults. A yoga practice has the potential to target all four factors at the same time. What's more, a recent study suggests that yoga has modest yet positive effects on several factors linked to cardiovascular health (see ""How yoga may help your heart""). ""The reason behind these benefits isn't entirely clear, but we believe that multiple, simultaneous mechanisms are probably at play,"" says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. Yoga is more than simply stretching and moving into poses — it weaves together three interconnected threads: physical postures, controlled breathing, and meditation. Together, they help cultivate the relaxation response, which trains your body to be less reactive during times of stress. How yoga may help your heart To explore how yoga may affect cardiovascular health, a team of researchers pooled data from studies of yoga done over the past few decades. Their findings, reported in the May 2023 Current Problems in Cardiology, are summarized below. When: The analysis combined results from 64 randomized controlled trials of yoga published from 1989 to 2022. Most were done in Southeast Asia. Who: The analysis included nearly 17,000 people in all, roughly half of whom performed yoga. Those in control groups did other types of gentle exercise, stretching, or no exercise. Their average age was 56. Key findings: Compared with those in control groups, people who did yoga had systolic blood pressure values (the first number in a reading) that were 4.5 points lower and levels of harmful LDL cholesterol that were 7.6 points lower, on average. Yoga was also linked to slightly lower HbA1c levels (a measure of average blood sugar over the past few months) and a small drop in body mass index. How yoga helps The relaxation response not only slows the heart rate and lowers blood pressure, it may also tamp down inflammation and promote favorable changes in blood vessel function that protect the heart. As a mind-body practice, yoga encourages people to slow down and be more mindful about heart-healthy behaviors, such as eating well and getting enough sleep, says Dr. Mehta. Those habits — along with positive emotions that some forms of yoga aim to inspire, such as compassion and gratitude — may also help foster cardiovascular health. Finding your fit Think you can't do yoga because you aren't flexible? ""By practicing yoga, you become more flexible — that's another reason to do it,"" says clinical social worker and yoga teacher Laura Malloy, director of yoga programs at the Benson-Henry Institute. If you're new to yoga, seek out a beginner or ""gentle"" class, especially if you're over 65 or have any medical conditions. Several forms are well suited to beginners, such as Hatha yoga, which features gentle, smooth movements that are integrated with your breathing. Iyengar is similar but places more emphasis on body alignment and balance and uses props such as straps, blankets, and blocks. Yin yoga, which is done mostly sitting or lying down, encourages people to go deeper into poses by holding them longer. Another option is chair yoga, practiced sitting in a chair or standing using a chair for support. It's good for older people or anyone who feels less steady or has trouble getting up from the floor, says Malloy. Though gentle, chair yoga still provides results. ""After I teach a 20-minute chair yoga class, I've heard people say ""Wow, that made such a difference in how I feel!'"" says Malloy. (You can try one of her 30-minute instructional videos here: health.harvard.edu/cy. You can find classes at dedicated yoga studios as well as at health clubs, community or senior centers, or even hospitals. Costs range from about $15 to $20 per class.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/winning-the-skin-game,Winning the skin game,1,"The saying goes that the past always comes back to haunt you. Nowhere is this more apparent than with your skin. ""As you get older, the sun damage to your face and neck you experienced when you were younger shows up as dry skin, wrinkles, and age spots,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, a dermatologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. While much of this sun damage occurred in the past, you can take steps now to reverse some of it. ""Adopting a daily skin care routine is the best way to treat existing skin problems, maintain healthy skin, and protect against future harm,"" says Dr. Waldman. You don't need to follow an elaborate process. Keep it simple, and focus on three steps: wash, moisturize, and apply sunscreen. Then do it every day. Step 1: Wash Wash your face and neck twice a day — when you wake up and before bedtime. (You can do this once daily if your skin tends to be dry, and preferably in the evening so you sleep with clean skin.) ""Avoid using regular bar soap,"" says Dr. Waldman. ""It strips the skin of its outer layer and makes it harder to keep in moisture, which can lead to dry skin."" Instead, choose an over-the-counter product labeled as a gentle cleanser for sensitive skin. Avoid products that contain sulfates or are labeled ""foaming,"" as they can be drying. Also, don't use facial scrubs with small particles, which can irritate the skin. Massage a pea-sized amount of the cleanser onto your damp face and neck for about 20 seconds, or the amount of time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice, and then rinse with warm water. ""If you don't have oily skin, washing only with warm water also can work,"" says Dr. Waldman. Give your skin an A — and maybe a B Another way to help restore aging skin is to use a lotion or cream that contains a retinoid, a compound derived from vitamin A. Retinoids increase collagen (the most abundant protein in the body) and help strengthen skin and restore elasticity. ""Regular application can improve the appearance of wrinkles, sun spots, and overall skin texture,"" says dermatologist Dr. Abigail Waldman with Brigham and Women's Hospital. Choose over-the-counter anti-aging creams or lotions with retinol as the active ingredient, or get a prescription for a stronger retinoid from your doctor. Take it slow, as these products can irritate the skin if overused. Dr. Waldman suggests an every-three-day routine at first. Use a pea-sized amount over your entire face before bedtime. Retinoids make skin sensitive to light, so don't use them during the daytime. ""Monitor how your skin reacts, and look for redness, significant peeling, or irritation,"" says Dr. Waldman. ""As your skin builds tolerance, increase applications to every night."" Oral nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3, has protective effects against ultraviolet damage caused by sun exposure. Research has shown it can lower the risks of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma — the two most common skin cancers — in people vulnerable to skin cancer. Speak with your doctor or dermatologist about whether you are a candidate. Step 2: Moisturize After washing, while your skin is still damp, apply a moisturizing lotion or cream. (People with oily skin can skip this step.) ""Moisturizing recreates the skin's outer barrier to prevent moisture from escaping and to stop foreign substances from getting in,"" says Dr. Waldman. Use a dollop for your entire face and another for your neck, and massage in until fully absorbed. Choose a lotion or cream that contains fewer than 10 ingredients or is labeled for sensitive skin. ""Fewer ingredients mean fewer chemicals or additives, especially fragrances that could irritate skin,"" says Dr. Waldman. Key ingredients to look for include hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycolic acid, and squalene, which help keep skin hydrated. Vitamin C and azelaic acid can help lighten dark spots. Step 3: Apply sunscreen Finally, apply sunscreen to your face, especially under the eyes, as well as your entire neck and ears. ""Sunscreen not only guards against skin cancer and the aging effects from sun exposure but also helps to prevent brown spots and to keep existing ones from worsening,"" says Dr. Waldman. Use sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Avoid spray sunscreens, which contain alcohol that can burn. For efficiency, a combination moisturizing and sunscreen product also works well. ""The best sunscreen is the one you enjoy wearing, so experiment until you find one that has a pleasant smell and texture and is easy to apply,"" says Dr. Waldman. When you're outside for an extended period, make sure to reapply your sunscreen every two hours. Image: © PeopleImages/Getty Images",9,0.10918248,-0.092913106
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/6-natural-ways-to-lower-blood-pressure,6 natural ways to lower blood pressure,1,"Taking medication to lower high blood pressure is a proven way to reduce your risk for heart disease. But adopting lifestyle changes may let you maintain healthy readings and perhaps even avoid drug therapy. ""Unless a person's blood pressure is very high, medication most often does not start immediately,"" says Dr. Howard LeWine, editor in chief of Harvard Men's Health Watch. ""For people with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension, the first order of business is to get serious about modifying their lifestyle."" By the numbers Normal blood pressure is defined as a reading of less than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Elevated pressure means systolic blood pressure (the first number in a reading) is 120 to 129 mm Hg with a diastolic pressure (the second number) of less than 80 mm Hg. People who have consistent readings of 130 to 139 for systolic pressure or 80 to 89 for diastolic pressure are said to have high blood pressure (stage 1 hypertension). ""But your target numbers may differ based on your health and individual goals, as determined in consultation with your doctor,"" says Dr. LeWine. Healthy lifestyle habits are the cornerstone of managing blood pressure, whether or not you require medication. A lifestyle approach to management also helps people feel more in control of their health. ""Understandable, sometimes people are reluctant to start a drug because they don't want to be dependent on medication,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""And this resistance can provide extra motivation for making the necessary changes."" Still, don't be discouraged if your doctor wants you to begin taking a low dose of medication. Once you reach your blood pressure goals, maintaining a healthy lifestyle may mean you can take a drug holiday (with your doctor's approval). ""And even if you still need medication, your healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent dose increases or additional blood pressure drugs,"" says Dr. LeWine. The big six Six lifestyle changes have the most significant influence on blood pressure, according to Dr. LeWine. They include the foundation for healthy living — diet, exercise, and weight control — as well as limiting sodium and alcohol and managing stress. ""While all of these are important, don't try to change them all at once,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""In consultation with your doctor, you first want to concentrate on the one or two most important modifications, based on what's likely to have the greatest impact."" Diet. While most experts advocate plant-based diets to help lower blood pressure numbers, a recent study found that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may have the most significant impact. The researchers found that adopting the DASH diet could prevent an estimated 15,000 annual heart attacks and strokes among men with high blood pressure. DASH emphasizes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, nuts, seeds, and grains and limits consumption of red meat, sodium, and sugar-sweetened foods and drinks. Exercise. Guidelines call for a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. A reasonable starting goal is 20 to 30 minutes every other day. Any kind of exercise is always better than nothing. But if you need motivation, join a walking club or sports league (like golf, bowling, basketball, or pickleball), hire a personal trainer, or sign up for fitness classes at a gym or community center. You can also increase your daily movements, like walking for five minutes every hour, doing two sets of five to 10 push-ups on the floor or against the kitchen counter, or 20 minutes of yoga or stretching. Weight. While it's natural for men's weight to increase somewhat with age, even five to 10 pounds over their ideal number can raise blood pressure. ""In fact, for overweight men, every pound lost could lower systolic blood pressure by up to 1 mm Hg,"" says Dr. LeWine. Your doctor can determine your target weight for your age and body type. Investing in a healthy diet and increasing exercise can help reduce weight. Sodium. ""People with high blood pressure sometimes have a significant improvement by avoiding sodium,"" says Dr. LeWine. Processed foods account for much of the sodium that people consume. These include foods like canned vegetables and soups, frozen dinners, lunch meats, instant and ready-to-eat cereals, salty chips, and other packaged snacks. Cut back on these items, or select low-sodium options. Alcohol. Drinking more than moderate amounts of alcohol can raise blood pressure. Guidelines says men should consume no more than two standard drinks per day, with a single drink defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. However, cutting back on alcohol as much as possible is ideal. Stress. Reducing stress is also a priority. Stress can lead to chronic inflammation that damages artery walls, making them less elastic. In addition, ongoing stress can trigger the adrenal glands to release hormones that raise blood pressure. ""Uncontrolled stress often manifests as poor sleep, overeating, and physical inactivity,"" says Dr. LeWine. To manage stress, practice relaxation breathing and meditation, or perhaps just set aside time every day to do whatever you wish, even if it's nothing at all.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sleep-apnea-may-lead-to-weaker-bones-and-teeth,Sleep apnea may lead to weaker bones and teeth,1,"People with sleep apnea — meaning they briefly and repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping — are more likely to have low bone density, a small new analysis suggests. The study, published online Nov. 11, 2022, by The Journal of Craniomandibular and Sleep Practice, used a type of imaging called cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to measure bone density in the head and neck of 38 adults undergoing orthodontic treatment, half of whom had sleep apnea. The researchers found that participants with apnea had significantly lower bone density in the head and neck than those who didn't have the condition. Sleep apnea can trigger low oxygen levels and inflammation in the body, which may interfere with the continual cycle of bone breakdown and renewal, researchers said. This could ultimately lower bone density levels, increasing the risk of broken bones and causing teeth to become loose. Screening tests for bone density are an important part of routine care for many people, including all women 65 and older. Image: Somsak Bumroongwong/EyeEm/Getty Images",6,0.19055092,-0.27629957
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-humble-gallbladder,The humble gallbladder,1,"In the hierarchy of digestive organs, you might first list the stomach, liver, or colon. But there's a pear-shaped sac tucked under your liver that barely gets a second thought: the lowly gallbladder. This small but mighty organ plays an important role in helping us digest food, but we often don't acknowledge it unless something goes wrong — which happens in about 15% of American adults, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Yet gallbladder disease — which includes stones, inflammation, infection, or blockage — can lead to excruciating pain or even life-threatening complications down the line. The gallbladder essentially serves as a storage room for bile, squeezing the fluid into the small intestine to help digest the fats we consume. It makes sense, then, that the organ might struggle when our diet is heavy in fatty or fried foods. We can live without a gallbladder, but it can't stay in peak performance mode without diligent care, says Dr. William Brugge, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""I think people generally try to ignore their gallbladder,"" Dr. Brugge says. ""It doesn't have as squeamish a reputation as the colon or rectum, but it's down there on the list."" Tactics to promote gallbladder health Keeping your gallbladder healthy involves a similar approach to keeping the rest of your body in optimal shape. These familiar suggestions include: Eat more fruits and vegetables. They're rich in nutrients such as vitamin C, folic acid, and magnesium, which may lower the risk of gallbladder disease. Fiber-filled fruits and vegetables also don't strain the gallbladder, since they contain little or no fat. Favor lean proteins. Opting for poultry, lean meat, and fish dishes that are baked or broiled — not fried — can lower your gallstone risk. Limit or avoid full-fat dairy products and red or processed meats. Maintain a healthy weight. Overweight or obesity can make you prone to gallstones. Risk factors Aside from a high-fat diet, other risk factors for gallbladder disease include overweight or obesity, a family history of gallbladder issues, Native American or Latino heritage, and being 40 or older. Women are twice as likely as men to develop gallstones, which top the list of gallbladder problems. Extra estrogen, particularly during pregnancy, slows the gallbladder's ability to empty, letting bile pool, Dr. Brugge says. Gallstones develop when bile or related fluids form hardened stonelike lumps that can grow and multiply. Attacks of agonizing pain result when gallstones get larger or block bile ducts. Other symptoms include pain between the shoulder blades, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, bloating, indigestion, and sweating. About a quarter of people diagnosed with gallstones each year need treatment, which is usually surgery. ""After eating a particularly heavy or fatty meal, you may have severe pain — far more than gas or cramps — that might last for an hour or two,"" Dr. Brugge says. Serious complications Because bile ducts connect the gallbladder to other digestive organs, these surrounding structures can also suffer complications from gallbladder disease. Problems include cholangitis (bile duct inflammation), cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). But the most dangerous complication, Dr. Brugge says, is gallbladder inflammation called cholecystitis. It results from a gallstone getting stuck in the gallbladder, which becomes infected and causes searing pain. ""It's a pretty dramatic illness,"" he says. ""The gallbladder can rupture or leak infected bile, and the infection can spread through the body. It can be fatal."" New evidence suggests gallstones may also raise the risk of developing cancers of the liver, bile duct, and pancreas. A study published online June 17, 2022, by the British Journal of Cancer tracked more than 115,000 women and nearly 50,000 men for up to 30 years, asking about their history of gallstones at the study's start and every other year afterward. Compared with people without gallstones, those who got them were 60% more likely to develop liver cancer, more than four times as likely to develop bile duct cancer, and 13% more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. Gallbladder cancer itself is relatively rare, diagnosed in about 12,200 Americans each year. ""It's very deadly, but not very common,"" Dr. Brugge says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/supplements-for-three-common-conditions,Supplements for three common conditions,1,"Certain herbs, vitamins, minerals, and other compounds may help control cholesterol, blood pressure, and anxiety. High cholesterol, high blood pressure, and anxiety are three common conditions that are often treated with medication. But sometimes people can't tolerate those drugs or are reluctant to use them. In these instances, dietary supplements may be an option. Studies have shown that some herbs, vitamins, minerals, and other substances, alone or in combination with traditional treatments, may be effective in treating these conditions, and are largely safe to use — provided your doctor approves. High cholesterol Vitamin D3. If you cannot tolerate a statin medication and have a low vitamin D level, a vitamin D3 supplement could help. After taking the supplement, some people are then able to tolerate statins when they couldn't in the past. Phytosterols. Phytosterols (also called plant stanols or sterols) are derived from the cell membranes of plants and can be taken in pill form. They are also found naturally in foods such as nuts, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Studies show that phytosterol supplements can lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by up to 14% in people taking 2,000 to 3,000 milligrams (mg) a day. When choosing a product, look for a quality seal (see ""Worried about supplement safety? Here's what you should consider""), and also look for a product that contains phytosterol esters. Red yeast rice. Red yeast rice supplements are made from a type of yeast that is grown on white rice. Red yeast rice has long been used in Chinese medicine. But a recent study comparing red yeast rice to a low dose statin found the statin was much more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol levels. If you still decide to use it, look for a high-quality product, because red yeast rice can contain a dangerous contaminant, citrinin, which is a toxin produced by fungus that can cause food poisoning, kidney damage, and immune system problems. Worried about supplement safety? Here's what you should consider While some supplements are potentially helpful (or at least harmless), a lack of regulatory oversight of these products means that others might be ineffective or dangerous, or might contain hazardous contaminants. Identifying the safe choices requires a little detective work. Before taking a supplement, always talk to your doctor to make sure that it's safe for any medical conditions you may have and that it won't interact with any medications you are taking. Although supplement makers must follow FDA rules for good manufacturing practices, the agency does not require testing the estimated 9,000 products on the market to make sure they do contain the ingredients they claim, and don't contain contaminants, such as dangerous bacteria, arsenic, cadmium, or lead. This means there is no guarantee that any particular product is effective or safe. To add a degree of protection, look for products that have voluntarily gone through quality testing, which is certified by a seal on the packaging. Some good ones to look for are those from U.S. Pharmacopeia, ConsumerLab.com, and NSF International. High blood pressure Magnesium citrate or glycinate. Some people are deficient in the mineral magnesium. But blood tests aren't good at detecting total magnesium levels inside the body, because much of your body's magnesium is stored within cells. Many people find the deficiency only after a nutritionist analyzes their diet. In those individuals, supplements can boost magnesium levels and help reduce high blood pressure when taken along with traditional blood pressure treatments. It typically takes up to six weeks for the supplements to show an effect. However, not everyone should take magnesium, particularly those with kidney disease, so be certain to consult with your doctor before taking it. Lycopene. An antioxidant supplement that may also help reduce high blood pressure is lycopene, which gives vegetables like tomatoes their red hue. While tomato-based products, including canned sauces, contain lycopene, those foods often have a lot of sodium. So, it's better in many instances to opt for a supplement. Look for one that also contains tomato extract for an added benefit. Typically, people need to take 15 to 25 mg of lycopene daily to see a reduction in blood pressure. Anxiety Chamomile extract. This extract, which comes from a flower, has long been used as a therapy for anxiety. Anxiety often goes hand in hand with sleeplessness, so it's no surprise that chamomile is also often recommended as a sleep aid. Many people drink chamomile tea, but taking a supplement may be more convenient (and require fewer late-night trips to the bathroom if taken before bed).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-running-cause-arthritis-202304262930,Does running cause arthritis?,1,"When I took up running in college, a friend of mine scoffed at the idea. He hated running and was convinced runners were ""wearing out"" their joints. He liked to say he was saving his knees for his old age. So, was he onto something? Does running really ruin your joints, as many people believe? Runners can get arthritis, but is running the cause? You may think the answer is obvious. Surely, years of running (pounding pavements, or even softer surfaces) could wear out your joints, much like tires wear out after you put enough miles on them. And osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, usually affects older adults. In fact, it's often described as age-related and degenerative. That sounds like a wear-and-tear sort of situation, right? Maybe not. Sure, it's easy to blame running when a person who runs regularly develops arthritis. But that blame may be misguided. The questions to ask are: Does running damage the joints and lead to arthritis? Does arthritis develop first and become more noticeable while running? Is the connection more complicated? Perhaps there's no connection between running and arthritis for most people. But maybe those destined to develop arthritis (due to their genes, for example) get it sooner if they take up running. Extensive research over the last several decades has investigated these questions. While the answers are still not entirely clear, we're moving closer. What is the relationship between running and arthritis? Mounting evidence suggests that that running does not cause osteoarthritis, or any other joint disease. A study published in 2017 found that recreational runners had lower rates of hip and knee osteoarthritis (3.5%) compared with competitive runners (13.3%) and nonrunners (10.2%). According to a 2018 study, the rate of hip or knee arthritis among 675 marathon runners was half the rate expected within the US population. A 2022 analysis of 24 studies found no evidence of significant harm to the cartilage lining the knee joints on MRIs taken just after running. These are just a few of the published medical studies on the subject. Overall, research suggests that running is an unlikely cause of arthritis — and might even be protective. Why is it hard to study running and arthritis? Osteoarthritis takes many years to develop. Convincing research would require a long time, perhaps a decade or more. It's impossible to perform an ideal study. The most powerful type of research study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Participants in these studies are assigned to a treatment group (perhaps taking a new drug) or a control group (often taking a placebo). Double-blind means neither researchers nor participants know which people are in the treatment group and which people are getting a placebo. When the treatment being studied is running, there's no way to conduct this kind of trial. Beware the confounders. A confounder is a factor or variable you can't account for in a study. There may be important differences between people who run and those who don't that have nothing to do with running. For example, runners may follow a healthier diet, maintain a healthier weight, or smoke less than nonrunners. They may differ with respect to how their joints are aligned, the strength of their ligaments, or genes that direct development of the musculoskeletal system. These factors could affect the risk of arthritis and make study results hard to interpret clearly. In fact, they may explain why some studies find that running is protective. The effect of running may vary between people. For example, it's possible, though not proven, that people with obesity who run regularly are at increased risk of arthritis due to the stress of excess weight on the joints. The bottom line Trends in recent research suggest that running does not wear out your joints. That should be reassuring for those of us who enjoy running. And if you don't like to run, that's fine: try to find forms of exercise that you enjoy more. Just don't base your decision — or excuse — for not running on the idea that it will ruin your joints.",9,0.2564808,-0.21133968
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/quick-start-guide-to-an-antiinflammation-diet,Quick-start guide to an anti‑inflammation diet,1,"There are no complicated rules to follow. Just be mindful of general dos and don'ts. Chronic inflammation — a state of persistent activation of the immune system — is an important part of many diseases, and diet is a big contributor to inflammation. It would make sense, then, to follow what's becoming known as the ""anti-inflammation diet."" Just one problem: ""There isn't 'one' diet, although many people love to throw that term around. The diet in general is almost as much about what you don't eat as what you do eat,"" says Eric Rimm, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. For a quick start, let's boil it down to some dos and don'ts. Don't eat these Stay away from ""ultra-processed"" foods, which include just about anything that comes in a package — like microwaveable dinners, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, dehydrated soups, baked goods, sugary cereals, processed meats, biscuits, and sauces. These foods have little nutritional value. Worse, they're high in salt, added sugars (which can spike your blood sugar), and saturated fat (which can increase your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol). All of these ingredients are associated with promoting inflammation in the body. ""The biggest offender is anything with added sweeteners, whether that means cane sugar or any compounds used to add sweetness,"" Rimm says. A report published in December 2019 in Nature Medicine notes that sugars, grains, and extra salt in ultra-processed foods can change the bacteria in your gut, damage the gut's lining, and switch on inflammatory genes in cells. Other studies have linked ultra-processed foods to shorter life spans, cancer, heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes. Inflammation-promoting foods include white breads, cereals, white pasta, and other products made with refined flours, as well as white rice. ""White flour leads directly to a pro-inflammatory state,"" Rimm says. Other offenders include soda, juices, cookies and other baked goods, butter, cheese, ice cream, coconut products, candy, salad dressings, jarred tomato sauces, and processed and cured meats. Do eat these To fight inflammation, go for whole, unprocessed foods with no added sugar: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (beans, lentils), fish, poultry, nuts, seeds, a little bit of low-fat dairy, and olive oil. ""To these, many people add herbs and spices like cinnamon, ginger, and turmeric. There are a few studies that suggest modest benefits,"" Rimm says. How do they help? ""It's believed that antioxidants in brightly colored fruits and vegetables [cooked tomatoes, carrots, squash, and broccoli] may lessen the effect of free radicals, which damage cells,"" says Liz Moore, a registered dietitian at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Other food components that may help fight inflammation include fiber found in fruits, vegetables, and especially legumes and whole grains such as barley, oats, and bran omega-3 fatty acids found in fish (such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna), vegetable oils (flaxseed and canola), walnuts, flaxseeds, and leafy green vegetables (spinach and kale) polyphenols (plant chemicals) found in berries, dark chocolate, tea, apples, citrus, onions, soybeans, and coffee unsaturated fats found in almonds, pecans, walnuts, flaxseeds, pumpkin and sesame seeds, and plant oils (olive, peanut, canola). The evidence that trying to minimize inflammation through dietary changes reduces the risk of diseases ""is strongest for arthritis, gastrointestinal and heart health, and possibly auto­immune diseases,"" Moore says. Making the shift Don't try to suddenly switch to a new eating style. ""Start by slowly making changes so that these become more of a lifestyle shift rather than 'going on a diet,'"" Moore says. ""Try to eat fewer foods that come from packages and more that come from the ground."" Apply that approach to each meal. For breakfast, you might have a fruit smoothie or oatmeal with a few berries; for lunch, a salad of dark leafy greens with colorful vegetables topped with beans, nuts, and seeds; for dinner, a lean protein and more colorful vegetables, with fruit for dessert. The more color and variety you add to a meal, the more natural inflammation-fighting compounds you'll consume. If you're more comfortable following a particular diet plan, consider a Mediterranean diet or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet; they follow lots of the dos and don'ts we've outlined.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/11-foods-that-can-help-lower-your-cholesterol,11 foods that can help lower your cholesterol,1,"Focus on fiber-rich foods and avoid saturated fats. If your cholesterol level has crept up over the years, you may wonder whether changing your diet can help. Ideally, your total cholesterol value should be 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or lower. But it's the harmful LDL cholesterol value that experts worry about the most. Excess LDL builds up on artery walls and triggers a release of inflammatory substances that boost heart attack risk. ""To prevent heart disease, your LDL should be 100 mg/dL or lower,"" says Dr. Jorge Plutzky, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But many Americans have LDL values that are less than optimal (100 to 129 mg/dL) or borderline high (130 to 159 mg/dL). If you fall into either of those categories, you may be able to nudge down your LDL to a healthier level by changing what you eat, particularly if your current diet could use some improvement. However, most people with higher LDL values likely will also need to take a cholesterol-lowering drug, such as a statin, says Dr. Plutzky. Dietary directives Avoiding foods that are high in cholesterol isn't the best way to lower your LDL. Your overall diet — especially the types of fats and carbohydrates you eat — has the most impact on your blood cholesterol values. ""As the American Heart Association has noted, you'll get the biggest bang for your buck by lowering saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fat,"" says registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Brigham and Women's Hospital. That means avoiding meat, cheese, and other high-fat dairy products such as butter, half-and-half, and ice cream. Equally important is replacing those calories with healthy, unsaturated fats (such as those found in vegetable oils, avocados, and fatty fish) rather than refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, and white rice. Unlike healthy fats, these starchy foods aren't very filling, and they can trigger overeating and weight gain. The other big problem with refined carbs? They're woefully low in fiber, which helps flush cholesterol out of the body (see ""The fiber factor""). The fiber factor Your body can't break down fiber, so it passes through your body undigested. It comes in two varieties: insoluble and soluble. Fiber‑containing foods usually feature a mix of the two. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. While it doesn't directly lower LDL, this form of fiber fills you up, crowding other cholesterol-raising foods out of your diet and helping to promote weight loss. Soluble fiber dissolves in water, creating a gel. This gel traps some of the cholesterol in your body, so it's eliminated as waste instead of entering your arteries. Soluble fiber also binds to bile acids, which carry fats from your small intestine into the large intestine for excretion. This triggers your liver to create more bile acids — a process that requires cholesterol. If the liver doesn't have enough cholesterol, it draws more from the bloodstream, which in turn lowers your circulating LDL. Finally, certain soluble fibers (called oligosaccharides) are fermented into short-chain fatty acids in the gut. These fatty acids may also inhibit cholesterol production. The ""best"" foods The following 11 foods are good sources of fiber or unsaturated fat (or both). But they're not in any particular order and are simply suggestions. Most whole grains, vegetables, and fruits are good sources of fiber. And most nuts and seeds (and the oils made from them) provide monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats. 1. Oatmeal. This whole grain is one of the best sources of soluble fiber, along with barley (see ""Grain of the month,"" at right). Start your day with a bowl of steel-cut or old-fashioned rolled oats, topped with fresh or dried fruit for a little extra fiber. 2. White beans. Also called navy beans, this variety ranks highest in fiber content. Try different types of beans as well, such as black beans, garbanzos, or kidney beans, which you can add to salads, soups, or chili. But avoid prepared baked beans, which are canned in sauce that's loaded with added sugar. 3. Avocado. The creamy, green flesh of an avocado is not only rich in monounsaturated fat, it also contains both soluble and insoluble fiber. Enjoy this fruit sliced in salad, pureed into dip, or mashed and spread on a slice of whole-grain toast. 4. Eggplant. Although not everyone's favorite, these deep purple vegetables are one of the richest sources of soluble fiber. One idea: oven-roast or grill whole eggplants until soft and use the flesh in a Middle Eastern dip called baba ghanoush. 5. Carrots. Raw baby carrots are a tasty and convenient snack — and they also give you a decent dose of insoluble fiber. 6. Almonds. Among nuts, almonds are highest in fiber, although other popular varieties such as pistachios and pecans are close behind. Walnuts have the added advantage of being a good source of polyunsaturated, plant-based omega-3 fatty acids. 7. Kiwi fruit. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to peel these fuzzy, brown fruits. But to avoid the skin, slice one in half and scoop out the inside with a spoon for an easy, fiber-rich, sweet snack. 8. Berries. Because these fruits are packed with tiny seeds, their fiber content is higher than most other fruits. Raspberries and blackberries provide the most, but strawberries and blueberries are also good sources. 9. Cauliflower. This cruciferous veggie not only provides fiber, it can also serve as a substitute for white rice. Just shred or whirl in a food processor until it resembles rice, then sauté with a little olive oil until tender. 10. Soy. Eating soybeans and foods made from them, such as soy milk, tofu, and tempeh, was once touted as a powerful way to lower cholesterol. More recent analyses showed the effect is modest, at best. Still, protein-rich, soy-based foods are a far healthier choice than a hamburger or other red meat. 11. Salmon. Likewise, eating cold-water fish such as salmon twice a week can lower LDL by replacing meat and delivering healthy omega-3 fats. Other good fish options include chunk light canned tuna and tinned sardines. Image: © marilyna/Getty Images",3,0.36928973,-0.037859097

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-heart-healthy-diet-doesnt-need-to-be-low-in-fat,A heart-healthy diet doesn't need to be low in fat,1,"But the source of the fats you choose — and the rest of what you typically eat — make a big difference. For the last half of the 20th century, most major health organizations, including the American Heart Association, recommended a low-fat diet. Yes, they did, but the message has changed dramatically. Now, the American Heart Association, the federal dietary guidelines, and other nutrition authorities have shifted away from advising people to limit the total amount of fat in their diets. ""Instead, the focus is on an overall healthy dietary pattern. That means an eating style that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans, along with only modest or small amounts of meat, dairy, eggs, and sweets,"" says Dr. Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The reality is that eating more whole or minimally processed, plant-based foods will naturally lower your intake of fat, especially saturated fat. Found mainly in meat and dairy products, saturated fat can boost levels of harmful LDL cholesterol, a key contributor to heart disease. But simply cutting back on all types of fat does not necessarily translate into a diet that lowers cardiovascular risk. Low-fat diet fails Starting in the 1980s, when food manufacturers and consumers cut the fat from their products and diets, they replaced it with refined carbohydrates. People filled up on bread, pasta, low-fat chips and cookies, and low-fat sweetened yogurt. Eating lots of these highly processed carbohydrates floods your bloodstream with sugar, triggering a release of insulin to clear the sugar from your blood. But that can push your blood sugar too low, leaving you hungry again after just a few hours, which encourages overeating and weight gain. What's more, a steady diet of these unhealthy carbs can eventually impair your body's ability to respond to insulin, which can lead to diabetes. Both obesity and diabetes are closely linked to a heightened risk of heart disease. You might also be interested in...

Learn in our course about simple lifestyle changes you can make to optimize your cognitive fitness—and stay mentally sharp! Learn More! But eating too many refined carbs wasn't the only problem. Avoiding unsaturated fats — those found in nuts, seeds, olives, avocados, and fish — isn't necessary. Not only do these foods make your meals more satisfying and tasty, unsaturated fat promotes cardiovascular health. What about ultra-low-fat diets? Some physicians advocate an ultra-low-fat diet, which includes just 10% of calories from fat. This diet excludes all animal-based products (such as meat, poultry, dairy, and fish), as well as refined carbohydrates (including white flour, white sugar, and even fruit juice). But it also shuns some healthier unsaturated fats, including added oils and high-fat, plant-based foods such as avocados and nuts. Small studies have shown that this eating pattern may actually reverse the buildup of cholesterol-clogged plaque in the arteries. At least some of that benefit may stem from the abundant fiber and other nutrients in the diet's copious amounts of vegetables, beans, and whole grains, all of which are fairly scarce in the typical American diet. The only problem with an ultra-low-fat vegan diet is that it's very challenging for most people to stick to over the long term. ""If you are among the 1% of people who can, may the Force be with you,"" says Dr. Rimm. For everyone else, a Mediterranean-style diet offers the best of both worlds — a plant-centric diet that's not overly restrictive (see ""Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan""). ""The Mediterranean diet doesn't require extreme eating habits that make it difficult to socialize with other people,"" he says. What's more, he adds, it tastes good and has the best evidence from long-term clinical studies for lowering a person's risk of heart disease. Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan To ease into this eating style, look over these suggestions from registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Choose one, try it for a week, then gradually add more changes over time, she advises. Switch from whatever fats you use now to extra‑virgin olive oil. Start by using olive oil when cooking, including in salad dressings. Try swapping olive oil for butter on crusty bread. Have salad every day. Choose crisp, dark greens and whatever vegetables are in season. Go nuts. Instead of a bag of chips or cookies, have a handful of raw nuts as a healthy snack. Add more whole grains to your meals. Experiment with bulgur, barley, farro, brown rice, and whole-grain pasta. Select dense, chewy, country-style bread without added sugar or butter. Add a variety of vegetables to your menus. Add an extra serving of vegetables to both lunch and dinner, aiming for three to four servings a day. Try a new vegetable every week. Eat at least three servings of legumes a week. Options include lentils, chickpeas, pinto beans, and black beans. Eat less meat. Choose lean poultry in moderate, 3- to 4-ounce portions. Save red meat for occasional consumption or use meat as a condiment, accompanied by lots of vegetables, as in stews, stir-fries, and soups. Eat more fish, aiming for two servings a week. Both canned and fresh fish are fine. Cut out sugary beverages. Replace soda and juices with water. Eat fewer high-fat, high-sugar desserts. Fresh fruit or poached fruit is best.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-foods-that-fight-high-cholesterol,5 foods that fight high cholesterol,1,"Your diet clearly plays a role in determining your cho­lesterol levels. In fact, changing what you eat can lower your cholesterol and improve the composition of the armada of fats floating through your bloodstream. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and ""good fats"" are all part of a heart-healthy diet. But some foods are particularly good at helping bring down cholesterol. How? Some cholesterol-lowering foods deliver a good dose of soluble fiber, which binds cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drags them out of the body before they get into circulation. Others provide polyunsaturated fats, which directly lower LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. And those with plant sterols and stanols keep the body from absorbing cholesterol. Here are five of those foods: Oats. An easy way to start lowering cholesterol is to choose oatmeal or an oat-based cold cereal like Cheerios for breakfast. It gives you one to two grams of soluble fiber. Add a banana or some strawberries for another half-gram. Beans. Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight. Nuts. Studies show that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts is good for the heart. Eating two ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%. Nuts also have additional nutrients that protect the heart in other ways. Foods fortified with sterols and stanols. Sterols and stanols extracted from plants interfere with the body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Companies are now adding them to a wide variety of foods. They're also available as supplements. Getting two grams of plant sterols or stanols a day can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%. Fatty fish. Eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL in two ways: by replacing meat, which has LDL-boosting saturated fats, and by delivering LDL-lowering omega-3 fats. Omega-3s reduce triglycerides in the bloodstream and protect the heart by helping prevent the onset of abnormal heart rhythms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/ibs-a-low-fodmap-diet-may-help,IBS? A low-FODMAP diet may help,1,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that affects at least one out of 10 people in the United States each year. With symptoms like cramping, diarrhea, gas and bloating, it's no surprise that living with IBS can have a significant effect on a person's quality of life. Diet is one way people manage IBS symptoms. A common treatment approach is to avoid the foods that trigger symptoms. But if you have trouble identifying your trigger foods, you may benefit from adopting an elimination diet. One of the best ones for people with IBS is a low-FODMAP diet. FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. These are poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates. They are found in many foods and are associated with IBS problems, like diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence. The following foods contain FODMAPs: oligosaccharides, including fructans (in wheat, onions, garlic) and galactans (in beans, lentils, soybeans) disaccharides, including lactose (in milk and other dairy products) monosaccharides, including fructose (in apples, honey) polyols, including sorbitol and mannitol (in some fruits, vegetables, artificial sweeteners). The Low-FODMAP diet works in two phases. First, you eliminate most dietary FODMAP foods for two to four weeks. Then you replace them with low-FODMAP alternatives. You monitor your symptoms for changes and then reintroduce specific FODMAPs one by one over a six- to eight-week period, according to your tolerance. (Your doctor or nutritionist may advise you to keep a food diary and symptom chart to help identify problem foods as well as track amounts.) The goal is to find which foods trigger your IBS symptoms, so you can limit or eliminate them in your diet. Keep in mind that everyone reacts differently to FODMAPs, and some people with IBS can consume small amounts without having symptoms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-good-side-of-bacteria,The good side of bacteria,1,"Probiotics may help maintain a healthy and happy gut — but make sure you choose the right sources. There are many things in life that can be categorized as coming in both good and bad versions. The same applies to bacteria. Bad bacteria like salmonella and E. coli can make you sick. Good bacteria like the kind in probiotics play an important role in keeping us healthy. These good bacteria interact with the intestinal lining to protect the body from harmful invaders. They help the immune system function properly, which means better ability both to fight infections and to dampen chronic inflammation. Know your bacteria Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. ""Many people could probably benefit by increasing their intake of probiotics,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""The problem is the unsubstantiated hype that probiotic supplements have far-reaching health potential, which can keep people from choosing the best sources."" There are hundreds of bacteria classified as probiotics, but most come from two main species: Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Within each of these are various strains. There are two ways to get probiotics: fermented foods and over-the-counter products. According to Dr. Walker, fermented foods are the better choices primarily because over-the-counter supplements and formulas aren’t subject to the necessary oversight. (See ""Take care with supplements."") Take care with supplements Probiotics are also found in over-the-counter probiotic supplements and formulas. Most use Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or a combination. The bacteria are concentrated and then dried to use as powders or in capsules, tablets, lozenges, and even gums. The issue with these products is that they are sold as dietary supplements and therefore don’t require FDA approval. ""So you can never be sure that the label claims about health benefits or the type and number of bacteria per serving are accurate,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He advises you to avoid them unless recommended by your doctor. Eat more fermented foods Foods contain probiotics after going through lactofermentation, a process in which bacteria feed on the food’s sugar and starch to create lactic acid, which helps preserve it. Another way to think of lactofermentation is that it transforms one type of food into another kind—for instance, cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into pickles, soybeans into miso, and milk into yogurt. The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. Besides probiotics, fermented foods may also contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. How much fermented food do you need to eat for optimal gut health? Unfortunately, there is no recommended daily allowance for probiotics, so it’s uncertain which fermented foods or what amount is ideal, according to Dr. Walker. ""The general recommendation is simply to add more fermented foods to your diet,"" he says. Probiotic Smoothie Smoothies are a quick and easy way to get probiotics. Here is a recipe that is ideal for a breakfast, snack, or post-workout drink. Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.

Kimchi. Kimchi is a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish. You can find jars of it at most grocery stores or Asian markets. Kombucha. This tangy fermented tea drink is found in many grocery and specialty food stores. Some brands have added sugar, so make sure the label lists no more than 5 grams per serving. Miso. The paste is a staple in Japanese cuisine, especially in soup. It’s made from soybeans fermented with brown rice and has a strong, salty flavor. Pickles. Choose brands brined in water and sea salt instead of vinegar. Vinegar stops good bacteria from growing. Sauerkraut. Select raw or nonpasteurized sauerkraut, which contains more bacteria strains. You can find them in specialty grocery stores. Sourdough bread. This kind of bread is baked with fermented flour. Not all store-bought bread labeled ""sourdough"" uses it, so shop at an artisan bakery or specialty grocery store. Tempeh. Tempeh is a cake made from fermented soybeans with a firmer texture than tofu. It often comes precooked and ready to eat. Yogurt. Some brands include a Live & Active Cultures (LAC) seal from the International Dairy Foods Association. This certifies that the product has been fermented. But not all yogurts have this, so look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label.

Chan School of Public Health. There’s been a lot of buzz recently about the need to eat probiotics — ­living microorganisms found in foods such as yogurt and fermented vegetables. Probiotics add to your gut microbiota, the collection of 100 trillion or so bacteria and other critters living in your gut. Having a healthy microbiota may help foster a healthy immune system and reduce damaging inflammation in the body. Eating probiotics regularly may also help to prevent the intestinal environment from being overrun by unhealthy bacteria, which have been linked to everything from mood disorders and obesity to diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. But probiotics are much like pets, says Fung. It’s not enough to just get one; you also have to take care of it, she says. This means feeding the population of microorganisms with prebiotics — foods that will help all of these desirable gut bugs grow and thrive inside your digestive tract. Understanding your gut To understand how to keep your intestinal environment healthy, it’s important to understand how your microbiota evolves. Everyone has a unique mix of microorganisms living inside them. Some of these come from your mother, conferred during pregnancy, delivery, and, potentially, breastfeeding. Others are introduced by the foods you eat, and your environment. Probiotics found in fermented foods and drinks — such as yogurt, cheese, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut — can add desirable organisms to your gut. But not all varieties of these foods have probiotics; it depends on how they are processed. Sometimes foods that naturally contain probiotics are then cooked or heated, killing the microorganisms and any potential health benefits along with them, says Fung. Slipping an occasional food with probiotics into your diet won’t do much to help you improve your microbiota, says Fung. ""Eating probiotics needs to be a regular thing,"" she says. (Research hasn’t yet determined the ideal frequency.) Try adding them into one or more daily meals for the biggest benefit. Sip a yogurt smoothie for breakfast, or put a forkful or two of sauerkraut alongside your sandwich at lunch. The need for prebiotics Even if you eat a lot of foods that contain probiotics, it won’t do you much good if your intestinal environment doesn’t allow them to prosper, says Fung. Research has shown that a traditional Western diet — heavy on fat, sugar, and animal meat — creates a toxic environment for healthy microbes and can even change the proportion of different types of bacteria inside your body, she says. In short, your healthy gut microbes will suffer on a diet of hot dogs and French fries. What beneficial bacteria love, says Fung, is fiber. When fiber enters your digestive system, enzymes from the microbiota help to break it down, producing substances called short-chain fatty acids. Experts think that having more of these fatty acids changes the pH inside your colon, making it less hospitable to some damaging types of microorganisms. Some good prebiotic options are beans and whole grains. ""Whole grains can include everything from oats to wheat,"" says Fung. Vegetables and fruits also contain healthy fiber. Other good prebiotic sources include garlic, bananas, onions, asparagus, and seaweed. Over all, the goal should be to make sure your diet contains a good balance of probiotics and prebiotics. If you feed your gut well, it may repay you in better health. Image: © SDI Productions/Getty Images",0,0.32105383,0.2095801

New CDC data published late Monday show the positive COVID test rate edged up 2 points to 16% for the week ending July 27. Emergency room visits involving a COVID diagnosis also ticked up (accounting now for 2% of all ER visits), and wastewater detections of the virus that causes COVID continue their unrelenting climb since early May. The nation’s wastewater viral activity level is currently more than twice as high as it was this same time last year. Testing for viral traces in sewage is considered an advanced indicator of whether COVID community impacts are heading upward or downward. All but seven U.S. states currently are reporting “high” or “very high” SARS-CoV-2 wastewater levels as of Aug. 1, according to the CDC’s monitoring program (SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID). New York and West Virginia levels remained “low,” while moderate levels were observed in New Jersey, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Arizona. There was no data reported for North Dakota. COVID-19 deaths jumped by 25% during the latest week of reporting, although the overall rate of deaths that week due to COVID was 1.5% when all other causes of death are considered. The total number of weekly COVID deaths has remained less than 500 nationally since mid-April. The current dominant variants are still Omicron descendants, called KP.3 and KP.3.1.1, the latter of which recently unseated KP.3 for the top prevalence spot. The CDC estimates that for the week ending Aug. 3, KP.3.1.1 accounted for nearly 28% of U.S. infections, up from 14% 2 weeks prior. The variant KP.3 slipped to the second position, now accounting for about 20% of infections, down from about 24% during the prior 2-week reporting period. COVID expert Eric Topol, MD, tweeted recently that KP.3.1.1 is moving toward being “more of a challenge to our immune response than KP.3 and prior variants.” Updated COVID vaccines are expected to become available later this month or in September.",7,-0.33515376,-0.18361625
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dietary-changes-to-help-reduce-ulcerative-colitis-symptoms,Dietary changes to help reduce ulcerative colitis symptoms,1,"Since ulcerative colitis (UC), a condition that causes inflammation in the colon and rectum, is never medically cured, certain lifestyle behaviors can help you manage symptoms and better cope with your condition. In addition to managing stress, paying attention to what you eat can have a big impact on your quality of life. There is no single diet that works best for managing UC. In fact, no studies have shown that any specific diet improves symptoms or that any specific foods cause UC flare-ups. The best approach is to avoid or reduce the foods that aggravate your symptoms. You should eat a well-balanced, healthy diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, such as a Mediterranean style diet. Avoid preservatives and emulsifiers, such as carrageenan, carboxymethylcellulose, and polysorbate-80. Having a nutritionist design a specialized diet plan for you may be helpful. The nutritionist will first want to identify foods that may trigger flare-ups or make your symptoms worse. There is no strong evidence that following any particular specialized diet diet—such as low-carb, vegetarian, or paleo—has any effect on keeping UC in remission. If you have inflammatory bowel disease and also irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a low-FODMAP diet may be helpful. FODMAP stands for the short-chain carbohydrates known as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. Some people who eat high-FODMAP foods have an increased risk of problems like diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence. FODMAPs include the following: disaccharides, such as lactose (in milk and other dairy products) monosaccharides, such as fructose (for example, in apples and honey) oligosaccharides, such as fructans (in wheat, onions, and garlic, for example) and galactans (commonly found in beans, lentils, and soybeans) polyols, such as sorbitol and mannitol (in some fruits, vegetables, and artificial sweeteners). A low-FODMAP diet can help reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea and improve stool consistency in people with IBS who also have well-controlled IBD. Consult with your doctor and a nutritionist about how FODMAP reduction may fit into your dietary plan. For more information on treating inflammatory bowel disease, check out Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, an online guide from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/ibs-in-the-crosshairs,IBS in the crosshairs,1,"Up to 45 million Americans have a condition that people affected may only reluctantly mention: irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. Despite its prevalence, IBS is still somewhat mysterious when it comes to who gets it — two-thirds of patients are women — and why. But scientists are steadily peeling this proverbial onion, with newer treatment approaches targeting pathways that appear to be involved in the cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and/or constipation that disrupt patients' everyday lives. Marked by chronic belly pain and altered bowel habits, IBS is categorized into three types according to which symptoms dominate: diarrhea (IBS-D), constipation (IBS-C), or a combination. It's one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions, affecting up to 15% of Americans, according to the International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders. IBS is what doctors call a functional bowel disorder, since it affects the way the digestive system works but isn't due to any apparent structural problem. But that label is problematic, Harvard experts say. ""To say nothing's wrong is just wrong, because clearly something is different,"" says Dr. Anthony Lembo, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's just that our standard clinical testing can't show it."" Compelling effects on daily life The causes of IBS remain frustratingly unclear, but symptoms are believed to stem from any of a wide range of factors. Among them: Changes in the gut microbiome. This array of microbes in the gut is influenced by what we eat and drink as well as by illness. ""About 10% of people who develop a gastrointestinal infection, whether viral, bacterial, or parasitic — even COVID — show a higher rate of IBS,"" Dr. Lembo says. Skewed intestinal muscle contractions. Normally rhythmic, these contractions push food through the digestive tract faster or slower than normal in IBS patients. Faulty nerve signals. Normal digestion relies on clear communication between the brain, gut, and nervous system. These signals are disrupted in IBS. Pelvic floor problems. This is especially true for women whose pelvic muscles don't relax normally, which can lead to chronic constipation. Early life stress. This can include traumatic events during childhood. Genetics. People with a family history of IBS are more likely to have it as well. At best, IBS is inconvenient, forcing people to shape their schedules around their bathroom needs. At worst, it can be incapacitating, causing extreme distress and controlling people's ability to work and travel. ""All the data show the suffering is pretty significant,"" Dr. Lembo says. ""It's a disorder we know can really debilitate people."" Tailoring treatments For the first time, IBS treatment guidelines, updated in June 2022 by the American Gastroenterological Association, steer doctors on how to personalize patients' treatment with a widening assortment of medications. Over-the-counter options — including fiber supplements, laxatives (in limited amounts), and anti-diarrheals — can help control symptoms. But recent years have brought an influx of IBS-specific drug options that don't just address symptoms, but instead target specific biochemical or cellular pathways to slow food movement through the bowel or push fluids into the intestine to soften stools and speed their passage. For IBS-D, these drugs include alosetron (Lotronex) and eluxadoline (Viberzi). For IBS-C, they include lubiprostone (Amitiza), linaclotide (Linzess), plecanatide (Trulance), and tenapanor (Ibsrela). The antibiotic rifaximin (Xifaxan) appears to benefit the gut microbiome, suppressing ""bad"" organisms that contribute to IBS symptoms, says Dr. Lawrence Friedman, assistant chief of medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital and chair of the Department of Medicine at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. ""It's one of the more exciting newer developments,"" he says. Doctors are also tapping older drugs for new purposes. Various antidepressants can alter nerve signal activity in the intestines or lessen pain in IBS, Dr. Lembo says. While a variety of medications can help relieve symptoms, effective IBS management depends on diet and life-style changes. For many people, avoiding trigger foods, eating more fiber, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly, and getting sufficient sleep can help control mild symptoms. Symptoms may also worsen depending on the foods you eat. Wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, and carbonated drinks are known culprits. Meanwhile, peppermint oil supplements, taken as coated tablets, can ease bloating and pain. ""Many people also figure out that lactose can be a trigger and if they drink a glass of milk or consume other dairy products, their symptoms worsen,"" Dr. Lembo says. ""But sometimes it's more subtle than that. Even drinking a glass of diet soda can cause gas and bloating."" For those in whom gas and bloating are severe, a low-FODMAP diet may help. FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols) are foods that increase gas production. They include beans, onions, celery, carrots, raisins, bananas, apricots, prunes, Brussels sprouts, wheat germ, pretzels, and bagels. Dr. Lembo suggests eliminating FODMAPs temporarily and then slowly adding each food back into your diet to pinpoint the worst offenders. Over all, Dr. Friedman says, ""the spectrum of treatments has expanded. We have more tools to work with and there's a higher likelihood of success, but there may still be an element of trial and error involved.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-05-02-european-commission-president-conspired-with-pfizer-ceo.html,European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen conspired with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to defraud the European people,0,"During the past four calamitous years, as global leaders sought to restrict, threaten and undermine the rights of citizens, there was, and still is, a war against the values and principles that protect human rights and human dignity. During the more challenging phases of this war , Ursula von der Leyen presided over the European Commission, one of the three branches of the European Union (EU). According to her own confessions, she privately conspired with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to secure 11 contracts, 4.6 billion in vaccines, while transferring €71 billion of public money to Big Pharma. In 2020, Ursula told the New York Times she was texting Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to secure 1.9 billion doses of their COVID-19 vaccine for the EU population, which is just 448 million. These contracts with Pfizer defrauded the public, leading to policies that suspended civil liberties, while misleading and coercively harming individuals amid the implementation of a global vaccine agenda and a biosecurity police state. This war utilized some of the darkest forms of bio-terror propaganda and unleashed mass medical fraud to experiment on populations with bioweapons disguised as “vaccines.” Today, these vaccine contracts, which guaranteed protections for the vaccine makers, are being concealed or made highly redacted, as EU leaders try to hide the evidence of their crimes against their people, and humanity in general. Ursula von der Leyen orchestrated mass violations of human rights to enforce a global vaccine agenda It's important to note that President Ursula von der Leyen is not an elected official. She was appointed in December 2019 by the heads of state of the EU and then approved by a European Parliament. These people and their appointees are not accountable to any real form of democracy, nor held in check by a true republic. Yet, “President” Ursula von der Leyen went on to represent the Commission in European Council meetings, G7 and G20 summits and summits with non-EU countries, calling for restrictions on travel, assembly and personal freedom. These restrictions were then used to install a medical Apartheid state, one where people could not participate in society without a QR code indicating their subservience to the injections and swabs demanded of them at the time.

Ursula went on to participate in major debates in the European Parliament and the council, while giving political guidance to the Commission. She led the Commission’s work in implementing EU policies. Her policies, which included lockdowns and vaccine passports, were a threat to the body autonomy, movement, assembly, livelihood and property rights of free individuals. Her policies threatened medical ethics and human rights, leading to widespread discrimination, segregation and abuse in the workplace, and throughout all society. According to French NGO Global Health Advocates , and the UK based health nonprofit, StopAids, the European Commission “agreed to extensive confidentiality requirements with pharmaceutical corporations that may not be fully consistent with EU legislation."" Their research also found the ""Pfizer contract was the most significantly redacted.” They also noted that the EU Commission redacted the most information about product safety and indemnification in the Pfizer and Moderna contract,” concluding that “it looks like most of the risk was borne by the EU in a desperate attempt to get access to these vaccines.” Disbanding and prosecuting the EU Commission will prevent future wars against the people Going into 2024, Ursula von der Leyen appears unfazed by any of the wars she waged against the people and the damage she inflicted on the integrity of longstanding governments, institutions, treaties and alliances. Because she carried out the depopulation plans of globalists – spearheading the global vaccine agenda and installing surveillance and control systems – she will most likely be appointed yet again to her puppet role in the EU, although she is dangling from strings that are wearing thin. Ursula views herself as a bastion of transparency and foresight , but she continues to conceal the crooked deals she made between the EU and Pfizer – deals that sent billions in taxpayer dollars to Big Pharma, while stripping the people of their rights and injuring the masses in phony vaccine experiments. During the war, Ursula rolled out a bloc-wide QR code system, demanding that individuals provide proof of vaccination for travel, leisure and employment. The strongest individuals fought back against the propaganda and proved that the experimental jab did not stop infection, transmission or death. It did the opposite, and those behind the vaccine rollout are liars, scammers and thieves, responsible for mass murder and a barrage of crimes against humanity. The digital identity system faltered as more people fought back against booster requirements and the outright segregation that the system fostered. Now, the only way to restore global security and freedom is to disband the EU and subject its leaders to trials and tribunals, in accordance with the Nuremberg Code .

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-take-afternoon-naps,Should I take afternoon naps?,1,"Q. I retired earlier this year and have begun to enjoy taking afternoon naps. But is regular napping good for my health? A. The first thing to consider is the possibility that you nap because you have daytime sleepiness. If so, what is the cause? For example: Do you take any medicine that might make you sleepy? Review your prescriptions with your pharmacist or during your next doctor's visit. Have you started having problems sleeping at night? If you sleep well at night and wake up refreshed, don't worry. But if you feel groggy or have early-morning headaches, you may have sleep apnea or some other cause of interrupted sleep. Could you be depressed? Ask yourself if you no longer enjoy activities that previously gave you pleasure and whether you feel low. If you feel your napping may be related to these issues or other health concerns then see your doctor. However, it sounds as if your nap is voluntary and enjoyable. It probably does not reflect an underlying sleep disturbance. If it refreshes your day without making it hard to sleep at night, snooze away. For most people, napping in the early afternoon when your body experiences a natural circadian dip, is the best way to catch a few winks without disturbing the sleep-wake cycle. There is no consensus on how long you should nap. Some experts recommend naps should last no more than 30 minutes. The limit is 60 minutes, because longer naps have been linked to a higher risk of health problems like cardiovascular disease. Try to schedule your naps and not wait until you get sleepy, which will prevent you from napping too late in the day. Keep your napping space dark, cool, and free from distractions. (But there is nothing wrong with the standard couch nap if that's most comfortable.) Remember to give yourself 10 minutes after napping before engaging in mentally or physically demanding tasks. There is still some stigma about naps at work in America because of the lingering notions of decreased productivity and even laziness. But there is solid evidence that an afternoon nap can improve a worker's cognitive performance, especially for complex tasks, and may stimulate creativity. When NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration studied the effects of napping on pilots, they found that naps improved mental alertness and performance. Many night shift workers reportedly perked up after taking naps as brief as 15 to 20 minutes. So, enjoy your nap. Even if you return to work, maintaining an afternoon nap as part of your daily routine can be beneficial. Image: © Westend61/Getty Images",6,0.21041657,-0.19680692
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/was-it-something-you-ate-follow-these-steps-when-food-makes-you-sick,Was it something you ate? Follow these steps when food makes you sick,1,"Foodborne illness outbreaks occur frequently in the United States. Invisible microbes in food sicken an estimated 48 million people in our country each year, landing 128,000 in the hospital and killing about 3,000, according to the CDC. Culprits are usually viruses (such as norovirus), bacteria (such as Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, or Campylobacter), parasites (such as Toxoplasma gondii), or toxins (such as those that can accumulate in shellfish). If you ingest them and get sick, you'll need to know how to respond. Recognizing symptoms Sometimes food-related illness shows up within a few hours of eating contaminated food. But some bugs (such as norovirus and Escherichia coli) don't trigger symptoms for days. Either way, the signs are usually intense: nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, or diarrhea, and possibly a low-grade fever (below 101° F). If you get dehydrated due to fluid loss from vomiting or diarrhea, you may feel lethargic, dizzy, or faint. Symptoms typically last for a couple of days. If they continue after a week, it may be less likely that food-related illness is making you sick. You should call your doctor to figure out what the problem is. In the throes of symptoms If you suspect you have food-related illness, you'll need to rest as much as possible and avoid sugary drinks or alcohol (which can make symptoms worse). Stay away from others (and try not to use the same bathroom), so you don't spread any bugs you're carrying, and keep taking any prescribed medications for chronic illnesses. You'll also need to stay hydrated. ""If it's hard to keep fluids down, take small sips. It's challenging, but important. Standing too suddenly when you're dehydrated can lead to fainting and injury. Severe dehydration can cause chemical imbalances in the body and even lead to kidney failure,"" says Dr. Christopher Baugh, an emergency medicine physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. If your symptoms don't include a high fever or bloody stool, Dr. Baugh says it's probably okay to take an antidiarrheal medication such as loperamide (Imodium). If you can stand the symptoms, however, it may be wise to avoid medications and let your body expel the invaders. ""If you take the medication, there's a risk that it might improve the symptoms but prolong or worsen the illness,"" Dr. Baugh says. Avoiding food-related illness Many cases of food-related illness result from improper food handling, preparation, and storage. For example, food can become contaminated if the cook doesn't wash his or her hands before preparing it; if fluids from raw meat, seafood, or poultry get onto fresh produce or cooked food; if food isn't cooked at temperatures high enough to kill microbes; or if food has spoiled. Avoiding those problems will help you ward off food-related illness. You have a lot of control over this at home. But what if you're eating at a restaurant? It's safest to order cooked foods, ask when stews and soups were initially prepared (if it wasn't that day, skip it), and tell your server that you'll need your food to be piping hot. If food doesn't arrive steaming or sizzling, request that it get a quick nuke in the microwave. When to seek emergency care Sometimes food-related illness requires a trip to the emergency room. ""The biggest warning signs are high fever or bloody stool,"" Dr. Baugh says. ""You should also seek emergency care if you have severe dehydration or abdominal pain, if you're unable to keep medications down, or if you have a weakened immune system."" This isn't the time to try to avoid care because you don't want to be a bother to anyone. ""Untreated bacterial food poisoning may progress into a life-threatening condition without antibiotics and intravenous fluids,"" Dr. Baugh says. ""If you're caring for someone with a food-related illness, be on alert for signs and symptoms that suggest they need medical attention."" Image: © Jay Lim/Getty Images",9,-0.00012897328,0.038004555
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-you-napping-too-much,Are you napping too much?,1,"A quick catnap can be refreshing and provide just the right reset to keep up your energy and concentration. But what about a lot of little catnaps — or even a great big snooze after every meal? Too much daytime sleeping can indicate a serious health problem. How much is too much? The optimal amount of sleep we need each night is seven to nine hours. Getting more or less than that is linked to cognitive decline, obesity, heart disease, and premature death. A direct cause hasn’t been established conclusively, but there’s growing evidence to suggest that possibility. The same is true of regular napping for long periods. For example, 90-minute daily naps are tied to increased risks for stroke, and two-hour daily naps are associated with an increased risk for dementia. Again, it is unclear whether naps actually cause these problems. Causes of daytime sleeping Many things can lead to excessive daytime sleeping. ""It could simply be that you’re bored because there isn’t much to do. Or maybe you’re bored because you have hearing loss and you’re avoiding group activities,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, associate chief of gerontology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Here are some other reasons that might lead you to sleep more during the day. You’re not sleeping well at night. You may be drowsy in the day if you have insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep) or another condition that keeps you from getting enough rest at night, such as chronic pain, depression, anxiety, an overactive bladder, restless legs syndrome, or sleep apnea (frequent pauses in breathing during sleep). You have an underlying condition. Many conditions can make you tired during the day regardless of how well you slept at night. Examples are very low blood pressure (especially after eating), low thyroid activity, vitamin D or B12 deficiency, anemia, low blood sugar, depression, narcolepsy (sudden episodes of deep sleep), and even obesity. You have frailty syndrome. Frailty includes a loss of muscle mass, stamina, endurance, weight, and general fitness. ""It affects about 25% of people ages 90 or older, and 50% of those 90 or older in nursing homes. One key symptom is fatigue, caused by lower energy production in cells. Eventually, doing any activity can be really exhausting, and the frail person sleeps more and more,"" says Dr. Dae Hyun Kim, a frailty researcher and geriatrician with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Your medication is making you drowsy. Common offenders include prescription medications to treat allergies, depression, high blood pressure (such as alpha blockers and beta blockers), insomnia, nausea, Parkinson’s disease, or seizures, as well as over-the-counter remedies for insomnia, allergies, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. ""And if you’re taking a lot of medications, there might be a drug interaction that’s making you tired,"" Dr. Salamon says. You’re not eating or drinking enough. You need food and fluids to keep up your energy. What you should do Dr. Salamon says you don’t have to do anything about excessive daytime napping if it isn’t bothering you and you’re unconcerned about potential health effects. But if you (or your family) would like to address it, talk to your doctor about hunting for causes. ""It could be that you just need to take your medication at a different time of day,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""For example, if you’re on a diuretic that makes you go to the bathroom a lot at night, you might be able to take it in the morning or afternoon instead of the evening."" If your doctor can’t find any medical causes of daytime sleepiness, you might just need a little more nourishment and activity in your life. ""Try to eat three meals and a couple of snacks each day, and drink four to six cups of fluid,"" Dr. Salamon suggests. ""And figure out a way to stay more engaged. Join a club, take an exercise class, go for a daily walk, or get together with friends,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""Even talking on the phone with someone each day can perk you up."" It will also help to go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day; keep your room cool and dark at night; and avoid caffeine, alcohol, and electronic screens close to bedtime. ""If you need to nap, try to limit it to up to 30 minutes,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""A little napping is normal as we get older, and quick catnaps can recharge your batteries. It’s a lot of napping that we worry about."" Image: © BraunS/Getty Images",6,0.23024711,-0.24949007
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-our-microbes-affect-our-behavior,Do our microbes affect our behavior?,1,"We've known for almost 200 years that trillions of microbes live on our skin and deep inside us, particularly in our gut. Until recently, we thought they were just freeloaders using our bodies to get food and shelter, causing us no trouble. However, we now know that the genes of these microbes (our microbiome) make many chemicals that affect our body and may influence our vulnerability to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, and several degenerative neurological diseases. Recent studies suggest the microbes within us may also influence our behavior. A study published online Dec. 14, 2022, by the journal Nature compared mice that began exercising when given a running wheel to mice that didn't. There were no differences in their genes. However, there were differences in their gut microbiomes. In the exercisers, there were more bacteria that produced a certain chemical. Whenever these mice ran, that chemical sent signals from the gut up to the brain and ignited the brain's reward centers: they got a ""runner's high,"" and took every opportunity to run. Because of their different microbiome, the ""lazy"" mice got no such reward and remained couch potatoes. But when the microbiome of the exercisers was placed inside the lazy mice, they began exercising. If the gut microbiome can influence an animal's motivation to exercise, could that be true in humans? If so, could microbes in our body also affect our motivation to do other things — to use or avoid addictive substances, eat healthier foods, or socialize more readily? Or consider another microbe within us. When various animals are infected with a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii, they are much more likely to engage in risky behaviors. For example, infected gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park are much more likely than uninfected wolves to strike out on their own or to become dominant in the pack — or to die trying. The same fearlessness is seen in other infected animal species. Infected mice, for example, are less likely to avoid cats. Roughly 30% of humans are also infected with this same parasite. Could it possibly affect us the way it affects other animals, turning us into fearless risk takers? Studies have found that infected business school students are considerably more likely to aspire to be entrepreneurs (rather than, say, accountants), and that infected professionals attending events for entrepreneurs are much more likely to have already started their own business. So while the idea is still a long way from being proven, it is possible that the microbes within us not only influence our risk of various diseases but also influence our behavior. Scientists now even consider it conceivable that the microbes within us may influence things like intelligence, attitudes, empathy, who we are attracted to — in short, who we are. image: © Double Brain/Adobe Stock",3,0.2523998,0.022045726
https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/fighting-the-most-common-skin-cancers,Fighting the most common skin cancers,1,"Heading outside on a sunny day is a bit like going into battle. To protect your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, you’ll need armor (sunscreen or sunblock, and sun-protective clothing), tactical strategy (avoiding peak sun hours), and a place to retreat (the shade) — especially during the summer months, when UV intensity is highest. Mind you, we need a little sunshine on our skin to trigger the production of vitamin D, keep bones strong, and possibly help regulate mood and ward off illness. But unprotected UV exposure can cause skin cancers. The most common of these are non-melanoma skin cancers. What are they? To put it simply, non-melanoma skin cancers aren’t melanomas — the aggressive skin cancers that account for just 1% of all skin cancer cases, yet cause the majority of skin cancer deaths in the United States. Extremely aggressive non-melanoma skin cancers are rare. Instead, the most common types, affecting millions of people per year, are slow-growing. They develop in basal cells (basal cell carcinomas, or BCCs) or squamous cells (squamous cell carcinomas, or SCCs). These cancers don’t usually spread to other parts of the body, and they aren’t usually life-threatening. But they can be quite dangerous. ""Small skin cancers can bleed, hurt, and eat away at your skin. If left untreated, they can erode through important structures like your nose, eyes, bones, or muscles. If they become very large, they can spread, and in rare cases cause death,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Symptoms While non-melanoma skin cancers can develop anywhere on the body, they typically show up in areas that have been exposed to the sun, such as the head, face, neck, ears, lips, arms, legs, or hands. The cancers may look like flat areas that differ only slightly from healthy skin, or they may have distinguishing features. SCCs can be scaly patches, crusty sores, or wart-like bumps. BCCs often have raised edges, a sunken center, and visible blood vessels. They also can look like a pale scar, a sore that won’t heal, a reddish patch, or a bump that might have a number of colors (red, blue, brown, or black). Melanomas usually have brown, black, or blue pigment of uneven color, jagged edges, and an asymmetrical shape. They can be flat or lumpy. Many people have small brown, black, or blue spots on their skin (lentigos), but their color is even, their edges are smooth, and their shape is symmetrical. Lentigos can turn into melanomas, so pigmented spots that start to change color or shape need to be evaluated. Diagnosis BCCs and SCCs are often found early (by you or your doctor), when they are easiest to treat. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will take a look at a new or changing skin growth under a powerful magnifier. If the area looks suspicious, your doctor might remove a sample of the tissue (a biopsy) and send it to a lab for analysis. If the sample is positive for BCC or SCC, the cancer will need to be removed. For large tumors, ask your doctor about additional testing. ""For SCCs that are bigger than a quarter, my recommendation is to ask your doctor about getting your lymph nodes checked to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread,"" Dr. Waldman says. Treatment Non-melanoma skin cancer treatment depends on a cancer’s specific type and features. ""For instance, an in situ [contained and not spreading] SCC on the cheek may be treated with a prescription cream. But an invasive SCC on the cheek would need to be removed with Mohs surgery,"" Dr. Waldman says. Mohs micrographic surgery involves removing cancer a little bit at a time, to preserve as much healthy skin as possible. Each piece is checked immediately under a microscope. Once the edges are free of cancer, the surgery is complete. ""Mohs surgery is usually reserved for invasive skin cancers in areas that are cosmetically sensitive — on the face, scalp, neck — or on functional areas like the hands, feet, and genitals, or with very aggressive or large tumors on the trunk or extremities,"" Dr. Waldman says. If Mohs surgery isn’t necessary, the skin cancer may be cut or scraped out with surgical tools, frozen, or destroyed with radiation. The encouraging news is that most SCCs and BCCs can be cured when they’re treated early. Develop your battle plan The best weapon to fight skin cancer is a strict regimen of prevention and detection. It should include the following steps. Cover up. Apply sunscreen or sunblock with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 to 50 before you go outside. Protect your lips with a sun protection product made for them. If possible, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, shoes, and socks. Avoid direct sunlight. Stay out of the sun when it’s strongest (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), and seek the shade as much as possible. Be vigilant about detection. Schedule annual skin check-ups with your doctor, and conduct your own exams at home each month. Don’t forget your scalp and all the back surfaces of your body. A mirror (or a loved one) can help you check your back and other areas you can’t see well. Be proactive. Call your doctor if you find any new skin growth that looks suspicious. ""We need to see you before tumors grow and become a problem,"" Dr. Waldman says. Image: © Jim Bastardo/Getty Images",9,0.043199744,-0.00856429
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gene-editing-a-one-time-fix-for-dangerously-high-cholesterol,Gene editing: A one-time fix for dangerously high cholesterol?,1,"Among your more than 20,000 different genes, one provides instructions for a protein called PCSK9, which helps regulate levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in your bloodstream. About one in 250 people has a variant in this gene that causes LDL cholesterol to skyrocket, sometimes to more than three times the optimal ceiling of 100 mg/dL. This genetic condition, called familial hypercholesterolemia, is the leading cause of premature heart attacks in America. But other people have different PCSK9 gene variants that have the exact opposite effect. Their LDL cholesterol is extraordinarily low—and their risk of heart attack is also far below average. This discovery, made by Dallas Heart Study researchers in 2005, spurred industry scientists to develop drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors (see ""How does PCSK9 affect your cholesterol level?""). ""From a drug development perspective, it was very exciting, because just 10 years later, there were two FDA-approved medications that could dramatically lower LDL,"" says Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. The drugs, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha), can slash LDL levels by 50%. Taking one of these drugs with a cholesterol-lowering statin can further de-crease a person’s risk of heart attack and related problems by approximately 15% compared with taking a statin alone. How does PCSK9 affect your cholesterol level? The PCSK9 protein acts like a tag that signals LDL receptors to be broken down in liver cells, which means there are fewer receptors to clear LDL from the bloodstream. As a result, LDL levels rise. High LDL accelerates the buildup of fatty plaque in the heart’s arteries, raising heart attack risk. But therapies that either block or prevent the creation of PCSK9 have the opposite effect. More LDL receptors remain active in the liver to remove LDL. Blood levels of LDL plummet, lowering the risk of a heart attack. From inhibition to suppression While taking a statin means swallowing a pill every day, the PCSK9 inhibitors are given by self-injection once or twice a month. But inclisiran (Leqvio), an equally effective drug approved last year, requires an injection just once every six months. Instead of blocking PCSK9 after it’s made, inclisiran prevents the protein from being made in the first place, using a technique called RNA interference. Now, a cutting-edge therapy that uses gene editing to permanently shut down PCSK9 production is being tested in people with familial hypercholesterolemia who’ve already had a heart attack. The CEO of Verve Therapeutics, the company leading the trial, is former Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Sek Kathiresan. To create the therapy, scientists relied on a modification of the powerful gene editing tool called CRISPR, which Dr. Kathiresan describes as ""a molecular pencil and eraser"" that changes a single letter in the instructions for making PCSK9. The one-time infusion contains tiny lipid particles that contain the editing tools, which travel through the blood to the liver. Once there, the particles release their contents, and the editor goes to work in liver cells. Studies in monkeys show that a single infusion lowered blood levels of PCSK9 by 89%, with a corresponding drop in LDL of 61%. Early data from the first human trial should be available later this year. Future possibilities? If the therapy proves to be safe and effective, it could also potentially treat people who don’t have familial hypercholesterolemia but who instead have ""garden variety"" high cholesterol, says Dr. Natarajan. ""People with inactivating PCSK9 variants in both gene copies that lead to LDL values as low as 15 mg/dL are alive and well, which suggests such levels are safe,"" he says. And so far, evidence suggests that PCSK9 gene editing is very specific and without identified ""off-target"" effects in other places on the genome. Despite the many available treatments to reduce LDL, many people don’t take these drugs consistently over the long term for a variety of reasons, such as insurance and access issues. That makes the ""one and done"" option of gene editing especially appealing, particularly since high LDL is very common and an important contributor to cardio-vascular disease, the leading cause of death in this country, Dr. Natarajan says. As the Verve trial moves forward, investigators at Harvard and elsewhere are developing gene editing therapies for other inherited heart conditions, including cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which currently have only limited treatment options.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-i-get-a-calcium-score,Should I get a calcium score?,1,"Q. I'm wondering if I should get a test to check my calcium score. I'm 52 and in good health. My LDL cholesterol level is normal (97 mg/dL), but my father had a heart attack in his late 40s. A. The artery-clogging plaque that builds up inside the heart's arteries contains cholesterol, inflammatory cells, scar tissue, and calcium. A coronary artery calcium scan (often called a calcium score) uses a special type of CT scan to look for that calcium, which is then quantified on a scale from zero to over 1,000. A score of zero indicates no calcified plaque. The higher the score, the more plaque is present. Findings from large studies link higher calcium scores to a higher risk of a heart attack or stroke. While a calcium score can be informative, the scans don't make sense for everyone. Not all cholesterol plaques have become calcified in younger people, so the scans aren't usually recommended for people under 40. Anyone who already has known heart disease doesn't need a calcium scan. That's because the results likely wouldn't change a doctor's treatment recommendations, which would very likely include a statin. However, if you're at risk for heart disease but don't have any symptoms, knowing your calcium score can help you decide whether to start taking a statin. Statins can help lower your risk of heart disease even if your LDL cholesterol is in the normal range. Current guidelines suggest that people estimate their 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease with a calculator from the American College of Cardiology, available at /ascvd. Statins are recommended for people with a score of 7.5% or higher. However, the score doesn't capture other possible situations that may elevate your risk — which include a family history of premature heart disease (defined as coronary artery disease occurring in men younger than 55 or women younger than 65). Calcium scans are readily available, quick, and painless. For the test, you simply lie on your back. The scanner then takes multiple pictures of your heart over the course of about five minutes. It involves some radiation exposure, although not as much as a standard CT scan. The cost (around $100) is usually covered by insurance. But keep in mind that the test isn't mandatory. Another option is to skip the test and simply start taking a statin. But for someone like you, who may have inherited a higher-than-normal heart disease risk, a calcium scan can give you a better sense of your risk and inform your doctor's advice.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-long-covid-affect-the-gut-202303202903,Can long COVID affect the gut?,1,"Low energy, brain fog, and lung problems are a few of the lingering aftereffects reported by some people who have had COVID-19. Could gut troubles also fall among the constellation of chronic symptoms that people with long-haul COVID experience? And if so, what do experts suggest to help ease this? What happens to the gut during a COVID infection? As we head into the fourth year since COVID-19 became a global health emergency, hundreds of millions of people around the globe have been infected with the virus that causes it. Since 2020, we've known that the virus particles that cause lung illness also infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract: the esophagus, stomach, small intestines, and colon. This can trigger abdominal pain and diarrhea, which often — but not always — clear up as people recover. We know chronic gut problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) sometimes occur even after illness caused by microorganisms like Campylobacter and Salmonella are cured. Could this happen with COVID-19? What is long COVID? While most people who get COVID-19 will survive, medical science is becoming aware of a group of people suffering from lasting declines in health. Well-reported long COVID aftereffects include tiredness, breathing difficulty, heart rhythm changes, and muscle pain. But few people, even in the medical field, are aware that long COVID symptoms may include chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. Why might the gut be involved in long COVID? It is not clear why chronic gut symptoms might occur after a COVID-19 infection. One possible insight is a well-known syndrome called post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that may occur after a stomach flu (gastroenteritis). Long after the bug causing the illness is gone, a change in gut-brain signaling may occur. A complex network of nerves connects the gut and the brain, and controls communication between different parts of the gut. These nerves tell body organs to produce digestive juices, alert you to the need to go to the bathroom, or prevent you from having another serving of stuffing at the Thanksgiving table. The nerve network of the gut is so complicated that it is sometimes called the second brain. When the nerves are working well, you won't notice a thing: you eat without pain, you move your bowels with ease, you have no GI worries. But what if the nerves are not working well? Then, even if the process of digestion remains normal, you may frequently have symptoms like pain or a distressing change in your bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation. Once known as functional GI disorders, these health problems are now called disordered gut-brain interactions (DGBIs). When viruses and bacteria infect the gut, experts believe they may prompt a change in gut-brain signaling that can cause a DGBI like IBS to develop. What to do if you're noticing long-lasting gut problems after COVID-19 infection We still do not know conclusively if COVID-19 can cause a long-term change in gut-brain messaging that leads to IBS or other disordered gut-brain interactions. But increasing evidence suggests that GI distress lasting six months or longer might be a symptom of long COVID. While we wait for more evidence, some GI specialists, including myself, recommend trying approaches that help relieve irritable bowel syndrome and other DGBIs. If you are suffering from chronic abdominal pain and a change in your bowel movements after having had COVID-19, talk to your primary care doctor. Many health conditions have similar symptoms, including viral or bacterial infections, inflammation, or even cancers. A thorough exam can help to rule out certain conditions. If the problem persists, do not suffer alone or feel embarrassed to act! Seek help if severe pain or changes in bowel movements are harming your quality of life or affecting daily activities. Talk with your doctor about the possibility that your chronic gut symptoms might be a form of long COVID. Find out if they can recommend helpful treatments or suggest a referral to a GI specialist.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/slowing-down-racing-thoughts-202303132901,Slowing down racing thoughts,1,"Everyone has moments when their brain suddenly goes haywire. They repeatedly fixate on the same thought, like being stuck on a hamster wheel. Or their thoughts aimlessly bounce from one random topic to the next like a pinball. People often refer to these thought patterns as racing thoughts, and the most common cause is anxiety, says Fairlee Fabrett, PhD, a psychologist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""People who struggle with racing thoughts are constantly worried about what needs to be done, what hasn't been done, and what is next,"" says Fabrett. ""Or they obsess about past, present, or future situations."" For example, you replay a conversation with different versions of dialogue, ruminate about an upcoming meeting with your boss or medical appointment, or worry about an unlikely doomsday scenario. ""When racing thoughts take over your mind you can't stay focused, and you feel trapped, which makes you even more anxious and stressed, and the cycle continues,"" says Fabrett. Breaking the cycle of anxiety and racing thoughts How can you break this cycle and keep racing thoughts from controlling you? Here are five strategies to try. Give yourself permission Racing thoughts are often made worse by the anxiety over having racing thoughts. To escape this, give yourself permission to experience them. ""Acknowledge that racing thoughts are just noise, it is what our minds sometimes do, and that's okay,"" says Fabrett. ""This gives you a sense of control so you don't feel helpless. When you put racing thoughts in their proper context, they feel less threatening and easier to manage."" Get mindful Practicing mindfulness can help change your thought patterns. For instance, try counting your breaths. Close your eyes and count to yourself as you take slow, steady breaths: count one on the inhale, two on the exhale, etc. When you reach 10, start over and repeat the process until you calm down. ""This is also a great remedy before sleep when most people's minds begin to ruminate,"" says Fabrett. Also, practice this breath work at times when your thoughts are not racing, so you will have the skill when you need it. Distract yourself You can sometimes break the cycle by distracting your mind. ""As soon as you notice yourself worrying again or thinking about things over and over, make an internal comment to yourself, like 'here I go again, with my list of thoughts that never ends,"" says Fabrett. Then make a conscious decision to do something else, like reading, listening to music, or calling a friend. Get moving It sounds like token health advice — exercise more — but movement is helpful for defusing anxiety. For instance, when an episode of racing thoughts strikes, do a set of push-ups, 10 jumping jacks, take a five-minute walk, or do household chores. ""These not only help break the cycle of racing thoughts but give your mind something else to focus on,"" says Fabrett. Also, try to build regular exercise into your life as well as these short bursts of activity. That can help relieve anxiety and stress. Schedule worry time Sometimes it's best to let racing thoughts run their course; otherwise, they may linger indefinitely. To do this, schedule worry time. When anxious racing thoughts occur, recognize them, but tell yourself that now is not worry time and you will deal with them later. Then at a fixed time of your choosing, do nothing but explore those thoughts and work through them. For example, write down the thoughts that come to mind without editing, including all the worst-case scenarios you can think of. ""You can also talk about them aloud and ask what makes you nervous and why,"" says Fabrett. ""This allows you to confront your anxiety head-on, but on your schedule without taking away from other activities,"" says Fabrett. Set a limit to worry time, like 10 to 20 minutes. When the time is up, you move on. If racing thoughts regularly affect your life or interfere with sleep, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. ""Frequent racing thoughts may be related to anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), trauma, or other mental health issues that need exploring,"" says Fabrett.",6,0.094529025,-0.18467174
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-electrical-brain-stimulation-boost-attention-memory-and-more-202303032898,"Can electrical brain stimulation boost attention, memory, and more?",1,"Imagine this as a morning routine that replaces your first cup of coffee: You wake up feeling a bit foggy, so you slip on a wearable device that looks like an extra-thick headband. You turn on the power source and settle in while electrical current flows into your brain. Twenty minutes later, feeling more focused and energized, you start your busy day feeling grateful for this new technology. If this scenario sounds strange to you, I'm with you. And yet, hype around transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is growing for an expanding list of conditions such as depression, ADHD, and even Alzheimer's disease. A recent ad for one tDCS device urges you to ""elevate your performance."" But before you give this a try, read on. What is transcranial direct current stimulation? Brain stimulation therapies aim to activate or inhibit parts of the brain. tDCS has been around for years, but its popularity has spiked over the last decade. tDCS devices use headgear that may look like a swim cap or headband to position electrodes against the scalp. When a power source is switched on, the electrodes deliver low levels of electrical current to the brain. A typical session lasts 20 to 30 minutes and may be repeated over days or weeks. Three better-known brain stimulation therapies are: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): A device worn over the forehead stimulates specific areas of the brain by changing nearby magnetic fields. TMS is cleared by the FDA to treat depression that hasn't responded to standard medicines, and for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): An electric current flowing through electrodes placed at specific locations on the scalp causes a brief seizure while a patient is under anesthesia. In use since the late 1930s, ECT can be highly effective for severe depression that hasn't responded to standard therapies. It uses higher levels of electrical current than tDCS. That's why it requires close medical supervision and is generally administered in a hospital or specialized clinic. Deep brain stimulation (DBS): Electrodes surgically implanted in specific areas of the brain generate electrical pulses. DBS is used to treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or tremors that don't improve with medicines. What claims are made for tDCS? The brain normally functions by sending and receiving tiny electrical signals between nerve cells. Stimulating specific regions of the brain with low levels of electricity might improve focus or memory, mood, or even dementia, according to tDCS advocates. Some claims say tDCS can improve mental clarity, focus, and memory increase energy and motivation relieve so-called brain fog following COVID-19, Lyme disease, or other conditions reduce depression or anxiety reduce cravings among smokers or people with drug addiction improve symptoms of ADHD or Alzheimer's disease. Does tDCS work? The jury is still out. Research suggests that tDCS holds promise for certain conditions, but techniques tested through research may differ from devices sold commercially for at-home use. For example, electrodes may be positioned more precisely over an area of the brain, and how current is delivered, session length, or number of sessions may differ. Currently, small, short-term studies show that tDCS may benefit people with: Depression: An analysis of 10 randomized trials found some participants were more likely to report fewer symptoms of depression, or remission of depression, after a course of tDCS treatment compared with sham treatment. Alzheimer's disease: A review of seven studies found that tDCS lasting 20 to 40 minutes improved memory and other cognitive measures in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. ADHD: One randomized trial of 64 adults with ADHD found improved attention after 30 minutes of tDCS daily for a month. The FDA has not cleared tDCS for any health condition, and it is considered investigational. More research with positive results and reassuring safety data are needed before tDCS gets a thumbs-up from regulators. That's probably why some ads for tDCS note in fine print that it is not a medical device and is only for recreational use. Does tDCS have downsides? While the FDA assesses tDCS as safe for adults, there are downsides to consider. For example, treatment may cause itching, irritation, or small burns at the sites of the electrodes. Some users complain of fatigue or headache. There are no large, long-term studies of tDCS, so overall safety is uncertain. Some experts believe at-home use raises many questions, such as how much of the brain beyond targeted areas is affected, what inconsistent approaches to tDCS use might do, and how long changes in the brain — intended or not — could last. Very limited research has been done in children. So, the consequences for a child's developing brain aren't clear. Finally, tDCS devices can be expensive (several hundred dollars or more), and generally are not covered by health insurance. The bottom line It's not yet clear how tDCS should be used, or who is most likely to benefit from it. If you're interested in pursuing tDCS, understand that there's still a lot we don't know. If you're more skeptical and risk-averse (like me), you may want to wait for more definitive research regarding its benefits and risks — and for now, stick with your morning coffee to clear your mind.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/short-on-slumber,Short on slumber,1,"If you use an alarm clock to wake up, it's a good bet you're sleep deprived. But what if you feel fine when that buzzer, bell, or blast of music rouses you? You're probably still not getting all the sleep you need — the fundamental definition of sleep deprivation — or you wouldn't have required the jolt. You would have woken up by yourself already. ""You can keep eating when you're not hungry, but you can't keep sleeping if you're not tired,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, according to the National Sleep Foundation, but more than 35% of American adults report consistently sleeping less than seven hours. Moreover, nearly half of Americans say they feel sleepy during the day between three and seven days a week — meaning they're likely not getting enough nighttime rest. Women have particular problems with getting sufficient sleep, regardless of how much time we spend in bed; our lifetime risk of insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep) is up to 40% higher than that of men. And things are only getting worse. ""When we examine the data that tell us how much people have been sleeping over the last century, it's clear we're sleeping less and less,"" says Dr. Ina Djonlagic, a neurologist at the Sleep Disorders Center at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Being short on slumber can make us dopey, sluggish, cranky, and forgetful. But consistently getting less sleep than we need can lead to serious health problems that go far beyond a day's bad mood. ""Sleep deprivation affects basically everything,"" Dr. Klerman says. Reasons for poor sleep Why aren't many of us sleeping enough? Some reasons are habit-based and therefore controllable. Often, Harvard experts say, we simply don't set aside enough time for sleep and allow work or other commitments to intrude. ""For some parents, bedtime is finally their 'me' time when they start to watch movies and do things they enjoy at the expense of sleep,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""And it's not just bedtime procrastination; some people get up really early to go to the gym to have time for themselves."" Some also carry a misguided sense of pride in not ""needing"" sleep, boasting about how little they get — as if it's a virtue. ""It's almost like a competition, and there's certainly this idea that if you sleep a lot you're a bit lazy and less productive,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. But some contributors to a lack of shuteye are indeed out of our control, making sound sleep an unattainable dream. They include pregnancy menopause-related night sweats certain medications sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome ailments such as chronic pain, cancer, depression, or dementia. Threats to health and safety Whatever the cause, skipping shut-eye can be disastrous. ""The immediate effect of sleep deprivation is a lack of alertness that can translate into more accidents in cars and other situations,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. About one in 25 adults falls asleep at the wheel each month, according to the CDC, while 6,000 fatal car crashes per year are due to drowsy driving. And a new analysis provides eye-popping insight into how our health can suffer for decades to come. Published online Oct. 18, 2022, by the journal PLOS Medicine, the study showed that healthy 50-year-olds who sleep five hours or less each weeknight have a 30% higher risk of developing two or more chronic health conditions over the next 25 years compared with peers who sleep seven hours. By age 70, that risk climbs to 40% in those with the same scanty sleep pattern. The study tracked nearly 8,000 British people from 1985 to 2016, none of whom had multiple chronic diseases at the start. A quarter-century later, researchers observed far higher risks of multiple conditions such as diabetes, cancer, coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney or liver disease, depression, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and arthritis in those who logged five hours of sleep or less. Other recent research has zeroed in on sleep deprivation's effects on specific conditions. A study published online Nov. 2, 2022, by The Science of Diabetes Self-Management and Care suggests that people who report trouble sleeping are likelier to have markers—including higher cholesterol, greater body weight, and more inflammation—that contribute to diabetes. The study involved more than 1,000 Australian adults (average age 45). There's also a higher risk of obesity among people averaging less than seven hours of sleep each night, according to a 2018 study in the journal BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine. ""Hunger hormones are involved, but when we're tired or sleepy we gravitate more to foods that give us energy, such as carbohydrates,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. Our brains suffer, too. A study published in the November 2022 issue of Sleep that tracked more than 26,000 people ages 45 through 85 over three years showed those with insomnia faced greater risks of memory decline and dementia. ""We know there's a link between sleep and our ability to flush out brain toxins, such as amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""Sleep deprivation may also speed up the process for those destined to develop the disease."" Don't despair if you tend to operate on a sleep deficit. It might not be too late to turn around any deprivation-driven health trends, Dr. Klerman says. ""I want to believe if you start getting more sleep now, your body will begin repairing all the things that happened when you didn't sleep enough,"" she says. Tactics for sounder sleep Sleep feels good, so deciding to get more should theoretically be easy. But many of us don't cultivate the environment and set of habits known as sleep hygiene that promote sounder slumber. To accomplish that, Harvard experts offer these tips. Keep a consistent schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. But if there are nights you haven't slept enough before rising for school or work, it's okay to allow yourself to sleep longer on mornings when that's possible, Dr. Klerman says. Exercise earlier in the day. For some, exercising too close to bedtime can keep them up or fuel insomnia. Ease into sleep. ""We're good at helping little children do this by reading books and taking warm baths, but it's helpful for adults too,"" says Dr. Djonlagic. ""Light and stimulation are the biggest enemies to getting to sleep on time. Put everything aside and read a book in dim light or do something relaxing."" Use your bed for only two things. ""You should associate your bed with sleep or sex, not paying the bills,"" Dr. Klerman says. Ramp down caffeine use. This stimulant has a half-life of five hours in most adults, meaning your body will eliminate about half the caffeine you've consumed in that time, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. It's wise to avoid it after lunchtime. Why do we sleep? If sleep isn't a biological necessity, it's the biggest mistake evolution ever made. So said Allan Rechtschaffen, a pioneer of modern sleep research. His musings make sense, since by sleeping we spend about one-third of our lives inert, not reproducing or being productive in any other way. So why do we sleep? Scientists don't yet fully know the answer. But they do know that while we lie quiet, our brain and body are busy. Research has shown that this period of seeming inactivity serves to fine-tune physiological fundamentals such as metabolism, immune function, and more. We also process memories and wake feeling ready to focus on the day ahead. ""We think sleep serves multiple purposes,"" says Dr. Ina Djonlagic, a neurologist at the Sleep Disorders Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's almost like your body is processing things on a deeper level."" Skip the nightcap. Alcohol's sedative effects help us fall asleep quickly — but that effect wears off later in the night, making us more likely to toss and turn. More than one alcoholic drink each day lowers sleep quality in women by nearly 40%, according to the National Sleep Foundation. Put away devices. Blue light from cellphones, tablets, and computers can interfere with our circadian rhythm, the internal body clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Blue light–filtering glasses can help stem these effects, as can built-in filters available on some devices. Better yet, avoid using electronic devices for an hour or longer before bedtime. Let natural light in. Don't use blackout shades in your bedroom, Dr. Klerman advises. ""If you want to stay in sync with the world, you want the morning light to help you wake up,"" she says. Room-darkening shades can be helpful for people with chronic insomnia, however. Avoid using sleep aids for more than a night or two. It's tempting to take sleeping pills, but they carry major risks—especially as we age and are more prone to falls. They should only be used for a specific short-term reason (such as problems sleeping after a stressful event). Taken for longer, sleep aids tend to lose effectiveness within a few weeks and can backfire, disrupting sleep. People with chronic sleep problems can try a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that's geared toward insomnia (called CBT-i), ""which has been shown to work better than drugs,"" Dr. Klerman says. Another proactive step: try tracking your vacation sleep habits — the amount of shut-eye you log when you're not working for a week or two and are unencumbered by normal routines. ""That's usually how much sleep you actually need,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""Unfortunately, few people will make it a priority to get that amount during normal times.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-wont-my-hives-go-away,Why won't my hives go away?,1,"Q. I've gotten hives from time to time when I've been overly stressed. But now I have a case that won't quit after six weeks. What's going on? A. No one welcomes these red, itchy welts that crop up on our skin. Many things can lead to a temporary case of hives, including allergic reactions to food, medications, bug bites, pollen, latex, or animal dander. Like you, some people also develop them when they're stressed, or in response to ultraviolet light or excess skin pressure. Hives are more common in women than men, especially from our 30s to 50s. Most cases of hives go away within several days to a couple of weeks. If they last six weeks or longer, you may have autoimmune hives. This happens when your immune system mistakenly targets healthy tissue — in this case, triggering a skin reaction. Autoimmune hives are more common in people with other autoimmune conditions, such as lupus, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or celiac disease. Anyone whose hives last longer than a few weeks should see a doctor. Image: © chokja/Getty Images",9,0.07653716,-0.10646124
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-take-a-seat,Try this: Take a seat,1,"Meditation can lower blood pressure, reduce stress, and improve concentration. But where to begin? Here is a simple meditation to get you going. Try it every other day for five to 10 minutes. and build toward a daily practice: Sit quietly in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a full, deep breath, hold it briefly, and then exhale completely. Repeat several times until you reach a steady, calm breathing pattern. Relax all your muscles in sequence, beginning with your feet, lower legs, and thighs. Shrug your shoulders and roll your neck to the left and then right. Then on each exhalation, say to yourself or out loud the word ""peace,"" ""love,"" or any other short, positive mantra. Don't get discouraged when your thoughts wander (they will). Go back to the pattern of repeating the mantra each time you exhale. You can also practice brief meditation throughout your day. For example: Be mindful during chores. Focus your complete attention on doing routine tasks. Do walking meditation. Match your footsteps to your inhalations and exhalations. For example, take four steps as you inhale and four steps as you exhale. Take a moment. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths before starting your car or heading into a store.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-closer-look-at-good-cholesterol,A closer look at good cholesterol,1,"Managing blood cholesterol levels is one way to avoid cardiovascular disease and protect against heart attacks and strokes. Doctors concentrate on helping men lower their blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream can create plaque buildup inside arteries. If this buildup blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, the result is a heart attack or stroke. Your goal level for LDL depends on your risk factor profile. In general, the lower the number, the better. If you already have cardiovascular disease or are at high risk for it, you should aim for an LDL of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). For people at average risk, achieving a level of less than 100 mg/dL with lifestyle changes is excellent. You and your doctor can decide if you need a statin or other medication to lower your LDL further. But what about LDL's cholesterol counterpart, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the ""good"" cholesterol? ""HDL tends to get lost in the cholesterol conversation, but it plays a vital role in heart health, so it's important to also monitor HDL while you manage LDL,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. When is good HDL too good? HDL is considered ""good"" because it does the good work. It patrols blood vessels, collects excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls, and delivers it to the liver, where it's removed from the body. This ongoing action prevents dangerous plaque buildup. Guidelines recommend an HDL level of 40 mg/dL to 60 mg/dL for adult men. ""A level below 40 mg/dL could mean that there is not enough HDL to do its job properly,"" says Dr. Sacks. Since HDL is deemed ""good,"" it would make sense that higher amounts equal extra protection. But research has found that this is not necessarily true, and that HDL levels beyond 80 mg/dL don't offer additional benefits. Higher HDL might not always be effective because it needs help to do its job. Research suggests that HDL's protective role depends partly on the levels of LDL and triglycerides (a type of blood fat that helps make up your lipid profile). One study that looked at people with both low and high HDL levels and those with normal and high levels of LDL and triglycerides discovered that for optimal protection against cardiovascular disease, there needs to be healthy levels for all three. Do you need advanced lipid testing? Doctors use lipid panels to measure cholesterol levels, screen people for cardiovascular disease risk, and monitor treatments. Yet, sometimes more detailed cholesterol information is needed. This requires advanced lipid testing to measure apolipoprotein B (apoB), the main protein in LDL. Research has suggested that higher amounts of apoB can signal greater risk. But not everyone needs this test. ""For the average person with high LDL or total cholesterol, the additional details won't materially alter their diagnosis or treatment,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. However, specific individuals may benefit, he adds. These include people who've had a recent stroke or heart attack without any apparent risk factors, such as high LDL, high blood pressure, diabetes, or smoking, and men diagnosed with cardiovascular disease before age 55. On the rise A standard blood test called a lipid panel measures a person's total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. Specific individuals may benefit from advanced lipid testing (see ""Do you need advanced lipid testing?""). The results help assess cardiovascular disease risk and dictate if treatment is needed. Addressing high LDL is always the first priority, but if you have concerningly low HDL levels — less than 40 mg/dL — your doctor likely will recommend lifestyle changes, according to Dr. Sacks. ""While a person's HDL level is predominantly determined by genetics, certain habits can cause HDL levels to drop,"" he says. Here are some strategies that people with low HDL should adopt. Exercise more. Moderate-intensity exercise, like brisk walking for at least 30 minutes three times a week, can help boost HDL. High-intensity interval training also can help. Lose weight. If overweight, aim to lose 5% to 10% of your current weight. Cut back on refined carbohydrates. Switch from refined carbohydrates (white bread, white pasta) to whole grains (oats, whole-wheat pasta, brown rice) and add lean protein to your diet, like poultry, tofu, beans, and lentils. Limit alcohol. Keep your intake, if any, to one to two drinks daily. Stop smoking. If needed, seek out medical assistance to quit. Image: © Dilok Klaisataporn/Getty Images",1,0.29647607,-0.1584161
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-dark-side-of-daylight-saving-time,The dark side of daylight saving time,1,"On March 12, most Americans will observe the start of daylight saving time (DST) and ""spring forward"" by setting their clocks one hour ahead. (The exceptions are people living in Arizona and Hawaii.) DST lasts from mid-March until early November when the clocks turn back an hour and return to standard time. During DST, people can enjoy more time in the sunlight in the evenings. But that convenience comes at a price. ""That one-hour change may not seem like much, but it can wreak havoc on people's mental and physical well-being in the short term,"" says Dr. Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School's Division of Sleep Medicine. Go toward the light Research suggests that changing our clocks twice a year can have various health consequences. Of the two, springing ahead one hour tends to be more disruptive. That hour change can upset our circadian rhythms, the body's natural 24-hour cycles regulating key functions like appetite, mood, and sleep. Circadian rhythms largely depend on light exposure. The hour transition in the spring initially causes darker mornings and lighter evenings. Less morning light can decrease levels of the mood-boosting hormone serotonin. In contrast, exposure to light later in the evening can delay the production of melatonin, the hormone that helps you fall asleep. Many people also have trouble adjusting their sleep schedule to the new time. For the first few days or even a week, they may go to bed later or wake up earlier than usual, which can cause sleep deprivation. One study found that the average person gets 40 minutes less sleep on the Monday after DST begins compared with other nights of the year. ""Disrupted sleep can cause people to feel fatigued, groggy, and less focused,"" says Dr. Czeisler. This may explain, in part, the 6% rise in car accidents following the spring time change, according to a 2020 study in the journal Current Biology. Poor sleep caused by DST also can exacerbate existing problems like depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder. Is the end of daylight saving near? Present-day daylight saving time (DST) was officially adopted in 1966. Proponents believe the semiannual time change means people can enjoy outdoor activities longer, save energy by using less electricity for lighting, and perhaps have a positive economic impact. But DST has its critics. A 2022 poll found that 61% of Americans favored ending DST. Also, many sleep experts say evidence strongly suggests that staying on standard time all year is healthier. A bill to eliminate the time change has been introduced in the past three Congressional sessions but has not yet made it into law. It remains to be seen whether legislators will reintroduce it. Prepare for the switch People can take steps to make the hour change less daunting to their bodies and mind. Dr. Czeisler offers several different approaches: Alter your bedtime. About three days before the time change, go to bed and wake up 10 to 15 minutes earlier than usual. The next night, aim for 20 to 30 minutes, and then 30 to 45 minutes on the third night. ""By the end of this period, your body would have adjusted to that lost hour, and you won't have the stress of trying to quickly catch up on sleep,"" says Dr. Czeisler. Take afternoon naps. If you feel tired in the afternoons after DST starts, take scheduled midday naps for 20 to 30 minutes (napping longer than that can make you feel even more groggy). Get more light. During the first week after the time change, try to get about 15 minutes of exposure to morning light, which can help maintain your circadian rhythms. Another option is to use a light box that produces a bright white light. Choose a light box with 10,000 lux exposure (lux is a measure of light intensity). Sit about 12 inches away for up to 30 minutes. Keep your eyes open, but don't look directly at the light. Spend the time reading, writing, or just being present. Delay your day. For several days after the time change, postpone beginning your daily routine for an hour. For example, if you go for your morning walk at 8 a.m., wait until 9 a.m. ""Your internal clock is still running an hour behind, so you give it a chance to adjust,"" says Dr. Czeisler. Gradually shorten your start time by 10 or 15 minutes; within a week, your body's clock should be reset to the new time. Curb the alcohol and caffeine. Cut back on drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages several days before and after the time change, as they can disrupt your sleep. Image: © ljubaphoto/Getty Images",6,0.13612373,-0.14182873
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-new-diabetes-drugs-your-best-shot-for-weight-loss,The new diabetes drugs: Your best shot for weight loss?,1,"A weekly injection that leads to dramatic weight loss without serious side effects almost sounds too good to be true. But several drugs originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes can help people shed as much as 20% of their body weight — far more than other anti-obesity drugs. Known as incretin mimetics, they also improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Not surprisingly, these medications are in high demand, especially semaglutide (for a list of these drugs and their brand names, see ""Diabetes and anti-obesity drugs""). This has led to shortages of certain formulations. That's just one of the issues faced by people hoping to take these drugs, which are costly — around $1,000 to $1,500 per month — and not covered by Medicare for obesity (although some private insurers cover them). Who's a good candidate for these medications, and what else should people know about them? Diabetes and anti-obesity drugs Poisonous lizards known as Gila monsters have a unique ability to maintain steady blood sugar levels even after long stretches of not eating. Venom from this colorful creature inspired the development of exenatide (Byetta), the first in a class of drugs known as incretin mimetics. Today, there are more effective drugs that mimic an incretin called GLP-1. These injectable drugs include dulaglutide (Trulicity), liraglutide (Victoza), and semaglutide (Ozempic); the latter is also available as a pill called Rybelsus. Liraglutide and semaglutide are also approved for weight loss, in formulations marketed respectively as Saxenda and Wegovy. The newest addition to this drug family combines GLP-1 and another incretin mimic, GIP. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) was approved for treating type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and tagged for accelerated review for approval to treat obesity, which is anticipated sometime in 2023. Overlapping risks Up to half of all new-onset diabetes cases in this country are linked to obesity, a disease that now affects more than 40% of Americans. Both conditions are closely linked to cardiovascular disease. ""Many cardiologists now recognize that treating obesity is the best way to treat heart disease,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, who co-directs the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Other anti-obesity drugs help people lose only about 5% to 8% of their body weight. But the incretin mimics, which are similar to hormones made naturally by the gut and brain, have multiple effects. They prod the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar rises too high, slow down the emptying of the stomach, and target brain receptors involved in reducing appetite. The newest ones, tirzepatide and semaglutide, can lead to remarkable weight loss and also lower HbA1c levels (a three-month average measure of blood sugar) by as much as two percentage points. ""Studies also show that semaglutide and liraglutide, an older drug, can lower the risk of serious cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with obesity and diabetes,"" says Dr. Apovian. A large trial to see whether semaglutide lowers heart-related risks in people without diabetes who are overweight or obese is currently under way, she adds. Who might consider these drugs? People with diabetes who are carrying excess weight are good candidates for semaglutide or tirzepatide, especially those at high risk for heart disease, Dr. Apovian says. For people without diabetes, the official criteria for prescribing the drugs are the same as for all other anti-obesity drugs: a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, or a BMI of 27 or higher and at least one weight-related health problem, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. (See the calculator at /bmi-calculator to estimate your BMI.) Taking these drugs involves injecting yourself in the abdomen or thigh using a penlike device with a tiny needle the size of a human hair. Side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation are common. But they rarely last longer than a week or so, especially if you start low and increase the dosage slowly while guided by an experienced physician, says Dr. Apovian. If you stop taking the drug, you'll likely regain weight. But that's similar to what would happen if you were taking blood pressure medication and stopped — your blood pressure would rise. ""Obesity is a disease, and we need to treat it like one,"" says Dr. Apovian. Image: © Ariel Skelley/Getty Images",8,0.17047359,0.07006061
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercising-when-you-have-a-heart-condition,Exercising when you have a heart condition,1,"You just discovered you need surgery to replace a faulty heart valve. Or maybe you've had a heart attack, or were recently diagnosed with mild heart failure. Learning that you have heart disease is understandably upsetting. But don't let fear or worry keep you from taking steps to heal and strengthen your heart. ""For a lot of people, a heart attack is a wake-up call. But for others, it's more like a red light,"" says Dr. Hicham Skali, associate director of the cardiac rehabilitation program at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Instead of starting or renewing efforts to exercise, they stop or avoid physical activity. ""Some people believe that a heart condition means they should be careful and rest, but that's a major misconception,"" says Dr. Skali. Exercise is one of the most important things you can do to prevent all types of heart disease from getting worse — not to mention avoiding heart problems in the first place. ""As long as you're exercising safely, there's far more benefit than risk,"" says Dr. Skali. Your age, current fitness level, and diagnosis will influence what makes the most sense for you. But everyone can exercise, and even small amounts can make a difference, he adds. Cardiac rehab Many people with heart disease qualify for cardiac rehabilitation. The initial evaluation includes an exercise stress test, a closely monitored workout done on a treadmill or stationary bike that shows how your heart and body respond to exertion. The results can help your rehab team offer safe, effective suggestions for physical activity. Unfortunately, not everyone who qualifies for cardiac rehab has easy access to such a program, which typically requires you to attend a few times a week for several months. However, a hybrid program that includes some online sessions may be available (see ""A virtual approach to healing the heart"" in the October 2022 Heart Letter). Another option is to ask your cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, or primary care doctor to prescribe an exercise stress test, which can be reassuring for people who are worried about exercising, says Dr. Skali. If you're generally healthy, your doctor might decide that you don't need a stress test and can go ahead and start exercising on your own. After a procedure After any procedure, wait until your doctor gives you the green light to start exercising. After an angioplasty (a minimally invasive procedure to widen a narrowed or blocked heart artery), you can usually resume your normal activities after two days. If you had the procedure to treat a heart attack, you might need to take it easy for a bit longer. People often need a month or more to fully recover from open heart surgery, which requires sawing through the breastbone. But that doesn't mean avoiding exercise as you heal. In fact, a small study found that starting cardiac rehab just two weeks after surgery was just as effective and likely as safe as waiting for six weeks, says Dr. Skali. The good news is that people often have more energy and endurance after their heart is repaired. Take it easy at first, starting ""low and slow,"" especially if exercise hasn't been part of your regular routine, says Dr. Skali. Walking outside or on a treadmill for just five minutes at a time several times a day is a good way to start. Keep adding a few minutes to your walks every week or so, until you're up to at least 20 minutes a day. Pay attention to how you're feeling, and add intensity by walking briskly (or even jogging) for short bouts if that feels okay. Rest as needed Even people who've never exercised and have several serious health problems can still exercise. ""I have patients with heart failure and obesity who tell me they can't walk for more than one minute,"" Dr. Skali says. His advice: Put a chair at each end of your driveway or whatever short distance you can manage. Walk back and forth between the chairs, sitting down to rest when needed to catch your breath. Try to do four laps in the morning, and then another four laps in the afternoon. ""Even just 30 seconds at a time is enough to make progress,"" he says. And no matter what your fitness level, always stop or slow down if you feel dizzy, weak, or breathless. Image: © luciano/Getty Images",6,0.26577526,-0.3238175
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/shift-work-can-harm-sleep-and-health-what-helps-202302282896,Shift work can harm sleep and health: What helps?,1,"We can feel groggy when our sleep schedule is thrown off even just a little. So what happens when shift work requires people to regularly stay awake through the night and sleep during the day — and how can they protect their health and well-being? What is shift work disorder? Mounting evidence, including several new studies, paints a worrisome picture of the potential health fallout of nontraditional shift work schedules that affect 15% to 30% of workers in the US and Europe, including factory and warehouse workers, police officers, nurses, and other first responders. So-called shift work disorder mainly strikes people who work the overnight or early morning shift, or who rotate their shifts, says Eric Zhou, an assistant professor in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. It is characterized by significant problems falling and staying asleep, or sleeping when desired. That's because shift work disrupts the body's normal alignment with the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle called the circadian rhythm. ""People who work 9-to-5 shifts are typically awake when the sun is up, which is aligned with their body's internal circadian clock. But for shift workers, their work hours and sleep hours are misaligned with the natural cues to be awake or asleep,"" Zhou says. ""They're working against the universe's natural inclinations — not just their body's."" What's the connection between shift work and health? A 2022 research review in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine links shift work to higher risks for serious health problems, such as heart attack and diabetes. This research suggests adverse effects can include metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that raises the risks for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke), accidents, and certain types of cancer. ""The research is consistent and powerful,"" Zhou says. ""Working and sleeping during hours misaligned with natural light for extended periods of time is not likely to be healthy for you."" How do new studies on shift work boost our understanding? New research continues to add to and strengthen earlier findings, teasing out specific health effects that could stem from shift work. Shift workers on rotating schedules eat more erratically and frequently than day workers, snack more at night, and consume fewer healthier foods with potentially more calories, a study published online in Advances in Nutrition suggests. This analysis reviewed 31 prior studies involving more than 18,000 participants, comparing workers' average food intake over 24 hours. Disrupting the circadian rhythm through shift work appears to increase the odds of colorectal cancer, a malignancy with strong ties to lifestyle factors, according to a 2023 review of multiple studies published online in the Journal of Investigative Medicine. Contributors to this higher risk may include exposure to artificial light at night, along with complex genetic and hormonal interactions, study authors said. ""Cancer understandably scares people, and the World Health Organization recognizes that shift work is a probable carcinogen,"" Zhou says. ""The combination of chronically insufficient and poor-quality sleep is likely to get under the skin. That said, we don't fully understand how this happens."" How can you protect your sleep — and your health? If you work overnight or early morning shifts, how can you ensure you sleep more soundly and restfully? Zhou offers these evidence-based tips. Time your exposure to bright and dim light. Graveyard shift workers whose work schedule runs from midnight through 8 a.m., for example, should reduce their light exposure as much as possible after leaving work if they intend to go right to sleep once they return home. ""These measures could take the form of wearing blue light–blocking glasses or using blackout shades in your bedroom,"" he says. Make enough time for sleep on days off. ""This is often harder than it sounds, because you'll want to see your family and friends during nonwork hours,"" Zhou says. ""You need to truly protect your opportunity for sleep."" Maintain a consistent shift work schedule. ""Also, try to minimize the consecutive number of days you spend working challenging shifts,"" he says. Talk to your employer. Perhaps your boss can schedule you for fewer overnight shifts. ""You can also ask your doctor to make a case for you to be moved off these shifts or have more flexibility,"" Zhou says. Look for practical solutions that allow you to get more restful sleep. ""People engaged in shift work usually have responsibilities to their job as well as their family members, who often operate under a more typical 9-to-5 schedule,"" he notes. ""The goal is to preserve as strong a circadian rhythm as possible under the abnormal schedule shift work requires.""",6,0.1921938,-0.25912142
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/parents-dont-always-realize-that-their-teen-is-suicidal-201902132897,Parents don't always realize that their teen is suicidal,1,"Parents like to think that they know what is going on with their children — and that they would know if their teen was suicidal. However, research shows that this is not always the case. Teens may consider suicide more often than parents realize In a study published a few years ago in the journal Pediatrics, researchers interviewed more than 5,000 adolescents ages 11 to 17. In those interviews, they asked them if they had ever thought about killing themselves — or if they had ever thought a lot about death or dying. The teens' parents were asked if they believed that their teens had ever thought about killing themselves, or had thought a lot about death or dying. There wasn't a whole lot of match-up. Half of the parents of the adolescents who thought of killing themselves were unaware — as were three-quarters of the parents of adolescents who thought often about death. This disconnect looms larger as research shows mental health problems are on the rise in youth. According to the 2021 Youth Risk Behavioral Survey, 42% of high school students reported persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness; 22% seriously considered suicide, and 10% attempted it. The numbers were higher for girls and youth who identify as LGBTQ+: Almost 60% of girls experienced persistent sadness and hopelessness; 30% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 13% attempted it. Among LGBTQ+ youth, 70% experienced persistent sadness and hopelessness; 45% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 22% attempted it. Many factors contribute to this. Stress and isolation caused by the pandemic clearly played a role. While teens are back in school, re-entry has been difficult for many. Social media clearly plays a role, inviting unrealistic comparisons, reinforcing negative thoughts and ideas, and encouraging doomscrolling. It is also a source of bullying: in the report, 16% of high school students reported being bullied electronically, including 20% of girls and 27% of those who identify as LGBTQ+. Why the disconnect between teens and parents? It's not that surprising that parents don't always know that their teens are considering suicide. Teens may not always realize how bad they are feeling, and may not want to tell their parents when they do — both for fear of worrying them, and also because of uncertainty about how their parents might react. Parents may miss signs of depression in their teens, or quite genuinely misinterpret them or attribute them to something innocent; after all, it's natural to want to believe that your child is fine, rather than thinking that they might be suicidal. And given how much drama can be intrinsic to the life of a teen, it's understandable that parents could misinterpret statements about death or dying as, well, just teen drama. What can parents do? Be aware of signs of depression in teens, and never ignore them. Acting sad is one of them, but there are many others: dropping gradesbeing irritable or angry oftenacting bored all the time, and/or dropping out of activitiesdifficulty with relationships, including changing peer groups or becoming more isolateddangerous or risky behaviorpersistent physical complaints such as headaches or stomachachesfatigue. Listen to your teen, and never assume that statements like ""nobody cares if I live or die"" are just drama. Instead of saying, ""You don't mean that,"" ask them if they do mean it. Often parents worry that asking about suicide might ""give them ideas,"" but asking may be the only way to know — and the best way to show your teen that you are taking them seriously. Learn how to have tough conversations about mental health and suicide. The American Academy of Pediatrics has many tips and resources for parents. Get help. Call your doctor, call a mental health professional, call the new nationwide number 988 that can link you to local help like a suicide hotline, or take your child to a local emergency room. This is crucial. If counseling is recommended, do your best to schedule it, letting your doctor know if you are having trouble finding a provider. Make sure your teen sticks with it. If you suspect your teen may be depressed or suicidal, take precautions. If you have a gun in your house, make sure it is locked up with the ammunition locked separately. Take stock of prescription medications and alcohol in your house that could be used for self-harm, and either get rid of them or be sure they are stored safely. Sometimes it is just drama — or short-term blues after a breakup or another one of life's inevitable disappointments. And in the study, half of the teens whose parents thought they were suicidal, and two-thirds of those whose parents believed their teens thought about death, said they were fine. But when it comes to suicide, it's always better to be safe than sorry. So ask the questions — and ask for help.",1,-0.039217394,-0.12707646
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/a-pain-in-the-rear,A pain in the rear,1,"We're all born with eyes, ears, arms, legs… and the makings of hemorrhoids. While they're not what we think of as a body part, the blood vessels that pad the anus and rectum are nonetheless part of all of us — and one that few mention in polite company. These blood vessels only become problematic when they enlarge. Before that, they ""actually contribute to some of our continence — they hold things in place,"" says Dr. Anne Fabrizio, a proctologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. But when symptoms emerge — ranging from barely noticeable to excruciating — they can disrupt our days. About half of adults have experienced some degree of hemorrhoidal symptoms by age 50. Pain, itching, swelling, and bleeding can progress to a point where hemorrhoids bulge dramatically and develop blood clots that prove agonizing, Dr. Fabrizio says. ""It's an incredibly common problem that can have a huge impact on quality of life,"" she says. ""But a lot of people try to ignore it for a long time, partly because it can be embarrassing, so they hesitate to bring it up."" Serious complications Hemorrhoids are classified into two types depending on where they're found. External hemorrhoids are visible at the anus, while internal ones are inside the rectum. The latter tend to produce painless, bright red bleeding with bowel movements, but not much pain, Dr. Fabrizio says. Because any rectal bleeding is concerning — possibly signaling colorectal cancer — you should see a doctor, even if you're unbothered and convinced internal hemorrhoids are the cause. Pregnancy is one of the top risk factors for hemorrhoids because it intensifies pressure in the rectum. Others include aging, chronic constipation or diarrhea, and obesity. But women are likely to delay hemorrhoid treatment in the years after childbirth — when the problem can flare — as they juggle family with other priorities. This is a mistake, Dr. Fabrizio says. Putting off care can lead to potentially serious complications as well as needless suffering for anyone with hemorrhoids. ""They may be uncomfortable all the time, in pain, and thinking of their hemorrhoids when they're supposed to be focused on other things,"" she says. When hemorrhoids get extremely large, mucus can seep out. So can blood. ""A worst-case scenario is that people can get really anemic,"" Dr. Fabrizio adds. ""They can have significant blood loss that harms their overall health."" Treatment strategies Drugstore hemorrhoid remedies are often the first thing people try when symptoms are mild. These include pain relievers, along with witch hazel pads and topical creams and ointments to reduce itching and discomfort. Shallow sitz baths and cold compresses can also bring relief. But while these tactics are ""great for symptom management,"" Dr. Fabrizio says, ""they don't tackle the underlying problem. They don't really make a hemorrhoid go away. That's why you should see a doctor."" Seeking care early also widens your treatment choices before the problem worsens to a point of needing more extreme — and potentially painful — options. One tool is prescription hydrocortisone suppositories, which can be used for short-term hemorrhoid inflammation. Most patients who see a doctor early and take steps toward having easy, regular bowel movements can often sidestep the worst symptoms of hemorrhoids — or even prevent symptoms from arising at all, she says. For internal hemorrhoids, the doctor may recommend a procedure to eliminate the hemorrhoid by cutting off its blood flow. One option is sclerotherapy, which involves a chemical injection into the hemorrhoid. Another is banding, in which the doctor places a small rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid. In both cases, the bulging vessel eventually withers away. For large, bulging external hemorrhoids, surgery called hemorrhoidectomy is the only permanent removal option. Dr. Fabrizio acknowledges the procedure is painful, but often worth it. ""I tell patients that hemorrhoidectomy brings short-term, guaranteed pain, but offers long-term symptom improvement."" Preventing hemorrhoids from enlarging in the first place is the ideal, of course. Dr. Fabrizio recommends preventing constipation by eating fiber-rich foods and drinking plenty of water. Also, avoid straining for long periods on the toilet and aggressive wiping, which can lead to more irritation. ""Hemorrhoids are something we've been dealing with for centuries,"" she says. ""Talking about them more would make people more comfortable seeing a doctor earlier, which would be a win-win."" Image: © Lars Neumann/Getty Images",9,0.10345122,-0.30614358

Researchers examined 190 adults ages 40 to 75 who did not have cardiovascular disease. Participants had LDL levels that ranged from optimal to high and a 5% to 20% risk of developing cardiovascular disease within 10 years. Everyone was randomly put into one of eight groups. One group took 5 milligrams of the statin drug rosuvastatin (Crestor), another group took a daily placebo, and the rest took one of six dietary supplements, each with a dominant ingredient: fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice. (These ingredients have been touted to have heart health benefits, including helping to lower cholesterol.) After 28 days, people in the statin group lowered their LDL by an average of almost 38%, while changes in most of the supplement groups were comparable to those who took a placebo. (The garlic supplement group actually saw their LDL levels increase.) The statin group also had an average 24% decrease in total cholesterol. The researchers noted that more than 28 days may be needed for these dietary supplements to affect cholesterol levels. Still, the findings support statins as the best medicine for lowering cholesterol. Image: © Tanja Ivanova/Getty Images",3,0.3143729,0.023322167
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart",1,"The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection? Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease. The gut-heart connection The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects. ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse. One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque. Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO. In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less. The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat. Fiber at work Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels. But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health. Other supporting foods It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health. The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw. ""And if your gut is healthy, there is a greater chance your heart is healthy, too."" Image: © CareyHope/Getty Images",3,0.34324154,-0.019962277

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/poor-sleep-linked-to-a-common-cause-of-blindness,Poor sleep linked to a common cause of blindness,1,"Poor sleep is tied to many health problems, such as weight gain, mood disorders, and even dementia. Now, a large study published online Nov. 1, 2022, by BMJ Open suggests that poor sleep is also linked to higher risk for developing glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The study involved more than 400,000 people without glaucoma (ages 40 to 69) who were followed for 10 years. Researchers evaluated participants' medical records and self-reported sleep habits. People who had unhealthy sleep patterns (those who snored, experienced daytime sleepiness, had insomnia, slept less than seven hours per night, or slept more than nine hours per night) were more likely to develop glaucoma than people who had healthy sleep patterns. People who had insomnia or slept too much or too little had the highest risks for glaucoma — 13% higher than people without these problems. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that unhealthy sleep behaviors caused glaucoma. So what's the possible link? Study authors say eye pressure increases when you lie down and when your sleep hormones are out of kilter (which occurs in insomnia). That might be a plausible explanation for glaucoma risks, since the condition is caused by increased pressure on the optic nerves, which connect the eyes to the brain.

https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20240621/essential-nutritional-counseling-after-heart-attack-misses-many,Essential Nutritional Counseling After Heart Attacks Misses Many,1,"June 21, 2024 -- Heart disease reigns as the leading cause of death in the U.S., a stark reality fueled largely by our daily choices. Among these, diet stands out as the foremost contributor to premature deaths from cardiovascular conditions. But many people aren’t getting important nutritional counseling after surviving a heart attack that could prolong their lives. In a study published last week in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, researchers found that fewer than 1 in 4 patients received any nutritional counseling within 90 days of being hospitalized for a heart attack, cardiac bypass, congestive heart failure, or a stent. “Nutritional counseling is key to the prevention of future events, but not enough patients are getting it,” said lead study author Eric Brandt, MD, an assistant professor in the division of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, MI. We know that diet is critical to future heart health and that dietary counseling is an important tool for changing habits, yet several barriers hinder most patients from getting any nutritional guidance at all. Why Nutritional Counseling Works After a cardiac event, patients are presented with an urgent opportunity to make changes in their lives that can have a significant impact on their future heart health, said Barbara Olendzki, director of the Center for Applied Nutrition and an associate professor of medicine at the UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester, MA. In effect, this is the “sweet spot” when it comes to changing poor habits -- a time to adjust diet in ways that lower cholesterol and blood pressure to reduce the future risk arterial blockages. “After a heart attack, you’re frightened for your life, which gives patients around 6 months of motivation to make the kinds of changes necessary to prevent future events, but not enough patients take advantage of that time,” said Olendzki. Research has shown that medium-to high-intensity dietary counseling for patients with elevated cardiovascular risk factors can help them make significant changes toward a healthy diet that reduces cardiovascular events, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity-related outcomes, according to an article published in the November 2020 edition of JAMA Network. Patients are taught the importance of eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and healthy sources of monounsaturated fats like olive oil. They’re also taught to choose low-fat dairy and lean or plant-based sources of protein while avoiding saturated fats, sweets, and red meat, as well as moderating alcohol consumption. The type of counseling matters. Its effectiveness is dependent on format and frequency, according to a study published in the September 2019 issue of theJournal of Clinical Medicine. Just one meeting isn’t going to change habits. Rather, it takes time to establish trust with a clinician as well as identifying the changes that will have the most impact on heart health. It isn’t just about preaching a healthy diet, “it’s about identifying barriers that are keeping a patient from making positive dietary changes so that they can find ways around them,” said Geeta Sikand, a registered dietitian and associate professor of medicine in cardiology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine in Irvine, CA. For example, if you make poor dietary decisions when you get busy or anxious, consider having healthier foods prepared rather than reaching for unhealthy grab n’ go foods. If you tend to eat the least healthy when you drink alcohol, consider controlling consumption. And if you choose unhealthy foods at the grocery store, opt for grocery delivery services instead. “It’s about going on the journey with patients rather than them feeling like they’re being judged by their clinician,” said Sikand. Why Patients Aren’t Getting Nutritional Counseling Still, the largest barrier to nutritional counseling isn’t the quality of it but the complete lack of any sort of guidance. Cost, time, and motivation keep most patients from getting the care they need, said Brandt. And after the initial 6 months after a cardiac event, many people settle back into their bad habits if they haven’t already attempted to alter them. Counseling with a registered dietitian is the gold standard because dietitians are trained not just in nutrition but in the behavioral components of healthy eating. For example, why people eat the way they do. Unfortunately, one of the biggest hurdles for patients is cost since this type of counseling isn’t covered by insurance unless a patient has kidney failure or diabetes. “Many patients don’t receive dietary counseling either because their provider doesn’t have enough time to cover it during an office visit or dietitian services aren’t covered by insurance,” Brandt said. Heart attack patients can get limited nutritional counseling as part of their cardiac rehabilitation plan, which also involves exercise training, emotional support, and education around better heart health. But it tends to be more limited in scope and frequency. Still, this is the most counseling that many patients will get. Only about 5% of patients in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics study got counseling outside of cardiac rehab. Expanding Nutritional Services to Cardiac Patients The hope is that better access will increase patient participation. A new bill currently in Congress could improve access to nutritional counseling by expanding coverage to patients with Medicare. HR: 6407: The Expanded Medical Nutrition Therapy Act will expand the availability of medical nutrition therapy services under the Medicare program to include cardiovascular disease and a range of other chronic diseases. Once that happens, private insurers will follow the government’s lead when deciding what to cover, said Sikand. “But as of now, despite its benefits, many people are left without care.” Still, it’s also true that some choose not to go to counseling. They may wrongly conclude that genetics is the leading driver of cardiovascular health— and that there isn’t much they can do if their family history dooms them to die of a heart attack. Or they might not have time because they need to get back to work, said Jean Copeland, a clinical dietitian nutritionist with Dartmouth Health’s Heart and Vascular Center. “As a result, many patients fall prey to fad diets, resulting in them developing more and worsening health conditions in future years,” Copeland said. For patients who don’t have the time or transportation to do cardiac rehab, there’s also remote rehabilitation that may work for some, said David Jeremy Davidson, MD, director of medical weight loss and lipid clinics at NorthShore University Health System in Highland Park, IL. “This can help bridge the gap for patients who can’t do the therapy in person,” he said. Counseling apps that are nutrition focused like Noom, for example, provide nutritional counseling but also cognitive behavioral therapy, although these are also not covered by insurance. While they might not be as good as in person medical diet therapy, they do add a level of accountability and help patients recognize what they’re really eating, Davidson said. We now know that lifestyle changes can prevent cardiac events, and in fact those born into families with poorer cardiovascular outcomes are not destined to that same fate. But the next step for both patients and insurance providers are to recognize the important, cost-effective role of nutritional counseling in saving the lives of those with heart disease.",3,0.2540195,0.021348061
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/taking-up-adaptive-sports-202209122813,Taking up adaptive sports,1,"Health guidelines recommend adults get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise. Which activities you choose don't matter as long as they get you moving. But what if an injury, illness, health condition, disability, or even normal aging makes being active hard for you? In those cases, adaptive sports could lend a much-needed hand. What are adaptive sports? Adaptive sports are competitive or recreational sports or activities for people with disabilities or physical limitations. They often run parallel to traditional endeavors, but are modified to support people's specific physical abilities. ""Eventually, almost everyone will experience some kind of disability that impedes regular exercise, whether it's mild arthritis, requiring a knee or hip replacement, limited vision, or a more significant physical disability,"" says Dr. Cheri Blauwet, an associate professor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School, and a former wheelchair racer who is a seven-time Paralympic medalist and two-time winner of both the Boston and New York City Marathons. ""But today, because of advanced technology and supportive infrastructure, people can find almost any kind of sport or activity that takes into account their abilities and helps them stay active."" Why is it important to stay active? Not getting sufficient regular exercise increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. It also affects mood. And people with disabilities are especially vulnerable because of the challenges of staying active, says Dr. Blauwet. ""Adaptive sports are a way for us to continue to exercise regularly and support our health and well-being going forward."" Research backs this up. According to one study, people participating in adaptive sports and activities report better overall health, quality of life, and social life. How can you learn about options for adaptive activities near you? You can find state and local adaptive sports programs and accessible activities through the websites of the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability and the Challenged Athletes Foundation. ""These programs also can help you find mentors, coaches, and the support system that you need to be successful,"" says Dr. Blauwet. What kind of sport or activity you choose ultimately depends on your interests and level of function, but many options are available. Build on strengths and consider new activities Dr. Blauwet shares other strategies that can help you transition to adaptive activities. Look at your current form of exercise. ""Almost any kind of sport or activity can be adjusted to accommodate people with disabilities, so there is a good chance you can continue with a favorite endeavor,"" says Dr. Blauwet. For instance, as part of her ongoing therapy, former Arizona representative Gabby Giffords, an avid cyclist who lives with a brain injury after an assassination attempt, now rides a recumbent bike because of paralysis on her right side and balance issues. (A recumbent bike is a three-wheel bicycle that places the rider in a seated or laid-back reclining position.) Other sports and activities can be altered similarly. For example, specialized golf carts can help you stand and stabilize your body while swinging the club. Sledge hockey uses sleds to skate across the ice. Focus on your strengths. Don't dwell on what you can't do, but focus on what you can. Running no longer an option? How about power walking using walking poles for support? Can't use your legs? Focus on upper body activities like swimming or kayaking. Low vision? Guides are available to help you walk, run, and cycle. Join a team. Many adaptive sports have organized team leagues with adjusted rules and formats, like wheelchair basketball and tennis, and ""beep"" baseball and kickball for individuals with low vision. ""These are a great way to build more awareness about your new endeavor and build a community with other peers with similar disabilities,"" says Dr. Blauwet. ""Plus, a little competition provides extra motivation."" Try something new. Use your new functional status as an opportunity to attempt a different sport or activity. ""Test the waters and try something that has always interested you,"" says Dr. Blauwet. ""Now might be the ideal time to explore waterskiing, windsurfing, horseback riding, or rock wall climbing."" It may be mentally and emotionally tough to embrace adaptive sports and activities, as it can feel like your disability has become magnified. But don't let that dissuade you, adds Dr. Blauwet. ""Staying committed to being active and investing in your health can help reduce and eliminate any negative stigma you feel. Participation in adaptive sports is not a lesser way of living, but a way to live better.""",6,0.20780551,-0.25791863

The predicted lifespan rose to 77.5 years in 2022, adding just over an entire year to the life expectancy for babies born in 2022 compared to 2021. The improvement corresponds to a 9% decrease in the nation’s death rate and was primarily driven by a 55% decrease in year-over-year deaths attributed to COVID, according to final data published this week. The rebound in life expectancy still has not caught up to prepandemic highs. The 2022 life expectancy of 77.5 years is equivalent to life expectancy in the year 2004. While heart disease and cancer remained the top two causes of death in the nation in 2022, COVID dropped to fourth place. COVID was an underlying cause in the death of 186,552 people in 2022, down from 416,893 in 2021. Unintentional injuries moved into the third place position for leading causes of death. Women are still expected to live about 5 years longer than men, but the gender gap narrowed slightly in the new estimates. Girls born in 2022 are expected to live to 80.2 years old, while boys are expected to live to age 74.8. Women are now expected to live 5.4 more years than men, down from 5.8 years based on 2021 figures. The CDC report also estimated the remaining lifespan for people who were age 65 in 2022: Men were expected to live about 18 more years, to age 83, and women were expected to live nearly 19 more years, to age 84. The new data also showed a concerning trend of increasing death rates among children, including those ages 1 to 4 years old and those ages 5 to 14. The infant mortality rate rose as well. Maternal complications and bacterial infections in newborns increased substantially in reported causes of infant deaths, according to the CDC. An editorial published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association said the nation should be alarmed by the increasing death rate among its youngest residents, warning that “this increase in all-cause pediatric mortality has ominous implications. A nation that begins losing its most cherished population—its children—faces a crisis like no other.”",1,-0.21174555,-0.31062287
https://www.webmd.com/children/news/20240314/measles-control-2024-what-to-know,Measles Control So Far in 2024: ‘Not Off to a Great Start’,1,"March 14, 2024 – Just over 2 months into 2024, measles cases in the United States aren't looking great. The recent rise in cases across the U.S. is linked to unvaccinated travelers, lower than ideal vaccination rates, and misinformation, experts said. The CDC has identified 45 cases of measles in 17 jurisdictions across the U.S. As of March 7, the federal health agency reported measles cases in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York City, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington. As for the 45 cases, “that's almost as many as we had for the entire calendar year of 2023,” said Sarah Lim, MD, a medical specialist at the Minnesota Department of Health. “So we're really not off to a great start.” (For context, there were 58 officially reported measles cases last year.) Chicago is having a measles outbreak this week – with eight cases reported so far. All but one case has been linked to a migrant child at a city shelter. Given the potential for rapid spread – measles is relatively rare here but potentially very serious – the CDC sent a team of experts to investigate and to help keep this outbreak from growing further. Sometimes Deadly About 30% of children have measles symptoms and about 25% end up hospitalized. Complications include diarrhea, a whole-body rash, ear infections that can lead to permanent deafness, and pneumonia. Pneumonia with measles can be so serious that 1 in 20 affected children die. Measles can also cause inflammation of the brain called encephalitis in about 1 in 1,000 children, sometimes causing epilepsy or permanent brain damage. Similar to long COVID, some effects can last beyond the early infection. For example, measles “can wipe out immune memory that protects you against other bacterial and viral pathogens,” Lim said at a media briefing sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. This vulnerability to other infections can last up to 3 years after the early infection, she noted. Overall, measles kills between 1 and 3 people infected per thousand, mostly children. Vaccine Misinformation Playing a Role Vaccine misinformation is partly behind the uptick, and while many cases are mild, ""this can be a devastating disease,” said Joshua Barocas, MD, an associate professor of medicine in the divisions of General Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “I'm a parent myself. Parents are flooded with tons of information, some of that time being misinformation,” he said at the media briefing. “If you are a parent who's been on the fence [about vaccination], now is the time, given the outbreak potential and the outbreaks that we’re seeing.” Vaccine misinformation “is about as old as vaccines themselves,” Lim said. Concerns about the MMR vaccine, which includes measles protection, are not new. “It does seem to change periodically – new things bubble up, new ideas bubble up, and the problem is that it is like the old saying that ‘a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on.’” Social media helps to amplify vaccine misinformation, she said. “You don't want to scare people unnecessarily – but reminding people what these childhood diseases really look like and what they do is incredibly important,” Lim said. “It's so much easier to see stories about potential side effects of vaccines than it is to see stories about parents whose children were in intensive care for 2 weeks with pneumonia because of a severe case of measles.” Barocas said misinformation is sometimes deliberate, sometimes not. Regardless, “our job as infectious disease physicians and public health professionals is not necessarily to put the counternarrative out there, but to continue to advocate for what we know works based on the best science and the best evidence.” “And there is no reason to believe that vaccines are anything but helpful when it comes to preventing measles,” he noted. Lifelong Protection in Most Cases The MMR vaccine, typically given as two doses in childhood, offers 93% and then 97% protection against the highly contagious virus. During the 2022-to-2023 school year, the measles vaccination rate among kindergarten children nationwide was 92%. That sounds like a high rate, Lim said, “but because measles is so contagious, vaccination rates need to be 95% or higher to contain transmission.” One person with measles can infect anywhere from 12 to 18 other people, she said. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets spread through the air. “And if someone is unvaccinated and exposed, nine times out of 10, that person will go on to develop the disease.” She said given the high transmission rate, measles often spreads within families to infect multiple children. If you know you’re not vaccinated but exposed, the advice is to get the measles shot as quickly as possible. “There is a recommendation to receive the MMR vaccine within 72 hours as post-exposure prophylaxis,” Lim said. “That's a tight time window, but if you can do that, it reduces the risk of developing measles significantly.” If you’re unsure or do not remember getting vaccinated against measles as a young child, your health care provider may be able to search state registries for an answer. If that doesn't work, getting revaccinated with the MMR vaccine as an adult is an option. “There is no shame in getting caught up now,” Barocas said. Lim agreed. “There is really no downside to getting additional doses.”",7,-0.41476145,-0.15788268

Grown-ups need them to protect against diseases that become more common in adulthood. They can also protect you if you missed a dose as a child. Most adults need some or all of the following 11 vaccines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist what you need. Let them know if you'll be traveling internationally, if you have allergies, or if you’re pregnant. All of those things can affect which vaccines you need and which you should skip for now. How you get it: As a shot, or sometimes a nasal spray is recommended How often and when: Once a year, usually starting in September through the end of the flu season, which can last as late as May. The earlier you get it, the better your protection. Who should get it: All adults should get the vaccine in some form, unless they have a medical reason not to. The shot is the most common type. The nasal spray version has often been available for healthy adults up to age 49 who aren’t pregnant. There is an egg-free vaccine in case you have severe egg allergies. And if injections make you nervous, you can also get a shot that uses a smaller needle and doesn't pierce as deeply. Also, people who have a greater chance of getting the flu, like those over 65, can get high-dose injections that give them better protection. How you get it: As a shot How often and when: There are two types of these vaccines. If you’re a healthy adult over 65, you’ll need one or both. The timing and sequence of them depend on what vaccine you may have had before. Doctors may recommend more doses of the vaccine depending on which vaccine they received first for people with long-lasting kidney failure or other conditions that weaken the immune system. People who get their first pneumococcal shot before age 65 get a second dose after 65. Who should get it: All adults 65 and older. If you’re younger than 64, you need it if you: How you get it: A single shot of Tdap protects against all three diseases. One shot of Td guards against tetanus and diphtheria. How often and when: A one-time Tdap vaccination, followed by a Td booster every 10 years. Who should get it? How you get it: As a shot How often and when: First dose any time after age 1, second dose at least 6 months later. Who should get it? People of all ages who: How you get it: As a shot How often and when: You'll get a series two or three shots depending on the type of vaccine used. Who should get it? Adults of all ages at risk for hepatitis B infection, including those who: How you get it: A series of three shots How often and when: Preferably at ages 11 or 12, but older teens and young adults can get it, too. If you start before you are 15, then you get the second shot 1 to 2 months after the first. Who should get it? Young women and some men up to age 26 who didn't get it as preteens or teenagers. It’s best to get it before you start having sex. How you get it: In a single shot that protects against the three viruses How often and when: One shot, in some cases followed by a booster at least 4 weeks later Who should get it? Adults who were born after 1957, haven’t had measles, mumps, or rubella, and don’t have any immunity to them. Because this vaccine is made with live viruses, pregnant women shouldn’t get it, though women should get it at least 4 weeks before they get pregnant. How you get it: As a shot How often and when: Any time, in two doses 4-8 weeks apart Who should get it? Healthy adults who aren’t pregnant, haven't had chickenpox before, and aren’t immune to the virus. This vaccine is made with live viruses, so you shouldn’t get it if you have a weak immune system because of a disease (like cancer or HIV) or medical treatments (like steroids or chemotherapy). How you get it: As a shot How often and when: The first shot at age 11 or 12, with a booster at 16 and when a doctor recommends one. Who should get it? Adults who haven't had the vaccine should get it if they: How you get it: As a shot How often and when: Shingrix (RZV) is recommended for healthy adults 50 and older and well as those 19 years of age and older who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy.. It is administered in two shots, 2 to 6 months apart. It can be over 90% effective in prevening shingles and protection lasts an estimated 4-5 years. Who should get it? All healthy adults aged 50 and older should get Shingrex unless they have health problems or get treatments that affect how well their bodies fight infection. In addition, any adult over the age of 19 years of age who is immunocompromised due to illness or therapy. How you get it: As a shot How often and when: The Pfizer vaccine is given in two shots, 3 to 8 weeks apart. The Moderna vaccine is also administered in two shots, 4 to 8 weeks apart. Who should get it? They are recommended for everyone over the age of 6 months. Those ages 6 months to 4 years require a 3rd dose if receiving the Pfizer vaccine.",7,-0.2540826,-0.14754991

But exactly what is a healthy diet? It should include: Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs. More tips: That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms. Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats: Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",3,0.404435,0.121044025

It's a number of conditions that can affect how your heart works. Heart disease can also be called cardiovascular disease, though that term covers blood vessels problems as well. Heart disease is a major killer in the U.S., causing about 1 in 5 deaths, or about 700,000 a year. Each type of heart disease has its own symptoms and treatment. If you have some kinds, lifestyle changes and medicine can make a huge difference in your health. For others, you may need surgery to make your ticker work well again. Here are some of the common types of heart disease and how to prevent, recognize, and treat them. CAD is the most common heart problem and the biggest killer. With CAD, you get blockages in your coronary arteries — the vessels that supply blood to your heart. That can reduce the flow of blood to your heart muscle, keeping it from getting the oxygen it needs. The disease usually starts as a result of atherosclerosis, sometimes called hardening of the arteries. When you have that condition, deposits called plaque build up in your arteries, often over many years. Coronary heart disease can give you pain in your chest, called angina, or lead to a heart attack. It can also contribute to other heart problems, such as abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure. Some things that may put you at a higher risk of CAD are: When you have an arrhythmia, your heart beats too fast, too slow, or in an irregular, uneven pattern. Some arrhythmias are harmless. But others can put you at a serious risk of problems such as cardiac arrest and stroke. They may also cause symptoms like dizziness and fainting. Serious arrhythmias often develop from other heart problems but may also happen on their own. You're at higher risk if you smoke, drink alcohol, or have health problems such as obesity, high blood sugar, or sleep apnea. With heart failure, your heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should to meet your body's needs. It is usually caused by CAD, but it can also happen because you have thyroid disease, high blood pressure, heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), or certain other conditions. Your heart has four valves that open and close to direct blood flow between your heart's four chambers, the lungs, and blood vessels. An abnormality could make it hard for a valve to open and close the right way. When that happens, your blood flow could be blocked or blood can leak. The causes of heart valve problems include infections such as rheumatic fever, congenital heart disease, high blood pressure, CAD, and damage from a heart attack. Diseases of the heart valves include: Endocarditis. This is an infection that's usually caused by bacteria, which may enter the blood and take root in your heart during illness, after surgery, or after using IV drugs. It often happens if you already have valve problems. Antibiotics can usually cure it, but the disease is life threatening without treatment. If your heart valves are seriously damaged as a result of endocarditis, you may need valve replacement surgery. Rheumatic heart disease. This condition develops when your heart muscle and valves are damaged by rheumatic fever, which is linked to strep throat and scarlet fever. Rheumatic heart disease was more common in the past. But doctors are now able to prevent it by using antibiotics to treat the diseases that lead to it. If you do get it, the symptoms usually show up many years after the infection. Any disease of the pericardium, the sac that surrounds your heart, is called a pericardial disease. One of the more common diseases is pericarditis or inflammation of the pericardium. It's usually caused by an infection with a virus, inflammatory diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, or injury to your pericardium. Pericarditis often follows open heart surgery. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of your heart muscle, or myocardium. It gets stretched, thickened, or stiff. Your heart may get too weak to pump well. There are many possible causes of the disease, including genetic heart conditions, reactions to certain drugs or toxins (such as alcohol), and viral infections. Sometimes, chemotherapy for cancer causes cardiomyopathy. Many times, doctors can't find the exact cause. Congenital heart disease happens when something goes wrong while the heart is forming before birth. The heart abnormality sometimes leads to problems right after birth, but other times, there aren't any symptoms until adulthood. Septal abnormalities are among the most common congenital heart problems. These are holes in the wall that separates the left and right sides of your heart. You can get a procedure to patch the hole. Another type of abnormality is called pulmonary stenosis. A narrow valve reduces the flow of blood to your lungs. A procedure or surgery can open or replace the valve. In some babies, a small blood vessel known as the ductus arteriosus doesn't close up at birth as it should. When this happens, some blood leaks back into the pulmonary artery, which puts strain on the heart. Doctors can treat this with surgery or a procedure or sometimes with medication. Heart disease symptoms vary, depending on the kind of heart disease you have. In some cases, symptoms of different conditions overlap; in others, they don't. Here are some symptoms you might see with common types. CAD Arrythmias Heart failure Heart valve disease Cardiomyopathy Congenital heart disease If you have symptoms of heart disease, your doctor will start with the basics: examining you and listening to your heart with a stethoscope. They'll also want to know about your family and medical history. From there, you might get some tests, depending on your symptoms and history. They might include: Blood tests. These include the routine tests you get for cholesterol and blood sugar levels. In some cases, you might get tests for proteins linked to inflamed arteries and heart attacks. Chest X-ray. This can show if your heart is enlarged. EKG. This test records the electrical signals in your heart and shows the rate and rhythm of your heartbeats. Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to make detailed images of your heart in motion. It can show how blood moves through the heart and heart valves. Exercise tests or stress tests. You might use a treadmill or stationary bike while your heart is checked. Cardiac catheterization. If you might have blockages in your heart arteries, you can get this test, in which a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter is inserted in a blood vessel and guided to your heart. Dye can then be injected to help the arteries show up on X-rays. Depending on your type of heart disease, your treatment might start with lifestyle changes and include medications, procedures, and rehabilitation. Medications for heart disease These include medications to: Procedures for heart disease These include: Cardiac rehabilitation If you've had a heart attack, angioplasty, or heart surgery or if you have heart failure, you can benefit from this kind of program. Cardiac rehab includes: Because heart disease is the leading cause of death, taking steps to protect your heart is important, whether you've been diagnosed with heart disease or not. Here are some ways to keep your heart in the best shape possible: Don't smoke. Smoking isn't just bad for your lungs. It harms your heart and blood vessels, too. Quitting can quickly improve your heart health. Get or stay active. Try to get your heart pumping with 150 minutes a week of moderate activity, like brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, like running. Eat heart-healthy foods. That means lots of fruits and veggies, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats like those found in olive oil and avocados. Limit salt, sugar, alcohol, and highly processed foods. Get enough sleep. Most adults need at least seven hours a night. Reduce stress. If you're constantly on edge, try relaxation exercises or meditation. Getting more physical activity can help, too. Get regular checkups. Make sure you know your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels and take steps to improve them if needed. Having heart disease can have a big impact on your life and keep you from doing the things you'd like to do. The most common form of heart disease, CAD, is a major killer. But you can prevent or limit the damage from most forms of heart diseases. Living a heart-healthy lifestyle and working with your doctor to recognize and treat heart problems can make a big difference. Can you live a long life with heart disease? In many cases, the answer is yes. Of course, it depends on the type of heart disease you have and how effectively it's treated, as well as your health habits. For example, people who get treated for CAD can stop artery buildup from getting worse and prevent heart attacks, potentially adding years to their lives. And people with some conditions, including heart failure, are living longer than they did in the past, thanks to advances in medicine. What are the two warning signs of heart disease? Heart disease can have many warning signs. For the most common type, CAD, the two most common symptoms are chest pain and shortness of breath. What happens after you get diagnosed with heart disease? After the diagnosis, it's important to work with your doctor to get the best care and understand what's going on with your heart. So ask lots of questions — like whether you'll need more tests and treatments and what you should do if you have new symptoms. You may need to have regular visits with a heart doctor and make changes to your diet or other habits. In many cases, you'll need to take medicine for the rest of your life.",1,0.18700193,-0.31887558

Lots of items can be recalled. Some products that are commonly recalled include: If an item is recalled, you may have to throw it away, return it, or exchange it for a similar or newer product. Although most companies create specific quality control procedures to either prevent or lessen the chance of a recall, they can happen. Product safety recalls are mainly used to protect people. Usually, a recall happens because someone finds out that the item could hurt someone or make them sick, or has already has. It could also be an issue that affects how the item is supposed to work or it might be one that creates legal problems for the makers. If an item you have is recalled, your next move depends on the type of product and the instructions put out by the government agency or manufacturer. Usually the company that makes the product or a government agency will announce the product recall and encourage people who have that item to take action. For example, some recalls will let you know that you need to throw the item out. Others prevent the company from selling any more of that product. Or, you might have to send the product back to the manufacturer so they can either repair or replace it.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-calcium-plaque-in-your-heart-arteries/,8 Ways To Stop Calcium Plaque In Your Heart Arteries,0,"Welcome to our video on the 8 Ways To Stop Calcium Plaque In Your Heart Arteries. The blood vessels that wrap around the outside of your heart, covering it like a crown, are called coronary arteries. They deliver a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients to your heart muscle so it can pump blood effectively to the rest of your body. Excess calcium commonly builds up in the coronary arteries as you age. Coronary calcification is widespread; calcium deposits are found in 67% of women and 90% of men over 70. Contrary to popular belief, coronary artery disease (CAD) is not a result of consuming saturated animal fats or dietary cholesterol. Instead, coronary calcification, the root of CAD, is a symptom of inflammation and repair in your arteries. Calcium, the most abundant mineral in your body, usually resides within your teeth and bones. However, calcium can start depositing elsewhere as you age, including in your arteries. Calcification starts early in the development of atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease that causes your arteries to harden and narrow. Over time, as calcium accumulates in the fatty deposits called plaque, reduced blood flow may cause chest pain or tightness (angina), shortness of breath, and extreme fatigue. However, more often than not, calcification goes undetected and has no symptoms until a blood clot cuts off the blood flow entirely and causes a heart attack or stroke. Now, calcification is not random; it is found in all patients with documented CAD. The good news is you can rewrite your heart’s story by addressing the inflammation in your body. Here are eight ways to reverse coronary calcification, backed by the synergy of modern science and timeless wisdom. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider about any changes to your health regimen. So, we start with Number 8. “Avoid Inflammatory Foods.” Say goodbye to inflammation-inducing foods in your diet. These offenders, including vegetable oils, trans fats, refined sugars, GMOs, and gluten, can cause a low-grade inflammatory response in your body, contributing to coronary calcification. Instead, focus on anti-inflammatory, heart-healthy foods that can help combat inflammation. Consume whole foods rich in vitamin K2, magnesium, and vitamin D. This powerful trio can help counteract nutritional deficiencies linked to coronary calcification. Picture a plate filled with vibrant, organic leafy greens, nutritious nuts from nature, and wild-caught fish from the ocean’s depths. Remember to include grass-fed and pasture-raised meats; they are nutrient-dense sources of these vitamins. Click the link below to get your FREE anti-inflammatory diet plan. Next, we have Number 7. “Practise Fasting.” When you eat food, your body breaks it down into fuel that provides energy for essential organs like your brain, heart, lungs, and liver. During fasting, your body looks for alternative energy sources, leading to ketosis. In ketosis, your body uses ketones from fat as its primary fuel source instead of glucose from carbohydrates. Fasting and ketogenic diets help reduce oxidation, inflammation, and insulin resistance, three factors that contribute to artery calcification. As you fast, your fat stores decrease, and your body may slowly and naturally break down coronary plaque for fuel. Fasting can also increase apoptosis and autophagy, which help clear damaged cells and plaques in arteries. Some fasting protocols that may help prevent coronary calcification include intermittent fasting, alternate-day fasting, 24-hour fasting, and 72-hour fasting periods. Consider consulting a healthcare professional before starting any extended fasting regimen. Moving on, we have Number 6. “Get Regular Exercise.” Staying active is essential for a healthy heart, but it’s all about finding the right balance. Moderate exercise can help slow down the hardening of heart arteries, but very high-intensity workouts may speed it up. Don’t let this discourage you from being active, though. Studies reveal a sedentary lifestyle promotes heart artery hardening by lowering body metabolism and increasing inflammation. For most individuals, the cardiovascular benefits of exercise far outweigh any potential risks. Whether you take a leisurely walk in the park or a lively dance class, every move you make is a step towards a healthier heart. Next, at Number 5, we have “Get Enough Sunlight.” Did you know that soaking up the sun’s rays could benefit your heart? Turns out, sunlight does way more than feel nice your skin. It helps your body make optimal vitamin D crucial for preventing coronary calcification. Vitamin D keeps inflammation in check. Not getting enough can cause inflammation to spiral out of control and speed up calcification. Despite its importance, an estimated 42% of people in the US struggle with vitamin D deficiency, mainly due to spending too much time cooped up indoors and slathering on sunscreen when outside. Besides helping with vitamin D production, sunlight also stimulates the creation of nitric oxide, a compound that widens blood vessels. When the body has enough nitric oxide, blood flows freely and quickly, thus preventing calcification. Diabetes and insulin resistance can cause clogged arteries by blocking nitric oxide production. You can increase nitric oxide by spending more time in the sun. Coming up next is Number 4. “Reduce Toxins.” We are constantly exposed to harmful substances such as air pollution, pesticides, mold, heavy metals, and chemicals in everyday products. These toxins can disrupt your body’s balance and contribute to coronary calcification. Choose organic food and avoid items susceptible to mold mycotoxins. Replace chemical-heavy cleaners and beauty products with natural alternatives. By making these changes, you can reduce exposure to harmful substances and support your body’s natural detoxification processes, ultimately promoting better heart health. In the top 3, we have Number 3. “Reduce Stress.” When stress invades your life, it triggers a series of biological changes, such as increased blood pressure and a fight-or-flight response, which leads to a surge in hormones like cortisol. Chronic stress leads to inflammation, a significant contributor to calcification. Studies show that reducing stress can help stop or slow the progression of coronary artery calcification by lowering cortisol levels and blood pressure. Moving on next, Number 2 is “Sleep More.” Getting enough quality sleep is critical for heart health. Multiple studies have found strong links between insufficient sleep and increased risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, and other cardiovascular problems. A 2008 study from the University of Chicago found that people who slept less than 5 hours per night were over twice as likely to develop coronary artery calcification over five years compared to those sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night. The researchers concluded that getting just one extra hour of sleep per night could significantly reduce heart disease risk, with benefits comparable to a significant drop in blood pressure. And at Number 1, we have “Supplement As Needed.” Due to depleted soils and chemical agriculture, it’s increasingly more difficult to obtain all the essential nutrients your body needs from food alone. Here are six essential nutrients that combat calcification and CAD, along with their food options. Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Statins do not prevent coronary calcification, but eating seafood does. A recent study showed that omega-3 fatty acids from seafood help to prevent coronary calcification and plaque progression. According to this study, a high omega-3 index predicts a low heart attack risk in people with coronary calcification. Wild-caught fatty fish top the list of omega-3 foods you can eat. They are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that support the heart by decreasing inflammation, lowering triglycerides, preventing blood clots, and maintaining healthy blood pressure. The best seafood choices for Omega-3s are salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, anchovies, oysters, and mussels. If you plan to supplement, take a look at the high-quality fish oil below. Vitamin K2. Clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that vitamin K2, especially in the form of MK-7, can help slow down the development and progression of coronary artery calcification. Vitamin K2 activates a protein called MGP, which prevents calcium buildup in blood vessel walls and pushes the calcium to your bones where needed! Fermented foods reign supreme when it comes to vitamin K2. Bacteria produce it during fermentation, so foods like natto (fermented soybeans), sauerkraut, kefir, and cheeses like gouda, brie, and cheddar pack a punch when it comes to K2. Two other excellent choices are grass-fed butter and pastured egg yolks. When choosing a supplement, opt for the MK-7 form of K2, as it stays in your bloodstream longer, providing more benefits to your heart health. CoQ10 CoQ10 does two critical things. It sparks energy production in your body’s cells, including your heart. Plus, it scavenges and destroys free radicals that cause cardiovascular problems and heart disease. Fueling your body with CoQ10 is one of the most important things you can do for your heart. CoQ10 is an antioxidant. It helps prevent artery calcification by reducing the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. It also regenerates nitric oxide to improve blood flow. The bioavailable form of CoQ10 is Ubiquinol, which provides eight times more absorption and works better for people over 45. For a supplement that combines ubiquinol with vitamin K2, see the link below. Vitamin D. Vitamin D helps increase the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines. There are a few decent food sources of vitamin D: fatty fish, cod liver oil, pastured egg yolks, mushrooms exposed to UV light, beef liver, and fortified foods. When supplementing, take vitamin D3 with vitamin K2. Multiple studies have shown that taking MK-7 plus vitamin D over six months to 2 years slows artery calcification more than vitamin D alone. B Vitamins. Homocysteine is a double-edged amino acid that plays a crucial role in building proteins but can be harmful when levels become too high. Eating protein-rich foods like meats, seafood, dairy, eggs, sesame seeds, and Brazil nuts converts the amino acid methionine to homocysteine. B vitamins, specifically B12, B6, and B9 or folate, help regulate homocysteine levels by breaking it down into other beneficial substances, leaving only a trace in the bloodstream. High homocysteine levels can cause significant damage to arterial walls. It can also trigger excessive clotting, obstructing blood flow to critical body areas and potentially leading to heart attacks, accelerated dementia, and strokes. To consume all three, B12, B6, and folate, in foods, choose beef liver, salmon, pastured eggs, grass-fed milk and yogurt, fortified cereals, lentils, spinach, asparagus, and avocado. When supplementing, choose a liposomal B complex for better absorption. Magnesium. Magnesium is vital in various bodily functions, including muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation, and bone health. Up to 80% of adults are not getting enough magnesium because it’s depleted in the soil. This can be serious, because your heart cannot function properly without adequate magnesium. Magnesium prevents muscle spasms of the heart arteries, which increases the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack. Together with vitamins K2 and D3, magnesium stops calcium from forming inside the plaque. Higher magnesium intake has been associated with reduced markers of calcium plaque in the arteries. There are many forms of magnesium. Get 7 types of magnesium in one supplement at the link below. There you have it! Eight ways to stop calcium plaque in your heart and arteries.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms/,Top 15 Magnesium Deficiency Symptoms (Boost Magnesium),0,"Do you get muscle cramps, restless legs, or toss and turn in your bed at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep? If you answered Yes, this could be because your body is deficient in magnesium. Magnesium is a mineral your body desperately needs, yet rarely gets nearly enough. It is estimated that up to 80% of the U.S. population is deficient in magnesium. And since magnesium is critical for the electrical stability of every cell in the body, a lack of it disrupts bodily processes, and can cause you to struggle with issues like sleep, energy, metabolism, stress, and pain. If magnesium deficiency continues, your risk for heart disease, stroke, osteo-porosis, diabetes, depression, arthritis, and asthma increases. In today’s video, we’re going to talk about the top 15 signs your body needs more magnesium, so you can take immediate steps to remedy it. Which are magnesium-rich foods can you add to your diet? What are some guidelines for magnesium supplementation? And what causes magnesium deficiency? We’ll talk about these and more in this video. What are the foods high in magnesium you can add to your diet? What are some guidelines for magnesium supplementation? And what causes magnesium deficiency? We’ll talk about these and more in this video. Make sure you watch till the end, cause there may be a few things you did not know! As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors. First, why is this mineral and electrolyte important? Magnesium is a co-factor in more than 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, including DNA and protein synthesis, cellular energy production, nerve signal transmission, bone metabolism, cardiac function, conduction of signals between muscles and nerves, blood pressure, glucose and insulin metabolism, and immune response. So, how much magnesium should be consumed? The recommended dietary allowance is 400 milligrams for adults per day. The medical name for magnesium deficiency is hypomagnesemia. This is defined as having lower than 1.8 milligrams per decilitre of serum magnesium. Next, how can you tell if your body is deficient in magnesium? Signs of magnesium deficiency can manifest in these ways. Number 15. Increased Blood Pressure. Studies indicate that magnesium deficiency may cause or contribute to high blood pressure. Number 14. Troubled Sleep or Insomnia. Magnesium regulates the neurotransmitter GABA, and the hormone melatonin, to calm down nerve activity and guide the sleep-wake cycle. A lack in this mineral can cause interrupted sleep and insomnia. Number 13. Stress and Anxiety. Low levels of this mineral in the brain can result in neuronal excitations, and thereby cause or increase anxiety. As stress continues, magnesium leaves the body more quickly in urine, which induces even more stress and anxiety. Number 12. Increased Glucose Intolerance. Magnesium helps in blood sugar metabolism, and a deficiency causes higher than normal blood glucose levels. This is important for individuals with type 2 diabetes, because low magnesium increases insulin resistance, which in turn decreases magnesium levels, and could end up in a vicious cycle. Number 11. Muscle Spasms. Magnesium helps facilitate nerve connectivity, and a deficiency causes sudden muscle jerks, eye twitches, persistent blinking, and numbness and tingling in limbs, because of distorted nerve connections. Number 10. Irregular Heartbeat. A lack of magnesium can cause palpitations and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), which increase the risks of blood clots and heart failure. Number 9. Weakness and Constant Tiredness. A lack of magnesium disrupts protein synthesis, muscle and nerve functions, and blood pressure, which are necessary to produce energy. Number 8. Weak or Brittle Bones. Since 60% of the body’s magnesium is stored in bone, a deficiency can negatively impact bone strength and density, leaving them more prone to osteo-porosis, especially for people who are already high-risk, like postmenopausal women. Magnesium is essential for healthy bone structure, along with the other co-factors vitamin D, vitamin K2, calcium and zinc. Number 7. Gastrointestinal Issues. Magnesium deficiency can disrupt the gastrointestinal tract, causing poor digestion, constipation, acid reflux, nausea and vomiting, and a loss of appetite. Number 6. Dry and Dull Skin. A lack in magnesium may make it difficult to manage eczema and poor skin conditions because of fluctuating hormones and decreased fatty acids. Number 5. Migraine Headache. People who are prone to migraines have low levels of serum and tissue magnesium, which could lead to their frequent headaches. Number 4. Hearing Problems. A deficiency in magnesium increases the susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Number 3. Breathing Difficulties. Magnesium deficiency may cause the buildup of calcium in muscles lining airways, making it difficult to breathe. Number 2. Intense PMS Symptoms. Many women find their premenstrual symptoms are more intense when they lack magnesium. Number 1. Irritability, Confusion, and Depression. Long periods of magnesium deficiency often lead to irritability, confusion, poor memory, and symptoms of depression. Next, what happens to your body when you boost magnesium to optimal levels? Getting enough magnesium through food and supplements has been shown to. help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. ease night time leg cramps and restless legs. relieve joint, muscle, and nerve pain (neuropathy). keep your muscles and joints limber and flexible. lower the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline. increase the happiness hormone serotonin, and reduce symptoms of depression. boost energy and exercise performance. improve digestion and bowel movement. increase insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels. decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure. reduce symptoms of migraines. alleviate symptoms in women with PMS. increase bone mineral density. reduce symptoms of asthma. decrease symptoms of tinnitus. Next, which are the magnesium-rich foods you can add to your diet? Here are 15 good ones. Dark Chocolate with at least 75% cocoa. 2. Avocados or Guacamole. 3. Nuts like cashews, Brazil nuts, and almonds. 4. Legumes like lentils, black beans, chickpeas, and soybeans. 5. Tofu or bean curd. 6. Seeds like pumpkin, flax, and chia seeds. 7. Whole grains like oats and barley, and pseudocereals like buckwheat and quinoa. 8. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and halibut. 9. Bananas. 10. Leafy greens like spinach, kale, collards, turnips, and mustard greens. 11. Tamarind. 12. Okra. 13. Oysters. 14. Baked Potatoes with the Skin. 15. Raisins. Next, if you plan to supplement with magnesium, here are 7 tips. The standard dose is 200 to 400 milligrams. A magnesium deficiency can be treated by any form of magnesium, except magnesium L-threonate, since it contains less magnesium per dose. Magnesium oxide or magnesium chloride have lower absorption rates, so they are more likely to cause side effects such as diarrhea and bloating. In general, magnesium citrate is a good choice for supplementation, due to its high water solubility and low cost. For cognitive enhancement, magnesium L-threonate can be used. Magnesium should be taken daily, along with food. If you plan to superload magnesium to attenuate a deficiency, consider magnesium diglycinate or magnesium gluconate, as these may have higher bio-availability.

Recommended magnesium supplement Make sure to consult your doctor if you plan to supplement along with your medications. Next, you may be wondering: what causes magnesium deficiency? Industrialized agriculture has long depleted the soil of nutrients, and the fruits, vegetables, and grains grown on them are deficient in minerals. At the same time, the processed foods we do eat further deplete magnesium. While we absorb less magnesium as we age, certain medical conditions, like diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and medications, like diuretics and proton-pump inhibitors, contribute to poor absorption. Other factors that cause magnesium to leave the body include: Excessive sweating, high alcohol consumption, diabetes, chronic diarrhea, Crohn’s disease, and kidney issues. Lastly, how do you test for magnesium deficiency? A blood test. However, do know that less than 1% of magnesium travels through our bloodstream as it’s stored in bones and tissues. To test at the cellular level, a hair mineral analysis is required. If you enjoyed this video, Like, Share, and Subscribe, and Click on the bell icon, so you never miss a video! And now over to you!

https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20230818/cm/cdc-tracking-new-covid-strain,CDC Tracking New COVID Strain,1,"Aug. 18, 2023 – The CDC is tracking a newly discovered strain of COVID-19 called BA.2.86. On Thursday, the agency posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the lineage has been detected in the United States, Denmark, and Israel. “As we learn more about BA.2.86, CDC’s advice on protecting yourself from COVID-19 remains the same,"" the CDC said on X. A case of BA.2.86 was detected at a laboratory at the University of Michigan, CBS News reported. It's not clear how the university obtained the sample that was sequenced. A case was also detected in the United Kingdom, the news outlet said. The World Health Organization is also tracking BA.2.86 and has classified it as a ""variant under monitoring."" “More data are needed to understand this #COVID19 variant and the extent of its spread, but the number of mutations warrants attention. WHO will update countries and the public as we learn more,” the WHO said on X. The strain is so new that scientists don’t know if BA.2.86 is more easily spread, causes more severe symptoms than existing strains, or will be more resistant to vaccines and natural immunity developed over the last few years. Early research indicates BA.2.86 ""will have equal or greater escape than XBB.1.5 from antibodies elicited by pre-Omicron and first-generation Omicron variants,"" Jesse Bloom, PhD, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said in a slide deck published Thursday. (XBB.1.5 is the Omicron subvariant that is targeted in the updated COVID booster shot to be released soon.) Still, Bloom noted that “even if a highly mutated new variant like BA.2.86 starts to spread, we will be in a far better place than we were in 2020 and 2021, since most people have some immunity to SARS-CoV-2 now.”",7,-0.4063553,-0.13260658

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/chronic-loneliness-linked-to-higher-risk-of-stroke,Chronic loneliness linked to higher risk of stroke,1,"People who feel persistently lonely may be more prone to experiencing a stroke, according to a study published June 24, 2024, in eClinicalMedicine. The study included more than 12,000 adults ages 50 and older who had never had a stroke. All completed a 20-item test designed to measure loneliness and social isolation. Four years later, the nearly 9,000 people remaining in the study repeated the test; researchers then tracked them for six to eight more years. People with high loneliness scores only during the initial assessment had a 25% higher risk of stroke than those not considered lonely. But those who were lonely during both assessments had a 56% higher risk of stroke than those with consistently low loneliness scores, even after researchers accounted for a range of other risk factors. In addition to classic risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure and smoking, these included measures of social isolation and symptoms of depression, which are related to but distinct from loneliness.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy,Is extra-virgin olive oil extra healthy?,1,"Q. I know olive oil is part of a heart-healthy diet, but is extra-virgin olive oil healthier than regular olive oil? A. Many studies continue to confirm the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which cuts the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet's nutritional benefits probably come from various sources, but the generous use of olive oil appears to be a key contributor. Regardless of the type, olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, containing about 75% by volume. When substituted for saturated fat, monounsaturated fats help lower your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. The health benefits of olive oil have been attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, observational studies have shown a link between lower risks of cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and even dementia in people who consume higher amounts of olive oil than those who use little or none. Still, extra-virgin olive oil does offer something extra that regular olive oil does not. Extra-virgin olive oil is pressed mechanically from ripe olives and processed without high heat or chemical solvents. This protects chemicals in the oil called phenols. In contrast, regular, highly processed olive oils lose these chemicals. Small laboratory-based experiments suggest that higher concentrations of phenols may provide extra antioxidant effects. Even so, there are no definitive studies that show extra-virgin olive oil has a greater ability than refined oil to prevent heart problems, cancer or other diseases. Keep in mind that olive oil is not the sole healthy ingredient in a Mediterranean diet. Think of it as just one aspect of the Mediterranean style of eating, which includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts; whole grains; and limited amounts of red meat.
