The Wall serves as a kind of fulcrum, a hinge for dating in the modern world, the Manosphere types tell us. Before the Wall, women are wanton and carefree, dispensing their love to the most chosen men, in a kind of selective breeding every bit as rigorously eugenic as in Plato’s Republic, even if it produces no offspring.
Pre-Wall women engage exclusively in “hypergamy,” to use the correct Manosphere lingo—they choose only the very best mates, the Chads and Gigachads, the Alpha and Sigma males, and leave the rest.
And so a very small number of the most attractive men end up having all the sex, with the aid of dating apps like Tinder, while the rest don’t even get crumbs from the table, so to speak.
But then, suddenly—the Wall appears in her path.
Splat!
Now our formerly attractive formerly young woman, souring like (pasteurised) milk as she passes 30, must adopt a new strategy as she fights for survival. Pushed out of the dating market, she settles down with the kind of man—affable, non-threatening but financially secure—she wouldn’t have looked at twice in her glory days, before her dwindling eggs disappear altogether.
Many women fail, of course, and face a terrible, lonely fate: the life of the childless cat lady.
I felt a little bit grubby just writing all that, I won’t lie. It’s horribly cynical, and the kind of men who give themselves over to believing such theories usually end up making themselves even less attractive to the opposite sex than they were before, which is quite the achievement really.
The Manosphere worldview, at its worst, just makes already bitter men yet more lemonish, even if there are obvious shades of truth to the ideas behind it.
One obvious shade of truth is that women’s reproductive capabilities do decline naturally as they age. This is indisputable. And it’s also indisputable that women’s reproductive capabilities decline differently from men’s.
But now there’s new evidence to suggest that natural decline in women’s fertility is changing. It’s changing in ways that should worry us deeply.
More than 50% of American women aged 30-35 are now experiencing early symptoms of the menopause, according to a new study. This isn’t normal, and it’s not funny either. In fact, it’s part of a broader decline in fertility that has the potential to make reproduction all-but impossible for the human race.
First, a bit of basic science: the menopause, sometimes referred to as “the climacteric,” is when adult women stop having periods for good. It typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55; the average age in the US a decade ago was 51. It’s a natural change and marks the end of a woman’s ability to conceive.
A new survey, commissioned by researchers from Flo Health and the University of Virginia, looked at around 4,500 women, and found that half of all women in the 30-35 age bracket reported experiencing symptoms of early menopause or “perimenopause,” to give the condition its technical name. Over 55% of 30-35 year olds reported “moderate to severe” symptoms, increasing to 64.3% in women between the ages of 36 and 40.
The strength of perimenopause symptoms can vary, but the main change is extended durations without periods. In “early” perimenopause, women occasionally miss their period or cycle irregularly, whereas in “late” perimenopause, they may go for much longer—from between 60 days to a full year or more—without a period.
Other symptoms associated with perimenopause include: hot flashes; vaginal dryness; pain during sexual intercourse; recent cycle length irregularity; heart palpitations; frequent urination.
So what’s causing this? Why is this happening?
Although the survey doesn’t discuss the causes of its findings, other studies have linked early menopause to exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, a pervasive class of chemicals that are found in everything from personal-care products to food packaging.
A study from 2012 showed a clear link between levels of exposure to endocrine disruptors and age of menopause onset.
“The researchers looked at the levels of numerous EDCs [endocrine-disrupting chemicals] in the blood or urine of 5,700 women through a secondary analysis of the US National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Those with the highest amounts of phthalates and PCBs [two very common types of endocrine-disrupting chemical] went through menopause an average of 2.5 years before the others.”
There have been a wide range of studies showing associations between particular chemicals, like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and early menopause, as well as studies that demonstrate the mechanisms by which such chemicals are likely to disturb the menstrual cycle.
For example, one study showed a clear link between levels of PFOA (a PFAS chemical) and cycle length. Women with the highest levels of PFOA exposure had significantly higher odds for longer cycles than women with the lowest levels.
Studies have also shown that endocrine-disruptors can disrupt the function of ovarian follicles, which are involved in the production of the hormones that govern menstruation.
Endocrine disruptors are a serious problem for both sexes. This is why I say “the end of men is the end of women,” borrowing the title of the 2022 Tucker Carlson documentary I starred in alongside Robert F. Kennedy Jr. That documentary focused mainly on men’s health and falling testosterone levels and sperm counts as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals like PFAS. But everything I said there about endocrine disruptors and their dreadful effects on male health is true for women too.
There’s been a lot of focus in recent years on a potential “spermageddon” scenario, in which sperm counts continue to fall on their current trajectory and within decades it becomes impossible for reproduction to occur by natural means. Such a scenario grabs headlines for obvious reasons. But the decline in women’s reproductive health is no less stunning or grave.
Thankfully, someone who understands these declines in fertility—their causes and solutions, the fact they’re interlinked and inseparable—is now in charge of the Department of Human Health and Services. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, after years of campaigning to clean up the environment and reduce Americans’ exposure to toxic chemicals, now has the ability to do those things and the mandate, as part of his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. He faces an uphill battle against entrenched interests that have countless billions of dollars staked on the continuing ill health of Americans, but the price of failure will be far, far greater than that.
While we’re on the subject of fertility, I’d like to draw your attention to an important upcoming event in Austin, Texas. On 28-29 March, the second Natal Conference will take place, featuring a whole host of experts, including myself, all of whom will be addressing the nature of the current reproductive crisis and, just as importantly, what we can do about it in order to ensure a future for our nation and the human race.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/post-vaccination-syndrome-new-paper-identifies-lingering-covid-19-vaxx-effects,“Post-Vaccination Syndrome:” New Paper Identifies Lingering COVID-19 Vaxx Effects,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 days ago,"A new condition called “post-vaccination syndrome” has been acknowledged by Yale scientists investigating the long-term after-effects of COVID-19 vaccination.
The condition is characterised by a variety of troubling symptoms including brain fog, insomnia, tinnitus and heart palpitations, and resembles the condition dubbed “long COVID.”
The symptoms typically develop a day or two after vaccination and can persist for months or even years, worsening over time.
“It’s clear that some individuals are experiencing significant challenges after vaccination. Our responsibility as scientists and clinicians is to listen to their experiences, rigorously investigate the underlying causes, and seek ways to help,” said co-senior author Harlan Krumholz.
The researchers looked at blood samples from 42 patients who experienced symptoms of post-vaccination syndrome and from 22 who did not.
Those with the syndrome were found to have lower levels of true crucial white blood-cell types. They also had lower levels of antibodies against the COVID-19 spike protein, and in some cases higher levels of the spike protein itself.
“We don’t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with PVS [post-vaccination syndrome] who didn’t have any measurable spike protein—but it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome,” said co-senior study author Akiko Iwasaki.
The researchers believe further studies are needed to confirm the study’s findings.
“This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Iwasaki added.
“But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.”",0

The menopause, often referred to as the climacteric, is when women cease menstruating and become infertile. In the US, the average age of menopause is around 50 years old.
A new survey, commissioned by researchers from Flo Health and the University of Virginia, looked at around 4,500 women, and found that half of all women in the 30-35 age bracket reported experiencing symptoms of early menopause or “perimenopause,” to give the condition its technical name. Over 55% of 30-35 year olds reported “moderate to severe” symptoms, increasing to 64.3% in women between the ages of 36 and 40.
“Physical and emotional symptoms associated with perimenopause are understudied and often dismissed by physicians. This research is important in order to more fully understand how common these symptoms are, their impact on women, and to raise awareness amongst physicians as well as the general public,” says study co-author Dr. Jennifer Payne.
The strength of perimenopause symptoms can vary, but the main change is extended durations without periods. In “early” perimenopause, women occasionally miss their period or cycle irregularly, whereas in “late” perimenopause, they may go for much longer—from between 60 days to a full year or more—without a period.

According to a new study out of China, lung tissue from birds contains hundreds of particles of commonly used forms of plastic like polyethylene.
“Birds serve as important indicators of environmental conditions,” said one of the study’s authors.
“They help us understand the state of the environment and make informed decisions about conservation and pollution control.”
The Chinese scientists studied over 50 different species of wild bird in western China.
They took samples of lung tissue from the birds and tested it using infrared technology to detect and count microplastics. Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass-spectrometry was also used to identify smaller nanoplastics, which can enter the lungs through the bloodstream.
Hundreds of microplastics were found in the bird lungs, with an average of 221 particles per species and 416 particles per gram of lung tissue. The most common types identified were chlorinated polyethylene, used for insulating pipes and wires, and butadiene rubber, a synthetic material in tires.
There are currently no “safe” established levels of exposure to microplastics and nanoplastics.
More than nine billion tons of plastic are estimated to have been produced between 1950 and 2017, with over half of that total having been produced since 2004. The vast majority of plastic ends up in the environment in one form or another, where it breaks down, through weathering, exposure to UV light and organisms of all kinds, into smaller and smaller pieces—microplastics and then even smaller nanoplastics. These are called “secondary” microplastics, because they become small, but there’s also a whole class of “primary” microplastics which are small by design, like so-called “microbeads” used in cosmetics.
Within our homes, microplastics are mainly produced when synthetic fibres from clothes, furnishings and carpets are shed. They accumulate in large quantities in dust and float around in the air, which we then inhale.
New studies are appearing at a steady pace, linking microplastic exposure to virtually every chronic disease, from irritable bowel syndrome, obesity and autism, to cancer, Alzheimer’s and infertility.
Microplastic exposure has been linked to a terrifying decline in male fertility—a so-called “spermageddon” scenario—where within the next quarter century, it could be impossible for the human race to reproduce by natural means, because men produce so few sperm.

The study, published in the World Journal of Cardiology, revealed mRNA from the injections “travels within lipid nanoparticles to all organ systems, including the heart. Once it’s in there, your cardiomyocytes start to produce spike protein. This spike protein is found circulating in the bloodstream which can also reach the heart.”
Hulscher told Dr. Drew there has been a 600% increase in myocarditis after mRNA injections “based on the largest COVID-19 vaccine safety study ever conducted.”
The show host pointed out the cardiac arrests being witnessed since the rollout of the jabs are increasingly found in young people who previously almost never suffered these events.
“Right, it’s not supposed to be seen in young healthy adults as we’ve seen since 2021, since these cardiotoxic injections rolled out,” the epidemiologist responded.
The alarming update is not surprising to Infowarriors who have been warned about the dangers of the experimental shots since they were first introduced.",0

“A person may not add fluoride to water in, or water that will be introduced into, a public water system,” the bill awaiting a signature from Gov. Spencer Cox (R) states, adding that “A political subdivision may not enact or enforce an ordinance that requires or permits the addition of fluoride to water in, or water that will be introduced into, a public water system.”
The CBS segment focused on a nine-year-old girl named Whitley who suffers from a rare form of epilepsy.
Due to her brain disorder, the child must undergo general anesthesia to receive basic dental care.
Whitley’s mother Kat Smith told the outlet she fears removing fluoride will result in the child getting “more cavities” and having to be sedated at the dentist’s office.
The potential cavity-blocking properties of fluoride do not outweigh the negative effects of the toxic chemical, which have been linked to a lowered IQ and brain-damaged babies among other health issues.
More states will likely follow Utah’s lead in making drinking water safe for all citizens by removing harmful substances.
Under the Donald Trump administration, it’s possible the federal government takes action as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been vocal about fluoride being a “poison.”
Infowars and Alex Jones have been warning about the dangers of fluoride for decades:",0

Kennedy lauded American fast-food chain Steak ‘n Shake for its commitment to switch from seed-based frying oils to beef tallow.
The chain on Monday announced it had switched over to “tallow fries” at stores in Ohio, Colorado, Florida, Texas and Oklahoma, adding that by March 1 fries at all locations would be “RFK’d.”
“Congratulations @SteaknShake for being the first national fast-food chain to begin the transition away from seed oils,” Kennedy wrote Thursday responding to the news.
Congratulations @SteaknShake for being the first national fast-food chain to begin the transition away from seed oils. Thanks for leadership in the crusade to Make America Healthy Again. https://t.co/eEqF6No1bc
“Thanks for leadership in the crusade to Make America Healthy Again,” he added.
Thank you Secretary Kennedy! https://t.co/qdCiJy1ofV
Meanwhile, Children’s Health Defense, the health-conscious non-profit formerly headed by Kennedy, weighed in asking the restaurant to also consider revamping other items on their menu.
It's a start, but there are many ingredients that need an overhaul on your menu to make them healthy for our children to consume — whole food ingredients to nourish growing children, not filled with chemicals that cause health issues.
Steak ‘n Shake’s transition from seed oils to tallow comes as Trump’s brief stint working at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania inspired calls for the fast-food giant to bring back beef tallow frying oil.
President Donald Trump’s HHS secretary has previously slammed seed oils for contributing to America’s illness epidemic.

“Seed oils are one of the most unhealthy ingredients that we have in foods,” Kennedy told Fox & Friends last year, ahead of the election. “And seed oils, the reason they’re in the foods is because they’re heavily subsidized. They’re very, very cheap, but they are associated with all kinds of very, very serious illnesses, including body-wide inflammation, which affects all of our health.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/vaxxed-buffy-star-michelle-trachtenberg-dies-suddenly-at-39,Vaxxed ‘Buffy’ Star Michelle Trachtenberg Dies Suddenly at 39,By Adan Salazar,6 days ago,"Hollywood actress Michelle Trachtenberg, who starred alongside Sarah Michelle Gellar in the popular Buffy The Vampire Slayer series, died Wednesday at the age of 39.
“Trachtenberg was found by her mother around 8 a.m. Wednesday at One Columbus Place, a 51-story luxury apartment complex in Manhattan’s Central Park South neighborhood,” reported the New York Post citing sources.
The Post notes the Gossip Girl actress had undergone “a liver transplant within the last year, but her body may have rejected the organ, according to sources, who said she died of natural causes.”
“The NYPD confirmed Trachtenberg was found ‘unconscious and unresponsive’ by police and pronounced dead by EMS workers. They responded to the building after a 911 call reporting a woman experiencing cardiac arrest,” The Post added, noting police did not suspect foul play.
Instagram photos showed the former child star appearing frail and gaunt, with sources telling People she was “struggling” with health issues.
Many on social media pointed out the Eurotrip actress had previously promoted face masks and the Covid-19 vaccine, prompting many to speculate the jab may have somehow possibly contributed to her death.
“Get vaccinated. Wear a f*cking mask. Stay safe,” Trachtenberg wrote in an Aug. 2021 post.
“This is how I look down at people who don’t want to get the vaccine. The virus is real,” she wrote in another post.
Whether the vaccine played a role in Trachtenberg’s untimely passing remains unclear, but a 2022 research study documented cases of rejection in 56 transplanted solid organs following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, or Sinovac.
“Organ rejection post-COVID-19 vaccination with all vaccines used to prevent COVID-19 or following COVID-19 infection with all variants of concerns is rare but can occur,” researchers wrote, adding the study shouldn’t necessarily discourage Covid jab vaccination.",0

RFK Jr. HALTS Multi-Million Dollar Biden-Era COVID-19 Vax Project,By Jamie White,6 days ago,"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has paused a multi-million dollar contract from the Biden administration to develop a new COVID-19 vaccine.
Kennedy issued a 90-day stop-work order on Friday related to the HHS contract with American biotech company Vaxart Inc., which is working to develop a new oral COVID-19 vaccine.
The pause comes as 10,000 individuals were slated to begin clinical trials on Monday.
“While it is crucial that the Department [of] Health and Human Services (HHS) support pandemic preparedness, four years of the Biden administration’s failed oversight have made it necessary to review agreements for vaccine production, including Vaxart’s,” Kennedy told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.
“I look forward to working with Vaxart and medical experts to ensure this work produces safe, effective, and fiscal-minded vaccine technology.”
The trial is only paused — not terminated — and Kennedy and other health officials will examine the study’s initial findings over the next 90 days before making a determination on what comes next.
The contract to create a new COVID vaccine was part of the Biden administration’s $4.7 billion NextGen initiative launched in 2023.
From Fox News:
The Vaxart vaccine was specifically funded through an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which is a department within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response under the HHS umbrella.
BARDA obligated roughly $460 million to Vaxart’s development of the new vaccine, with a total of $240 million already authorized for the preliminary study, Fox Digital learned.
A recent modification to the contract would have allowed Vaxart to invoice BARDA for the remaining roughly $230 million for clinical trials, but the stop-work order prevents the biotech company from invoicing BARDA until further notice. Vaxart, however, can still invoice HHS related to medical monitoring of individuals who took part in an initial round of trials, Fox Digital learned.
The move comes just two weeks after RFK Jr. was sworn in as HHS Secretary and President Trump signed an order establishing the Make America Healthy Again Commission, which is led by Kennedy to tackle “the root causes of America’s escalating health crisis.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/utah-set-to-become-first-state-to-ban-fluoride,Utah Set to Become First State to Ban Fluoride,By Adan Salazar,7 days ago,"Utah could soon become the first state to ban fluoride from municipal water supplies if Gov. Spencer Cox (R) signs the bill into law.
H.B. 81 would stop government entities in the Beehive State from fluoridating public water systems.
“A person may not add fluoride to water in, or water that will be introduced into, a public water system,” the bill states, adding that “A political subdivision may not enact or enforce an ordinance that requires or permits the addition of fluoride to water in, or water that will be introduced into, a public water system.”
The bill still allows fluoride treatments to be prescribed by pharmacists.
ABC4.com reports the bill cleared legislative hurdles last week and is now headed for the governor’s desk:
“The bill has made its way through both chambers of Utah’s Legislature. Passing on Friday in a mixed partisan vote of 18-8-3 vote, with members of both parties voting for and against the measure.”
The measure comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously said he would work to remove fluoride from public water supplies, citing the “industrial waste” chemical’s numerous adverse health effects, including “arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease.”
A comprehensive study recently published in JAMA Pediatrics found an inverse correlation between high fluoride exposure and lower childhood IQ levels.
Last month, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson highlighted a proposal to ban fluoride from drinking water, comparing it to the tyrannical medical overreach seen during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“If COVID-19 taught us anything, it is that government has the ability to force health decisions without our consent based on emerging facts,” Simpson wrote. “Public water systems should be about fresh, clean, safe drinking water — not a means for delivering government prescribed medicine without the consent of the consumer.”
It’s unclear whether Gov. Cox will sign the bill, which is then slated to go into effect on May 7.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/donald-trump-was-right-about-autism,Donald Trump Was Right about Autism,By Sinead Murphy | Brownstone Institute,7 days ago,"‘Something’s wrong.’ So said Donald Trump, about the rising prevalence of autism in children. It was in an interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker, on the 17th of December.
It is not an implausible statement. Conservative estimates are that there has been a 1,000-fold increase in diagnoses of autism in children since the turn of the millennium, in the UK and the US at least.
One in 100,000 children with autism to 1 in 100 children with autism. In 25 years.
Yet Trump’s statement is controversial. So much so that the like of it is rarely made.
Welker’s eyes widened when she heard it. Their whites became clearly visible. We associate the look with a kind of madness.
And indeed a kind of madness ensued, as Welker eagerly parrotted the party line: ‘Scientists say they’ve gotten better at identifying it.’
As if autism could go undetected. As if autism must be winkled out. As if autism can ‘mask.’
Every week I bring my little boy to a social club for local young people with intellectual disabilities. Most have autism. Around two dozen are there, ranging in age from 15 to 35 – my son, aged 10, is considerably the youngest.
Every week these young people come together in a church hall, to play life-size Snakes and Ladders or Twister or board games, then to sit at the table for dinner, then for sports led by outreach coaches from the city’s Premier League football club.
John spends the two hours walking alongside the walls of the hall, or from corner to corner. Every now and then, he pauses to snatch someone’s coat from the back of a chair, or a pair of gloves from someone’s bag. He buries his head in these as he walks, taking in their smell. Sometimes John nuzzles a garment you are wearing.
Simon wears a headset with one end behind one of his ears. If there is something playing through the headset it does not stem the tide of Simon’s commentary, which is relentless and without obvious relevance for anyone in the room.
Kate must be watched when the food comes and piles her plate with mountains of mayonnaise and ketchup. She is a compulsive questioner. When did Joseph get his hair cut? What day this week? Why Thursday? What haircut did he get? Why a skin fade? What number on top? What number at the sides? Why 2 on top? Will Joseph ever get his hair cut on Tuesdays?…You have to walk away to help her to stop.
Sam is unable to speak. He expresses himself with spasms of his arms and torso and animalistic noises. With encouragement, he can type a one-word answer on his phone, which transmits to a speaker lying in his bag at the end of the room.
Bill never puts down his phone. He looks at it out of the corner of his eye as he holds it near to his ear, while he eats, while he plays football, as he arrives, as he leaves.
Matt can answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ if you ask him a question, but only if he looks away from you and places a hand over his ear. He sits on the floor by your side and moves whenever you move and shakes with excitement at your sheepskin boots which he sometimes reaches out to touch.
My Joseph is in the middle of it all. He likes to know everyone’s name and is happy that there is life around and people moving and making noise. He is unable to respond to comments made to him. He moves contentedly along the Snakes and Ladders floor mat with no grasp of the purpose of a game, or of winning or losing. He stands still as the handball match is played around him, without any idea of being on a team, playing in one direction, receiving or passing the ball, scoring a goal.
The range of idiosyncrasies in the hall of the social club is like nothing on earth. To be of help there, presupposition and spontaneity must be put on hold.
But there is one thing for sure. No expertise is needed to discern autism in these young people. No scientists required to identify their condition. To the untrained eye and from a distance of 20 yards, their situation is almost instantly apparent.
These young people cannot avoid detection. These young people cannot remain in the shadows. These young people cannot ‘mask.’
Talk of ‘masking’ is now ubiquitous in autism discourse.
I first heard it two years ago from a BBC documentary on autism, in which a woman described the strain of having to ‘mask’ her autism ‘stimming’ when out in the world.
I next heard it at a local meeting that offered support to parents of an autistic child. The other parents there were seeking advice on how to advance their struggle to have the needs of their child recognised in a mainstream school. All without exception had recourse to the term ‘masking’ to explain a certain ambiguity in the presentation of their child’s autism.
The idea of an autism ‘spectrum’ has done much to increase the attribution of autism.
But the idea of autism ‘masking’ is much more dynamic, allowing not just for a range of autism symptoms, severities, and outcomes but also for potential autism, partial autism, hidden autism, emergent autism, retrospective autism.
The concept of autistic ‘masking’ is itself a masking device, obscuring the tragic reality of autism by recasting it as a natural human condition that ebbs and flows through young and old.
‘Masking’ diffuses the autism effect so widely that we have lost our bearings with regard to autism, and have not the clarity required even to say ‘Something’s wrong.’
Talk of ‘masking’ works first and foremost to mask clinical autism – the autism that onsets at the age of 2 or 3 and so dramatically that there is no question of its reality and no hope of its retreat.
‘Masking’ quietens the anger that we ought to feel at the rise of clinical autism by implicitly denying that the condition exists.
If ‘masking’ denotes a strategic modification of behaviour in response to the judgments of other people and the world, it describes precisely what children with clinical autism cannot do.
Those who care for a child with clinical autism in fact expend their energies in trying to train their child to mask, just a little. The project is a lifelong one.
Clinical autism is the inability to mask. To put abroad the idea that autistics mask is to deny its defining symptom.
But really, talk of ‘masking’ denies that autism has any symptoms, insofar as symptoms are manifestations of an adverse condition.
Because talk of ‘masking’ reframes autism as an ‘identity,’ aligning autism with all those other ‘identities’ is the duty of our society to encourage people to ‘come out.’
Our society castigates itself, not for generating and incubating autism, but for failing to ‘include’ ‘auties.’ Rather than look for the cause of the autism in order to solve it, we look for the cause of the masking in order to solve it.
Clinical autism is a profound derangement that consigns its sufferers to unending exclusion from human sympathy and worldly functioning.
The concept of ‘masking’ conceals this sad reality, remaking clinical autism as a problem of societal prejudice.
But the concept of ‘masking’ also masks the growing problem of social autism – the autism that emerges in halting fashion, the autism that is partial, the autism that can pass muster more or less, that struggles for a diagnosis, that is retrospectively recognised.
Social autism is quite different from clinical autism. Whatever the cause of the latter – environmental or pharmaceutical toxins – social autism is caused by the social infrastructure to which our children are submitted.
Alarmingly quickly, the lives of our children have been given over to the depersonalizing and derealizing effects of institutional and digital interfaces.
The consequences of this are now being revealed, as vast numbers of children are emerging, slowly or quickly, wholly or partly, with autism-like propensities and behaviours.
Inability to engage with people, lack of concentration, hyperactivity, equivocality, inflexibility, ennui: these and other symptoms, so characteristic of clinical autism, are being produced in our children by their neglectful relegation to impersonal settings and remote interactions.
The abstract character of curricula and online content, and the rapid exchangeability of one topic or vista for another, further exacerbate in would-be non-autistic children the jaded disaffection and fractious inattention that are the telltale signs of clinical autism.
And ‘masking’ is at the heart of it all – a clean-up concept with which the tragedy of social autism is concealed and the tragedy of clinical autism deepened and further obscured.
The concept of autistic ‘masking’ hides social autism by conflating it with clinical autism – social autism is clinical autism that ‘masks’ more or less.
This obviates the need to look for the cause of social autism, positing social autism as the struggle for free expression of a naturally occurring condition and not as manufactured by the nature of contemporary childhood.
In fact, the concept of autistic ‘masking’ causes us to celebrate the intensification of social autism as liberatory, as a glorious unmasking, a great autie coming out.
The more our socially autistic children come to resemble their clinically autistic peers, the more we congratulate ourselves on our diversity and inclusivity.
Meanwhile, the admission of swathes of socially-damaged children into the autism fold further obscures clinical autism by flooding it with victims of social autism.
And the crisis of clinical autism is exacerbated as it is further concealed, by the submission of clinically autistic children, along with everyone else, to the institutional and digital experiences that, however damaging of children generally, are utterly destructive of children with clinical autism.
The concept of ‘masking’ makes it difficult for us to grasp two separate, though related, assaults on our children, even as it works to excuse and intensify those assaults.
And generations of our children are being lost either to clinical autism or to social autism or – worst of all – to both.
And still talk of ‘masking’ goes on, obscuring not only the autism assault on our children but also a nascent autism assault on us all.
The concept of ‘masking’ is set to mask an unfolding, third autism tragedy, the cultural autism from which we are all now beginning to suffer.
Life in our societies is increasingly an experience of detachment, our human spirit suppressed by the elaborate artifices of corporate invention and state promotion.
Vernacular ways of life have been all but smothered by the low-level virtuosity that is required in metropolitan environments. Familiar human-to-human modes have been replaced by proliferating impersonal routines.
We yearn to ‘switch off’ because we are always ‘on;’ the jobs we work mine more and more of our private lives and the lives we live feel more and more like work – we clock on for a shift with our ASDA ‘family’ and ‘manage’ our children’s weekends.
‘Work-from-home’ is but the fruit of all of this, as we scramble to discern some time and space in which to put aside the ‘soft skills’ that we must reuse and refresh ad nauseam and that make of daily life a wearying repeat performance.
The encroachment of AI is making this performance unbearably rote, stifling what remains of the human impulse.
As we strain to distinguish an iota of humanity in our daily routines, we lurch between hyper-excitement at some leftover human feeling and anxious discontent at its otherwise absence.
Excess of stimulation and agitated disaffection are two indications of clinical autism. Modern metropolitan culture is making autistics of us all.
Then enter the concept of ‘masking,’ so all of that is fine and dandy.
‘Masking’ repackages the cultural autism against which we ought to rail with every fibre of our being, as the experience of an underlying identity.
If we feel that we must put on a face for other people and the world – and in our culture of the managed heart, we feel this all the time – we are encouraged to understand ourselves as ‘masking’ and to identify ourselves as at least somewhat ‘autie.’
And, insofar as we are somewhat ‘autie,’ far from objecting to it, we welcome it. Because it points to a truth, which requires only to be set free – Ahh, now I get it. I’m autistic.
Once again, we are deflected from trying to solve the autism towards trying to solve the masking.
We purchase stress toys on Amazon and search out times and spaces in which we can ‘be ourselves’ with impunity.
We look forward to a world much like Joseph’s social club, a world where we can nuzzle someone’s shirt…
…or give a Nazi salute.
A world where all of that’s okay. Because we’re autistic, you know.
A world of ‘free expression’ without reason or repercussion, a kind of Babel that we can scarcely conceive, with technical solutions running the show while we ‘stim’ our way to oblivion.
In 2019, the University of Montreal published the results of a meta-analysis of trends in the diagnosis of autism. These results showed that, if trends continue, within 10 years there will be no objective means of distinguishing between those in the population who merit the diagnosis of autism and those who do not.
Is the growing phenomenon of cultural autism, allied with the formation of our children as socially and/or clinically autistic, destined to capture us all? While talk of ‘masking’ covers up the crime?
And if so, what then?
At Joseph’s social club, there is at least one volunteer or carer for every young person with autism. Those who like board games sit alongside one another at the table, waiting for someone to play with them.
These young people can play Connect Four. But they can’t play Connect Four with one another. Because they’re autistic, and so require non-autistic scaffolding to enter into purposeful activity.
Who or what will do this scaffolding when autism has affected us all? Who or what will determine the purposes of our lives and direct us to their fulfillment? The prospect is as bleak as a prospect could be.
We need to pull back.
We need to start saying ‘Something’s wrong.’
Something’s wrong with children like Joseph, whose horizons narrow irrevocably between the ages of 2 and 3 and whose lives are thereafter an unrelenting struggle for some modicum of sympathy and significance.
Something’s wrong with a society like ours, which dispatches its young to institutions and devices so that those children who are not already like Joseph are made to be like him.
And something’s wrong with a culture that so saps our human spirit that we are all remade as at least a little autistic, and clamour for the ‘freedom’ to act out or opt out within parameters administered by others and their machines.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/none-of-the-70000-adverse-events-of-puberty-blocking-drugs-were-a-safety-priority-for-bidens-fda,"None of the 70,000 Adverse Events of Puberty Blocking Drugs Were a “Safety Priority” for Biden’s FDA","By David Gortler, Pharm. D | Brownstone Institute",8 days ago,"Back in the early 2000s, the FDA launched the Safety First Steering Committee (SFSC). It was started to address the safety concerns of marketed drugs of noteworthy concern to Americans. Today, the acronym is still found ubiquitously throughout FDA documents, but those links no longer function.
It appears to have been replaced by the Drug Risk Management Board (DRMB). The DRMB has no public-facing web page, but it appears that the DRMB is just a rebranded SFSC.
Per the FDA:
“The DRMB is a cross-CDER governance board responsible for three key objectives: (1) facilitating and coordinating decisions around major product safety issues, (2) providing clear and consistent guidance enabling an appropriate response to major safety issues, and (3) systematically communicating decisions and resulting actions across the Center and to other stakeholders as appropriate. In addition, the DRMB facilitates and coordinates all new and existing marketed product-safety initiatives.”
The Drug Safety Monitoring Board was chaired by Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, the head of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Cavazzoni unexpectedly resigned just hours prior to Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan 20th, 2025. Although neither the DRMB staff nor meeting minutes are made public, the FDA Drug Safety Priority annual reports are. One of the more conspicuous things missing from those reports over the past decade or so is any mention of the widespread off-label promotion of hormone modulators (also referred to as GnRH modulators or puberty blockers) and/or cross-sex hormones in kids, in the name of “gender transition.”
It’s not really a surprise that Cavazzoni – a psychiatrist and former Big Pharma employee for nearly two decades prior to joining the FDA – would turn a blind eye to drug safety based on politics. During her leadership, Cavazzoni enacted questionable political regulatory decisions and advanced other Biden/Harris White House policies including multiple ineffective and dangerous Alzheimer’s disease products, as well as demanding cruel animal testing in place of newer, animal-free methodology.
As the chairwoman of the DRMB, Cavazzoni should objectively determine what is a priority. Cavazzoni determined that tens of thousands of puberty-blocking transgender drug adverse events – including deaths, hospitalizations, and permanent disabilities – simply aren’t a “Drug Risk Monitoring Board” priority.
Over the last two decades, around 70,000 reports of harm from puberty-blocking medications were submitted to the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting Database (AERS). Yet the FDA “Drug Risk Monitoring Board” report never mentioned any of these submissions.
In addition to AERS, published data shows that cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers are correlated with dramatically increased (7-fold) risks of stroke, heart attack, and blood clots along with additional studies also showing serious life-threatening adverse events and other permanent, physiologically devastating consequences.
On a side note, the FDA DRMB seems to ignore Covid mRNA and several other Covid-era treatment safety issues as well.
One would think that any kind of adverse event is something that the FDA would feel obligated to warn American taxpayers about, but for one reason or another, it isn’t.
Puberty blockers are a particularly notable case for a safety discussion, as they are used off-label to block the natural progression biological of puberty in healthy kids and adolescents. Before being used for gender alteration, these drugs were typically prescribed for life-threatening endocrine disorders or cancers in the elderly or older adult populations. A price comparison for one kit (a one-month supply), leuprolide (Lupron) costs anywhere from over $12,000 to over 14,000 every six months with an online coupon. Plus, under the Biden Administration, puberty blockers for transgender therapy would have been covered by the taxpayers:
The administration of synthetic, sex-incongruent hormones and/or so-called puberty blockers are hormones – not at all your everyday drugs. Hormones are especially potent, synthetic versions of signaling compounds made by one’s anterior pituitary (A/K/A the “master gland”). Hormones (natural or synthetic) are therefore seen by the body’s receptors as a particularly forceful command.
On the other end is one’s natural biological and hormonal function. There exist ~100 trillion nucleated cells with an “XX” (female) or “XY” (male) combination denoting either female or male sex, respectively. Hormones released by one’s pituitary foster normal physiological development; sex-incongruent hormones interrupt that biological function. That chaos between one’s healthy biology versus outside chemicals means that all sorts of adverse effects would emerge as one’s physiology gets bewildered.
A highly simplified mechanical analogy would be trying to drive your car across America by alternately/simultaneously pressing the gas and brake pedals, while constantly shifting into random gears. You will get nowhere and destroy the car.
Although the FDA has warned that puberty-blocking-type products can cause life-threatening brain swelling, headaches, vomiting, a host of visual disturbances (including blindness), and/or tumor-like masses in the brain, it has only done so deep within regulatory notifications and publications where it cannot easily be found; it has not made a widespread public notification to pharmacists, physicians, or the American public.
On the other hand, the FDA very prominently and selectively warned about the dangers of off-label use of drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, neither of which have anywhere near the breadth or incidence of safety issues compared to that of transgender pharmacotherapy.
When the FDA chose to speak out against hydroxychloroquine for Covid, it commenced a salvo of social media ads plus multiple dedicated web pages and videos against it. It did so following just 331 adverse event reports over six months – many of which were obvious misuse with wildly incorrect or lacking critically important dosing and/or timing information.
The FDA even advertised its success in warning consumers over the internet, which caused its website to become the number one internet search leading to FDA webpages, and “at the top of trending topics on social media platforms.”
Clearly, the FDA knows exactly how to inform Americans about critical drug safety matters…if it wants to.",0

Kennedy Jr. and the disgraceful Dr. Anthony Fauci.
In a segment of the podcast going viral online, Harrelson said he really hopes Kennedy “is able to do some good things” because “he is certainly a man on a mission and a man who cares deeply.”
The actor called it “heroic” that RFK would speak out about topics “that he didn’t need to talk about, that didn’t help him in any way,” saying, “He just took one arrow after the other.”
“To me, even if he was wrong, which I don’t think he was, then it’s heroic to do that,” Harrelson added.
Rogan chimed in, explaining he bought into the propaganda that Kennedy was an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist until he read his book “The Real Anthony Fauci.”
The podcast host noted RFK would have been sued if the horrifying details in the book were false.
“There is some info in there that just blew my mind,” Harrelson said of the book. “Like the way Fauci was able to get the principal investigators from all these respectable colleges and put them on these committees that ended up saying, ‘Yeah this is the vaccine we’ll use,’ or AZT, he started with the AZT.”
The Kingpin actor continued, “You know, AZT was known to be a highly-toxic really effective drug of course, but that was the one they picked… and I don’t know how many people that killed. That killed friends of mine, you know? AZT was very toxic and they finally had to yank it. Now, they use different chemical cocktails, but Fauci did some extraordinarily evil shit and he knows what he did.”
The pair was referring to Fauci approving the dangerous drug AZT during the 1980s AIDS pandemic, which killed countless Americans.
It’s worth noting Fauci was given a preemptive pardon on Sleepy Joe Biden’s last day in office as the puppet president delivered get out of jail free cards to corrupt Deep State criminals expected to be held accountable by the second Donald Trump administration.",0

Kennedy Jr., posted a video on social media over the weekend calling for transparency regarding the decades of chemical spraying in American skies.
She captioned her post, “Many of us know it’s happening. We’d like more details, please,” along with text reading, “This has to end. At the very least geoengineering should not happen without a referendum with full and accurate disclosures.”
“I went surfing this morning and was watching the planes flying overhead, and then I just couldn’t take it anymore. That is not a contrail,” Shanahan said, pointing to massive lines in the sky. “That looked like it started as a contrail, maybe. Now it’s turning into a cloud. You see how thick that is?”
“This shit has to end. This is ridiculous. It’s like an otherwise perfect day,” she added.
Just days before the social media post, President Trump raised eyebrows during a Friday press conference by saying his administration would investigate rising autism rates and suggesting something being “sprayed” could be a contributing factor.
“Maybe it’s a spray that we spray all over the place that nobody else does, other countries don’t,” Trump said, adding, “The Pennsylvania Dutch, they don’t do anything, and they’re amazingly healthy,” likely referring to vaccines Amish Americans are known to refuse.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/rfk-jr-prepares-to-dismiss-vaccine-advisors,RFK Jr. Prepares To Dismiss Vaccine Advisors,By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is preparing to dismiss a number of vaccine advisors as he begins shaking up the Department of Health and Human Services.
Kennedy plans to remove from advisory committees a number of individuals he believes have conflicts of interest. Kennedy has been explicit in stating that the medical industry has undue influence over regulators and government policy.
“We will remove conflicts of interest from the committees and research partners whenever possible or balance them with other stakeholders,” Kennedy said on Tuesday, in his first detailed remarks to HHS staff.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which has a key role in dictating vaccine policies, is one clear target for Kennedy. On Thursday, the ACIP was postponed indefinitely.
In response, medical professionals sent a joint letter urging Kennedy to preserve the meeting. “Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance,” the letter states.
“Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats… Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.”
Panels that advise the Food and Drug Administration are also being targeted.
At present, it’s unclear who is being targeted or how many people will be dismissed.
RFK Jr. is a long-time critic of vaccination practices, especially in the US; although he has reiterated that he is not against vaccination per se. During the election campaign, he vowed to reassess the childhood vaccination schedule and he also suggested that certain vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines, could be taken off the market.
The CDC has already withdrawn its “Wild to Mild” seasonal campaign for flu vaccination. CDC staff were apparently told on Wednesday that the campaign would be withdrawn.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-vaccine-mrna-crosses-placenta-to-unborn,COVID Vaccine mRNA Crosses Placenta to Unborn,By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"Messenger RNA molecules from the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are able to cross the placental barrier and enter the fetus during pregnancy, according to a new scientific study.
The study, which was conducted on mice, is the first to show that genetic material from an mRNA vaccine can be transferred directly to a fetus via the mother.
Accepted explanations claim protection is conferred on fetuses through the transfer of antibodies, rather than genetic material, but this new study, if correct, shows such claims to be wrong. It also underlines the fact that mRNA vaccines do not function in the same way as “traditional” vaccines.
“This study provides the first in vivo confirmation that mRNA injections cross the placenta, directly reaching the fetus,” Nicolas Hulscher, who first reported the study, notes.
“It also helps explain why these genetic injections pose such serious risks to pregnant women and their unborn children.”
The researchers behind the study administered Moderna’s Spikevax vaccine to pregnant mice.
At least one previous study had claimed that neither mRNA nor the COVID-19 spike protein could be detected in placental and cord-blood samples after vaccination of pregnant women. This was taken to suggest that the placenta served as an impassable barrier for such materials.
However, the new research on mice showed that mRNA from the vaccine passed quickly through the placenta to the fetus, within an hour of administration, and persisted in fetal tissues. mRNA was found in fetal spleen and liver tissue three weeks after the mouse pups were born.
It was also found that the fetuses were producing the spike protein, raising concerns about unintended immune responses and other negative effects.
DNA contamination has been demonstrated during the manufacture of the mRNA vaccines, with fears this could directly lead to the incorporation of genetic material in the host’s tissues, with the potential to cause cancer.
The researchers behind the study said the vaccine “did not pose discernable safety issues in pregnant mice and their pups.” However, they conceded, “the risk of long-term genotoxicity in the offspring born to mRNA-vaccinated mothers cannot be overlooked.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/egg-smuggling-a-growing-problem-as-prices-rise,Egg Smuggling a Growing Problem as Prices Rise,By Raw Egg Nationalist,10 days ago,"Egg smuggling is becoming a major problem at the border as domestic prices rise.
US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said that since January, agriculture specialists in El Paso have encountered close to 100 people attempting to smuggle eggs into the US from Mexico.
“Travelers need to be aware that raw egg imports from Mexico are prohibited,” the CBP said in a statement, which also highlighted concerns about the transmission of avian flu.
A rise in egg smuggling has been noted elsewhere along the border. CBP’s San Diego office issued a similar statement in January, reminding travellers that they could be fined up to $10,000 for bringing raw eggs from Mexico into California.
The importation of live poultry and raw eggs from 17 parts of Canada has also been restricted over concerns about avian flu. Canada has placed similar restrictions on imports from half of all US states.
On Friday, the average price for a dozen large white eggs was $8.07, up more than 30 cents from just a week earlier.
Federal officials have warned that hoarding eggs drives prices up by reducing stock.
Prices have been driven up largely because of desperate attempts to prevent the spread of avian flu, which have seen over 25 million egg-laying hens culled across the US in 2025 alone. The American Farm Bureau Federation puts the total number of hens culled at 43 million this year.",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/lawmakers-in-multiple-states-seek-to-ban-mrna-vaccines,Lawmakers in Multiple States Seek To Ban mRNA Vaccines,By Raw Egg Nationalist,11 days ago,"Lawmakers in multiple states are looking to ban mRNA vaccines.
A bill introduced in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the last few weeks would ban until 1 July 2035 the administration of “any human gene therapy product for any infectious disease indication, regardless of whether the administration is termed an immunization, vaccine, or any other term.”
Lawmakers in Montana and Idaho have introduced similar bills, and at the county level initiatives have been introduced in Iowa, South Carolina, Texas and Washington.
In Montana, for example, House Bill 371 would ban mRNA vaccines and make their administration a misdemeanor.
The bill states the mRNA vaccines “are contaminated with DNA, metallic particles, and other unknown nanoparticles” and may shed to others or “integrate into the human genome and be passed onto the next generation.” The bill also notes that no long-term safety studies of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been completed.
Anybody who administers an mRNA vaccine in Montana would face a $500 fine and a review of their professional licence.
Senate Bill 1036 in Idaho would place a moratorium on all “human gene-therapy products,” including mRNA vaccines, until 2035.
The bill is named after Doug Cameron, a rancher who “was severely injured immediately after receiving a genetic immunization encouraged by his employer.”
According to the bill, the vaccine injury  disabled him from the waist down, and left him confined to a wheelchair.
“His experience highlights the urgent need for caution, transparency, and rigorous oversight in the deployment of these treatments,” the bill states.
Reviews into the safety of mRNA vaccines are taking place outside the US as well. Last month, the Canadian province of Alberta issued an official response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in which it stated that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines should immediately be withdrawn from the market.
The Slovakian government made the same recommendation in 2024, after branding the vaccines “dangerous.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/11-ways-to-detoxify-your-mind-and-body-a-roadmap-to-enhance-overall-well-being,“11 Ways to Detoxify Your Mind and Body”: A Roadmap to Enhance Overall Well-Being,By Arsenio Toledo | Natural News,11 days ago,"In an era where modern lifestyles increasingly expose individuals to environmental pollutants, stress and unhealthy diets, the GreenMedInfo Research Group has released a comprehensive report titled “11 Ways to Detoxify Your Mind and Body.” This report offers a roadmap to enhance overall well-being by supporting the body’s natural detoxification processes.
The report addresses a critical concern: The overwhelming burden of toxins that the body faces daily. It emphasizes that while the body is equipped with detoxifying organs like the liver, kidneys and colon, these systems are often overtaxed. The liver, a chemical processing plant of sorts, handles over 500 functions, converting toxins into less harmful forms. The kidneys filter blood, removing waste, while the colon processes undigested material. However, their efficiency is strained by modern toxin exposure, necessitating intentional support.
GreenMedInfo’s research underscores the importance of adopting a holistic approach to detoxification. The report outlines 11 strategies, each designed to complement the body’s natural functions. These include incorporating superfoods such as cruciferous vegetables and beets, which support liver and kidney health. Exercise is highlighted for its role in boosting lymph flow and aiding toxin elimination, with even simple activities like post-meal walks being beneficial.
Sweating, through exercise or sauna use, is another key strategy, aiding in the removal of heavy metals. Dry brushing is recommended to enhance circulation and lymphatic drainage. Therapeutic massages not only relax muscles but also stimulate the lymphatic system and reduce stress hormones.
For mental detox, the report advocates meditation and yoga, which clear negative emotions and promote well-being. Yoga’s focus on twists and inversions can detoxify internal organs. Consuming raw fruits and vegetables for several days is suggested to rest the digestive system and provide essential nutrients. Unplugging from technology and spending time in nature reduces stress and inflammation, while journaling offers a cathartic release for mental clarity. Lastly, quality sleep is emphasized for its role in brain detoxification, including the removal of proteins linked to Alzheimer’s disease.
The report also suggests starting with an induction phase, such as the Apples and Clean Water Mono Diet, followed by gradual integration of these strategies. It emphasizes that detoxification is a lifestyle, not a fleeting trend.
Historically, humans have relied on natural detox methods, yet modern challenges necessitate a reevaluation of these practices. GreenMedInfo’s report serves as a timely reminder to integrate these strategies into daily life, fostering overall health and vitality.
In conclusion, the “11 Ways to Detoxify Your Mind and Body” report offers practical steps to support natural detoxification, encouraging readers to adopt a lifestyle that values health and well-being. By integrating these strategies, individuals can achieve a lighter, more energetic and mentally clear state, enhancing their quality of life.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/eleven-steps-to-revitalize-the-practice-of-medicine,Eleven Steps to Revitalize the Practice of Medicine,By Allon Friedman | Brownstone Institute,11 days ago,"For 30 years I have worked as an academic physician treating patients, teaching trainees of all levels, and conducting research. I find my job tremendously gratifying spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually, which is why it is so painful to watch it decline in front of my eyes.
In recent years forces arising from inside and outside my profession have worked to degrade core tenets of medical practice like physician autonomy, professional excellence, and the physician-patient relationship. These forces are succeeding in large measure because of increasingly centralized power among a variety of actors and a suffocating blanket of regulations and bureaucracy. The result? Physician dissatisfaction and burnout and deterioration of the medical profession. As physicians go so goes the health care system, so this is a crisis that affects every American.
I believe, however, that it is not too late to reverse this trend. That is why I would like to bring to the attention of the incoming Trump administration, which ran on a platform of reform, my personal list of restorative strategies. I believe instituting reform in the specific areas I outline below would correct some of the worst problems that physicians are currently facing, reinvigorate the medical profession, and improve medical care.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/wuhan-bat-lady-reveals-new-coronavirus-with-pandemic-potential,Wuhan ‘Bat Lady’ Reveals New Coronavirus With Pandemic Potential,By Adan Salazar,11 days ago,"A novel coronavirus has again been detected in bats, with scientists in China claiming it has the potential to spread to humans and spark another global pandemic.
The new HKU5-CoV-2 virus strain recently detected in bats has striking similarities to the SARS-CoV2 virus, or COVID-19, according to Chinese scientists, including lead researcher virologist Shi Zhengli, the “bat lady” who worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology known for its ties to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The study published in the journal Cell reportedly claims HKU5-CoV-2 has the potential for zoonotic transmission, with researchers stating there’s a “high risk of spillover to humans, either through direct transmission or facilitated by intermediate hosts.”
According to the Daily Mail, “Tests showed HKU5-CoV-2 infiltrated human cells in the same way as SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind Covid.”
Additionally, the Mail warns, “The new virus is even closer related to MERS, a deadlier type of coronavirus that kills up to a third of people it infects.”
Scientists noted the new virus is part of the merbecovirus family of pathogens, which have been detected in minks and pangolins—the latter suspected of being the link in Covid’s spread from bats to humans.
“This, the scientists wrote, ‘suggests frequent cross-species transmission of these viruses between bats and other animal species,'” the Mail reports.
“This study reveals a distinct lineage of HKU5-CoVs in bats that efficiently use human [cells] and underscores their potential zoonotic risk,” the study’s authors wrote.
Scientists claimed HKU5-CoV-2 has a “higher potential for interspecies infection,” prompting worries a new pandemic could be on the horizon.
The possibility of a new pandemic reportedly spooked the stock market Friday.

And by the way, your population, even though it’s somewhat liberal although I did very well there, your population doesn’t want men playing in women’s sports. So you better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any federal funding —“
Mills: “I’ll see you in court.”
Trump: “Good I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one. Enjoy your life after governor because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics.”
Mills has since issued a statement after the exchange.
“If the President attempts to unilaterally deprive Maine school children of the benefit of Federal funding, my Administration and the Attorney General will take all appropriate and necessary legal action to restore that funding and the academic opportunity it provides. The State of Maine will not be intimidated by the President’s threats.”",0

Speaking at a Black History Month event in the East Room, Trump thanked Bourla among others for attending, prompting groans and boos from audience members.
“We also have the head of Pfizer here, so I want to thank him…one of the great, great people,” Trump said, as boos rippled throughout the crowd.
“One of the great businessmen. Thank you, Albert,” Trump said, smiling and chuckling, aware of the crowd’s negative reaction to the Big Pharma chief.
Bourla’s poor reception is representative of the American people’s distrust of the Big Pharma-industrial complex and Pfizer’s rollout of the deadly Covid-19 jab, responsible for injuring and killing many people throughout the world.
Elsewhere during the event, Trump joked about running again for a third presidential term, which the crowd enthusiastically supported.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/jewelry-company-dehumanizes-ivf-babies-by-turning-unused-human-embryos-into-pendants,Jewelry Company Dehumanizes IVF Babies by Turning Unused Human Embryos Into Pendants,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,12 days ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — A specialty jeweler that offers to incorporate organic tissue including frozen embryos into its products is gaining notoriety as a stark example of how the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process objectifies nascent human life.
Blossom Keepsake offers hand-crafted jewelry “transforming breastmilk, ashes, umbilical cord, embryo, placenta, and hair into unique stones to create modern heirlooms,” according to its website.
It says it specializes in keepsakes “using unused IVF embryos that are destined to be destroyed” to “provide families with a way to honour and cherish the journey they have taken to bring life into the world.”
The company purports to “believe that every life is precious and deserves to be celebrated,” which is why it “carefully handles each embryo with the utmost care and respect. Using advanced techniques, we are able to encapsulate the essence of life within stunning jewellery pieces. From delicate pendants to intricate rings, each keepsake is meticulously crafted to reflect the beauty and significance of the journey it represents.”
Many found professions of respecting life difficult to reconcile with a business model of literally turning the bodies of pre-born human into material for luxury items, however.
“By offering to turn these tiny humans into keepsakes, the company preys on the emotional desire of parents to hold onto a ‘piece’ of their children,” wrote Lydia Taylor Davis at Students for Life. “But here’s the kicker: these embryos are not just biological material; they are reportedly living human beings who are being killed and turned into accessories, not treated with dignity.”
“Many Instagram users thought the same, as the business experienced swift and intense backlash,” Davis continued. “When I commented on how this jewelry business profits from the termination of innocent human life, the business blocked me. Other commenters argued that turning embryos into jewelry isn’t just disrespectful – it’s dangerous. In the pursuit of ‘celebrating life,’ as this business claims to do, we risk normalizing the idea that some human lives are less valuable than others based solely on their potential for profit or utility.”
The IVF process is gravely unethical, as it entails the conscious creation of scores of “excess” embryonic humans only to be killed and human lives being treated like commodities to be bartered over. It has been estimated that more than a million embryos are frozen in storage in the United States after IVF, and that as many as 93 percent of all embryos created through IVF are eventually destroyed. A 2019 NBC News profile of Florida fertility doctor Craig Sweet acknowledged that his practice has discarded or abandoned approximately a third of the embryos it places in cold storage.
Yet most in the nominally pro-life Republican Party have dropped opposition to IVF, led by President Donald Trump, who this week directed his administration to brainstorm administrative action and policy recommendations to strengthen IVF “access” and “affordability” that he campaigned on.
A White House official later told the Daily Wire’s Mary Margaret Olohan that input from pro-life groups will be considered in formulating a final policy, but many pro-life and religious leaders continue to point out that any pro-IVF policy will be fundamentally anti-life.",0

CNBC anchor Morgan Brennan said, “Vaccine makers like yourself [are] largely shielded from liability,” asking, “If the products are safe and effective, what is the need to continue to shield, to have these liability shields and what happens if those shields are changed or go away completely?”
Bourla answered, “If the product is not safe and effective, we’ll never get approval from FDA or from the other health authorities. They are very strict when they are approving products, particularly for vaccines because exactly it’s given to healthy people.”
He continued to bizarrely claim that “in a system where litigations can flourish,” people could blame things such as car accidents on vaccine side effects.
“With a jury, it’s going to be maybe a flip of a coin,” the corrupt Big Pharma CEO said. “This is why, I think, Congress – it was not an administration – had passed this legislation protecting those that they gave approval, through the FDA, from federal liabilities.”
In the end, Bourla failed to answer Brennan’s question about “what happens if those shields are changed or go away completely.”
Last year, five U.S. states sued Pfizer for misleading Americans about its mRNA Covid jabs.
Under the Donald Trump administration’s leadership with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. heading Health and Human Services, it’s likely the Covid shots will be re-examined and that Big Pharma will finally be held liable for decades of poisoning the public.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/report-deadly-covid-vaccine-could-be-banned-by-trump,Report: Trump May Ban Deadly Covid Vaccine,By Adan Salazar,13 days ago,"President Donald Trump could order a halt to the experimental mRNA Covid-19 vaccine given members joining his administration have previously expressed skepticism over the jabs, which many have blamed for causing severe injuries and even death, the Daily Mail reports.
According to the Mail, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, who’s been nominated to serve as Trump’s director of the National Institutes of Health, previously signed a document known as The Hope Accord, a July 2024 petition asserting the “widespread rollout of the novel Covid-19 mRNA vaccine products is contributing to an alarming rise in disability and excess deaths,” and that mRNA jabs should be held back from human use until further studies are done.
The Hope Accords calls on healthcare professionals, scientists and the public to support an “immediate suspension of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine products,” a “comprehensive re-evaluation of the safety and efficacy of all COVID-19 vaccine products,” the “immediate recognition and support for the vaccine-injured,” the “restoration of ethical principles abandoned during the COVID-19 era,” and for “addressing the root causes of our current predicament.”
The Mail goes on to describe other notable figures in Trump’s orbit have also previously expressed skepticism toward the mRNA jabs, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and British cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malhotra, who’s “being considered for a health advisory role in Kennedy’s new health departments,” The Mail reports.
Spurred on by the sudden cardiac death of his fit and active father in July 2021, Malhotra, an NHS-trained consultant cardiologist, undertook efforts in the UK to debunk the “pandemic of misinformation on Covid-19 mRNA vaccines” using real-world evidence after noticing a spate of heart attacks and sudden cardiac death in people aged between 16 and 39 specifically related to the Covid mRNA vaccines, and not related to Covid.
On top of that, The Mail says prospective FBI director Kash Patel could also be instrumental in bringing down the Covid-19 vaccine program.
“Outside the health agencies, Kash Patel — who has been nominated as FBI director — previously promoted bogus supplements that ‘reversed’ the supposed damage caused by Covid vaccines,” the Mail noted, adding, “How a ban would be implemented is still not clear,” but that “A total ban would require the FDA withdrawing its approval status for safety or effectiveness reasons.”
While not fully owning up to the alarming number of deaths that followed the jab rollout, the CDC has admitted Covid-19 jabs were found to cause myocarditis and pericarditis as well as Guillain-Barré Syndrome in some people.
If Dr. Bhattacharya is approved to head the NIH, Americans can likely expect President Trump to reverse course on the jabs and question why previous health officials misled him.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/how-usaid-assisted-the-corporate-takeover-of-ukrainian-agriculture,How USAID Assisted the Corporate Takeover of Ukrainian Agriculture,By John Klar | Brownstone Institute,13 days ago,"A recent essay titled “The Real Purpose of Net Zero” by Jefferey Jaxon posited that Europe’s current war against farmers in the name of preventing climate change is ultimately designed to inflict famine. Jaxon is not speculating on globalist motives; he is warning humanity of a rapidly unfolding reality that is observable in the perverse lies against cows, denigration of European farmers as enemies of the Earth, and calls by the WHO, WEF, and UN for a plant-based diet dependent entirely on GMOs, synthetic fertilizers, and agrichemicals.
Revelations about the evil doings of the Orwellian-monikered “United States Agency of International Development” (USAID) reveal a roadmap to totalitarian control unwittingly funded by America’s taxpaying proles. USAID’s clandestine machinations have long focused on controlling local and global food supplies as “soft colonization” by multinational chemical, agricultural, and financial corporations. European farmers revolting against climate, wildlife, and animal rights policies are harbingers of this tightening globalist noose.
The roots of the current globalist plan to “save humanity from climate change” link directly to the infamous Kissinger Report, which called to control world food supplies and agriculture as part of a globalist collaboration between nation-states and NGOs to advance US national security interests and “save the world” from human overpopulation using “fertility reduction technologies.” Kissinger’s 1974 Report was created by USAID, the CIA, and various federal agencies, including the USDA.
Fast forward to the 2003 Iraq War, justified using fear-mongering propaganda about weapons of mass destruction and neo-conservative malarky about rescuing the Iraqi people. The US-led occupation of Iraq became a rapacious profiteering smorgasbord for colonizing corporations husbanded by USAID. Iraq is heir to the birthplace of human civilization, made possible by early Mesopotamian agriculture: many of the grains, fruits, and vegetables that now feed the world were developed there. Iraq’s farmers saved back 97% of their seed stocks from their own harvests before the US invasion. Under Paul Bremer, Rule 81 (never fully implemented) sought to institute GMO cropping and patented seed varieties, as Cargill, Monsanto, and other corporations descended upon the war-ravaged nation using American tax dollars and USAID.
That playbook was more quietly implemented during the Ukraine War, once again orchestrated by USAID. Before the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, Ukraine was the breadbasket of Europe, prohibiting GMO technologies and restricting land ownership to Ukrainians. Within months of US intervention, USAID assisted in the dismantling of these protections in the name of “land reforms,” free markets, financial support, improved agricultural efficiency, and rescuing the Ukrainian people. In just two years, over half of Ukraine’s farmland became the property of foreign investors. GMO seeds and drone technology were “donated” by Bayer Corporation, and companies such as GMO seed-seller Syngenta and German chemical manufacturer BASF became the dominant agricultural “stakeholders” in war-torn Ukraine. Russia may withdraw, but Ukraine’s foreign debts, soil degradation, and soft colonization will remain.
The UN, WTO, WHO, and WEF all conspire to peddle a false narrative that cows and peasant farmers are destroying the planet, and that chemical-dependent GMO monocropping, synthetic fertilizers, and patented fake meats and bug burgers must be implemented post haste (by force if necessary) to rescue humanity. The argument that pesticides and synthetic fertilizers (manufactured from natural gas, aka methane) are salvific is patently false. They are, however, highly profitable for chemical companies like Bayer, Dow, and BASF.
Jefferey Jaxon is exactly correct. The Netherlands committed to robust agricultural development following a Nazi embargo that deliberately inflicted mass famine following their collaboration with Allied Forces in Operation Market Garden. France boasts the highest cow population in all of Europe. Ireland’s culture is tightly linked to farming as part of its trauma during the (British-assisted) Irish Potato Famine. The corporate/NGO cabal now uprooting and targeting farmers in these nations and across the EU in the name of staving off climate change and preserving wildlife is a direct outcropping of Kissinger’s grand dystopian scheme launched through USAID in 1974.
Americans watch European farmer protests from afar, largely oblivious that most all of US agriculture was absorbed by the Big Ag Borg generations ago. Currency control linked to a (political, environmental, and economic) social credit scorecard promises the fruition of Kissinger’s demonic plan: “Control the food, control the people.”
Modern humans suffer a double hubris that blinds them to the contemplation of the truth of Jaxon’s hypothesis: a cultish trust in technology, coupled with an irrational faith in their self-perceived moral superiority to past civilizations (Wendell Berry calls this “historical pride”). Yet, as long as mankind has had the capacity to harm another for personal gain, humans have devised ways to control food for power or profit. Siege warfare generally depended on starving defenders of castle walls into submission.
Even if globalist food control proposals are well-intentioned, a monolithic, monocultured, industrial-dependent worldwide food system is a lurking humanitarian disaster. Berry observed:
In a highly centralized and industrialized food-supply system there can be no small disaster. Whether it be a production “error” or a corn blight, the disaster is not foreseen until it exists; it is not recognized until it is widespread.
The current push to dominate global food production using industrial systems is the cornerstone of complete globalist dominion over all of humanity. The “Mark of the Beast” without which no American will buy or sell goods – including guns, bullets, or factory-grown hamburgers and cricket patties – is mere steps away. Mr. Jaxon is correct that these leaders “know these basic historical and current facts,” and that “[f]armers are becoming endangered because of government [climate] policy … and it’s being allowed to happen.” USAID has been actively seeding and watering this dystopia for decades.
Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates are as fully cognizant of this fundamental truth as Henry Kissinger was in 1974. USAID has aided all three. Having lost almost all of their small farms over the last century, Americans are well ahead of Europeans in their near-complete dependence on industrial food.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/why-bird-flu-why-now,Why Bird Flu? Why Now?,By Joel Salatin | Brownstone Institute,13 days ago,"Ever since the Covid debacle, I’ve become dubious of ANYTHING the government says – er, way MORE dubious. The official narrative is wrong 90 percent of the time.
So a bunch of things suddenly fell into place for me today when one of our staff, who just returned from visiting family in Michigan, came with stories of signs over vacant egg shelves in the supermarket saying: “Egg shortage due to cage free chicken production.” She didn’t have pictures; I’m hoping someone reading this blog can take some pictures.
I’m not sure she quoted the signs exactly right, but it brings to mind conversations I had several years ago when Burger King announced that within 10 years they would use only cage-free eggs. The food writer for the Washington Post called me to get my comments about such an earth-shattering announcement. Of course, she assumed I’d be thrilled and have all kinds of wonderful things to say about it.
My response was “Why 10 years? We have a Burger King 15 minutes from our farm; we could supply cage-free eggs today. In fact, we can do even better and offer pastured GMO-free, vaccine-free eggs right now. Why the long runway?”
I began doing some sleuthing on the issue, talking to folks friendly to the industry. They were quite surprised at my naivete. “Don’t you realize the plan? The long runway is to give time for the industry to prove the superiority of caged hens so they don’t have to go to cage-free.”
Industry folks were adamant, and are right now, that caged birds are healthier than cage-free. And they will fight tooth and nail to keep caged production systems.
It actually makes sense. Cage-free means the birds live in and on their poop and stir up far more fecal dust to inhale. Caged birds, although they can’t move around, at least don’t live on their poop and don’t have fecal bedding to stir up and create pathogenic dust. The industry position is that cage-free is harmful to laying hens, period. And the industry has a lot of money tied up in caged infrastructure, from housing to egg collection to feed distribution. That’s the train, and it doesn’t like to be derailed.
Those old conversations from several years ago suddenly popped into my mind when I learned today that supermarkets are putting up signage blaming cage-free chickens for the bird flu. “See, we told you, you dimwit animal welfare folks. You’re such idiots and now your cage-free rules and prejudices are destroying the egg industry.” This could be a great win for the caged-laying hen industry.",0

Torres warned viruses such as Marburg or Ebola have a higher fatality rate than COVID-19 before pointing out Trump and Musk shut down USAID while a Marburg outbreak is spreading in Africa.
Bolan responded, “There’s also Dengue, which is on its way to the United States, an active Ebola outbreak in Uganda, Mpox, polio and Bird Flu, which is probably the next pandemic.”
Next, Torres praised USAID for allegedly “fighting violence and poverty, and displacement and disease” abroad, calling the agency “a stabilizing force.”
Disease and other issues taking place in foreign nations “is a lot of what’s fueling migration to the United States,” Bolan said.
Torres then suggested funding USAID is “an investment in” U.S. national security and health.
The former USAID employee also told the Democrat candidate that China, Russia and terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda will take advantage of people in the areas where the agency used to operate.
“It’s going to cost the U.S. taxpayer so much money,” Bolan added. “The grain is rotting in the ports and on the ships and the medications are in warehouses going bad.”
The pair went on to falsely say only Congress can shut down USAID as it has the “power of the purse,” when President Trump actually has the authority to close the agency via executive order as it was created by a John F. Kennedy EO in 1961.

Richard Lear and Camilla Rees posted their report on Feb. 6 as a preprint on ResearchGate. Lear and Rees are business executives and long-time health and environmental researchers.
The report, which Rees called a “discussion and commentary” on published science related to wireless radiation’s biological impacts, is geared toward an everyday audience.
Lear and Rees posted the report on ResearchGate to make it accessible to the public.
On Feb. 14, Rees shared the paper with attendees of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine’s annual conference in San Antonio, Texas, according to a press release.
Miriam Eckenfels, director of Children’s Health Defense’s (CHD) Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) & Wireless called the report an “easy-to-understand distillation of pertinent scientific findings that gives the public a sense of how regulatory agencies ignored earlier science and why agencies need to take protective action now.”
In the report, Lear and Rees discuss how the U.S. Naval Medical Research Institute in 1971 issued a report that reviewed 2,311 scientific studies on the biological and health effects of electromagnetic radiation (EMR).
Most of the studies examined by the Navy involved low-intensity EMR signals in the 1 to 4 gigahertz (GHz) range, said Lear and Rees. “These types of wireless exposures are virtually identical with those from modern devices and wireless sources such as cell phones, WiFi, Bluetooth, smart meters, GPS, wearables, and wireless infrastructure.”
The Navy’s review found 132 different biological effects, symptoms and diseases linked to wireless exposures.
According to Lear and Rees, 23 of those are among the fastest-growing chronic diseases and conditions in the U.S. today, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or ADHD, anxiety, asthma, autism, chronic fatigue, diabetes, leukemia, autoimmune disease and celiac disease.
In 2016, Lear examined the growth of chronic disease from 1990 to 2015 and the related economic costs of those diseases. His research found that 36 chronic diseases and conditions doubled from 1990 to 2015.
“Of the 36 chronic diseases and conditions that more than doubled (1990-2015), the U.S. Navy study warned us of the connection between wireless radiation and twenty-three of those chronic diseases, predicting what has indeed happened to the health of Americans,” the authors of the report wrote.
They added:
“By ignoring the earlier science, U.S. regulators failed to protect the American people from the dangers of wireless technologies. In doing so, they imposed millions of unnecessary chronic exposure conditions on the American public.”
Rees told The Defender she hopes U.S. regulators finally take action. “Pressure is needed from all directions to encourage federal regulatory agencies to do their jobs, and to hold these agencies accountable.”
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not updated its exposure limits for wireless radiation since 1996.
In 2021, CHD and other groups won a lawsuit challenging the FCC’s exposure limits.
The groups filed 11,000 pages of evidence of harm from 5G and wireless technology, which they alleged the FCC ignored when it decided to keep its 1996 guidelines. The pages included evidence of widespread sickness due to wireless radiation exposure.
The FCC has yet to comply with a court-ordered mandate to explain how the agency determined that its current guidelines adequately protect humans and the environment against the harmful effects of exposure to wireless radiation.
Lear and Rees plan to send hard copies of their report to all U.S. Congress members and at least 1,000 U.S. business leaders.
“We want this information to get to people who are courageous enough to make a difference, including government leaders, business leaders, religious leaders and media,” Rees said.
Business leaders need to understand the connection between wireless exposures and their employees’ mood, health and therefore productivity, she said.
Rees is a senior policy adviser for the National Institute for Science, Law and Public Policy and founder of Manhattan Neighbors for Safer Telecommunications.
According to the report:
“By 2015, the 23 diseases the U.S. Navy predicted may have added more than $2 trillion in annual health care costs to the U.S. economy due to their negligence.”
The authors acknowledged that other factors have likely contributed to the current U.S. chronic disease crisis, such as sugar consumption, glyphosate and other pesticide exposures.
‘We’ve been misled about the benefits of wireless’
In the report, Lear and Rees also cite other scientific reports that have shown a link between wireless radiation and negative health impacts, including the BioInitiative 2012 Report.
The BioInitiative Report, updated in 2017, cites more than 2,200 scientific studies that link low-level EMR exposure to dozens of diseases and biological effects, including neurological effects, brain cancer, fetal effects, blood-brain barrier damage, DNA damage, breast cancer, biochemical imbalances, leukemia, decreased fertility and oxidative stress.
The report also discusses studies that suggested a possible biological mechanism for explaining how wireless radiation is linked to chronic disease.
Rees said, “We have been misled about the relative benefits of wireless.”
Wired connections are far superior to wireless for numerous reasons, including connection speed, according to a 2018 National Institute for Science, Law and Public Policy report.
“It is faster, far more energy efficient, higher audio quality, more reliable, more resilient in weather events, more secure, and more enduring, meaning that it is not subject to the costs of planned obsolescence like wireless technologies,” Rees said.
She added:
“We need to start taking responsibility ourselves, and minimize our personal wireless exposure while supporting efforts, such as CHD’s new ‘704 No More’ initiative, to restore local control over cell towers and antennas.”
The 704 No More initiative is raising money to legally challenge Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which prohibits local authorities from denying cell tower applications based on health and environmental effects.",0

Baker, MD | Brownstone Institute",14 days ago,"Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it.
In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it.
The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script. There is just one twist:
Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines.
This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it.
Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it.
Let’s review. What happened during Covid?
What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu?
This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition.
The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-end-of-college-vaccine-mandates,The End of College Vaccine Mandates,By Lucia Sinatra | Brownstone Institute,14 days ago,"With one stroke of his pen, President Trump accomplished what we have been fighting for over the last 4 years – an end to college and university Covid-19 vaccine mandates. He signed an executive order to halt federal funding to all schools, including colleges and universities, that still impose Covid-19 vaccine mandates on students. While there are only 15 colleges and universities left mandating these shots, the magnitude of his message to higher education leaders should not be underestimated.
Covid-19 vaccine mandates on healthy young adults were never based on scientific data or sound reasoning, but they were harshly implemented nonetheless. These policies coerced a captive population of students to choose between abandonment of their college programs and dreams for the future or complying with decisions over bodily autonomy made by the “experts.”
Beginning in the spring of 2021, colleges and universities mandated students to take shots that never protected against infection or transmission of Covid-19. These mandates were imposed with the mantra that injections were the best way to “protect our community” from severe illness and death – a claim that proved false by the summer of 2021 just prior to mandated compliance for fall 2021 enrollment.
In fact, colleges that never had Covid-19 vaccine mandates had less infections and have no recorded history of severe illnesses or death among their campus communities as compared to colleges that did. It was easy to analyze these data using the colleges’ own Covid infection and vaccination rate dashboards until most of them scrubbed the dashboards from their college websites.
Over 1,000 colleges announced Covid vaccine mandates by the summer of 2021. After a concerted campaign by No College Mandates and other advocacy groups, by the spring of 2022, colleges had slowly begun dropping them. By the summer of 2023, very few colleges imposed the mandates on faculty and staff, but students were still required to comply.
Until this executive order, which tasked our new Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to develop a plan to end these coercive policies, our nation’s entire academic apparatus seemed perfectly fine with the continued application of these mandates on students. For example, at CSU Dominguez Hills and CSU Cal Poly Humboldt, only residential students are required to show proof of Covid vaccination prior to enrollment. At Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore Colleges only students are required to take Covid vaccines. No other members of the college community must comply.
Coercive and mandatory policies such as these alerted many of us to the fact that student health was not at the forefront of administrators’ concerns. Somehow, they perpetuated the draconian notion that only students were to blame for spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus and that only students must comply to put an end to the pandemic. College leaders knew such strategies were incoherent and illogical, yet they persisted almost entirely unchallenged.
From the very start, many of us lost trust in the hypocrisy of such inconsistencies. It was downright crazy for students to have to put up with such nonsense and risk injury from taking novel and needless medical treatments in the name of “protecting the community.” This is why we refused to stop shining a light on the injustice of it all.
It is with deep gratitude to President Trump and his team for keeping his promise and ending all federal funding to colleges and universities that continue these unnecessary and dangerous Covid-19 vaccine policies. There was zero science or reasoning to support them, and this new executive order might just prevent similar dictates from ever happening again.
But our work is far from done.
Healthcare students are still being forced to choose between their dreams and their autonomy to access hospitals and clinical facilities. To graduate, healthcare students must complete their clinical rotations, and hospitals and clinical facilities have required that these students take updated Covid vaccines even when faculty and staff no longer must comply. There is zero rationale for this patently retaliatory discrepancy.
In Florida, it is against the law for any “a business entity [to] require any person to provide any documentation certifying vaccination…or postinfection recovery from COVID-19, or require a COVID-19 test, to gain access to, entry upon, or service from the business operations in this state or as a condition of contracting, hiring, promotion, or continued employment with the business entity.”
When I called the University of Florida Nursing Program a few weeks ago, however, I was told students are required to receive updated Covid vaccines to complete clinical programs with some providers. Making matters worse, some colleges smugly refuse to disclose these requirements to prospective or even enrolled students, often leaving them to learn about them in the final year of their program.
Ironically, but perhaps not unexpectedly, UF Nursing posted on X just last week that there is a nationwide nursing shortage including in the State of Florida. It blows my mind that those who determine policies affecting the training of our nation’s nurses were somehow unaware that their coercive and nonsensical policies would likely lead to such shortages. After No College Mandates drew attention to this on X, UF Nursing deleted the post.
In Montana, there is a similar problem. Montana law prohibits discrimination based on Covid vaccine status yet the Emergency Medical Technician program at Helena College still requires students to take Covid vaccines to enroll.
I have reached out to representatives in both states to report the college programs that are not following state law because if there is anything I have learned over the past several years, colleges and universities will get away with these discriminatory and punitive policies for as long as they can until someone steps in to put an end to them.
It is uncertain what will happen to healthcare majors whose colleges and universities no longer require injections to enroll but whose clinical partner assignments are still requiring them to complete clinical rotations to graduate. So, while President Trump took a huge step forward to end federal funding to colleges and universities that perpetuate unscientific and unreasonable Covid vaccination, it is not nearly enough to end the coercive policies at partner facilities when the unreasonable and unconstitutional mandates remain for many healthcare students who need to complete clinical rotations at those facilities.
I would be remiss if I failed to mention that there are legislative efforts in at least 9 states* to completely ban mRNA shots. Such efforts promise to stop remaining Covid vaccine mandates dead in their tracks. Until we see those efforts make more progress, we will keep pressuring healthcare programs to end partnerships with hospitals and clinics when those facilities require students to receive Covid injections, and we will keep working with state representatives to hold clinical partners accountable for refusing to follow state law.
It is long overdue that our nation’s healthcare academies leave our healthcare students alone to make their own private decisions over what medical measures to take so they can pursue their dreams and help heal our very sick nation.
*On February 15, 2024, the Idaho Senate blocked the vote to ban mRNA vaccines so as of right now Bill S1036 is dead, and Idaho should no longer be on the map of 9 states.",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/is-our-five-year-nightmare-finally-over,Is Our Five-Year Nightmare Finally Over?,By Jeffrey A. Tucker | Brownstone Institute,15 days ago,"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s confirmation as the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the US is the ultimate repudiation of the Covid policy response.
The scheme of lockdown-until-vaccination was the biggest effort of government and industry on a global scale on historical record. It was all designed to transfer wealth to winning industries (pharma, online retail, streaming services, online education), divide and conquer the population, and consolidate power in the administrative state.
By 2021, RFK, Jr., had emerged as the world’s most vocal, erudite, and knowledgeable critic of the scheme. In two brilliant books – The Real Anthony Fauci and The Wuhan Cover-Up – he documented the entire enterprise and dated the evolution of the pandemic industry from its postwar inception to the present. There was simply no way to read these books and think about the corporatist cabal in the same way.
The circumstances that led to his appointment at HHS are themselves implausible and remarkable. Perceiving President Biden to be a weak candidate – one who had forced masks and shots on the population and brutally censored tech and media – he decided to make a run for president, presuming that there would be an open primary. There wasn’t one, so he was forced into an independent run.
That effort was chewed up by the usual political dynamic that befalls every third-party effort – too many ballot-access barriers plus the usual logic of Duverger’s law. That left the campaign in a difficult spot. At the same time, two huge political shifts had become clear. The Democratic Party had become a vessel and a front mainly for the administrative state with a veneer of woke ideology, while the Republican Party was being taken over by refugees from the Democrats, in effect creating a new Trump party out of the remnants of the other two.
The rest is legendary. Trump linked up with Elon Musk to do to the federal government what he did when he took over Twitter, taking the company private, gutting the place of embedded federal assets, and firing 4 out of 5 workers. In the midst of this, and faced with a terrifying flurry of legal attacks, Trump dodged an assassin’s bullet. That triggered terrible memories of RFK, Jr.’s father and uncle, and thus sparked discussions about coming together.
Within a matter of weeks, we had a new coalition that brought together old antagonists, as many people and groups seemingly in the same instant realized their conjoined interests in cleaning up the corporatist cartel. With the newly freed platform of X to reach the public, MAGA/MAHA/DOGE was born.
Trump won and chose RFK, Jr., to lead the most powerful public health agency in the world. The barrier was Senate confirmation, but that was achieved through some incredible triangulation that made it extremely difficult to vote no.
In the big picture, you can measure the size of this titanic shift in American politics by the way the votes in the Senate lined up. All Republicans but one voted for the most prominent scion of the Democratic Party to head the health empire while all Democrats voted no. That alone is striking, and a testament to the power of the pharma lobby, which, during the hearings, was exposed as the hidden hand behind the most passionate opponents of the confirmation.
Is our nightmare over? Not yet. Writing not even a month into the second presidential term of Donald Trump, it is still unclear just how much authority he truly exercises over the sprawling executive branch. For that matter, no one can even agree on how large this branch is: between 2.2 million and 3 million employees and somewhere between 400 and 450 agencies. The financial bleed in this realm is unthinkable and far worse than even the biggest cynic can imagine.
Five former secretaries of the Treasury took to the pages of the New York Times with a shocking claim. “The nation’s payment system has historically been operated by a very small group of nonpartisan career civil servants.” This has included a career employee called “fiscal assistant secretary—a post that for the prior eight decades had been reserved exclusively for civil servants to ensure impartiality and public confidence in the handling and payment of federal funds.”
There is no reason even to read between the lines. What this means is that no person voted into office by the people and no one appointed by such a person has access to the federal books since 1946. This is startling beyond belief. No owner of any company would ever tolerate being barred from the accounting offices and payment systems. And no company can offer any public stock without independent audits and open books.
And yet almost 80 years have gone by during which time neither has been true for this gigantic enterprise called the federal government. That means that $193 trillion has been spent by an institution that has never faced granulated oversight from the people and never met the normal demands that every enterprise faces every day.
The usual habit in Washington has been to treat every elected leader and their appointments as temporary and transitory marionettes, people who come and go and disturb little to nothing about the normal operations of government. This new administration seems to have every intention to change that but the job is inconceivably challenging. As much public support as MAGA/MAHA/DOGE enjoy for now, and as many people from those groups are getting embedded in the power structure, they are outnumbered and outmaneuvered by millions of agents of the old order.
This transition will not be easy if it happens at all.
The inertia of the old order is mighty. Even on the issue of health and pandemics, there is already confusion. CBS News has reported that Fauci-loyalist and mRNA pusher Gerald Parker will head the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response or OPPR. The report cited only unnamed “health officials” and the appointment has been celebrated by Scott Gottlieb, the Pfizer board member who nudged Trump into backing lockdowns in 2020.
All the while, this appointment has not been confirmed by the White House. We do not know if OPPR, created by Congressional charter, will even be funded. The reporter will not reveal his sources – raising the question of why any appointment having to do with health should be surrounded by such cloak-and-dagger machinations.
If Dr. Parker becomes ensconced in this position and another health emergency is declared, this time for Bird flu, HHS and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., will not be in any kind of decision-making position at all.
The larger problems have to do with a broader question: is the president really in charge of the executive branch? Can he hire and fire? Can he spend money or decline to spend money? Can he set policy for the agencies?
One might suppose that the whole answer to these questions can be found in Article 2, Section 1: “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” And yet that sentence was written almost 100 years before Congress created this thing called the “civil service” that nowhere appears in the Constitution. This fourth branch has grown in size and power to swamp both the presidency and the legislature.
Courts are going to have to sort this out, and already an avalanche of lawsuits has hit the new administration for daring to presume control over agencies and their activities of which the president is and must necessarily be held accountable. Lower federal courts seem to be demanding that the president be that in name only, while the Supreme Court might have a different opinion.
The much-ballyhooed “constitutional crisis” consists of nothing other than an attempt to reassert the original constitutional design of government.
This is the background template in which RFK, Jr., takes power at HHS, and oversees all the sub-agencies. These agencies played a huge role in covering for the attack on liberty and rights over five years. His confirmation is a symbolic repudiation of the most egregious public policies on record. And yet, the repudiation is entirely implicit: there has been no commission, no admission of error, no one truly held responsible, and no real accountability.
The trajectory on which we find ourselves affords many reasons for champagne celebrations, but sober up quickly. There is a very long way to go and enormous barriers in place to get us to the point that we are really safe again from the marauding corporatist/statist complex and their plots and schemes to rob the public of rights and liberties. In the meantime, to invoke a common phrase, keep these new appointees in your thoughts and prayers.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/dr-robert-malone-trump-admin-holding-high-level-discussions-of-bird-flu-mrna-vaccine-push,Dr. Robert Malone: Trump Admin Holding High-Level Discussions of Bird Flu mRNA Vaccine Push,By Emily Mangiaracina | Lifesite,16 days ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist and pioneer-turned-critic of mRNA technology, has announced that President Donald Trump’s administration is currently having high-level discussions about rolling out bird flu mRNA “vaccines.”
“I was just told by a reliable source that there are serious discussions going on at the top level of the Trump administration about pushing mRNA vaccines for bird flu,” said Malone on X Thursday evening.
Malone pointed out that Dr. Gerald Parker, DVM, who was recently appointed the White House Pandemic czar, is a “big fan” of Peter Hotez, a radical pro-vaccine scientist who has claimed that anti-vaccine activism is a “major killing force globally.”
Parker has collaborated with Hotez on “many podcasts,” and Hotez has even written a forward to one of Parker’s books, noted Malone, referring to Consequences of COVID-19: A One Health Approach to the Responses, Challenges, and Lessons Learned, published in 2024.
“One Health,” a term used by the World Health Organization (WHO), refers to the idea that human health, animal health, and the environment are all interconnected and therefore require holistic solutions to “global health security” and disease control. It is one of Parker’s specialties: He formerly served as an associate dean for Global One Health at Texas A&M’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.
Dr. Joseph Mercola has warned that under the One Health agenda, the WHO, and/or governments would have the ability to control a wide range of aspects of human life, from diet, to agriculture and livestock farming, to the movement of populations.
Dr. Meryl Nass has further explained: “They can close borders. The WHO directors-general could basically take control of anything. If they say, ‘Oh, people are getting [disease] from animals,’ they can stop contact with animals, stop you eating chicken or whatever, because One Health has taken jurisdiction over ecosystems.”
The pharmaceutical giant Moderna has already been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Biden administration to develop mRNA bird flu “vaccines,” with the last payment award of $590 million announced last month.
The abysmal track record of mRNA injections – both before and after coming to market – raises safety questions about the planned mRNA bird flu shot. Before the COVID outbreak, not one Moderna mRNA treatment had been brought to market since 2013, when it signed an agreement to develop and commercialize mRNA therapeutic treatments.
StatNews noted in 2016 that mRNA-based treatments are “highly risky,” and that “[b]ig pharma companies had tried similar work and abandoned it because it’s exceedingly hard to get RNA into cells without triggering nasty side effects.”
“Novartis abandoned the related realm of RNA interference over concerns about toxicity, as did Merck and Roche,” StatNews continued.
Whether because of these “nasty side effects” or for other reasons, such as the antigens (spike proteins) created by mRNA, the COVID shots went on to take a devastating toll on human health and lives. In the U.S. alone, the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which has previously been estimated to account for only 1 percent of vaccine injuries, now has tallied 38,264 deaths due to the COVID shots, and a total of 1,658,330 COVID shot-induced adverse events.
In June 2024, ​​the World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of bird flu detected in humans for the first time had a “potential for high public health impact.” They logged the death of a 59-year-old man in Mexico with “multiple underlying conditions” as a “confirmed fatal case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus,” despite the fact that Mexico’s health ministry said the death was due to underlying conditions that led to septic shock, Reuters reported.
Dr. Peter McCullough, one of the most highly published cardiologists in history, pointed to gain-of-function research as a likely explanation for a “jump” of bird flu from animals to humans, alluding to the fact that it has long historically only been detected in animals. He called for a shutdown of U.S. gain-of-function labs and warned that animal culling and bird flu vaccines would only create “more resistant strains.”
Dr. Joseph Mercola also pointed out in 2022 that Bill Gates and Dr. Anthony Fauci have spent years funding research to “develop a bird flu pathogen capable of infecting humans,” as Alexis Baden-Mayer showed in an article published last year. Some of this gain-of-function research has taken place in U.S. Department of Defense-funded biolabs in Ukraine.
Mercola noted that Christian Westbrook (the “Ice Age Farmer”) detailed in one video Gates’ funding of Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka in Wisconsin to identify mutations in various bird flu strains that could have pandemic potential. Fauci has also funded Kawaoka’s work since 1990.
“In one experiment, Kawaoka mixed bird flu virus with the Spanish flu virus, resulting in a highly lethal respiratory virus with human transmission capability. Kawaoka has also played around with mixtures of H5N1 and the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) virus, creating an airborne hybrid capable of completely evading the human immune system, effectively rendering humans defenseless against it,” Mercola explained.
Such funding of gain-of-function bird flu research is especially significant considering that people like Dr. Robert Redfield, former director for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have for years warned of a dangerous impending bird flu that will devastate humans despite the fact that it has historically been detected only in animals.
In a March 30, 2022, CenterPoint interview, Redfield stated, “I believe the great pandemic is still in the future, and that’s going to be a bird flu pandemic for man. It’s going to have significant mortality in the 10 to 50% range. It’s going to be trouble.”
Remarkably, Dr. Michael Gregor, a scientist and vegan who once testified on behalf of Oprah Winfrey in her “meat defamation” trial, has repeatedly claimed that chicken farms will trigger an apocalyptic virus that will threaten half of humankind. In 2006, he published a book called Bird Flu: A Virus of Our Own Hatching, in which he asserts that “leading public health authorities now predict as inevitable a pandemic of influenza, triggered by bird flu and expected to lead to millions of deaths around the globe.”
Accordingly, Westbrook “suspects a weaponized bird flu may be released to usher in The Great Reset and Fourth Industrial Revolution, which include the elimination of traditional farming and meat consumption in favor of patented, lab-created ‘foods,’” Mercola noted. In Westbrook’s words, this would be a “a controlled demolition of the protein supply.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/ebola-ruled-out-in-ny-health-scare,Ebola Ruled Out in NY Health Scare,By Raw Egg Nationalist,16 days ago,"Ebola has been ruled out as the cause of a health scare in New York, after two patients were rushed to hospital by health workers in hazmat suits.
The patients were transported from a City MD on East 125th Street and Lexington Avenue by emergency workers in hazmat suits, after it was believed the patients had contracted the deadly African haemorrhagic fever.
Officials later said it was likely the patients had norovirus and not Ebola.
The patients are believed to have had contact with an individual who had travelled from Uganda and had signs consistent with the early stages of Ebola. However, the speed with which the infection then travelled between family members suggested it was not Ebola but norovirus.
“Neither patient had exposure to Ebola or other factors that would indicate risk,” Interim Commissioner of Health at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Dr. Michelle Morse wrote on X.
Ebola is generally spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Its symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and internal and external bleeding. Many of these symptoms are similar to those of norovirus; although norovirus is usually not deadly. Without treatment, 90% of Ebola cases are fatal.",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/ozempic-users-going-blind,Ozempic Users Going Blind,By Raw Egg Nationalist,17 days ago,"Users of weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Tirzepatide are going blind, according to a new study.
The study, published in JAMA Opthalmology, reports multiple cases of serious eye complications in users of the popular drugs for diabetes and obesity. These included seven cases of a condition where reduced blood flow to the optic nerve led to vision loss, a case of swelling of the optic nerve and a case of swelling affecting the retina.
Drugs like Ozempic and Tirzepatide work by mimicking natural hormones in the body that are released after eating. Ozempic primarily acts as an agonist for the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor, while Tirzepatide acts as an agonist for both the GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptors. By activating these receptors, the medications help to lower blood sugar levels and promote weight loss.
In recent months, as publicity for and use of these new “miracle” drugs has grown tremendously, more attention has been drawn to their side effects. Psychiatric issues, hormonal problems including reduced testosterone and loss of libido, inhalation of the contents of the stomach, and even permanent lifelong diarrhea have been reported.
Tens of thousands of people are now suing the manufacturers of Wegovy/Ozempic (Novo Nordisk) and Mounjaro (Eli Lilly) for the physical damages they claim to have suffered.
Huge payouts, in the hundreds of millions or even billions, may be necessary to stem the flood of claims.
One in eight Americans have used weight-loss drugs. Around 70% of Americans are now overweight or obese.
The majority of those using the drugs (61%) are using them to treat a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease. Just over 40% are diabetics.
A little over a quarter of users have heart disease. In March, Wegovy became the first weight-loss medication to be given FDA approval as a treatment to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Less than a quarter, or 22%, are taking the drugs because they have been diagnosed as being overweight, but 38% say they take the drugs to lose weight.
Weight-loss drugs like Ozempic can cost over $1000 a month without insurance coverage, rebates or discount coupons.",0

Kennedy Jr. said.
Speaking to “The Ingraham Angle” on Thursday, RFK said the new system is part of his effort to protect the health of Americans and hold vaccine manufacturers accountable for their products.
Asked if he believed the experimental Covid-19 vaccine or booster jabs were safe, RFK said he couldn’t accurately respond because “We don’t have good data on it, and that is a crime – the fact that we don’t have a surveillance system that actually works.”
Kennedy went on to describe the inefficiencies of the current federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which was intended to compensate vaccine victims who experience debilitating side effects, up to and including death, but has failed to do so adequately.
“In 2010, CDC had a surveillance system called the vaccine adverse event reporting system, and it’s supposed to pick up injuries, but CDC did a study of that system in 2010, and that study said – and this is a published study by CDC – that it captures less than one percent of the vaccine injuries. That’s inexcusable.”
Kennedy went on to say he’ll implement a new reporting system as has been requested by Congress and multiple health agencies.
“Congress and the Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences, have repeatedly ordered the CDC to put together a better vaccine reporting system. And we will do that right away.”
For decades, Americans have fallen victim to Big Pharma with little to no recourse; however, RFK is keenly aware of how their often faulty products sometimes lead to injuries and deaths and is determined to hold corporations liable to Make America Healthy Again.",0

Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as President Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services, Infowars is republishing this definitive analysis on issues that will no doubt be addressed now that America is ready to be healthy again.
Robert F. Kennedy Junior’s decision to retire and endorse Donald Trump has electrified a presidential race that was hardly lacking in excitement. Donald Trump had already come millimetres from having his head blown off, and Joe Biden was deposed in a carefully orchestrated palace coup, to make way for Kamala Harris. This has been a campaign of shocks and firsts, and now we can add another first to that list: a member of the Kennedy family supporting a Republican ticket.
In his announcement on Friday, before he joined Trump on stage in Arizona, Kennedy said that he would work with the Trump administration to “make America healthy again.” He described watching a generation of children grow up “damaged” as a result of poor diet and environmental pollution, and said that four more years of Democratic rule will “complete the consolidation of corporate and neocon power, and our children will be the ones that suffer most.”
“For 19 years I prayed, every morning, that God would put me in a position to end this calamity. The chronic-disease crisis was one of my primary reasons for running for president, along with ending the censorship and the Ukraine war.”
Now Kennedy is in a position to do that, and Trump has confirmed that he will head a task-force to investigate, and hopefully solve, America’s unprecedented health crisis.
The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, autism and AHDH, cancer, auto-immune conditions, infertility and reproductive issues, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s is exploding across the Western world, but especially in America, which leads the world, or once did, in virtually every single metric of ill health you could care to name. Over 40% of adults in the US are now classified as obese, and 1 in 36 American children have an autism-spectrum disorder.
On Friday, Kennedy identified two major contributors to this health crisis: ultra-processed food and toxic endocrine-disrupting chemicals. These are things Kennedy has talked about, at length, for years—decades, actually—including in the 2022 Tucker Carlson documentary The End of Men, which I’m proud to say I featured in prominently, alongside him.
The harmful effects of ultra-processed food and endocrine-disruptors are no longer fringe topics for discussion, but you may still be confused or unsure about what they are and why they’re bad. That’s where I come in. I’ve not been writing about these things for quite as long as RFK Jr. has, but I have been raising awareness about them for the last four years, including in my book The Eggs Benedict Option and my various media and podcast appearances.
On Saturday, I told you everything you need to know to understand what ultra-processed food is and why it’s so bad. Today, I’ll be telling you about endocrine disruptors.
These two primers can be shared with family and friends to help educate them and give them an incentive to improve their health by reducing their dependence on and exposure to ultra-processed foods and toxic chemicals.
WHAT ARE ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS?
Worry about endocrine disruptors is a relatively new thing. The first use of the term appears to date to 1991, and one of the earliest uses in the scientific literature was in a paper published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, two years later. In 2013, the World Health Organisation and the United Nations released a detailed report on endocrine disruptors that called for more research into their effects.
So what are endocrine disruptors?
In simple terms, endocrine disruptors are substances that can interfere with the body’s hormonal (endocrine) system, in a variety of different ways, from mimicking the body’s hormones, to preventing them from working properly or even disabling them.
Hormones govern more or less every single process in the human body, which means, worryingly, that endocrine-disruptors can affect—well, more or less every single process in the human body. There’s been a lot of focus in recent years on endocrine disruptors and sexual health, but as well as causing reduced fertility, genital deformations and demasculinisation, endocrine disruptors have been linked to altered immune function, cancers, diabetes, obesity, respiratory problems and neurological disabilities. Again, like with ultra-processed food, we’re finding out that these nasty chemicals seem to be one of the principal causes of all the prevailing chronic diseases of modernity.

Endocrine disruptors have been around for as long as humans have been around. There are lots of natural substances, mainly plant substances, that can interfere with or mimic bodily hormones. Soy, for example, contains natural endocrine-disrupting compounds. For thousands of years, in the Far East, Buddhist monks have consumed unfermented soy because it dampens their libido and helps them extinguish their worldly desires, which is a prerequisite for achieving enlightenment and Nirvana.
Soy does this because it contains phytoestrogens—literally, plant versions of the sex hormone estrogen—that alter the body’s natural testosterone-to-estrogen ratio, which governs sexual differentiation. Men have more testosterone than estrogen, and for women it’s the other way round. Alteration of that sex-specific ratio can affect everything from mood and libido to growth of the sexual organs, depending on the time and extent of the alteration. Exposure to endocrine disruptors during pregnancy can be absolutely devastating for the developing fetus, causing lifelong changes, as I’ll explain a little later.
Of course, Buddhist monks who were doing this didn’t know anything about phytoestrogens. They were simply working on the basis of observed cause and effect. Eat unfermented soy: no desire for sex, or anything else for that matter.
Another plant that was used medicinally in a similar way was hops, which are used to preserve beer and also contain powerful phytoestrogens. For centuries hops were used to treat women’s problems, including hot flushes and other symptoms of the menopause.
Natural endocrine disruptors are important, especially when you’re considering the effects of diet on health. The presence of large quantities of natural estrogens in foods like soy is one of the many reasons plant-based diets, especially vegan diets, are a bad idea. But it’s a different class of endocrine disruptor we should be more worried about. These are artificial chemicals that have only existed since the modern industrial age, but have come to be so ubiquitous we simply can’t escape them, wherever we go. They’re in the food, the water, the air, the soil, consumer products, perfumes, soaps, sunscreen, clothing—pretty much everything. Microplastics now carry endocrine disruptors into the deepest recesses of the human body and to the farthest-flung corners of the planet.
I want to say before I go any further, that it’s very easy to become disheartened—or “blackpilled,” in internet slang—when it comes to the ubiquity of these toxic chemicals, and others, in the modern world. I won’t lie to you: you’re going to be exposed to them. But there are simple things you can do as an individual to lower your exposure significantly, not least of all reducing your use of plastic in all its forms, eating organic food and filtering your drinking water. The bigger, more important, question, I think, is what the government and corporations are going to do to eliminate these chemicals from the environment, the food and water supply and consumer goods.
THE SCALE OF EXPOSURE TO ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS AND THEIR EFFECTS
In the 1960s, in the book Silent Spring, Rachel Carson suggested that mankind might be poisoning and polluting the environment on a scale and in a way that had no precedent in history. The very air, water and food supply, she claimed, were becoming toxic because of the widespread use of new industrial chemicals whose safety had not been properly established.
Carson focused particularly on the pesticide DDT. She documented the harms it caused to soldiers during World War II and claimed that the chemical industry was involved in a systematic campaign of disinformation about DDT’s effects, which scientists and government were only too ready to believe. The book received furious pushback from chemical manufacturers, as you’d expect, but the public, and eventually government, listened. DDT was banned for agricultural purposes in the US, and less than a decade later, the US Environmental Protection Agency was created by President Richard Nixon.
Despite the success of Silent Spring and the campaign against DDT, Rachel Carson’s broader warning went unheeded. We are now exposed, on a regular basis, to a huge number—actually, an unknown number—of chemicals with hormone-altering effects. Scientific studies have substantiated their effects rigorously and in detail, but a full reckoning of the effects of these chemicals, and of their interactions with one another in the bodies of living creatures, is a long way off if it will ever happen at all.
The reason for this, in large part, is the insane system of chemical regulation in the US, which operates on the assumption of “safe until proven otherwise,” much like the FDA’s system for licensing food additives, which I discussed in Saturday’s piece on ultra-processed food. Simply put, we allow chemicals to be used whose effects we take no real care to establish beforehand. And so it’s only much later, years or decades later, that we start to discover that something might be wrong, by which time there are huge vested interests against establishing the toxicity of these compounds and regulating them or even taking them off the market. I’ll come back to this at the end of the piece.
Many, but not all of these endocrine disruptors are estrogenic, meaning they mimic the hormone estrogen or interfere with the proper functioning of androgenic hormones like testosterone in the body. It seems to be a strange kink of industrial chemistry that so many modern chemicals, especially plastic chemicals but also pesticides and herbicides, turn out to be estrogenic. I like to joke sometimes that, were these chemicals androgenic—if they mimicked testosterone instead—world governments would have done something about them a long time ago, because all of a sudden they’d have a very muscular, pumped-up citizenry to deal with. But as such, because most endocrine disruptors we’re exposed to have estrogenic effects and make us put on weight, shed muscle, lose our motivation and libido and make it harder for us to reproduce, governments don’t have quite the same incentive for regulation.
Among these estrogenic chemicals are plasticisers like bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which are found not only in anything made of plastic but also in cosmetics and personal-care products; chemicals used in fire retardants like polybrominated biphenyls; herbicides and pesticides like glyphosate and atrazine; and even food additives like the colouring Red 40, which, according to one estimate, was present in 40% of all foods in a typical US store and 78% of all candy products.

Let’s consider one chemical as an example: the herbicide glyphosate.
Since 1974, it’s estimated that at least 1.6 billion kg of glyphosate has been used in the US alone, or roughly 20% of the total global usage of the chemical. Glyphosate is sprayed on everything from lawns to soybeans, wheat and corn. Bayer, good corporation that it is, is constantly looking to maximise its profits by finding new uses for the chemical, and so now farmers are using glyphosate as a dessicant, to dry out crops for harvest. That means a double-dose of this nasty chemical: one during planting, and another during harvesting, much closer to consumption. More glyphosate than ever is getting into our environment and our food.
It’s not a wonder that, when a large-scale study of glyphosate in urine samples was carried out recently, 80.2% of Americans over the age of six had detectable levels of the chemical in their samples. A study of pregnant women from the Midwest, where glyphosate is used most extensively for agriculture, showed that 99% of the women surveyed had it in their bodies. Glyphosate has been shown to cross the placental barrier during pregnancy, and is found in cord blood after birth.
Glyphosate was also recently discovered in the semen of French men at concentrations four times higher than in the blood. Seventy-three of 128 men tested as part of the study had the chemical in their seminal fluid. The highest concentrations, unsurprisingly, were found in the semen of a farmer, who was probably spraying the stuff all over his fields.
When glyphosate is sprayed, you inhale it and you get it on your skin. When you eat food treated with glyphosate or drink contaminated water, you swallow it. It’s in your urine, it’s in your blood and, if you’re a man, even your sperm are probably swimming in it. Like I said, it’s hard not to lose hope.
Because so many of these chemicals are estrogenic, one of the most worrying manifestations of our exposure to endocrine disruptors is their effects on fertility and the ability of men and women to reproduce. We hear a lot about various different factors depressing the Western birth rate today, especially economic and cultural factors, but we’re only just starting to appreciate that there’s a biological war taking place too, one that might actually make it impossible to reproduce.
According to reproductive health expert Professor Shanna Swan, exposure to endocrine disruptors is one of the principal causes of the massive decline in male fertility parameters, mainly testosterone levels and sperm quality and quantity, that’s been recorded in the Western world in the last fifty years. If current trends in male fertility continue, by 2050 the median man will have a sperm count of zero, which means one half of all men will produce no sperm at all, and the other half will produce so few they might as well produce none—they’re certainly not going to be getting a fertile woman pregnant any time soon.
This has been called a “spermageddon” scenario, and it’s not science fiction. Like I say, it’s just an extrapolation of current trends in male fertility. If you want to know more about this, read Professor Swan’s book Count Down, or watch her appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast.
This reproductive crisis touches both sexes equally. There’s been a focus on men, probably because we assume estrogenic compounds have the worst effects on them. But the truth is, the effects of these compounds on women are just as bad. A recent study from Singapore, for example, showed that women with the highest levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in their bodies had a 40% lower chance of conceiving and bringing a live baby to full term.
PFAS are found everywhere today, because of their use in the manufacture of plastics, fire retardants, greaseproof coatings, non-stick cookware, stain-resistant coatings and personal-care products. PFAS are known as “forever chemicals,” due to their molecular stability, which makes eliminating them from the environment very difficult. They accumulate at higher and higher levels up the food chain, so that large predators like whales and bears have huge quantities in their fat stores. The Inuit of Greenland, who eat these creatures as part of their traditional diet, have some of the highest levels of these chemicals in their body of any human group on earth.

Estrogenic chemicals have their most damaging effects when individuals are exposed to them during crucial windows of physical and sexual development, especially in the womb and during puberty. These windows of development are governed by the sex hormones in specific ratios—male fetuses and boys should be exposed to more testosterone than female fetuses and girls—so if endocrine disruptors are present, even in small amount, they can disrupt those specific ratios and have damaging lifelong physical and mental effects, ranging from genital malformation to gender dysphoria.
Yes, gender dysphoria. The spectacular rise of transgenderism in recent years may very well be, at least in part, as a result of growing exposure to estrogenic chemicals in our daily livesSexual development is governed by hormones, and that includes the development of the brain and the sense of self that is central to gender identity.
Eight years ago, Alex Jones was ridiculed for his claim that the herbicide atrazine could “turn the frickin’ frogs gay,” the implication being that it could do something similar to humans. Jones was referring to studies that showed how exposure to atrazine at levels common in the environment could cause African clawed frogs to change gender and mate—successfully—with frogs of the opposite sex. The “gay frogs rant” became a huge meme. Funny as it was, this was a huge shame, because it detracted from the obvious truth of what Alex was saying.
Now, there’s actually been a study published, for the first time, linking exposure to an endocrine-disrupting chemical, diethylstilbestrol (DES), with gender dysphoria and transgenderism. The study’s authors discovered that boys exposed to DES in utero were at least 100 times more likely to become male-to-female transgender than the highest reported background rate across Europe. Reliable figures for the number of transgender people as a percentage of the population vary wildly, so the actual increase in risk due to exposure to DES could be even higher.
I wrote about this study in detail, and why Alex Jones is owed an apology, in an article you can read here.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
As I said in my companion piece on ultra-processed food, a significant part of the problem is the way that novel substances are licensed and regulated in the US. The general attitude is one of “safe until proven otherwise,” which is reckless in the extreme and allows harmful substances to be unleashed on the public without adequate safety testing or even any testing at all.
A new project called the Plastic Health Map, funded by the Minderoo Foundation, reveals the full recklessness of this system. The researchers behind the project wanted to provide the first comprehensive database of studies of plastic chemicals and their health effects. Since the 1960s at least, there have been many thousands of studies of the damage plastics cause to living creatures, but nobody had ever thought to catalogue them, let alone make it possible to compare their findings to create a comprehensive profile of the risks. The Plastic Health Map database contains the findings of 3,500 studies on plastic chemicals published between 1961 and 2022. What’s more, it allows complex cross-referencing on the basis of a number of different study variables, such as type of chemical, health effects, the age of the research subjects and the year of publication.
The researchers weren’t able to look at every single study of every single plastic chemical there is. That would have proven an almost impossible task. Experts believe there may be as many as 13,000 chemicals involved in the manufacture of plastics, so a subset of around 1,500 was used. The chemicals chosen included familiar ones like bisphenols, PFAS, flame retardants and phthalates, as well as others that are much less well known.
Even with this smaller subset of chemicals, it quickly became clear to the researchers just how stunningly ignorant we are of the health effects of plastic chemicals. Although the researchers found nearly 3,500 relevant studies, these accounted for just 30% of the total number of chemicals sampled. Seventy percent of the chemicals had no known safety data at all.
If we extrapolate that to the full estimated total of 13,000 chemicals, that gives us a figure of over 9,000 plastic chemicals that have never been safety-tested at all. Nine thousand! And these are just chemicals associated with the manufacture of plastics.
It gets worse. An unfortunate side effect of the current licensing rules for chemicals is that, even when a chemical is identified as dangerous, the replacement often turns out to be as bad as, if not worse than, the chemical it replaced. Bisphenol A, for example, is now being phased  out of the manufacture of consumer goods and especially children’s toys and food items like bottles and sippy cups, because we know it is a harmful endocrine disruptor, but new studies are also showing that the chemicals brought in to replace it, such as bisphenol S, are just as bad and may even be worse. ATBC, a “safe” alternative to phthalates, has just recently been shown to impair neural development, and maternal exposure may lead to brain damage for the baby.
We’re going round in circles.
It’s clear to me that we need a total rethink of the way novel substances are licensed and regulated, whether they be industrial or agricultural chemicals on the one hand, or food additives on the other. “Harmful until proven otherwise” would be a much safer motto, as I’ve suggested before. I’m sure RFK Jr. would agree, and I’m sure he’d also agree that the perverse incentives of our current system exist because they benefit corporations principally, which are able to bring new products to market with a minimum of testing and fuss.
As well as preventing harmful chemicals from getting into the environment in the first place, we’re going to need to do something about those chemicals that are already out there, polluting the rivers and the streams and the soils. Government will need to invest in environmental protection on a larger scale than ever before, and the corporations that are responsible for the pollution should be made to pay too.
In the meantime, while we hope for a saner system of regulation and a great big clean-up, there are things we can all do, in our daily lives, to reduce our expose to harmful endocrine-disruptors. We can reduce our reliance on all forms of plastic as much as possible, especially plastic food containers. We can ditch cheap ultra-processed food and start preparing our own food at home. Better yet, start buying organic food and even start growing some food of our own. Filter our water. If you’re a woman especially, reduce your reliance on personal-care products, which are loaded with harmful chemicals. Exercise and proper sleep will also fortify your body against the effects of harmful chemicals, activating physiological processes. For example, rats that exercise do not suffer cognitive impairment due to phthalate exposure, apparently because exercise stimulates the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other important proteins involved in brain function.

Such simple interventions can go a long way. A study of 40 pregnant women in rural and urban Idaho showed that just one week of eating organic food can reduce concentrations of glyphosate in the urine by as much as 43%.
This shouldn’t be surprising. Testing of non-organic food has revealed that glyphosate is omnipresent, especially in processed and fast food. An investigation by non-profit Moms Across America showed that 100% of food samples from the top 20 fast-food outlets contained glyphosate. Most shockingly, the highest levels were in samples from Panera Bread, which claims to be a purveyor of “clean, wholesome foods.” Levels of glyphosate in samples from Panera Bread were almost 95 times higher than the total in samples from Chipotle.
The scale of America’s health problems is staggering. But Americans shouldn’t feel helpless. The 2024 election is the first time the health of the nation has truly been on the ballot. Americans will have a choice. They can carry on as before, changing nothing and accepting the certainty of ill health. Or they can say “enough is enough” and try something radically different—an adventure that might lead, in the end, to the health and vitality they surrendered long ago.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/rfk-special-what-are-ultra-processed-foods-and-why-are-they-so-bad-for-us,RFK Jr. Special: What Are Ultra-Processed Foods and Why Are They So Bad for Us?,By Raw Egg Nationalist,18 days ago,"Editor’s note: Now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as President Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services, Infowars is republishing this definitive analysis on issues that will no doubt be addressed now that America is ready to be healthy again.
Robert F. Kennedy Junior’s decision to retire and endorse Donald Trump has electrified a presidential race that was hardly lacking in excitement. Donald Trump had already come millimetres from having his head blown off, and Joe Biden was deposed in a carefully orchestrated palace coup, to make way for Kamala Harris. This has been a campaign of shocks and firsts, and now we can add another first to that list: a member of the Kennedy family supporting a Republican ticket.
In his announcement on Friday, before he joined Trump on stage in Arizona, Kennedy said that he would work with the Trump administration to “make America healthy again.” He described watching a generation of children grow up “damaged” as a result of poor diet and environmental pollution, and said that four more years of Democratic rule will “complete the consolidation of corporate and neocon power, and our children will be the ones that suffer most.”
“For 19 years I prayed, every morning, that God would put me in a position to end this calamity. The chronic-disease crisis was one of my primary reasons for running for president, along with ending the censorship and the Ukraine war.”
Now Kennedy is in a position to do that, and Trump has confirmed that he will head a task-force to investigate, and hopefully solve, America’s unprecedented health crisis.
The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, autism and AHDH, cancer, auto-immune conditions, infertility and reproductive issues, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s is exploding across the Western world, but especially in America, which leads the world, or once did, in virtually every single metric of ill health you could care to name. Over 40% of adults in the US are now classified as obese, and 1 in 36 American children have an autism-spectrum disorder.
On Friday, Kennedy identified two major contributors to this health crisis: ultra-processed food and toxic endocrine-disrupting chemicals. These are things Kennedy has talked about, at length, for years—decades, actually—including in the 2022 Tucker Carlson documentary The End of Men, which I’m proud to say I featured in prominently, alongside him.
The harmful effects of ultra-processed food and endocrine-disruptors are no longer fringe topics for discussion, but you may still be confused or unsure about what they are and why they’re bad. That’s where I come in. I’ve not been writing about these things for quite as long as RFK Jr. has, but I have been raising awareness about them for the last four years, including in my book The Eggs Benedict Option and my various media and podcast appearances.
Today and on Monday, I’ll be telling you everything you need to know to get a handle on ultra-processed food and endocrine disruptors. These two primers can be shared with family and friends to help educate them and give them an incentive to improve their health by reducing their dependence on and exposure to ultra-processed foods and toxic chemicals.
Today I’ll tell you about ultra-processed foods in particular.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF FOOD PROCESSING
Food has been processed since the dawn of human history, or at least as far back as we can see through the mists of time. Our distant ancestors used fire to cook meat and other foods, and they discovered how to grind wild grains to make flour for early forms of bread. They also discovered how to harness bacteria—not that they knew anything about microbes—to ferment foods, helping to preserve and increase their digestibility and nutritional value in the process. They learned other preservation techniques like drying, smoking and, where the weather was cold enough, freezing.
Food prepared using any one or more of these techniques satisfies the common-sense definition of “processed food,” and for the longest span of human history, until the nineteenth century, this is how food was processed by human beings, if it was processed at all.
We cooked at home. Bread was made at home or in a local bakery. The majority of ingredients were sourced locally, apart from luxury items obtained through long-distance trade like sugar and spices.
In the last century or so, food began to be processed and sold to the public in new ways. Food started to be manufactured in factories owned by large-scale conglomerates, using new industrial processes and new ingredients like hydrogenated oils, seed and vegetable oils, refined sugars and refined grains. Special additives were created to alter the properties of the food produced—to alter its texture, color it or make it last longer—and new storage methods like canning and tinning also meant that the shelf-life of food could be extended, allowing these foods to reach new markets at home and overseas.
The creation of the first factory-made foods heralded a major shift in Western dietary patterns, and these foods soon made their way outside the West, to every corner of the globe.
The immediate effects of this dietary shift were nothing short of disastrous. The pioneering dentist Weston A. Price described the early effects in his classic book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration, from 1939, a book I consider to be the greatest book on nutrition ever written.
Price noticed worrying changes in the physical health of his patients, especially the children, in his practice in Cleveland, Ohio. It wasn’t just that their teeth were getting worse—and they were: their mouths were suddenly full of cavities—it’s that the entire structure of their faces seemed to be collapsing. The teeth themselves, the jaw and the roof of the mouth weren’t forming properly, and nor were the cheeks or nasal passages. What’s more, these worrying physical changes were accompanied by behavioural changes, including learning difficulties, that had previously been unknown.
One of the most amazing parts, and the most difficult for us to process as ""moderns"", of Weston Price's classic book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration (1939) is the fact that traditional peoples eating their ancestral diets rarely if ever suffered from diseases like cancer.… pic.twitter.com/hvq6Qz2EKu
— RAW EGG NATIONALIST (@Babygravy9) July 30, 2023

Price knew that diet had to be to blame, and eventually he got the chance to test his hypothesis with rigor. He travelled the globe with his wife, visiting small-scale communities on every inhabited continent, from the Inuit in the Arctic to pastoralists like the Nuer and Masai in Africa, and even remote communities in Europe, like the crofters and fishermen of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and the high Alpine Swiss. Price found that, wherever the people in these communities cleaved to their ancestral diets—wherever they ate locally produced whole foods, and especially nutrient-dense animal foods like organ meat, fatty cuts of meat, dairy, seafood and shellfish, eggs, blood products and butter—the people displayed remarkable health and vigor, including resistance to infectious diseases. The symptoms of physical degeneration Price had seen back in Ohio were totally absent.
But wherever these people deviated from their ancestral diets and started eating Western industrial foods—especially tinned foods high in sugar and refined wheat products—the symptoms of physical degeneration became apparent very quickly.
Weston Price’s work provided an early warning against the abandonment of traditional diets for new factory-made foods. Sadly, it went unheeded. In the decades since, we have moved further and further away from our traditional diets in the West, and across the rest of the world, increasing our reliance on factory-made foodstuffs that contain ingredients and additives that humans have little or even no history of ever consuming. The manufacture of processed foods has become more and more sophisticated, employing new techniques and an ever-expanding list of ingredients. Importantly, processed-food manufacturers have employed powerful targeted advertising that focuses on their products’ convenience and irresistible moreishness. These are the true “ultra-processed foods.”
PROCESSED FOOD TODAY
Before we go any further, here’s a minimal working definition of ultra-processed food: food that’s produced in a factory, contains one or more ingredients you wouldn’t find in a normal home kitchen—emulsifiers, humectants, colourings, stabilisers, preservatives—and is sold to you wrapped in plastic.
There’s a certain amount of quibbling about the definition of ultra-processed food, especially from scientists who happen to be funded by manufacturers of ultra-processed food, but it’s absolutely clear that there is a significant difference between the kind of processed food people are consuming in enormous quantities today and even the sort of foods Weston Price associated with physical degeneration back in the 1930s.
In many Western countries, children now derive the majority of their daily calories from ultra-processed food. A study from 2021 showed that toddlers in the UK (children aged between two and five) derive an average of 61% of their daily calories from ultra-processed food. Toddlers in the US hardly fare much better, getting 58% of their daily calories from ultra-processed food.
Scientific research has linked processed foods to virtually every single one of the prevailing chronic diseases of modernity I discussed at the beginning of this piece—to everything from autism to Alzheimer’s.

The best way to illustrate the whole host of problems associated with massive processed-food consumption would be to point you in the direction of a BBC documentary that was made during the pandemic. In What Are We Feeding Our Kids? a British doctor called Chris Van Tulleken spent one month eating a diet comprising 80% ultra-processed food. At least one fifth of British adults now follow such a diet.
The changes Dr Van Tulleken experienced were shocking. He gained a considerable amount of weight. He suffered from constipation and hemorrhoids. He couldn’t sleep, and began waking up in the middle of the night to raid the fridge for more sugary snacks, despite, by his own admission, not being hungry. His libido disappeared and he became paranoid and anxious.
MRI scans taken before and after the experiment revealed that Van Tulleken’s brain had actually been rewired in the manner we’d expect of a drug addict. The scans showed significant increases in connections between areas linking reward and automatic behaviour, and these changes appeared to be permanent. Months after the experiment ended, the connections were still lighting up under the scanner. He had been hardwired to crave ultra-processed food.
Manufacturers of ultra-processed foods are well aware their food is addictive. They make it that way deliberately. They call this addictiveness “hyperpalatability,” and they employ small armies of highly paid food scientists to exploit the complicated neurobiology of food pleasure—sensations like sweetness, saltiness, crunch and chew—to ensure that consumers reach the so-called “bliss point” and can’t stop eating.
A 2019 study showed that we eat ultra-processed foods 30% faster than normal foods. As a result, our bodies’ natural hormone mechanisms to signal satiety don’t have time to respond. That means we overeat, and if all we eat is ultra-processed food, we overeat all the time.
I’ve called ultra-processed food “weaponized food” with good reason. The companies that manufacture it know exactly what they’re doing and why. Of course, if you were a food manufacturer, you’d probably do that too: you’d want to maximize your profits as well. But that doesn’t make it right.
Interestingly, recent research has shown that tobacco companies may have played a pivotal role in hooking consumers on new ultra-processed foods in the 1980s, deploying the same marketing tricks and techniques as they used to hook people on cigarettes decades earlier. RFK Jr. has mentioned this.
WHAT’S WRONG WITH ULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD?
It’s not simply that ultra-processed food is designed to be overeaten, and overeating anything will, at the very least, make you overweight. The individual ingredients that go into processed food are bad too.
Processed food is full of cheap, low-quality ingredients, many of which are now genetically modified. Production of the base commodities that are turned into these ingredients—which means corn and soy, principally—is heavily subsidized by the US government. Processed food has been the main vehicle for corn and soy producers to get rid of the vast amounts of these crops they produce annually, whether in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, modified corn starch, soy protein or soybean oil. If you want to know more, in detail, about why American farmers produce so much corn and how it ends up in so much of the food Americans eat, I’d recommend you read Michael Pollan’s book The Omnivore’s Dilemma.
One ingredient of particular concern in ultra-processed food is seed and vegetable oils, which RFK Jr. has singled out for their health effects on a number of occasions, including during his announcement on Friday night. Although seed and vegetable oils have been marketed as healthy alternatives to traditional animal fats for the last 70 years, the truth is that they are anything but healthy. A large body of scientific evidence now links these novel fats to chronic inflammation, which is the cause of many diseases, as well as obesity and genetic dysregulation in animals and humans. These fats are toxic by their very nature, and shouldn’t be consumed in the kind of quantities people are consuming them today, mainly via processed food.

Take soybean oil, for example, consumption of which has increased a thousandfold over the last century. A study from 2020 showed that, as well as being obesogenic, soybean oil causes serious genetic dysregulation and neurological damage in mice. The genes affected included genes associated with inflammation, neuroendocrine and neurochemical processes, insulin signalling, and the production of oxytocin, the “love hormone,” which is responsible for social bonding. Other genes that were affected are linked to neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, and autism. The authors of the study conclude that, although the study was conducted on mice, the results are likely to hold for humans as well: “the [soybean-oil-rich] American diet may be not only contributing to increased rates of metabolic disease but also affecting neurological function.”
But it’s not just the “food” ingredients that we should be worried about. In recent years, there’s been a growing focus on the harmful effects of the non-nutritional additives that are found in ultra-processed food. These are the kind of ingredients you won’t find in a standard home kitchen: things like emulsifiers, colourings, humectants, texturisers, preservatives and anti-fungals, anti-caking agents and so on.
Artificial sweeteners, for example, have been linked to depression and gut dysbiosis—disruption of the digestive system—which is, in turn, linked to a whole host of other illnesses, from behavioural conditions like autism and ADHD, to neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s.
The US system of food additives, under the management of the FDA, is a beacon of stupidity and corruption. I’ve described the FDA’s “Generally Recognised as Safe” (GRAS) system as “Generally Recognised as Insane” for the ridiculous attitude to novel ingredients it licenses. The system was first introduced in 1958, when the Food Additive Amendments were passed, to require that all non-standard food additives—the kind of things that aren’t typically found in a normal kitchen—should be tested adequately for safety in humans.
When the new system was introduced, there were reckoned to be about 700 food additives in use, 400 of which were thought to be safe in the long term. The new system was supposed to guarantee additives that were already in the food supply were safe, but what happened instead was a process of “grandfathering,” where substances that were in use were simply assumed to be safe, for that very reason. That included substances like potassium bromate, which over 50 years’ worth of research has since shown to be linked to cancers such as thyroid and testicular cancer, kidney damage, gut dysbiosis and reproductive issues. The EU, Canada, China and India have now banned it. Even Nigeria has banned it. But not the US.
Around 2,000 additives are licensed for use in the EU. In the US, the figure rises to 10,000—and that’s just an estimate. Nobody knows how many additives are in the food supply, not even the FDA, because companies are simply introducing additives without telling anybody. A company can produce a new food additive, decide it’s safe and then bring it to market without any scrutiny from the FDA at all.
How did this happen?
When companies began applying for GRAS designation, they were allowed to submit their own safety data for their novel ingredients, which the FDA could then choose to accept or reject. But as a huge backlog of applications started to build up at the FDA, companies chose to add novel ingredients to their products without consulting the FDA at all. The FDA could have asserted its authority, but it did what any poorly staffed, totally compromised institution like the FDA would do: It simply made the problem disappear by defining it out of existence. The FDA retrospectively normalised the situation, a process that was finally completed in 2016. And so a company can produce a new food additive, decide it’s safe and bring it to market without any scrutiny from the FDA at all.
We are now at the corrupt heart of the American food supply today, at the center of a system that favors corporate producers at the expense of the people it claims to nourish. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is right. If we are ever going to make America healthy again, the corporations that produce its food must be brought into line. They must be made to serve the needs of the American people, and not the other way round.

Anita Somani and Tristan Rader announced they plan to introduce the ‘Conception Begins at Erection Act’ which would make ejaculation a felony if the semen was released in a manner not consistent with a few exceptions, such as a gay orgasm within the LGBTQIAAP2S+ community.
“The bill would make it a felony for a man to have unprotected sex without wanting a baby,” Ohio 19 News said Thursday night. “It does have some exceptions. It doesn’t apply if protection or contraception is used, if someone is masturbating, or donating sperm and it doesn’t apply to members of the LGBTQ+ community.”

Somani explained why such unlawful sperm releases are felonious. Third-wave feminism appears to be the philosophy behind her legal theory.
“As an OBGYN the bills that have been proposed with reproductive rights have also proposed felonies and fines for healthcare providers for people who support those women or those folks who want to go get reproductive care so we shouldn’t be penalizing reproductive care for anybody and that again, is why we have the felony piece of this bill,” Somani said.
They should call it the Dishonorable Discharge Act.

Somani is hopeful she will get to introduce her bill in the next few months, allowing male Ohioans at least a few more months of unregulated ejaculations.
“I know how ludicrous my bill sounds,” Somani said in an op-ed. “What I am doing is making a point.”
Perhaps focusing on making points like this and not points on how to improve the lives of the American people are a major reason Democrats have taken an ‘L’ in the 2024 election.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/a-look-into-the-link-between-vaccine-induced-viral-reactivation-autism,A Look Into The Link Between Vaccine-Induced Viral Reactivation & Autism,By Kelen McBreen,19 days ago,"Health Uncensored researcher Matt Cormier published a study in recent months exploring the connection between vaccines and autism.
In a brief video report describing his findings, Cormier explained that common viral infections in the brain could potentially be reactivated by vaccines, triggering the onset of autism spectrum disorder.
There is evidence that vaccinations are activating dormant infections such as herpes by disrupting the immune system.
Basically, research suggests viral infections play a role in developing autism and that vaccines may trigger the disorder by activating viruses people are already carrying.
Recently confirmed Donald Trump Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was questioned about his comments linking vaccines to autism during his Senate confirmation hearings earlier this month.
Kennedy stated during the hearing that autism rates “have gone from 1 in 10,000 to today in our children, it’s one in 34,” with President Donald Trump echoing the statement on Truth Social.
Perhaps, the dangerous connection will be exposed under RFK’s HHS leadership.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/sick-12-year-old-jd-vance-relative-denied-heart-transplant-over-lack-of-covid-flu-shots,Sick! 12-Year-Old JD Vance Relative Denied Heart Transplant Over Lack Of Covid & Flu Shots,By Kelen McBreen,20 days ago,"After ten years of treatment at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital for two rare heart conditions, a 12-year-old girl who is related to Vice President J.D. Vance through marriage is being denied a heart transplant due to her Covid “vaccine” status.
The young lady, Adaline Deal, is being discriminated against because she has not received a COVID-19 or flu shot.
After Cincinnati Children’s denied the Deal family’s religious exemption over the shots earlier this month, they are now looking for another health care facility to perform the surgery.
Fox 19 received a statement from the hospital, which read, “At Cincinnati Children’s, clinical decisions are guided by science, research, and best practices. We tailor care plans to each patient in collaboration with their family to ensure the safest, most effective treatment.”
The mother, Janeen Deal, told The Cincinnati Enquirer, “I thought, wow. So, it’s not about the kid. It’s not about saving her life… It’s not right.”
The hospital requires Covid and flu vaccinations for transplant recipients because they are allegedly more vulnerable to infections, but fails to acknowledge the same individuals would be more likely to suffer an adverse reaction to the experimental Covid shot for the same reason.
“I know I cannot put this (vaccine) in her body knowing what we know and how we feel about it,” Janeen said.
According to the New York Post, Adaline is related to Vance by marriage through his half-siblings.
The girl was adopted by the Deal family from China when she was four years old.
The family has now resorted to a GoFundMe account seeking money to put towards a transplant at a facility that won’t require the child to receive a dangerous Covid jab.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/merck-fda-knew-gardasil-hpv-vaccine-was-contaminated-with-dna,"Merck, FDA Knew Gardasil HPV Vaccine Was Contaminated With DNA","By Maryanne Demasi, Ph.D. | The Defender",21 days ago,"A landmark lawsuit against Merck is underway in a Los Angeles courtroom, marking the company’s first jury trial over claims it misrepresented the safety of its highly profitable Gardasil HPV vaccine.
Newly declassified documents in the trial have revealed troubling details about Merck’s failure to conduct key safety tests.
Internal emails reveal that Merck knew its Gardasil vaccine was contaminated with HPV DNA fragments from the vaccine‘s manufacturing process and lobbied regulators to bypass testing requirements.
Uncovering residual DNA contamination
Concerns over Gardasil’s residual DNA contamination have persisted for over a decade.
In 2011, Dr. Sin Hang Lee, a pathologist with extensive experience in DNA analysis, discovered high levels of HPV DNA fragments in 16 Gardasil vials from several countries, including the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Poland and France. (See previous story here.)
These DNA fragments, originating from the plasmid DNA used in vaccine production to code for the HPV virus’s L1 protein, are supposed to be removed during manufacturing.
Instead, high levels of HPV DNA fragments remain in the final product and tightly bind to the aluminum adjuvant. Unlike free DNA molecules in solution, the aluminum-bound HPV DNA is stabilized and resists breakdown by enzymes.
Once injected, these aggregates are absorbed by immune cells and activate Toll-like receptor 9(TLR9), triggering pro-inflammatory responses.
According to Lee, for some individuals, particularly those with genetic predispositions, this can lead to autoimmune conditions such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) or, in rare cases, sudden death.
Notably, Gardasil’s package inserts make no mention of the presence of HPV DNA or its potential to trigger immune responses.
Internal emails reveal negligence and cover-up
Lee is set to testify in the lawsuit, and his witness statement provides key evidence suggesting Merck was aware of the issue of HPV DNA contamination but failed to act.
Following Lee’s findings in 2011, Merck was asked by the Swiss drug regulator, Swissmedic, to provide data on HPV DNA levels in Gardasil.
In response, Merck’s Chief Medical Officer Carlos Sattler made a revealing admission to his colleagues in an internal email. On Sept. 8, 2011, Sattler admitted “We did not specifically look for the HPV L1 plasmid DNA.”
Despite this, Sattler downplayed the significance of the contamination, stating that Merck had “no plans” to conduct any testing and that, even if small amounts were present, there was “no evidence that this would be associated with any risk.”
The next day, Merck scientist Annie Sturgess confirmed, “We have not directly measured HPV DNA” in the vaccine.
Merck attempted to satisfy Swissmedic by estimating the level of HPV DNA using “yeast DNA” content as a proxy, but the regulator rejected this approach.
Thomas Hottiger, Ph.D., of Swissmedic warned Merck that its method was “not entirely fit for purpose” and explained that the company would need to use a PCR test specific for detecting HPV plasmid DNA, which behaves differently from yeast DNA.
Merck’s North American representative, Dave Wohlpart, expressed reluctance to perform such testing and proposed to his colleagues that Merck “not do testing” altogether.
On Oct. 21, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made a public announcement claiming that Merck had actually known that “small quantities of residual recombinant HPV L1-specific DNA fragments remain in the vaccine.”
This disclosure came as a surprise to Merck.
Frank Vandendriessche, Merck’s director of Regulatory Affairs in Europe, reacted to the FDA’s announcement, writing in an email that the company had “never tested specifically for HPV L1 DNA fragments.”
Merck used the situation to its advantage to suggest it was now a moot point. Armed with the FDA’s announcement, Merck lobbied Swissmedic to withdraw its request for new data.
Swissmedic obliged, granting a waiver for specific HPV DNA testing. Instead, Merck was instructed to make a minor change to the product’s label — effectively burying the issue.
Regulatory failure: Complicity or incompetence?
Gardasil was approved and distributed globally without proper testing for HPV L1 DNA contamination. Instead of enforcing rigorous safety standards, regulators allowed Merck’s flawed testing procedures to pass unchecked.
Even when evidence of contamination surfaced, regulators largely overlooked it, revealing a pattern of negligence and wilful blindness.
Their reluctance to demand accountability suggests either regulatory capture or gross incompetence — both of which have devastating consequences for the millions who have received the vaccine.
This trial may not only determine Merck’s liability — it could force a long-overdue reckoning with the regulatory agencies that have shielded pharmaceutical giants from scrutiny for far too long.
Lee will take the stand and testify at the trial on Feb. 13.

NBC affiliate WOOD reported that Corewell Health will no longer begin new “transition” interventions for anyone below age 19, though it will see already-started hormone regimens to completion. “We remain committed to providing the highest quality health care to all the patients we serve,” Corewell said in a statement, adding it will “continue monitoring federal changes to rules and regulations.”
The move follows an order signed by Trump to end all federal support for “transition” procedures on minors, rescind or amend all of the Biden health bureaucracy’s past endorsements of underage “transitioning,” review the medical literature on the subject, enforce all existing restrictions on underage “transitioning,” and take regulatory action to “end” the practice to the greatest extent possible under current law.
A significant body of evidence shows that “affirming” gender confusion carries serious harms, especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity, and life experience to consider the long-term ramifications of the decisions being pushed on them, or full knowledge about the long-term effects of life-altering, physically transformative, and often-irreversible surgical and chemical procedures.
Studies find that more than 80 percent of children suffering gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence, and that “reassignment” procedures fail to resolve gender-confused individuals’ heightened tendency to engage in self-harm and suicide – and even exacerbate it, including by reinforcing their confusion and neglecting the actual root causes of their mental strife.
Many oft-ignored detransitioners attest to the physical and mental harm of reinforcing gender confusion, as well as to the bias and negligence of the medical establishment on the subject, many of whom take an activist approach to their profession and begin cases with a predetermined conclusion that “transitioning” is the best solution.
“Gender-affirming” physicians have also been caught on video admitting to more old-fashioned motives for such procedures, as with a 2022 exposé about Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Clinic for Transgender Health, where Dr. Shayne Sebold Taylor said outright that “these surgeries make a lot of money.”
Meanwhile, Democrat Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is encouraging healthcare providers to continue offering to transition children, noting that “availability of federal funding has no bearing on Michiganders’ right to seek and receive healthcare services without discrimination,” and hinting the state may file discrimination suits against those that cease to offer it.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/florida-county-unanimously-votes-to-remove-fluoride-from-its-water-supply,Florida County Unanimously Votes to Remove Fluoride From its Water Supply,By Stephen Kokx | Lifesite,21 days ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Lee County, Florida, has joined a growing list of municipalities in the Sunshine State that have stopped fluoridating their water supply.
Last Tuesday, commissioners voted 5-0 to remove the controversial compound, which is touted by the American Dental Association as a beneficial tool in the fight against cavities despite widespread evidence that it causes health problems.
County lawmakers received praise from Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo, among others.
“Congratulations to the freedom loving people of Lee County & the courageous county commissioners,” Ladapo said on X. “Your decision to stop water fluoridation is backed by science & will improve the health of your communities.”
According to various media outlets, Lee County has followed Everglades City, Cape Coral, Marco Island, Immokalee, Naples County, Collier County, and Bonita Springs Utilities in not fluoridating its water.
Ladapo has shown bold leadership on an array of health issues in recent years. Last November, he issued a statement urging elected officials to remove fluoride from their water. He said that studies clearly show it to be a “neurotoxin” that can impair the intelligence of children, damage their pineal gland, and negatively impact their thyroid.
Water fluoridation was a top-tier campaign issue in the battle for medical freedom last year. During the 2024 presidential race, Donald Trump told NBC News that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s proposal to remove fluoride from public water supplies “sounds okay” to him.
Since then, Trump appointed Kennedy to be head of the Health and Human Services Department. His confirmation vote is expected to take place any day.
Water fluoridation garnered national headlines also because a bombshell report published by the Department of Health and Human Services last August revealed that excessive fluoride consumption in children has been linked to a two to five-point IQ reduction. The startling admission prompted Edward Chen, an Obama-appointed federal judge, to order the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen regulations around fluoride. Kennedy drew attention to the ruling on X.
Medical freedom activist Maija Hahn is encouraging concerned Floridians who want to urge their cities to end water fluoridation to attend city meetings in the coming days. She posted an image on X showing the place and time of town halls this week.
2020 data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that roughly 73 percent of the U.S. population has access to fluoridated water through public water systems, though that number is likely to decrease if Kennedy is approved by the Senate.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/searches-for-abortion-on-cdc-website-now-direct-users-to-look-up-adoption,Searches For ‘Abortion’ on CDC Website Now Direct Users to Look up ‘Adoption’,By Doug Mainwaring | Lifesite,21 days ago,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (LifeSiteNews) — In a move that some workers in the so-called “reproductive health” industry say is a “clear attempt” to change how conversations around pregnancy are approached, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website no longer returns search results for the word “abortion” and instead suggests that users try searching the word “adoption.”
One pro-life advocate called the change in the CDC’s website a “HUGE WIN.”
Conservative talk show host Christopher Calvin Reid proclaimed on X, “GREAT NEWS! The Trump administration is scrubbing [so-called] reproductive health care information from the CDC website.”
“Oh, and by the way, the site also suggests ‘adoption’ when people search for ‘abortion’!!!” he added.

“I saw this today and tears came down my face,” said Christian musician Sean Feucht on X. “I know it seems … simple but this is the moment we’ve prayed for.”
The change is just one of several in the CDC’s website that appeared after the site went offline shortly after President Donald Trump’s inauguration in order to comply with executive orders issued by Trump.
Terms scrubbed or edited from the CDC’s website include thousands of references to “transgender” individuals, so-called “LGBTQ+ health,” and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), as well as HIV testing guidelines for gender-confused people, recommendations for HIV medication, and resources on “LGBTQ+ youth health,” according to a Newsmax report.
The CDC’s vaccine advisory page also dropped references to the monkeypox (“mpox”) vaccine, according to Newsmax.
Not everyone was thrilled with the omission of “abortion” as a searchable term from the CDC website.
“It’s a very strange thing to do because the decision tree around pregnancy is to either continue the pregnancy or not,” Meghan Eagen-Torkko, director of the school of nursing at Eastern Michigan University, told The Hill.
“If the pregnancy is continued, then the decision becomes parenting or not,” said Eagen-Torkko. “There’s no point in that when abortion and adoption are on the same branch.”
Jezebel, the leftist website for women, said the move by the CDC was “alarming.”
“CDC Site Ominously Redirects Searches For Abortion to Adoption,” blared the Jezebel headline.
“Key federal websites are increasingly scrubbing and replacing vital, objective information to push the new administration’s far-right agenda – including manipulatively presenting adoption as an alternative for abortion,” lamented the outlet.",0

Posted by health activist Melissa Simonson, the viral clip shows the moment she learned at a school district meeting that the DOD funds school lunch programs and only allows them to purchase food from approved companies, which are mostly megacorporations selling processed garbage.
“They’ll [DOD] give us hundreds of thousands of dollars, but we can only spend it in their channels,” said a woman at the meeting. “We purchase through DOD, they have their own ordering guide and we purchase through them but they work out the contracts throughout the country… we have no control over that.”
The woman provided an anecdote about bananas being sent to her school that would “not ripen” even after two weeks, explaining they requested the DOD take them off the menu as they could not be eaten.
Since the government only allows schools to purchase items from their providers, the school district was left with no banana option at all instead of simply buying from another supplier.
Simonson asked at the meeting, “If the Department of Defense is supplying the food, and they are the ones who are supplying the contracts with these mega corporations like General Mills, Tyson, Nestle, Kellogg’s, then they are incentivized to get the lowest quality at the highest price, right? So, the more processed the better for them.”
Popular 𝕏 account “Wall Street Apes” shared the video, wondering, “Why is the DoD providing school lunch contracts in America? EXCELLENT question… We need Elon Musk, DOGE and RFK Jr.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-most-dramatic-narrative-shift-in-modern-history,The Most Dramatic Narrative Shift in Modern History,By Jeffrey A. Tucker | Brownstone Institute,22 days ago,"The most dramatic narrative shift in this post-lockdown period has been the flip in the perceptions of government itself. For decades and even centuries, government was seen as the essential bulwark to defend the poor, empower the marginalized, realize justice, even the playing field in commerce, and guarantee rights to all.
Government was the wise manager, curbing the excess of populist enthusiasm, blunting the impact of ferocious market dynamics, guaranteeing the safety of products, breaking up dangerous pockets of wealth accumulation, and protecting the rights of minority populations. That was the ethos and the perception.
Taxation itself was sold to the population for centuries as the price we pay for civilization, a slogan emblazoned in marble at the DC headquarters of the IRS and attributed to Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who said this in 1904, ten years before the federal income tax was even legal in the US.
This claim was not just about a method of funding; it was a commentary on the perceived merit of the whole of the public sector.
Yes, this view had challengers on the right and left but their radical critiques rarely took hold of the public mind in a sustained way.
A strange thing happened in 2020.
Most governments at all levels across the globe turned on their people. It was a shock because governments had never before attempted anything this audacious. It claimed to be exercising mastery over the whole of the microbial kingdom, the world over. It would prove this implausible mission as a valid one with the release of a magic potion made and distributed with its industrial partners who were fully indemnified against liability claims.
Suffice it to say that the potion did not work. Everyone got Covid anyway. Most everyone shook it off. Those who died were often denied common therapeutics to make way for a shot that clocked the highest rate of injury and death on public record. A worse fiasco would be hard to invent outside dystopian fiction.
Participating in this grand crusade were all the commanding heights. That included mass media, academia, the medical industry, the information systems, and science itself. After all, the very notion of “public health” itself implies a “whole of government” and a “whole of society” effort. Indeed, science – with its high status earned from many centuries of achievement – led the way.
The politicians – the people for whom the public votes and who form the one real connection that the people have with the regimes under which they live – went along but did not seem to be in the driver’s seat. Nor did the courts seem to have much role. They were closed along with small businesses, schools, and houses of worship.
The controlling forces in every nation traced to something else we did not normally think of as government. It was the administrators who occupied agencies that were deemed independent of public awareness or control. They worked closely with their industrial partners in tech, pharma, banking, and corporate life.
The Constitution did not matter. Neither did the long tradition of rights, liberty, and law. The workforce was divided between essential and nonessential in order to survive the great emergency. The essential people were the ruling class plus the workers who serve them. Everyone else was deemed unessential to social functioning.
It was supposed to be for our health – government merely looking after us – but this claim lost credibility quickly, as mental and physical health plummeted. Desperate loneliness replaced community. Loved ones were forcibly separated. The aged died alone with digital funerals. Weddings and worship were cancelled. Gyms were closed and then opened later only for the masked and the vaxxed. The arts died. Substance abuse skyrocketed because while everything else was closed the liquor stores and pot shops were open for business.
Here was when perceptions dramatically changed. Government was not what we thought. It is something else. It does not serve the public. It serves its own interests. Those interests are deeply woven into the fabric of industry and civil society. The agencies are captured. The largesse flows mainly to the well-connected.
The bills are paid by the people who had been deemed nonessential and who were now being compensated for the troubles with direct payments that were created by a printing press. Within a year, this showed up in the form of inflation that dramatically reduced real income during an economic crisis.
This huge experiment in pharmacological planning ended up flipping the rubrical narrative that had largely covered public affairs for everyone’s lifetimes. The terrible reality was being broadcast to the whole population in ways no one had ever before experienced. Centuries of philosophy and rhetoric were being shredded before our eyes, as whole populations came face-to-face with the unthinkable: government had become a grand scam or even criminal enterprise, a machinery that served only elite plans and elite institutions.
As it turns out, generations of ideological philosophizing had been chasing fictional rabbits. This is true for all the main debates about socialism and capitalism but also the side debates about religion, demographics, climate change, and so much more. Nearly everyone had been distracted from seeing the things that matter by hunting for things that did not actually matter.
This realization transversed typical partisan and ideological boundaries. Those who did not like to think about issues of class conflict had to face the ways in which the whole system was serving one class at the expense of everyone else. The cheerleaders of government beneficence faced the unthinkable: their true love had become malevolent. The champions of private enterprise had to deal with the ways in which private corporations participated and benefited from the entire fiasco. All major political parties and their journalistic backers participated.
No one’s ideological priors were confirmed in the course of events, and everyone was forced to realize that the world worked in a very different way from what we had been told. Most governments in the world had come to be controlled by people no one elected and these administrative forces were loyal not to voters but to industrial interests in media and pharma, while the intellectuals we had long trusted to say what is true went along with even the craziest of claims, while condemning dissent.
Making matters more confusing, no one in charge of this disaster would admit error or even explain their thinking. The burning questions were and are so voluminous as to be impossible to list in full. In the US, there was supposed to be a Covid commission but it never formed. Why? Because the critics far outweighed the apologists, and a public commission proved too risky.
Too much truth could get out, and then what would happen? Behind the public health rationale for the destruction, there was a hidden hand: national security interests rooted in the bioweapons industry that has long lived under a classified cover. This is likely what accounts for the strange taboo concerning this whole topic. Those who know cannot say while the rest of us who have been researching this for years are left with more questions than answers.
While we wait for a full accounting of how it is that rights and liberties were crushed worldwide – what Javier Milei has called a “crime against humanity” – there is no denying the reality on the ground. There was certain to be a blowback, the ferocity of which would only intensify the longer justice is delayed.
For several years, the world had awaited the political, economic, cultural, and intellectual fallout, while the perpetrators held on hoping that the whole subject would just go away. Forget about Covid, they kept saying to us, and yet the sheer size and scale of the calamity would not go away.
We live in the midst of that now, with minute-by-minute revelations of where the money went and who precisely was involved. Multiple trillions were squandered as the people’s standard of living took a dive, and now top among the burning questions is: who got the money? Careers are being wrecked as famous anti-corporate crusaders like Bernie Sanders turn out to be the US Senate’s largest single beneficiary of pharma largesse, exposed for the world.
The Sanders story is just one data point of millions. The news of the sheer number of rackets is spilling out like an avalanche minute-by-minute. The newspapers we thought were chronicling public life turned out to be on the take. The fact-checkers were always working for the blob. The censors were only protecting themselves. The inspectors we believed were keeping an eye out were always in on the game. The courts keeping tabs on government overreach were enabling it. The bureaucracies tagged to implement legislation were unchecked and unelected legislatures in themselves.
The shift is beautifully illustrated by USAID, a $50 billion agency that claimed to be doing humanitarian work but which was really a slush fund for regime change, deep-state operations, censorship, and NGO graft on a scale never before seen. Now we have the receipts. The entire agency, lording over the globe like an unchecked colossus for decades, seems destined for the trash heap.
And so on it goes.
Frequently overlooked in all the commentary on our times is how the second Trump administration is Republican in name only but mostly consists of refugees from the other party. Tick through the names (Trump, Vance, Musk, Kennedy, Gabbard, and so on) and you find people who only a few years ago were associated with the Democratic Party.
Which is to say that this aggressive rooting out of the deep state is being achieved by what is a de facto third party aimed at overthrowing the establishments of the legacy ones. And this is not just in the US: the same dynamic is taking shape throughout the industrialized world.
The entire system of government – properly conceived of not as a democratically elected conduit of the peoples’ interest but instead a complicated and unelected network of unfathomable industrial racketeering with a ruling class at the controls – seems to be unraveling before our eyes.
It’s like the old episodes of Scooby-Doo when the scary ghost or mysterious specter has the mask removed and it is the town mayor all along, who then proclaims that he would have gotten away with it but for these meddling kids.
The meddling kids now include vast swaths of the world’s population, burning with a passionate desire to clean up the public sector, expose the industrial scams, unearth all the secrets that have been kept for decades, put power back into the hands of the people as the liberal age promised long ago, while seeking justice for all the wrongdoing of these last hellish five years.
The Covid operation was an audacious global attempt to deploy all the power of government – in all the directions from and to which it flowed – in service of a goal never before attempted in history. To say that it failed is the understatement of the century. What it did was unleash fires of fury the world over, and whole legacy systems are in the process of burning down.
How deep is the corruption? There are no words to describe its breadth and depth.
Who is regretting this? It’s the legacy news media, the legacy academic establishment, the legacy corporate establishment, the legacy public-sector agencies, the legacy everything, and this regret knows no partisan or ideological bounds.
And who is celebrating this or, at least, enjoying the upheaval and cheering it on? It’s the independent media, the genuine grassroots, the deplorables and nonessentials, the pillaged and oppressed, the workers and peasants who were forced to serve the elites for years, those who have been truly marginalized through decades of exclusion from public life.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/seventeen-state-ags-to-investigate-fauci-over-covid-19-failings,Seventeen State AGs To Investigate Fauci over COVID-19 Failings,By Raw Egg Nationalist,24 days ago,"A group of 17 state attorneys general intend to investigate Anthony Fauci for his role, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in the pandemic response.
Under the leadership of South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, the group sent a letter to Congress to request material that could aid their investigation.
The letter criticizes President Joe Biden’s last-minute blanket pardon for Fauci, claiming it is an attempt to shield him from “accountability.”
“President Biden’s blanket pardon of Dr. Fauci is a shameful attempt to prevent accountability,” said Attorney General Wilson.
“If any of these findings indicate violations of state laws, we are fully prepared to take appropriate action to ensure justice is served.”
Although former President Biden’s pardon prevents federal prosecution of Fauci, it does not prevent state-level action.
In December, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic released its final report, in which it took Fauci to task for failings during the pandemic. The report also addressed important issues like the origin of the COVID-19 virus and suppression of dissenting voices during the pandemic.
In addition to Wilson of South Carolina, the attorneys general involved in the investigation into Fauci represent Tennessee, Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Texas Idaho, North Dakota, Utah, Indiana, South Dakota, Arkansas, Montana, Missouri, Kansas, West Virginia, and Nebraska.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/your-brain-could-contain-a-credit-cards-worth-of-plastic,Your Brain Could Contain a Credit Card’s Worth of Plastic,By Raw Egg Nationalist,25 days ago,"Our brains are accruing as much as a credit card’s worth of plastic, according to a worrying new study.
Researchers at the University of New Mexico examined brain samples from people who died between 2016 and 2024 and measured their plastic content. Other research had already shown, in humans and animals, that microplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier, which is the brain’s only protection against harmful substances and organisms.
The researchers discovered concentrations of plastic that were about 12 times higher than in liver or kidney samples.
They found that levels of plastic in the brain samples increased by 50% in just eight years, and the median weight of plastic in a brain sample from 2024 was 4,917 micrograms per gram, roughly five grams per kilogram. Given that the average brain weighs nearly 1.5 kilograms, that means many brains might contain as much as 7.5g of plastic—the weight of a credit card or more.
Older brain samples, from the period 1997 to 2013, were obtained for comparison, and showed a steady increase in concentrations of plastic that mirrored the global increase in plastic production. Polyethylene, the most commonly produced plastic, accounted for around 75% of all detected plastic, suggesting that exposure derives overwhelmingly from ordinary forms of plastic goods.
The researchers also found clear evidence of a link between dementia and microplastic exposure. The brains of people with dementia contained as much to ten times more microplastic particles than the brains of those without the condition.
More than nine billion tons of plastic are estimated to have been produced between 1950 and 2017, with over half of that total having been produced since 2004. The vast majority of plastic ends up in the environment in one form or another, where it breaks down, through weathering, exposure to UV light and organisms of all kinds, into smaller and smaller pieces—microplastics and then nanoplastics.
Within our homes, microplastics are mainly produced when synthetic fibres from clothes, furnishings and carpets are shed. They accumulate in large quantities in dust and float around in the air, which we then inhale.

However, critics said the materials — which include lesson plans and classroom activities titled “Operation Outbreak” and a graphic novel targeting teens — also could be interpreted as propaganda designed to encourage compliance with public health policies and initiatives.
The materials present hypothetical scenarios necessitating a public health response to the outbreak and spread of a disease with a zoonotic — or animal — origin. Students are asked to employ a “One Health” approach and methods such as contact tracing to respond to these hypothetical outbreaks.
According to the materials, “One Health recognizes that human health, animal health, and the environment are connected.”
The One Health approach “requires human, animal, and environmental health professionals to work together at the local, state, federal, and global levels to improve the health of people, animals, and their shared environment.”
Dr. Michelle Perro, a pediatrician, said the CDC’s educational initiatives “appear to be a well-intentioned educational effort under the One Health framework.” But instead, “a closer examination suggests it may also serve to acclimate students to compliance during future public health crises.”
Perro said:
“By emphasizing the inevitability of ‘the next pandemic’ and reinforcing a specific perspective on zoonotic transmission, these materials can condition naive minds to accept certain public health policies without room for opposing discussions. … This initiative prioritizes messaging over genuine scientific inquiry.”
Dr. Margaret Christensen, a clinical educator called the materials “propaganda,” that “groom the younger generation early to believe our biggest threat is from some disease jumping out of an animal, whether birds or cows or pigs, and attacking us without defense, unless we’ve been vaccinated.”
According to attorney Sheri Snow Powers, the educational resources are intended to foster an uncritical attitude toward public health authorities.
“These materials are inappropriate for teenagers and children because they promote and idolize public health authorities as heroes and saviors,” Powers said. “This is detrimental to young developing minds and conditions children to be future compliant citizens.”
CDC educational resources use ‘a fear-based narrative’
The CDC’s educational resources include material meant to teach students “about the roots of American public health,” including the history and role of the CDC in domestic and global disease outbreaks.
The materials include modules on “lessons learned” during the 1976 swine flu outbreak, the CDC’s role in food and water safety, and in responding to the “21st century public health challenge” of chronic diseases.
However, the main focus of the materials for high school students is the “Operation Outbreak” series of classroom activities, centered around a graphic novel targeting teenagers.
Featuring a cover page reminiscent of the popular series “Stranger Things,” “The Junior Disease Detectives: Operation Outbreak a novel produced in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, presents a fictional disease outbreak scenario involving teenagers and animals. It’s connected to three in-class activities focusing on “zoonotic disease prevention and response.”
The first activity, “The Outbreak Team,” focuses on the “various roles and responsibilities of the professionals involved in an outbreak response. The next two activities, “Eddie’s Story” and “Hamlet’s Story,” focus on investigating a disease outbreak and its subsequent spread from a pig (Hamlet) to a teenager (Eddie).
According to the CDC, upon completion of the activities, students should be able to “identify steps in an influenza outbreak investigation,” “identify roles and responsibilities of public health, animal health, environmental health, and other relevant professionals” and “describe why using a One Health approach … is best when investigating or preventing zoonotic diseases.”
Students are also expected to learn how to define a series of terms, including “zoonotic influenza virus,” “novel influenza virus,” and “case” — including the differences between “suspected,” “probable” and “confirmed” cases.
“Most human infections with novel influenza A viruses have occurred after close contact with infected animals,” the materials state, noting that “global surveillance” is necessary “to detect the emergence of novel influenza A viruses that could trigger a pandemic.”
The materials also state, “There are associations between zoonotic influenza viruses and pandemics.”
But according to Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, the graphic novel and activities use a “fear-based” narrative. She said the materials lack “a balanced and factual approach that pathogens, viruses and bacteria are a natural part of life that can be mostly handled by each person’s immune system.”
Vaccination also is prominently featured in the educational materials. According to the graphic novel:
“As we learned during Disease Detective Camp, our bodies’ immune system produces antibodies to fight against infection, and the safest way to get antibodies is through vaccination.
“Although the flu vaccine isn’t designed to protect against variant flu, it is still important to get, because it can help protect us from getting the flu and spreading it to others.”
One Health approach ‘subtly promotes compliance over critical thinking’
Perro questioned the CDC’s focus on the One Health approach, “due to its biased, one-sided narrative.”
“By focusing solely on zoonotic transmission, it ignores key factors like environmental toxicants, industrial farming and genetic engineering risks,” Perro said. This promotes “compliance over critical thinking” and serves as “institutional propaganda,” she said.
The materials ultimately “shape narratives about the origins of pandemics — particularly regarding COVID-19 having emerged ‘naturally’ rather than from a lab-related incident,” Perro said.
Powers the materials “condition” children to fear specific pathogens and “to be ignorant of their own bodies’ amazing immune system, by not mentioning it.”
“Teaching children how to take care of themselves with healthy food, exercise, and sunshine is a much more valuable lesson,” Powers said.
The CDC’s focus on the flu and children is not new. Documents Children’s Health Defense obtained in 2023 through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request revealed that the agency hired an advertising firm to write “news” articles promoting flu shots for kids and the elderly.
The CDC’s “Operation Outbreak” materials appear to be unrelated to an online simulation activity by the same name, developed by the Broad Institute, UMass Chan Medical School and The Inspire Project — funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.
This simulation, introduced in 2017 and described as an “infectious way to learn,” operates through a mobile app and “unleashes a virtual pathogen through Bluetooth across participant devices, prompting a contagious outbreak that participants strive to contain.”",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/hawaii-lawmakers-float-bill-to-eliminate-religious-vaccine-exemptions,Hawaii Lawmakers Float Bill to Eliminate Religious Vaccine Exemptions,"By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. | The Defender",27 days ago,"Hawaiian legislators last month introduced a bill to eliminate religious exemptions for vaccines required by the schools.
Democratic state Sen. Ron Kouchi on Jan. 23 introduced Senate Bill 1437 — which has a corresponding House Bill 1118. The bill aims to eliminate all non-medical exemptions as a way to ensure high rates of vaccination coverage.
The House version of the bill will be discussed in a health committee hearing this Friday.
In addition to testifying during the public section of that hearing, several organizations are planning a rally at the legislature on Feb. 20, when legislators are supposed to recess and hear feedback from their constituents.
According to the bill, 95% coverage is necessary to protect against the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases by creating “herd immunity.”
Non-medical exemption rates in Hawaii have grown over the last 10 years from 2.5% in the 2015-2016 school year to 5.3% in the 2023-2024 school year, according to the bill. Rates among individual schools vary, with 55 of 382 reporting schools having exemption rates of over 10%.
If passed, the law would allow children who were granted exemptions in the 2024-2025 school year or prior to maintain their exemptions.
Hawaii’s proposed legislation is a national outlier, as public opinion on exemptions has become more favorable in recent years.
A survey published last week by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania shows public support for policies that allow parents of schoolchildren to opt out of vaccinating their kids for medical, religious and personal or philosophical reasons has grown substantially since 2019.
Last month, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order allowing for religious exemptions from mandatory school vaccinations, ending one of the most restrictive vaccination policies in the country. West Virginia legislators are expected to introduce a bill to codify that executive order into law.
Mississippi also began allowing religious exemptions in July 2023, Under a federal court order.
California, Maine, New York and Connecticut are the only remaining states that don’t allow religious or philosophical exemptions from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements.
Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have also reportedly introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots, The Associated Press reported.
Other states are also considering bills to establish state-level vaccine injury databases or to change rules about what providers must tell patients about the shots, the AP reported.
The Hawaiian bill is part of the “governor’s package,” a set of proposed bills that make up Gov. Josh Green’s legislative agenda.
The package includes at least one other vaccine-related bill, Senate Bill 1434, which proposes to institute a universal immunization funding program that would provide state-purchased access to some or all vaccines for children and adults.
Gary Cordery, former gubernatorial candidate and founder of the Aloha Freedom Coalition — formed in 2020 in response to the state’s COVID-19 lockdown and mandate policies — said that most bills proposed to the legislature don’t even get hearings, but that all bills in the governor’s package make it to the floor for a vote.
He said the Democratic Senate and House will likely rubber-stamp the bill into law unless there is significant public pushback.
Green recently was in the national spotlight, making the rounds in mainstream media and in political ads smearing Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Children’s Health Defense (CHD) founder and President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Green tried to blame Kennedy for a 2019 measles outbreak in Samoa. The outbreak followed the Samoan government’s 10-month suspension of its measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) program after two nurses accidentally killed two infants with the MMR shot after mixing it with a paralytic solution instead of saline.
Kennedy had coincidentally visited the island for unrelated purposes just before the outbreak, which Green claims resulted from Kennedy’s alleged “anti-vaccine rhetoric” — an assertion that experts supportive of vaccination, like Dr. Vinay Prasad, said “falls apart on first glance.”
Kim Haines, former head of CHD’s Hawaii Chapter, said it was frustrating that the governor was “everywhere telling these blatant lies,” and using them to justify regressive vaccination policies.
According to Follow the Money, a nonpartisan national nonprofit organization that tracks campaign-donor and lobbyist money, the health sector has contributed more money to Green’s political campaigns than any other sector.
Green, an emergency medicine doctor, previously served as lieutenant governor and led the state’s COVID-19 response during the pandemic, heading up a pandemic response that local organizers told The Defender was one of the most draconian in the country, often requiring vaccine passports.
Cordery said that Green used his medical credentials for political ends during the pandemic — frequently appearing publicly in scrubs and with a stethoscope and using his perceived authority as a doctor to push for severe restrictions on personal liberties.
Aloha Freedom Coalition helped organize protests against the COVID-19 measures. They are also working with other organizations to organize people and educate them about the proposed legislation to eliminate religious exemptions.
Hawaii had history of pushing more stringent immunization rules
Hawaii’s vaccine requirements and exemption rules have become more stringent since 2018 when a series of administrative rule changes were first proposed, said Renee Dieperink, a Hawaii educator and organizer with Hawaii For Informed Consent.
The changes were implemented in 2020, despite strong public opposition. Dieperink explained that officials used a rule-change procedure that allowed top political officials to change some aspects of vaccine policy without consulting the legislature.
As part of that change, Hawaii added several vaccines to the list of required immunizations for K-12, including the HPV vaccine for both boys and girls starting in 7th grade. The new rules extended vaccination requirements to daycares, private schools and post-secondary education.
Before 2020, medical exemptions required only a letter from a doctor, which would exempt a child from all required vaccinations. This exemption could also be extended to siblings or other family members, “because family history matters when it comes to medical issues,” Dieperink said in a video explaining the exemption process and the rule changes.
They also added requirements that made it more difficult to obtain a medical exemption. “With the rule change, they gutted our medical exemption,” Haines said. “Now it’s just a bare-bones exemption.”
Once the new laws took effect in 2020, physicians had to fill out a standard medical exemption form. The form specifies that children can be exempted from a vaccine only if they have suffered a recognized injury from that vaccine or one of its ingredients. Exemptions could not be extended to siblings — even in cases of severe injury and death. The exemptions are also time-limited and must be renewed.
At that time, the religious exemption was still available to parents or guardians whose “religious beliefs prohibit the practice of immunization.” That request process also changed — parents had to agree that in the case of an outbreak, their children would be excluded from school. They also could not request exemptions only from specific vaccines.
Haines said the changes in 2020 were “egregious,” especially because they happened outside of the legislative process. “Now they want to take away our religious exemption and leave us subject to forced healthcare.”
However, she expects significant public pushback against the new bill. “COVID really woke up the sleeping giant and enlightened a lot of people,” she said.
“Support for medical freedom has grown a lot in our state, and I am really hopeful that we’re going to have not only a lot of testimony but also a lot of bodies in person at the capital to protest this bill,” she said.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/video-rfk-appears-to-put-wonder-drug-methylene-blue-in-drinking-water,Video: RFK Adds ‘Wonder Drug’ Methylene Blue to Drinking Water,By Adan Salazar,27 days ago,"Footage circulating on social media shows Health and Human Services secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. adding a blue substance, presumed to be miracle drug methylene blue, to his drink.
The video, reportedly filmed in Sept. 2024 by a passenger on a jet RFK was also aboard, features the former independent presidential candidate adding a blue tincture to a glass of water as he spoke to another passenger.
The substance was widely assumed to be methylene blue, a synthetic dye discovered to have various health benefits and approved by the FDA to treat methemoglobinemia, a disorder that reduces the blood’s ability to carry oxygen.
The substance’s health properties were recently highlighted by Mel Gibson during an interview on the Joe Rogan podcast, where the Braveheart actor described how three of his friends with terminal cancer reversed their diagnoses with a regimen of alternative treatments that included methylene blue.
“I’ll tell you a good story, okay. I have three friends. All three of them at stage four cancer. All three of them don’t have cancer right now at all and they had some serious stuff going on,” Gibson told Rogan, going on to say they used several alternative treatments rumored to eliminate cancer, including ivermectin, Fenbendazole, methylene blue and hydrochloride.
Methylene blue is not only a prescribed FDA-approved medication, but research has also been done into its purported antioxidant and preventative benefits, and its use as a treatment for cellular dysfunction, cancer, Alzheimer’s, depression and more.
“RFK Jr putting Methylene Blue in his water while flying is prime we’re so back,” one user wrote on X, adding claims that, “MB while flying – Mitigates any radiation burden – Protects against oxidative stress – Anti viral so you don’t catch a cold – Boosts autophagy if fasting on flight.”
RFK’s use of the drug emphasizes his knowledge in preventative medicine and underscores his commitment to health – both essential qualities to have in a US Health and Human Services Secretary.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/usaid-funded-covid-bioweapon-development-in-china,USAID Funded Covid Bioweapon Development in China,By Sean Miller,1 month ago,"Elon Musk, the head of government watchdog and advisory group the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has confirmed that American’s taxpayer money was funneled through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to the Chinese Wuhan Lab for bioweapons development of the Covid virus.
“Did you know that USAID, using YOUR tax dollars, funded bioweapon research, including COVID-19, that killed millions of people?” Musk said in a social media post Sunday.
Musk’s statements were quoting a post which outlined many corrupt programs and operations that USAID has funded through the years.
“USAID funneled $53 million to EcoHealth Alliance, which then used U.S. taxpayer funds to support gain-of-function research on coronaviruses at the Wuhan lab—research that likely led to the creation of COVID-19. The CIA’s deception regarding COVID-19 origins becomes much clearer when considering USAID’s long history of serving as a CIA front organization,” KanekoaTheGreat said in a social media post Sunday.
Alex Jones has been exposing the Wuhan Lab coverup since January 2020, before many had even heard of Covid.
Interestingly, this is not the first time USAID has been accused funding the creation of Covid. In 2023 the State Department refused to answer questions about USAID funding the creation of the Covid bioweapon.
In 2023 the U.S. quietly terminated a controversial $125 million ‘wildlife virus hunting program’ amid safety fears.
“USAID has determined that investments that focus on the search for and characterization of unknown viruses prior to spillover into humans are not an Agency global health security priority at this time. As a result, we will cease funding projects with this specific objective,” said the agency’s prepared statement, according to the British Medical Journal.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/uk-woman-suffering-from-aggressive-blood-cancer-after-she-received-lethal-covid-injection,UK Woman Suffering From ‘Aggressive’ Blood Cancer After She Received Lethal Covid Injection,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,1 month ago,"(LifeSiteNews) – Patients in Great Britain are speaking out about the injuries they experienced after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, with some going so far as to allege a link between the controversial shots and cancer diagnoses.
The Daily Mail reported that 16,824 claims have been submitted to the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS), and 188 Brits so far have received compensation for vaccine-related ailments as of the end of November 2024 at a maximum of £120,000 apiece (potentially reaching a total of more than £22 million). Most claims have been denied, but 8,018 are still pending.
The vast majority of the claims were linked to the AstraZeneca COVID shot, which was widely used in Europe but not in the United States. Last year, the company withdrewits vaccine worldwide; AstraZeneca insisted the move was for business reasons, but it shortly followed a wave of lawsuits from families over reported injuries due to the shot as well as a court ruling linking it to serious blood clotting.
In its latest report, the Mail tells the stories of several applicants, arguably the most concerning of which is 38-year-old bank fraud investigator Jennifer Furno’s. She received her first AstraZeneca shot in March 2021 and a second four months later. Shortly after the follow-up, she began suffering from leg tingling and numbness, gastric distress, and mild rashes, and was later found to have a blood clot on her lung.
Not yet considering a connection, Furno took a Moderna COVID booter in November 2021, and later the same month experienced worsening rashes, limb and joint swelling, and a pulmonary embolism on her lung.
A doctor initially diagnosed her with “an over-active immune response,” but despite taking immune suppressing medications her symptom continued to worsen. “’I was convinced it was some sort of cancer. I felt so unwell,” she recalled.
In December 2022, one rheumatologist finally told her that there did “appear to be a temporal link between the onset of her symptoms and her first COVID-19 vaccine dose,” and the following July the London Clinic performed a skin biopsy that found “aggressive” blood cancer, specifically cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. “The vaccine is likely the causative thing, something like this it can trigger,” she says she was told.
Thankfully, she was eventually able to secure a bone marrow transplant and reported, “I’m now cancer-free, vaccine-free.” Her injury claim has not yet received a verdict.
“Certainly, hospitals and doctors are not believing young people who were fit and healthy before,” Furno says. “Young people need to be listened to and not judged as being health anxious. There needs to be less of a stigma about vaccine injuries and that it is recognised condition that needs treatment.”
A large body of evidence has indicated serious problems with both the safety and effectiveness of the COVID shots, about which the federal government and medical establishment have been evasive and dismissive.
In America, the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports38,264 deaths, 219,594 hospitalizations, 22,134 heart attacks, and 28,814 myocarditis and pericarditis cases as of December 27, among other ailments. CDC researchers have recognized a “high verification rate of reports of myocarditis to VAERS after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination,” leading to the conclusion that “under-reporting is more likely” than over-reporting.
An analysis of 99 million people across eight countries published in February in the journal Vaccine “observed significantly higher risks of myocarditis following the first, second and third doses” of mRNA-based COVID vaccines as well as signs of increased risk of “pericarditis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis,” and other “potential safety signals that require further investigation.” In April, the CDC was forced to release by court order 780,000 previously undisclosed reports of serious adverse reactions, and a study out of Japan found “statistically significant increases” in cancer deaths after third doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines and offered several theories for a causal link.
In January, a long-awaited Florida grand jury report on the COVID vaccine manufacturers found that while a low percentage of the millions of vaccinations resulted in serious harm based on the data it had access to, such events do occur, and there are “profound and serious issues” in pharmaceutical companies’ review process, including reluctance to share what evidence of adverse events they did find.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-lockdowns-disrupted-crucial-social-skill-among-young-children,COVID Lockdowns Disrupted Crucial Social Skill among Young Children,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"The COVID-19 social restrictions caused significant changes to the development of children aged six or younger, retarding their acquisition of a key social skill.
A new study in the journal Scientific Reports suggests the lockdowns and other measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 did serious, potentially irreversible damage to preschoolers.
“It was remarkable to see the drop in kids’ performance,” said developmental psychology Professor Rose Scott , the lead author of the study.
“On one of the tasks in my lab, children tested before the pandemic could pass at 2 and a half years old. Right after the lockdowns, we were seeing 5-year-olds not passing it.”
The researchers tested young children for a social skill called “false-belief understanding,” the ability to recognize that other people can be wrong. Acquisition of this skill is considered to be a crucial step in distinguishing mind from reality, and allows children to develop skills for cooperation, communication and learning.
Current research shows that false-belief abilities undergo important developments in a child’s first five years. A child who lacks these cognition skills may grow into a student who struggles to get along with peers or who finds academic tasks harder.
Results were compared with results from children of the same age that were taken before the pandemic.
Children in the pre-lockdown group scored significantly higher in their tasks. In one task, 80% of five-year-olds in the pre-lockdown group passed, whereas only 63% of the children in the post-lockdown group did. Children from poorer backgrounds fared even worse, with only 51% of the post-lockdown children passing the same task.
What’s more, further testing revealed that the deficits in false-belief understanding persisted. Children who lacked the ability did not acquire it later.
The authors believe the pandemic stress and isolation were largely responsible for the differences observed.",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/microplastics-linked-to-premature-births,Microplastics Linked to Premature Births,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Microplastic exposure is linked to cases of premature births, according to new research.
Scientists at the University of New Mexico found that mothers with higher concentrations of microplastics in their placentas are more likely to give birth to babies prematurely.
Mass spectrometry technology was used to analyze 175 placentas, 100 of which were collected at term and 75 preterm (less than 37 weeks of pregnancy).
Microplastics concentrations in preterm placentas were significantly higher. Levels also surpassed those previously measured in human blood.
The researchers concluded that microplastics were accumulating at greater concentrations in the placentas of women who then gave birth early. At present, the reasons for this are unknown.
“The finding of higher placental concentrations among preterm births was surprising because it was counterintuitive to what you might expect if it was merely a byproduct of the length of time of the pregnancy,” says the study’s lead author Enrico R. Barrozo, Ph.D., an assistant professor.
“In other words, a preterm delivery not only accumulated more microplastics and nanoplastics in its placenta relative to term, but did so at an earlier time point in the pregnancy,” added senior study author Kjersti Aagaard.
“This hints at the possibility that the accumulation of plastics could be contributing to the risk and occurrence of preterm birth. When combined with other recent research, this study adds to the growing body of evidence, ranging from heart disease to potentially stroke, that demonstrates a real risk of exposure to plastics on human health and disease.”
More than nine billion tons of plastic are estimated to have been produced between 1950 and 2017, with over half of that total having been produced since 2004. The vast majority of plastic ends up in the environment in one form or another, where it breaks down, through weathering, exposure to UV light and organisms of all kinds, into smaller and smaller pieces—microplastics and then nanoplastics.
Within our homes, microplastics are mainly produced when synthetic fibres from clothes, furnishings and carpets are shed. They accumulate in large quantities in dust and float around in the air, and are then inhaled.

Fifty-seven percent of respondents believed vaccine makers should be stripped of their legal immunity from prosecution. At present, vaccine manufacturers are immune to legal claims for harm caused by their products.
Thirty-six percent of respondents said they don’t trust the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Forty-one percent said the government mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic.
Less than half of respondents supported government vaccine mandates, with 55% of 45-64 year olds opposing them.
The polling was commissioned by Children’s Health Defense (CHD) and took a representative sample of just over 1,000 US adults.
“This data highlights a significant loss of trust in our regulatory agencies,” said CHD CEO Mary Holland.
“Allowing this distrust to persist will further undermine the public’s confidence in our healthcare organizations.”
Holland continued: “We must emphasize that if the government wishes to regain credibility, it must recognize the realities of vaccines. Until that happens, Americans are less likely to heed their guidance, and the remaining public faith in these institutions will ultimately vanish.”
Respondents were asked five questions: Do Americans trust government health agencies like the CDC and FDA? Should the government be able to mandate vaccines? What about experimental vaccines that haven’t been subjected to standard safety testing—should the government be able to mandate those? Should anyone harmed by a vaccine be able to sue the manufacturer, as is the case for almost all other products and services? Looking back on it, how would you rate the government’s overall handling of COVID-19?",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-young-adult-mortality-skyrockets-experts-dont-know-why,US Young-adult Mortality Skyrockets: Experts Don’t Know Why,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Mortality among young adults, aged 25-44, has skyrocketed in recent years, according to a new study which shows significant increases in deaths by drug overdose, alcohol-related conditions and a host of other more mysterious causes.
Deaths of young adults in 2023 were 70% higher than they would have been in if trends from before 2011 had continued.
“One surprising thing about the increases in these causes of death are that these are causes of death that primarily kill people at much older ages,” said Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, associate professor of sociology and study author.
The study looked at over three million deaths among Americans aged 25-44 during the period 1999-2023.
The researchers identified two separate trends in mortality: an increase between 1999 and 2011, and a sharp increase from 2011 to 2019, which grew even sharper from 2020 to 2023.
Unnatural causes such as drug overdoses were the leading cause of deaths during the study period, accounting for a third of all deaths. Drug overdoses have been the significant biggest cause since 2014, with a significant increase since 2020, for reasons the study authors do not explain.
The contribution of cardio-metabolic conditions, including conditions related to heart and hormone function, as well as nutrition, was also substantial.
Compared to trends before 2011, deaths from most causes were significantly higher in 2023 than would be expected. Excess mortality was 35% greater in 2019, then tripled during the pandemic, before falling. Nevertheless, excess mortality in 2023 is still 70% higher than would be expected if pre-2011 trends had continued.
“The fact that we saw a real growth in mortality at these relatively young ages is very worrying because it suggests that many more deaths may come in the future as these cohorts age into midlife and beyond, if these trends aren’t reversed before then,” Professor Wrigley-Field added.
The pandemic is suggested as one reason for the spike in excess mortality, but longer term causes, such as the dislocations caused by the economic crash of 2008, are also suggested.
So-called “deaths from despair”—deaths resulting, directly or indirectly, from feelings of hopelessness and despair, brought on by hardship, isolation and lack of opportunities—are identified as a possible key factor in explaining the alarming rise in mortality among young adults.
“As a group, [young adults] have experienced expensive housing markets and a work context in which work hours have grown in many occupations, both of which can make it more difficult to lead healthy lifestyles,” Wrigley-Field said.
Because young people increasingly find themselves forced to work long hours to afford housing, they have less time, money or resources to look after themselves. As a result, they fall victim to physical and mental conditions that worsen their health and make it more likely they’ll die an early death.
Although the researchers note that the study does not explain the increase in excess mortality—they plan to look at explanation in detail next—the presence of so many different causes suggests the need to look at “big, systemic factors” in order to understand what’s happening.",0

By the middle of 2025 it is expected to be operational in the United Arab Emirates’ ambulatory setting.
“With the app, a patient in an emergency situation such as in a state of unconsciousness can have their face scanned by paramedics for their personal identification information to be retrieved, thanks to the system’s integration with the UAE national identity database,” Biometric Update said Friday.
Dubai is undergoing a so-called ‘digital transformation‘ where facial recognition is taking center stage in the areas of public transit and palm print scanning is being implemented in the areas of payments and commerce.
Being face scanned while unconscious may be the least of someone’s worries, as in the U.S. unconscious patients are being enrolled into medical experiments and administered lethal Covid vaccines.
While face scanning may be seen as invasive by some, American company VeriChip Corporation took things a step further, much further, when they developed an Orwellian implantable human microchip called the VeriChip in the early 2000s with the express purpose of identifying patients in the medical setting as well as identifying children.
“The VeriChip is injected under the skin of the upper arm or hip in an outpatient procedure. A special scanner reads the RF signal emitted by the microchip to obtain the device’s ID number, which then is entered into a database to access personal data about the individual,” Wired Magazine said in 2003. “Other potential uses of the chip, according to company officials, include scanning unconscious patients to obtain their medical records or restricting access to high-security buildings by scanning workers to verify their clearance.”
The VeriChip was targeted for implantation into children and the elderly.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/breaking-claims-that-childhood-vaccines-saved-millions-of-lives-based-on-flawed-models,Breaking: Claims That Childhood Vaccines ‘Saved Millions of Lives’ Based on Flawed Models,"By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. | The Defender",1 month ago,"Claims by public health agencies and in top medical journals that childhood vaccination prevents millions of deaths annually are based on flawed epidemiological models, according to a paper published today by Correlation, a Canadian nonprofit research organization.
The author, all-cause mortality expert Denis Rancourt, Ph.D., argues these claims are based on “tentative and untethered models of epidemiological forecasting” that produce “unlikely results.”
The models depend entirely on invalid estimates of vaccine efficacy and disease prevalence and virulence, none of which are based on real-world data concerning actual deaths, according to Rancourt.
They also fail to account for other complex factors contributing to child mortality — particularly in low-income countries, where most of these millions of infant lives are purportedly saved. These factors include nutritional deficiency, toxic exposures and poverty.
Rancourt also found that, contrary to public health claims, there are no examples in all-cause mortality data of a drop in infant or child mortality temporally associated with the rollout of a childhood vaccination program.
On the contrary, he wrote, independent observational studies have tied vaccine rollouts to increased infant or child mortality and morbidity.
In the paper, Rancourt develops an alternative model using yearly all-cause infant mortality. He estimates that childhood vaccination campaigns since 1974 may have been associated with approximately 100 million vaccine-related deaths.
However, he emphasizes that any true estimate of mortality would also have to account for other factors, such as the shifting political and economic dynamics that drive poverty and its associated health problems.
Children’s Health Defense Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski said, ”Rancourt points out serious flaws in mainstream debates over childhood vaccination that are premised on errors in generalization and lead to childlike black-and-white thinking when it comes to vaccine safety.”
Jablonowski said the paper clearly demonstrates that claims vaccines have saved millions of lives globally, “hang on a few impossible assumptions.” Those include:
Rancourt said he began writing the paper to demonstrate the “ludicrous theoretical modelling exercises” behind the spectacular claims of reduced infant mortality from mass vaccination programs.
“But what I discovered is that the longstanding industry of administering vaccination programmes to save infants in low-income countries from death is scientifically baseless and a fraudulent enterprise that removes resources and attention away from urgently needed development to correct ongoing mass neocolonial exploitation,” he said.
‘Garbage in, garbage out’
Many top researchers have raised public concerns about epidemic modeling, particularly in research that serves the pharmaceutical industry.
Dr. John Ioannidis has pointed out that “epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record,” which became particularly evident during the COVID-19 period. Models can easily be compromised or skewed if they use poor data, incorrect assumptions, lack epidemiological information or fail to consider all dimensions of a given problem.
This, combined with the fact — highlighted by former editors of both The Lancet and The BMJ — that medical journals have become “an extension of the marketing arm of pharmaceutical companies” has led to the proliferation of forecasting models that don’t meet even the most basic standards for modeling, Rancourt said.
In recent years, epidemiologic modelers have published many papers claiming to estimate mortality averted through childhood vaccination.
Rancourt argued these models share two fatal flaws: They are based on unreliable assumptions of vaccine efficacy and they “guesstimate” deaths avoided using disease models not anchored in real-world data.
The safety and efficacy numbers for these models always come from clinical trials, which he says are “systemically unreliable” in assessing efficacy and fail to evaluate safety.
The trials are, “overwhelmingly controlled by an industry making large profits from the vaccines, and this industry has amply, historically, consistently and repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to act fraudulently at the expense of endangering the public,” Rancourt wrote.
Also, the trials themselves introduce several biases. For example, trials are conducted with healthy children, but vaccines are administered to children with multiple vulnerabilities, particularly in low-income countries.
The trials also don’t test the vaccines against true placebos, don’t monitor children long-term for safety issues, and don’t test against disease prevention or safety in the real world.
Second, they rely on “guesstimates” of deaths averted — estimating how many children didn’t die because they got the vaccine — based on isolated models for disease contagion that aren’t validated by real-world research.
Most importantly, they fail to account for the fact that childhood mortality rates are affected by a wide range of factors — including underlying health conditions, poor nutrition and access to care — beyond simply whether a child is vaccinated or not.
“I argue that the proverbial computing term ‘garbage in, garbage out’ pre-eminently applies in these circumstances,” Rancourt said.
Breaking down claims that vaccination has saved 154 million lives since 1974
To illustrate his points, Rancourt analyzed a recent study funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and published in The Lancet by Andrew J. Shattock, Ph.D., and colleagues.
The study concluded that “Since 1974, vaccination has averted 154 million deaths, including 146 million among children younger than 5 years of whom 101 million were infants younger than 1 year.”
Rancourt calculated this would be the equivalent of 5.7% of global deaths annually, or a 20% reduction in global infant mortality.
Rancourt said it would be a “fantastic” medical achievement. “Some might reasonably call it unbelievable.”
In addition to the WHO funding, the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium — funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Gates-backed Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance — provided the models. Members of the research team also receive funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Wellcome Trust and other organizations with financial and political interests in promoting mass vaccination.
For The Lancet study, Shattock estimated deaths avoided by vaccination using only theoretical models for how disease spreads — with no attention to context. And then used efficacy rates from vaccine clinical trials to estimate how many children who would have gotten sick and died don’t because vaccines are present.
The study repeats that model for each of the nine vaccines it considered to arrive at the number of lives saved.
The study also estimated the numbers based on the assumption that, otherwise, infant mortality would have remained constant between 1974 and 2024. However, in reality, infant mortality had been dropping before that, which the model should have accounted for.
The study “collapses on examination of its premises,” Rancourt wrote.
The problem of poverty
Perhaps the most glaring issue, Rancourt said, is that models touting high numbers of lives saved by vaccines fail to account for the reality that child mortality is influenced by many complex factors, particularly in low-income countries.
For example, the WHO states that the measles vaccine has the greatest impact on infant mortality, accounting for most lives saved from all vaccines. However, deaths from measles are typically related to malnutrition. Mortality and morbidity rates from infectious diseases like measles decline with improved living standards.
Malnutrition also makes children more vulnerable to environmental toxins — including vaccines, Rancourt noted.
In other words, malnutrition, including of the mother, makes a child highly vulnerable to death from a wide range of infections that don’t occur or aren’t fatal in well-nourished children living in healthy environments.
Low-income countries not only lack funding for public health, Rancourt said, but vaccination campaigns divert resources away from other health priorities like clean water and basic health services.
Vaccination programs increase infant and child mortality
Contrary to repeated claims that vaccines save millions of lives, Rancourt’s analysis of the relationship between vaccine rollouts and infant mortality rates suggests the opposite — that these programs have contributed to increased infant and child mortality.
Rancourt correlated changes in the global infant mortality rate with major vaccine rollouts between 1980-1999 and 1999-2015. During those periods, global infant mortality rates were declining, but the rate of decline slowed after the vaccine rollouts.
The deceleration became more marked in about 1992, when the hepatitis B and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were introduced, even in low-income countries.
Had the decline in infant mortality continued at the same rate from the period before vaccine rollouts, there would have been 100 million fewer infant deaths. Instead, the rate of decline in mortality slowed precisely when the rollouts happened.
All researchers modeling the benefits of vaccination missed or disregarded this evident temporal correlation, Rancourt said.
Rancourt’s findings corroborate observational studies, including those showing the introduction of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine in low-income countries led to a spike in infant mortality among vaccinated babies.
However, Rancourt cautioned that he was presenting the simplest possible model. A true estimate would have to adjust for the benefits of improving living conditions. It would also have to account for the impacts of “aggressive so-called globalization” in the 80s and 90s that facilitated the global expansion of industry, global vaccination campaigns and industrial agriculture, which all had varied and significant impacts on low- and middle-income countries.
Rancourt concluded the overwhelming cause of high infant mortality is extreme poverty associated with severe malnutrition and exposure to toxic living environments.",0

Kennedy Jr. once suggested antidepressant Big Pharma drugs may be connected to school shootings.
Citing 2023 and 2024 interviews featuring RFK during Wednesday’s Senate confirmation hearing, Smith read a quote where Kennedy once noted school children didn’t start shooting up schools until drugs such as Prozac were introduced to the masses.
She asked, “So, do you believe that antidepressants cause school shootings?”
Kennedy responded, “I don’t think anybody can answer that question, and I didn’t answer that question. I said it should be studied along with other potential culprits like social media…”
Senator Smith claimed, “The science shows that there is no link between school shootings and antidepressants, and in fact most school shooters were not even treated with antidepressants. And, of those that were, there was no evidence of association.”
“I don’t think you can say that Senator, because with HIPAA rules nobody knows,” RFK answered, referring to the fact that health privacy laws prevent the public from learning what medications school shooting suspects were prescribed.
The HHS nominee also pointed out SSRI drugs have suicidal and homicidal warnings on the labels.
Infowars founder and host Alex Jones brought the SSRI and mass murder connection into the national spotlight during a historic appearance on British journalist Piers Morgan’s CNN program in 2013.

Kennedy told Warren, “Senator, you’re asking me to not sue vaccine, pharmaceutical companies,” causing her to shout, “No, I am not! My question is stop enriching yourself! No one should be fooled here.”
The Democrat politician continued berating RFK, claiming he will prevent parents from vaccinating their children, that “kids might die” while “Robert Kennedy can keep cashing in.”
Warren also asked Kennedy to promise he won’t take a job at a major pharmaceutical company after leaving his position as head of HHS.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/jaw-dropping-study-finds-vaccinated-children-have-170-higher-risk-of-autism,‘Jaw-dropping’ Study Finds Vaccinated Children Have 170% Higher Risk of Autism,"By Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. | The Defender",1 month ago,"Vaccinated children have a 170% higher chance of being diagnosed with autism compared to unvaccinated children, according to a new peer-reviewed study.
The study also found that vaccinated children had a 212% greater likelihood of developing a range of other neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy/seizures, brain inflammation and tic and learning disorders.
According to the study, the childhood vaccination schedule is likely a significant contributor to the higher rate of autism and neurodevelopmental conditions in vaccinated children.
The study of 47,155 9-year-old children enrolled in the Florida Medicaid program since birth was published on Jan. 23 in Science, Public Health Policy and the Law.
Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., senior research scientist for Children’s Health Defense, said the paper “is unignorable simply by the soundness of its methods.”
“The sheer hazards associated with severe childhood diseases is jaw-dropping,” Jablonowski said.
The paper’s authors — Anthony R. Mawson and Binu Jacob of the Mississippi-based Chalfont Research Institute — hypothesized that:
The study’s findings confirmed the authors’ hypotheses. Experts said the results of the study cast doubt on government claims that vaccines are not linked to autism.
“The vaccine propaganda campaigns operated by our regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and legacy media continue to claim that the link between vaccines and autism has been ‘debunked,’” said epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher. He said the findings of this study “completely dismantle” this narrative.
Jablonowski noted that the study was based solely on government data. He said:
“The government has had this data for decades, professing safety while simultaneously refusing to study safety. The facade of U.S. government public health is crumbling, revealing a culprit in chronic disease in this country: willful ignorance.”
The authors of the study noted that government-sponsored studies have not compared health outcomes in vaccinated versus completely unvaccinated children. Mawson and Jacob told The Defender they hope the government will initiate such studies.
Childhood vaccination schedule likely factor in increased autism diagnoses
The study found that, across all metrics, vaccinated children had a higher rate of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to those who remained unvaccinated. According to the findings:
“While the connection between receipt of vaccines and autism has been of grave concern to many parents, this study makes it clear that even in the absence of an autism diagnosis, children’s brains are being damaged,” said biologist Christina Parks, Ph.D.
Autism prevalence has grown from 1 in 1,000 children in the 1990s to 1 in 36, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study’s authors noted this increase is commonly attributed to greater awareness of autism-related symptoms and higher exposure to toxic chemicals.
However, the authors said their results suggest the childhood vaccination schedule may also be a key factor behind the sharp increase in autism diagnoses.
“The geographically widespread increases in ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and ADHD suggests a role for an environmental factor to which virtually all children are exposed. One such factor is routine childhood vaccinations,” the study noted.
The authors cited figures showing that the number of vaccines included in the CDC’s latest U.S. childhood schedule increased nearly threefold compared to the 1983 vaccination schedule.
“Although vaccination is said to be safe and effective for the great majority of children, a legitimate question is whether the expanded schedule could be contributing in some way to rising rates of NDDs [neurodevelopmental disorders],” the study stated.
“Any planned additions to the childhood vaccination schedule should be delayed until research to determine the safety of its impact on children’s overall health is completed,” Mawson and Jacob said.
Results indicate childhood vaccination schedule ‘needs a complete overhaul’
According to the study, the impact of vaccination on children born preterm has not been sufficiently examined.
“The possibility of adverse effects of vaccination on preterm infants may have been obscured by the primary importance placed on vaccinations for preventing neonatal infections,” the study said.
A peer-reviewed study published earlier this month found that preterm infants who received their routine 2-month vaccinations had a 170% higher incidence of apnea compared to unvaccinated babies.
The study also noted that while studies have often attempted to connect rising autism rates to specific vaccines, there has been less research exploring a possible link between the cumulative childhood vaccination schedule and autism.
“A link between vaccination and ASD could be due to the cumulative impact of all preceding vaccinations rather than to a specific vaccine alone,” the study said. “ASD and other NDDs could be triggered by the last vaccination administered or by one or more of a series of vaccinations.”
“There is an urgent need for research to identify biological mechanisms and potential causal relationships between individual vaccines, combinations of vaccines, and other potential factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorders,” Mawson and Jacob said.
Hulscher said the study suggests that the current “CDC hyper-vaccination schedule needs a complete overhaul.” He added, “Not only is it likely contributing to the autism and chronic disease epidemics, but almost all of the vaccines were licensed without proper long-term, placebo-controlled trials.”
Parks said the study’s results reinforce the importance of parental choice.
“However, there were some findings that parents may find comforting,” Parks said. “While preterm infants are extremely vulnerable to encephalopathy and seizures, if parents chose not to vaccinate them, they were statistically no more likely to develop neurodevelopmental disorders than normal-term infants.”
According to a September 2024 CDC report, vaccination rates among children born in 2020 and 2021 were lower than those for children born in 2018 and 2019. Hulscher said that an increasing number of Americans are becoming aware of the risks of childhood vaccination.
“The American public is becoming increasingly aware of the real risks of vaccines,” Hulscher said. He attributed the growing mistrust to “the COVID-19 mRNA injection debacle that killed, injured, or permanently disabled millions of people.”
Hulscher said the study’s results “warrant further study by the new U.S. administration.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/would-you-eat-bread-made-with-worms-brussels-thinks-so,Would You Eat Bread Made With Worms? Brussels Thinks So,By Liz Heflin | Remix,1 month ago,"According to Regulation (EU) 2025/89, EU citizens will now be able to enjoy bread made from worms. The inspiration for this new rule is that we humans need an alternative to meat.
“A European will eat four oxen, four rams, 46 pigs, 46 turkeys, 12 geese, 37 ducks, and as many as 945 chickens in their entire life. Over 73 percent of families prepare meat dishes at least several times a week. Around 350 million tons of meat are consumed worldwide each year,” explained Poland’s Salon24, noting that the consumption of meat in Poland is even higher than in other member states.
Last year, the European Commission removed the emphasis on promoting laboratory meat within the framework of the Community’s climate policy due to objections from farmers. Agriculture, namely, livestock, has been targeted for generating over 10 percent of annual gas emissions, and the EU aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by 90 percent by 2040.
So now, Brussels wants people to get their protein by eating insects The EU list of new foods for humans, reports Salon24, currently includes three types of insects: the mealworm (in the form of dried larvae), the migratory locust (frozen, dried and powdered) and the house cricket (frozen, dried and powdered).
The larvae of the shiny mealworm have also been allowed to be traded on the EU market in frozen, paste, dried, and powdered form.
The European Commission announcement implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/89 on Jan. 20 authorizes “the placing on the market of UV-treated powder of whole yellow mealworm larvae (Teebrio) as a novel food and amends Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470.”
It explains that “on March 28, 2023, the Authority adopted its scientific opinion on the ‘Safety of UV-treated powder of whole yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor larvae) as a novel food pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283’’ in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283.”
The communication continues: “In its scientific opinion, the Authority concluded that the UV-treated powder of whole Tenebrio molitor larvae is safe under the proposed conditions and use levels. Therefore, this scientific opinion provides sufficient grounds to establish that the UV-treated powder of whole Tenebrio molitor larvae, for use in bread and rolls, cakes, pasta products, processed potato products, cheese and cheese products, and fruit and vegetable compotes, intended for the general population, meets the conditions for placing it on the market in accordance with Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283.”
It concludes by stating that “this Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.”
The law means bread and rolls will contain 4 grams of mealworms per 100g of bread, and cakes – 3.5g of larvae per 100g of cake. And apparently, this is creating a whole new business of larvae breeders.
On a Polish government website, there is even a study published for over 5 million zlotys, provided by the EU, to develop “a strategy for the use of alternative protein sources in animal nutrition enabling the development of its production in the territory of the Republic of Poland.”
Luckily, it appears that the regulation mandates that all products containing UV-treated powder of whole Tenebrio molitor larvae (yellow mealworm) be listed as an ingredient. Also, there will have to be an additional “statement that this ingredient may cause allergic reactions to consumers with knownallergies to crustaceans, and products thereof, and to dust mites.”",0

Watch: (relevant portion begins at 34:06)
MATT TAIBBI: There are so many different areas where they are going to have to investigate and reinvestigate that. We just went through a period where there was mass stonewalling of Congress when it was trying to investigate what happened with COVID. There were key people like Peter Daszak from the EcoHealth Alliance, who just didn’t answer subpoenas, right? There are documents that we know exist that we’re going to get now with FBI communications between the bureau and a lot of these scientists dating back ten years. And it’s going to tell a crazy story, a really interesting story. There’s a reason why Fauci’s pardon is backdated to 2014, because that’s the time period they are going to have to start looking, which is, when did we start defying the ban on gain of function research. We clearly did. That’s pretty established at this point.
Why were we doing it? What connection did that have to the Wuhan thing? What kind of advanced notice did we get? What kind of lies were told about it? Who were responsible for those lies? What information did we get about the inefficacy of the vaccine and how did that connect to statement by the CDC and the White House? This also connects to the censorship issue in a major way because there was a massive effort to control the public conversation about this that went through the health agencies. We know they’re looking at that. And that’s another executive order, by the way, the free speech order. It directs the Department of Justice to come up with a comprehensive review of all the censorship stuff, so we’re going to find out about that. I just think COVID is a gigantic rat’s nest of stuff. Every direction they look there’s going to find something revelatory.
TUCKER CARLSON: The question is: will that information reach the public? There is these intermediaries like the media. Congressional brand investigators, executive brand investigators like DOJ, inspector generals, they are always constantly releasing reports and no one reads them because no one picks them up in the media. Do we have enough interested reporters to designate what they find?
MATT TAIBBI: I think we do because what we think of as the media is dead. They no longer really matter. The media that matters right now are people like you, Joe Rogan and other independent podcasters out there. There’s this gigantic, thriving independent media out there that turned the last election. It was abundantly clear that the old media no longer had any ability to control the narrative about anything. They’re totally discredited.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/california-residents-face-toxic-runoff-as-rains-arrive,California Residents Face Toxic Runoff as Rains Arrive,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Rains over southern California have the potential to cause dangerous toxic runoff in areas burned by the devastating wildfires.
Most of the region is forecast at least an inch of rain, but the National Weather Service has warned of localised cloudbursts that could cause mudslides.
Flood watches are now in effect for areas including Pacific Palisades, Altadena and Castaic Lake.
A portion of the Pacific Coast Highway was closed due to mudflows in Topanga Canyon.
“All these fresh burns are very susceptible to rapid runoff,” Joe Sirard, a local meteorologist, told AP News.
“What that means is we have a fairly high danger of mud and debris flows once we get above those thresholds.”
Officials have warned that the ash left by the fires is extremely toxic, made up of burnt-out cars, electronic devices, batteries, building materials and household items. It contains “pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead.” Residents have been advised to wear protective equipment, including masks, while cleaning up.
As well as bringing danger, the rains could also bring relief and help firefighters bring the remaining wildfires under control.
The Palisades fire, the largest of the wildfires by far, which has killed at least 11 people, was at 90% containment on Sunday. The Eaton fire, which has killed 16, was at 98% containment. The Hughes Fire was at 95%.
The rain brings to an a near-record streak of dry weather for southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began on 1 October.",0

The Telegraph has more.
The Chief Medical Officer for England told the Covid Inquiry the decision to implement the mandate was .
Care home workers were mandated to be vaccinated against COVID-19 from November 2021 and were among the first to be given the jabs during the original rollout.
However, this scheme, known as vaccination as a condition of deployment (VCOD), was controversial. Proposals to widen the scheme to include all healthcare workers were later abandoned and the need for care home staff to be jabbed was lifted in 2022.
Prof Whitty said such a decision was a balance between the risk of having a vulnerable person cared for by someone who may pass on an infection to them and respecting a person’s own autonomy.
“There’s a range of opinions on this and for what it’s worth – but I don’t think it’s worth very much – I’m rather more sceptical than some people that this is a good idea, but that’s a view as a citizen,” Prof Whitty told the inquiry. …
“Every drug and vaccine has side effects, and some of those may be rare, but still severe, and that has to be taken into account in the decisions that are taken about mandation,” he added.
“I was sometimes worried that people were just thinking, ‘people should just get vaccinated. What’s the problem?’
“And my view is that this is a medical procedure, and, more importantly, there will be side effects and they may well be rare around serious and that is an important part of the balance of risk.” …
Professor Dame Jenny Harries, CEO of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and a Deputy Chief Medical Officer in the early phases of the coronavirus pandemic, also had reservations about mandatory vaccination, it emerged.
In an email sent on Feb 15th 2021, Dame Jenny said she was “quite outspoken” on the mandatory vaccination policy.
“I am hugely supportive of getting care homes protected, but I have seen no evidence to suggest that this policy is going to result in more benefit than harm,” she wrote in the email, shown to the inquiry.
But the politicians brought it in anyway. Another thing we can thank the Tories for. And no, it’s not because the ‘experts’ were telling them they had to.
Notice Whitty still won’t acknowledge that the jab didn’t actually prevent transmission – he still appears to hold that there was some ‘benefit’ to others from it. The delusion and refusal to take on board unwelcome facts runs deep.",0

This new study, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, is the first to suggest a clear mechanism to explain extensive reports of heart and other organ damage in recipients of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
When the vaccines were developed, health authorities claimed that the lipid nanoparticles would remain localized at the injection site, but there existed no technology to verify their claim accurately.
The scientists behind the new study came up with an experimental technology to allow them to follow the nanoparticles in the body of rodents.
The technology, called “Single Cell Precision Nanocarrier Identification,” was designed to map and quantify where nanoparticles injected into a mouse ended up. The technology uses machine learning to analyze image data—making it possible to precisely quantify where the nanoparticles travel across the entire body, down to the level of individual cells.
The researchers found that even at extremely low doses, the lipid nanoparticles reached the body’s internal organs. The nanoparticles reached the heart and were observed to cause tissue and cellular changes.
“Our finding of changes in the expression of immune and vascular proteins in heart tissue after LNP [lipid nanoparticle] spike mRNA delivery aligns with reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in a subset of individuals who received mRNA vaccines,” the researchers write.
As at 27 December 2024, 27,357 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis—serious conditions of the heart—had been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systems (VAERS) as a result of COVID-19 vaccines, with the vast majority of cases—over 20,000—attributed to the Pfizer vaccine.",0

According to a doctor who runs a maternity clinic in the US, there has been a significant increase in pre-term delivery requests after Trump’s executive order on Monday.
“A seven months pregnant woman came with her husband to sign up for a preterm delivery,” the doctor said.
“She isn’t due until sometime in March.”
Another doctor who spoke to Times of India said he had spoken to between 15 and 20 couples about pre-term caesareans over the last two days, and warned of the significant health risks posed by the procedure.
“I am trying to tell couples that even if it is possible, a preterm birth poses significant risk to mother and child,” he said.
“Complications include underdeveloped lungs, feeding problems, low birth weight, neurological complications and more.”
An Indian couple expecting a baby in March said they have been in the United States on H-1B visas for eight years, and were hoping for their child to be born in the country.
“We were counting on our child being born here. We’ve been waiting for our green cards for six years. This was the only way to ensure stability for our family. We are terrified of the uncertainty.”
Another expectant parent, who is preparing to have his first child with his wife, told Times of India, “We sacrificed so much to come here. Now, it feels like the door is closing on us.”
On Tuesday, in direct response to the executive order, a number of Democrat state attorneys filed a lawsuit to halt the executive order. Then on Thursday, a Seattle judge put a temporary block on the order.
US District Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, said he couldn’t “remember another case where the question presented is as clear as it is here. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.”
“Obviously we will appeal it,” President Trump said, from the White House.
“There’s no surprises with that judge,” he added.",0

The settlement comes nearly seven months after the US Supreme Court overturned a previously negotiated settlement that would have granted the Sacklers broad immunity from lawsuits in exchange for a $6 billion settlement.
The Supreme Court overturned the settlement on the basis that the Sacklers were not entitled to legal protections intended to benefit bankrupt debtors.
The new settlement will not protect Purdue or the Sacklers from further lawsuits from states, local governments or individual victims of the opioid crisis.
The deal was negotiated by 15 states, including New York, California, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Florida and West Virginia. Other states will be asked to sign on the settlement, which will only become final when it is approved by a US bankruptcy judge.
The opioid crisis is reckoned to have claimed some 700,000 lives over two decades. The role of the Sacklers in the crisis was explored in the bestselling book Empire of Pain by Patrick Radden Keefe.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 as the company faced thousands of lawsuits accusing it and the Sackler family of using deceptive marketing to drive sales of its addictive pain medicines, including Oxycontin.
The company pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its marketing of OxyContin in 2007 and 2020. Although members of the Sackler family have expressed their “regret” about Oxycontin’s role in the opioid crisis, they have never admitted wrongdoing.
Connecticut attorney General William Tong said the new settlement would help provide closure to victims of the opioid crisis.
“It’s not just about the money,” Tong said. “There is not enough money in the world to make it right.”",0

The new collaboration, dubbed “Stargate,” would massively scale up AI data centers over the next four years, and speed the development of godlike AI systems that Ellison promised could do things like develop cancer vaccines.
The collaboration drew harsh and immediate rebuke from Elon Musk, a close Trump advisor who was notably not at the Wednesday press conference, and suggested on X “They don’t actually have the money.”
He directed particular vitriol at Altman, whose OpenAI he co-founded and is currently suing; he reposted an image of a crack pipe with the joking allegation that Altman and his associates were smoking it. After hours of this, Altman finally slapped back, saying “i realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you’ll mostly put 🇺🇸 first.” –Politico
And while Altman slapped back against his OpenAI co-founder Musk, both project Stargate, and Altman cozying up to the Trump administration 2.0 has come under attack.
Altman, Reid Hoffman’s pool boy, has come under fire from journalist and author Mike Cernovich, who’s been pointing out that the OpenAI CEO has been a far left activist for a while.

In an appearance on Megyn Kelly’s podcast Wednesday, Shanahan, a Silicon Valley attorney and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s 2024 running mate, called for a moratorium on experimental mRNA technology because they already raise health concerns since the long-term effects are not yet fully understood.
“What we need for the mRNA platform right now is a moratorium. It’s not ready for human use,” Shanahan said. “One of the reasons why is it delivers an inconsistent result in individuals.”
Shanahan went on to explain how 5% of those who received the experimental COVID-19 mRNA jabs during the plandemic didn’t get the expected results — instead, many ended up with “turbo cancers,” “blood clots” and other adverse side effects, and others were even harmed as a result of spike protein “shedding.”
“In order for our population to grow, to be strong, to be fully able-bodied, and for our human economy to thrive, we do need a moratorium on the mRNA for the time being,” she said.
Kelly added, “Until it’s not Russian roulette to take it.”
Shanahan pointed out that many engineers and pharmacological researchers working on the development of the mRNA tech are overlooking a fundamental truth about human biology: it can’t be programmed the way a computer system can.
“They think that you can program the human body as you program an AI system, as you program a computer system. And the trouble with that mentality is that nature…there’s an element to it that when you interject something like the mRNA vaccine, there’s a huge amount of stochastic randomness that can occur,” she noted.
“AI is a computer system. Human health is not,” she added.
Shanahan also criticized the fact that mRNA vaccine tech was at the forefront of Trump’s Stargate announcement given AI could be deployed in many other ways that directly benefit the U.S. economy.
“There’s so many that could have been shared in yesterday’s conference that are really excellent uses of AI,” she said. “I heard a few that were kind of out there and if deployed too quickly could lead to an extinction event. So I think we need to be careful.”
“Whoa!” Kelly responded.
During the announcement of the $500 billion Stargate joint venture at the White House Tuesday, Oracle CTO Larry Ellison gushed over the potential health breakthroughs AI could make for cancer, specifically using the deployment of mRNA tech to curate individualized vaccines for treatment.
“Cancer diagnosis using AI has the promise of just being a simple blood test,” Ellison said. “Then once we gene-sequence that cancer tumor, you can then vaccinate the person, design a vaccine for every individual person to vaccinate them against that cancer.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/why-joe-biden-had-to-pardon-anthony-fauci,Why Joe Biden Had to Pardon Anthony Fauci,By Connor O'Keeffe | Mises Institute,1 month ago,"On Monday, in their final hours in office, former President Biden’s team chose to issue a blanket pardon to a number of close political allies and family members. Among that group was former Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci.
Fauci was pardoned “for any offense against the United States which he may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through the date of [the] pardon” relating in any way to his time as NIAID Director, on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the White House covid-19 response team, or as Biden’s Chief Medical Advisor.
In the letter explaining the pardons, Biden defended the choice, saying, “baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families.” Even when those individuals have done nothing wrong, Biden’s ghostwriters reason, “the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.”
Setting aside the fact that this was the exact tactic the political establishment used to try and tarnish Trump’s reputation, it’s revealing that the primary public reason presented for the pardons was to avoid investigations.
There are, of course, plenty of unseemly details about Fauci’s career that the political establishment would not like to see resurface in either the court of law or the court of public opinion. Many were detailed in RFK Jr.’s book The Real Anthony Fauci, such as the secretive and deadly drug experiments on hundreds of HIV-positive foster children at New York City’s Incarnation Children’s Center between 1988 and 2002 and the experiment that locked the heads of Beagle puppies into cages full of flesh-eating insects.
If Fauci had come under the federal government’s microscope, episodes like those could have done much to stain the name of the man Biden recently dubbed “a true hero.”
The same goes for Fauci’s completely inaccurate projection of the danger posed by a strain of swine flu in the 1970s, along with the millions of dollars of damages the government had to pay out due to injuries sustained in the related swine flu vaccine experiments.
Fauci also made similar failed projections relating to the 2005 bird flu, the 2009 swine flu, and the 2016 Zika virus. In all these cases, the virus was nowhere near as dangerous as Fauci had claimed it would be. But his warnings did result in his department and other parts of Washington’s public health bureaucracy getting billions of dollars in new funding.
Of course, these episodes pale in comparison to what Fauci is now most famous for: overseeing the covid pandemic.
Early on, Fauci famously explained on TV that cloth masks cannot stop people infected with covid from filling the air around them with virus particles. He then completely reversed his stance and advocated for universal masking and government mask mandates.
He later claimed his earlier comments on television had been lies meant to trick the public into not buying masks to protect the supply of masks for healthcare workers who, in fact, used a different kind of mask. He then acted confused when much of the public stopped trusting him.
Fauci also went on record in early April 2020 calling for nationwide lockdowns—something he would later deny doing. When some states like Florida started to reopen months later, Fauci warned the governors they were taking “a really significant risk.”
It quickly became obvious to anyone who was actually looking that Fauci was completely wrong about the effectiveness of masking and lockdowns. But Fauci ignored the data and kept pushing for these measures into 2021, after the vaccines had become available.
Another fact that had become obvious early in the pandemic was that children posed little risk of contracting and spreading covid. Yet, Fauci pushed for school closures and later school masking long after both were clearly shown to be unnecessary.
Finally, Fauci made several high-profile claims about the covid vaccines that would quickly prove false.
But making bad projections and giving bad advice isn’t a crime. So why was the political class worried about Fauci being investigated by the Department of Justice? Because a federal investigation would likely have related to the speculation that Fauci played a role in bringing the pandemic about in the first place.
One controversial method for studying viruses involves artificially making the virus more transmissible or virulent. This so-called “gain-of-function” research allows for virus mutation or possible treatments to be analyzed much more quickly, but it brings the risk of a much more dangerous genetically-engineered virus infecting people if a sample leaks out.
We know that an NGO that gets funding from Fauci’s department bankrolled gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses at the laboratory in Wuhan, China, in 2017 and 2018. And that the same NGO had received federal funding while conducting gain-of-function research going back to 2014, when a three-year ban on using federal funds for such experiments had been implemented and when Fauci’s pardon happens to come into effect.
While there is no evidence that these experiments are related to the coronavirus that would eventually spread out of Wuhan in late 2019 and early 2020, there is still much we do not know about the extent of US involvement in similar experiments at the Wuhan lab around the time covid started to spread.
That fact, paired with the panicked and secretive behavior of Fauci and his colleagues after the first reports of covid started to emerge, has raised suspicion about the possibility of US government involvement in covid’s origin. Biden’s DOJ refused to investigate these matters. But after Senator Rand Paul got Fauci to explicitly deny, under oath, that his department had funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab, an investigation into the truth of the claim to determine if Fauci had committed perjury remained a possibility.
That was until Biden pardoned him Monday morning.
A federal investigation would have all but forced the media to revisit many of Fauci’s unseemly actions, failures, and possible crimes. That would have been uncomfortable for a political establishment that has embraced and celebrated Fauci for decades.
But the real danger of a high-profile Fauci investigation, from the political class’s perspective, would come if the public started to ask themselves why a bureaucrat with such a long track record of failure was embraced and celebrated by those in power. And why he enjoyed so much professional success before retiring with a net worth of more than $11 million.
Such questions could lead people to consider that maybe the decades of mistakes that transferred hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to public health agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and the crony healthcare system as a whole were not mistakes after all. That, perhaps, the federal public health apparatus is nothing more than a racket and that officials are professionally rewarded, not for keeping us safe, but for protecting and expanding that racket.",0

More experimental mRNA gene therapy technology for millions of people — what can possibly go wrong?
Ellison made the remarks Tuesday at a White House press conference hosted by President Donald Trump, alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son to announce the launch of the ambitious Stargate Project.
“One of the most exciting things we’re working on using the tools that Sam [Altman] and [Masayoshi Son] are providing is a cancer vaccine,” Ellison said.
“Turns out, all of our cancers, cancer tumors- little fragments of those tumors float around in your blood. So you can do early cancer detection with a blood test. And using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancers that are actually seriously threatening the person.”
“Cancer diagnosis using AI has the promise of just being a simple blood test,” Ellison continued. “Then once we gene-sequence that cancer tumor, you can then vaccinate the person, design a vaccine for every individual person to vaccinate them against that cancer.”
“And you can make that mRNA vaccine, you can make that robotically against using AI in about 48 hours,” he added. “This is the promise of AI and the promise of the future.”
Altman likewise predicted that “we will be amazed at how quickly we’re curing this cancer and that one – and heart disease” thanks to the development of more advanced AI technology.
Trump hailed the half-trillion dollar Stargate project as a “monumental undertaking” and a “resounding declaration of confidence in America’s potential” that would create around 100,000 new jobs, and will ensure America leads the world in the “future of technology.”
Notably, Elon Musk, tapped by Trump to head the Department of Government Efficiency, poured cold water all over Stargate on X, claiming that Altman is a “swindler” and that OpenAI and Softbank don’t “actually have the money” necessary to launch the project.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/some-of-the-foreign-doctors-are-a-significant-safety-risk-senior-german-doctor-warns-against-doctors-from-muslim-countries,‘Some of The Foreign Doctors Are a Significant Safety Risk’ – Senior German Doctor Warns Against Doctors From Muslim Countries,By Staff | Remix,1 month ago,"Foreign doctors are not a solution to the soaring healthcare shortage seen in Germany, and in many cases, these foreign doctors actually represent a threat to patients, according to a senior doctor in Lower Saxony who conducted an in-depth interview with Cicero magazine about her experience.
There are increasing calls to bring in more foreign doctors to Germany, but the doctor interviewed, who works as a specialist in internal medicine and cardiology in a hospital in Lower Saxony, warns there are serious differences in medical training between countries. She only spoke to Cicero under the condition her name would not be disclosed out of fear of reprisals.
“As a senior physician, I also look after foreign assistant doctors who have a professional license. Out of ten foreign doctors, there is only one that I would let loose on patients. It’s not just about language barriers, but about glaring differences in medical training. Look: A lung cancer patient and a patient with a heart attack receive the same guideline-compliant treatment regardless of their health insurance status. My experience: The majority of foreign colleagues are not even aware of these standards,” she said.
She has plenty of examples in her own experience of how foreign doctors are unfamiliar with standard practices in Germany.
“Last week I worked in the internal medicine intensive care unit with a colleague who is an electrophysiologist from Belarus. He was visibly struggling to interpret an ECG. When he then performed a cardiac ultrasound, I had the impression that it was like a moon landing for him. In our everyday medical practice, however, this is absolutely standard practice,” she said.In some cases, she added, it is very possible her foreign colleagues may have even contributed to the death of patients.
“I also have to report more extreme examples: In connection with an Arab colleague, the public prosecutor’s office has already ordered an autopsy. The colleague put a gastric tube in the lung and a central venous catheter in the artery in the neck. The patient died. I certainly don’t know for sure what caused the patient’s death, but you understand, some of these doctors pose a significant safety risk. This is not only a risk for the patients, but also pushes us senior doctors beyond the limits of our workload,” she said.
She went on to say that poorly trained colleagues are so inept that she has to “protect the patient from the doctor.” This means when she goes off duty and comes back on duty, she has to review all the steps poorly trained foreign medical colleagues did with the patients in order to ensure the patients’ health.
In this regard, she provided another example, stating: “With a young patient in his mid-20s, things were on edge. He was in a life-threatening condition. At the beginning of January, a young Arab doctor was on duty and was responsible for him, but he was not able to insert intravenous needles. It was the Arab doctor, I told you about. So I asked the nurses to look after the young patient themselves, not the doctor. As a senior physician, I expressly forbade this colleague from touching this patient. I could not have imagined something like this a few years ago.”
She said that not all foreign doctors have been an issue in Germany, saying that she has had good experiences with doctors from southern European countries. She noted that the Italian doctors who come to Germany have a “brilliant” level of training and can earn more money in northern European countries. She noted that even though doctors from Morocco may have a poor bedside manner, they have solid medical training; however, doctors from Syria and Afghanistan are another story.
“I have to say: The more Muslim the colleagues have been through their socialization, the more difficult it is to deal with them in everyday hospital life,” she said. “Many Muslim colleagues have great difficulty accepting criticism. Since they have a very strong sense of honor, they immediately feel attacked. When I wanted to explain objectively to a doctor colleague how to issue a death certificate, he shouted at me and accused me of racism. He also said that he did not want to deal with such simple tasks. How can I work profitably with a colleague if he cannot handle criticism and feels his honor is insulted? Constantly learning new things is essential in our profession.”
She also noted that many Muslim doctors harbor “gender stereotypes.”
“It is horrible how disrespectfully they sometimes treat nurses,” she said. “Even I, an experienced senior physician, am sometimes treated with an arrogance and superiority that I have never experienced before in my experience in hospitals. We have young female assistant doctors on the team who tell me quite openly to my face that they do not want to work with Arab colleagues on the weekend. They feel harassed and are afraid. As a woman, I have to say: I can understand my young colleagues very well.”
She also noted that she is not the only one who has had unbelievable experiences with foreign doctors. She notes that her husband once worked in Hesse and had to conduct a state examination with a foreign doctor only to have to fail him due to his lack of knowledge.
“One of these patients had a red face, a classic symptom of shingles. This is a very easy-to-recognize disease. One of the foreign doctors diagnosed that it was a tumor growing out of the head and urgently needed to be surgically removed. The man already had a professional license and was working as a neurosurgeon in Hesse. My husband had no choice but to let him fail. Many of his family members and friends were waiting outside the door. When they got wind of the fact that he had failed the exam, my husband had to be escorted out of the building by security,” she said.
Not only are medical standards much lower in many foreign countries, but foreign doctors are also struggling in Germany with the language, with nearly half of doctors failing the language proficiency tests, as Remix News has previously reported. Based on her own experience as a doctor for nearly 20 years, she says that accelerating the admission of foreign doctors into Germany, including relaxing standards, would be a fatal mistake.
“There is always discussion about whether we should gradually repeal the current rules in Germany and recognize more foreign specialist training. The faster recognition of specialists is just one example of many discussions that aim to admit foreign doctors to our hospitals more quickly and without complex checks. I can only strongly warn against this because, in my experience, a Syrian or Afghan doctor is very far from German standards. In view of the increasingly ideological debates about the shortage of skilled workers in recent years, I am very afraid of this possible development,” said the doctor.
She told Cicero that she is concerned about the poorly researched reporting in the media about the topic of foreign doctors, to which Cicero asks her whether this has to do with a deliberate omission of factors or simply shoddy reporting.
“I think it is both. In many media reports about the shortage of skilled workers and foreign doctors, poor research meets a preconceived, ideologically influenced opinion,” she said. “I have been a doctor since 2006, and I feel more and more strongly how a mainstream view has prevailed in the media debate about the shortage of skilled workers, which says that the recognition of professions should be made easier.”She also said that the media presents a contorted version of the facts, often portraying a huge wealth of foreign doctors that Germany could be tapping into, including many who are already working in low-skilled professions in Germany.“The media keeps presenting this manipulative and distorted image of foreign cardiology professors who have to work as garbage men. You know, in reality, that simply does not exist. Don’t get me wrong, we really do need to do something about the shortage of skilled workers, but the solution cannot be to let poorly trained doctors loose on patients. That would be a capitulation to our medical standards, which have distinguished the health system in Germany for a long time,” she said.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/west-virginia-gov-patrick-morrisey-orders-religious-exemptions-for-childhood-vaccines,West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey Orders Religious Exemptions for Childhood Vaccines,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,1 month ago,"CHARLESTON, West Virginia (LifeSiteNews) – New West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced an executive order establishing a religious exemption for childhood vaccination requirements that he says is necessary to clarify residents’ rights under a 2023 religious freedom law.
In 2023, previous Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed the Equal Protection for Religion Act, which updated state law by “forbidding excessive government limitations on exercise of religion; forbidding government from treating religious conduct more restrictively than any conduct of reasonably comparable risk; (and) forbidding government from treating religious conduct more restrictively than comparable conduct because of alleged economic need or benefit.”
Announced during the first news conference of Morrisey’s administration as one of 10 executive orders addressing a range of issues, the vaccine order directs state health officials to establish a process for parents to request religious or conscience-based objections to subjecting their children to state-mandated vaccines as a condition of enrolling them in public school, and directs those objections to be honored, with a “writing signed by the objector” being sufficient proof.
“I think most West Virginians care very deeply that our citizens have religious beliefs, and we also know that the First Amendment to our Constitution has specific clauses calling for free association,” the governor said, adding that he hopes the legislature writes a new law clarifying the situation “because when the Equal Protection for Religious Act was passed, it didn’t amend specific laws. So, the vaccine laws stand alone.”
“We cannot compromise individuals and parents’ deeply held religious convictions,” Morrisey declared.
Dr. Steven Eshenaur, health officer for the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department, opposes exemptions, arguing that they weaken protection against disease. Morrisey rejected that prediction, arguing that the move places West Virginia back in the national mainstream, and that previously West Virginia was one of just five states that failed to recognize non-medical exemptions for school immunization.
“This order reflects our shared commitment to protecting individual rights while fostering trust in our health care system,” said Republican state Del. Evan Worrell, new chair of the House Committee on Health, in support of the order. “Vaccines have played a critical role in safeguarding public health, but I believe that health decisions should remain a matter of personal choice, made in consultation with medical professionals. It is vital that we balance public health goals with the principles of freedom and transparency.”
The past four years have seen a renewed critical look by many at conventional vaccines and the laws governing them, provoked by the federal government’s lack of transparency regarding the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines that were developed and reviewed in a fraction of the time vaccines usually take under the first Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed initiative.
Attempts to mandate the shots also reignited awareness of the use of cells derived from aborted babies in vaccine development and testing, raising moral objections.
The federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports 38,264 deaths, 219,594 hospitalizations, 22,134 heart attacks, and 28,814 myocarditis and pericarditis cases as of December 27, among other ailments. CDC researchers have recognized a “high verification rate of reports of myocarditis to VAERS after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination,” leading to the conclusion that “under-reporting is more likely” than over-reporting.
An analysis of 99 million people across eight countries published February in the journal Vaccine “observed significantly higher risks of myocarditis following the first, second and third doses” of mRNA-based COVID vaccines, as well as signs of increased risk of “pericarditis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis,” and other “potential safety signals that require further investigation.” In April, the CDC was forced to release by court order 780,000 previously undisclosed reports of serious adverse reactions, and a study out of Japan found “statistically significant increases” in cancer deaths after third doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines and offered several theories for a causal link.
Earlier this month, a long-awaited Florida grand jury report on the COVID vaccine manufacturers found that while a low percentage of the millions of vaccinations resulted in serious harm based on the data it had access to, such events do occur, and there are “profound and serious issues” in pharmaceutical companies’ review process, including reluctance to share what evidence of adverse events they did find.",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/bidens-legacy-covid-persecution-censorship-and-across-the-board-oppression,"Biden’s Legacy: Covid Persecution, Censorship, and Across-the-Board Oppression",By James Bovard | Brownstone Institute,1 month ago,"Joe Biden’s presidency ends on January 20, 2025. There will likely be a media stampede to hallow his reign and trumpet his virtues. But Biden perpetually trampled his January 20, 2021, oath to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”
In his 2022 State of the Union address, Biden declared, “When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they keep moving.” And he kept moving until his own political party dumped him. Later in 2022, President Biden proclaimed that “liberty is under assault.” But he was referring solely to a few court rulings of which he disapproved, not to the federal supremacy he championed for almost 50 years in the Senate and the White House.
The absurdity of the Biden reign was epitomized in July when he was browbeaten into ending his reelection campaign. In Biden’s 11-minute speech announcing that decision, everything was sacred — including the Oval Office (“this sacred space”), “the sacred cause of this country,” “the “sacred task of perfecting our Union,” and the “sacred idea” of America. Biden announced that “I revere this office” — a hint that viewers should revere him, too. Biden has worshiped political power his entire life — and so it was no surprise that religiosity suffused his valedictory address.
Biden asked: “Does character in public life still matter?” That signaled that most of the cover-ups of his abuses and potential kickbacks will continue at least until January. No wonder Hunter Biden had a big smile as he sat just outside of the video sweep in the Oval Office. But Biden never permitted his Attorney General, Merrick Garland, to release the audiotape of Biden’s bumbling interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur — perhaps the single biggest step toward Biden’s expulsion from American political life.
Biden told viewers of that July spiel: “Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.” So Democratic Party bosses had no choice but to nullify 15 million primary ballots cast for Biden and jam a replacement candidate down the nation’s throat. For years, the Democratic Party has equated vanquishing or destroying Trump with saving democracy, justifying any tactic — fair or foul — to thwart him. Ginning up bogus criminal charges to get Trump locked away from voters? Check. Using the FBI and other federal agencies to target anyone who is too enthusiastic about MAGA? Check.
Perhaps Biden’s biggest innovation was his doctrine that preserving democracy requires destroying freedom of speech. His appointees launched the Disinformation Governance Board to police Americans’ criticisms of government and plenty of other topics. The Orwellian name helped torpedo that board, but that was not even the tip of the iceberg of federal abuses. A federal appeals court slammed the Biden administration for conducting an unconstitutional censorship “pressure campaign designed to coerce social-media companies into suppressing speakers, viewpoints, and content disfavored by the government.” That same court found that censors especially targeted speech by conservatives and Republicans.
For at least 15 years, Biden has relied on a two-step routine — ruthlessly vilifying his opponents and then appealing to “our better angels,” a phrase recycled from Lincoln’s first inaugural address. Biden lulled listeners into assuming he is personally one of those “better angels” as he flailed anyone in the way of his latest power grab.
From portraying any Republican who wanted to cut domestic spending as a “terrorist” in 2011, to claiming that Mitt Romney wanted to put black people back “in chains” in the 2012 presidential campaign, to endlessly misrepresenting the 2017 violence at a Charlottesville protest, Biden out-Nixoned Nixon. The media has sainted Biden on civil rights despite his championing crime legislation in the Senate that vastly increased the number of black and Hispanic citizens sent to prison. In a 2019 piece headlined “Joe Biden and the Era of Mass Incarceration,” the New York Times hyped Biden’s favorite fix: “Lock the S.O.B.s up!”
In his final full month before being demoted to lame-duck status, Biden made one last lunge to portray himself as a savior of the Constitution. After a Supreme Court decision blocked rigged political prosecutions of former President Trump, an outraged Biden condemned the decision. Seemingly speaking down from Mount Olympus, Biden declared that presidents “face moments where you need the wisdom to respect the limits of the power of the office of the presidency.” But then he claimed, “I know I will respect the limits of the presidential power, as I have for 3½ years.” That line obliterated all the president’s lofty pretenses.
While Biden piously invoked the “rule of law” in that brief statement, he consistently behaved as if his good intentions entitled him to dictatorial power. Biden speedily followed up by proposing a “No One Is Above the Law” constitutional amendment. But Biden would have been more honest if he labeled his pitch the “No One Is Above the Law Except Me” amendment.
In the same week that Biden trumpeted his proposed amendment, he announced new schemes to avoid complying with the Supreme Court ruling forbidding him from illegally and unilaterally forgiving hundreds of billions of dollars of federal student debt owed by 30 million people. Biden then openly bragged that the decision striking down his program “didn’t stop me” from canceling student-loan debt with one new scheme after another. No wonder almost half of student-loan debtors are not bothering to pay what they owe Uncle Sam.
The Biden administration presumed that federal policymakers are an elite automatically entitled to domineer other Americans. For example, Biden championed Covid vaccines as panaceas for the pandemic, promising that people who got injections would not get Covid. After vaccines massively failed to prevent Covid infections, the White House strong-armed the Food and Drug Administration to speedily bestow full approval on the Pfizer vax regardless of myocarditis problems. Biden then dictated that 100 million American adults must get those vaccines.
In January 2022, the Supreme Court struck down Biden’s vaccine mandate for 84 million employees of large private companies. The Supreme Court also struck down Biden’s illegal extension of a Covid-era eviction moratorium, scoffing at the administration’s attempt to justify the edict via an old law dealing with “fumigation and pest extermination.” But the president’s team perpetuated the Covid emergency and all the additional powers for the White House as long as possible. Team Biden even dictated that two-year-old children in Head Start must wear masks all day. But that wasn’t dictatorial because children were permitted to briefly remove the masks when they ate meals.
Americans have long groused about TSA agents browbeating them to “show your papers” prior to groin-grabbing “enhanced pat-downs.” The Biden administration solved the paperwork problem by permitting illegal aliens to board domestic flights merely by showing their arrest warrants from the Department of Homeland Security. Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) growled: “If an Idahoan gets a speeding ticket, they can’t use the ticket to board a plane, so why does the president seem to think an illegal immigrant’s arrest warrant is a valid form of identification to board a plane?”
TSA wizards recently launched a social media campaign to ridicule their victims, demeaning any American who does not approach a TSA checkpoint practically stripped down like a convict entering a prison shower. The failures of TSA’s Whole Body Scanners are legendary, but that didn’t deter Biden TSA policymakers from launching a vast facial-recognition system that even the Washington Post condemned.
Biden weaponized federal law at the same time he exempted himself and his appointees from the statute book. FBI agents conducted a heavily televised raid in August 2022 on Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida, seizing 33 boxes of evidence and documents. Five months later, the Justice Department announced that Biden may have also wrongfully stored or possessed numerous classified documents in his home and offices. Trump was swiftly indicted for his alleged offenses, while Biden was effectively absolved because jurors would likely see him as an elderly man with a bad memory. Although Biden was unfit to prosecute, he remained fit to possess almost boundless power over America and much of the world — at least until Democratic Party poohbahs and billionaire donors carried out a de facto coup ending his reelection campaign.
Biden is seeking to portray himself as the patron saint of the Rule of Law. The president spoke in July 2024 as if he worshipped legal procedures, but his devotion is selective.
Biden has stretched executive power far beyond reason — from his attempt to use the school-lunch program to force public schools to permit mixed-gender showers and bathrooms to his perversion of Title IX to risk crippling girls’ sports. To complement those power grabs, the Biden White House continually expanded the target list for federal investigations and surveillance — including angry parents at school board meetings and frustrated young guys supposedly prone to “involuntary celibate violent extremism.”
The FBI has illegally wiretapped more than 3 million Americans in recent years, but the Biden administration recently torpedoed Congressional efforts to curb that surveillance crime spree. The FBI has 80 agents on a task force to curb “subversive data utilized to drive a wedge between the populace and the government.” Multiple FBI offices across the nation may have secretly infiltrated church services to “identify the bad Catholics” (those who prefer traditional church services), according to FBI memos and whistleblowers. An FBI analysis justifying the targeting of Catholics portrayed rosaries as extremist symbols that helped justify federal targeting. The FBI aided Team Biden in portraying “white supremacy” as the nation’s greatest terror threat by arresting legions of people who were guilty of “parading without a permit” during the January 6 protest at the Capitol. The FBI classified all 1,000 people arrested on charges linked to January 6 as domestic terrorists — including peaceful grandmothers. No wonder people joke that FBI now stands for “Following Biden’s Instructions.”
In a spiel last summer before Democratic Party leaders labeled him mentally unfit, Biden invoked “the character of George Washington,” which he said “defined the presidency” with his belief that “power was limited, not absolute.” Biden claimed that “character” was the only restraint on White House power — suggesting that Americans were luckier than ever to have him in the Oval Office. Biden pirouetting as a constitutional vestal virgin is on par with Henry Kissinger winning the Nobel Peace Prize after ravaging Southeast Asia — an award that spurred Tom Lehrer to proclaim that satire was dead.
Biden did not permit his victory laps to interfere with his ongoing cover-ups designed to assure that Americans remained ignorant of Biden administration scandals till after Election Day. Americans did not learn the hard facts (despite a Congressional investigation) about allegations of Tim Walz’s connections to the Chinese Communist Party, the full details on the Secret Service’s failure to protect Trump, or the White House string-pulling for the federal censors muzzling countless Americans to safeguard the Biden administration’s reputation. And the Biden White House continued deluging Americans with phony claims of progress in Ukraine’s war against Russia while refusing to disclose almost any details on exactly how the US was intervening and risking World War Three.
Rather than pound the White House for belated disclosures that could change the outcome of the election, much of the media simply continued reciting “Orange Man Bad.” If The Wizard of Oz was a contemporary political campaign story, the media would overwhelmingly side with the guy behind the curtain. Nowadays, withholding evidence is the only proof of innocence required in Washington.
At a 2023 Juneteenth celebration, Biden proclaimed that he would need a second term to “literally redeem the soul of America.” Biden missed that train. He also missed the chance to satisfy his gender-fluid supporters by publicly coming out and personally identifying as “nondictator.”
Biden helped turn Washington into an Impunity Democracy in which government officials pay no price for their crimes. Thanks in part to Biden’s efforts stretching back to the Nixon era, Americans today are more likely to believe in witches, ghosts, and astrology than to trust the federal government. But Biden’s apologists will seek to redeem his name in the history books by defining down ‘dictator’. Instead of designating a ruler who tramples the law and Constitution, “dictatorship” will only refer to presidents who publicly proclaim their plans to do bad things to good people.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-deplorable-ethics-of-a-preemptive-pardon-for-fauci,The Deplorable Ethics of a Preemptive Pardon for Fauci,By Alex Washburne | Brownstone Institute,1 month ago,"Anthony “I represent science” Fauci can now stand beside Richard “I am not a crook” Nixon in the history books as someone who received the poison pill of a preemptive pardon.
While Nixon was pardoned for specific charges related to Watergate, the exact crimes for which Fauci was pardoned are not specified. Rather, the pardon specifies:
Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong – and in fact have done the right things – and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated and prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.
In other words, the dying breath of the Biden administration appears to be pardoning Fauci for crimes he didn’t commit, which would seem to make a pardon null and void. The pardon goes further than simply granting clemency for crimes. Clemency usually alleviates the punishment associated with a crime, but here Biden attempts to alleviate the burden of investigations and prosecutions, the likes of which our justice system uses to uncover crimes.
It’s one thing to pardon someone who has been subjected to a fair trial and convicted, to say they have already paid their dues. Gerald Ford, in his pardon of Richard Nixon, admitted that Nixon had already paid the high cost of resigning from the highest office in the land. Nixon’s resignation came as the final chapter of prolonged investigations into his illegal and unpresidential conduct during Watergate, and those investigations provided us the truth we needed to know that Nixon was a crook and move on content that his ignominious reputation was carved into stone for all of history.
Fauci, meanwhile, has evaded investigations on matters far more serious than Watergate. In 2017, DARPA organized a grant call – the PREEMPT call – aiming to preempt pathogen spillover from wildlife to people. In 2018 a newly formed collaborative group of scientists from the US, Singapore, and Wuhan wrote a grant – the DEFUSE grant – proposing to modify a bat sarbecovirus in Wuhan in a very unusual way. DARPA did not fund the team because their work was too risky for the Department of Defense, but in 2019 Fauci’s NIAID funded this exact set of scientists who never wrote a paper together prior or since. In late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan with the precise modifications proposed in the DEFUSE grant submitted to PREEMPT.
It’s reasonable to be concerned that this line of research funded by Fauci’s NIAID may have caused the pandemic. In fact, if we’re sharp-penciled and honest with our probabilities, it’s likely beyond reasonable doubt that SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a consequence of research proposed in DEFUSE. What we don’t know, however, is whether the research proceeded with US involvement or not.
Congress used its constitutionally-granted investigation and oversight responsibilities to investigate and oversee NIAID in search of answers. In the process of these investigations, they found endless pages of emails with unjustified redactions, evidence that Fauci’s FOIA lady could “make emails disappear,” Fauci’s right-hand-man David Morens aided the DEFUSE authors as they navigated disciplinary measures at NIH and NIAID, and there were significant concerns that NIAID sought to obstruct investigations and destroy federal records.
Such obstructive actions did not inspire confidence in the innocence of Anthony Fauci or the US scientists he funded in 2019. On the contrary, Fauci testified twice under oath saying NIAID did not fund gain-of-function research of concern in Wuhan…but then we discovered a 2018 progress report of research NIAID funded in Wuhan revealing research they funded had enhanced the transmissibility of a bat SARS-related coronavirus 10,000 times higher than the wild virus. That is, indisputably, gain-of-function research of concern. Fauci thus lied to the American public and perjured himself in his testimony to Congress, and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) has referred Fauci’s perjury charges to the Department of Justice.
What was NIAID trying to preempt with their obstruction of Congressional investigations? What is Biden trying to preempt with his pardon of Fauci? Why do we not have the 2019 NIAID progress report from the PI’s who submitted DEFUSE to PREEMPT and later received funding from NIAID?
It is deplorable for Biden to preemptively pardon Fauci on his last day in office, with so little known about the research NIAID funded in 2019 and voters so clearly eager to learn more. With Nixon’s preemptive pardon, the truth of his wrongdoing was known and all that was left was punishment. With Fauci’s preemptive pardon, the truth is not yet known, NIAID officials in Fauci’s orbit violated federal records laws in their effort to avoid the truth from being known, and Biden didn’t preemptively pardon Fauci to grant clemency and alleviate punishment, but to stop investigations and prosecutions the likes of which could uncover the truth.
I’m not a Constitutional scholar prepared to argue the legality of this maneuver, but I am an ethical human being, a scientist who contributed another grant to the PREEMPT call, and a scientist who helped uncover some of the evidence consistent with a lab origin and quantify the likelihood of a lab origin from research proposed in the DEFUSE grant. Any ethical human being knows that we need to know what caused the pandemic, and to deprive the citizenry of such information from open investigations of NIAID research in 2019 would be to deprive us of critical information we need to self-govern and elect people who manage scientific risks in ways we see fit. As a scientist, there are critical questions about bioattribution that require testing, and the way to test our hypotheses is to uncover the redacted and withheld documents from Fauci’s NIAID in 2019.
The Biden administration’s dying breath was to pardon Anthony Fauci not for the convictions for crimes he didn’t commit (?) but to avoid investigations that could be a reputational and financial burden for Anthony Fauci. A pardon to preempt an investigation is not a pardon; it is obstruction. The Biden administration’s dying breath is to obstruct our pursuit of truth and reconciliation on the ultimate cause of 1 million Americans’ dying breaths.
To remind everyone what we still need to know, it helps to look through the peephole of what we’ve already found to inspire curiosity about what else we’d find if only the peephole could be widened. Below is one of the precious few emails investigative journalists pursuing FOIAs against NIAID have managed to obtain from the critical period when SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have emerged. The email connects DEFUSE PI’s Peter Daszak (EcoHealth Alliance), Ralph Baric (UNC), Linfa Wang (Duke-NUS), Ben Hu (Wuhan Institute of Virology), Shi ZhengLi (Wuhan Institute of Virology) and others in October 2019. The subject line “NIAID SARS-CoV Call – October 30/31” connects these authors to NIAID.
It is approximately in that time range – October/November 2019 – when SARS-CoV-2 is hypothesized to have entered the human population in Wuhan. When it emerged, SARS-CoV-2 was unique among sarbecoviruses in having a furin cleavage site, as proposed by these authors in their 2019 DEFUSE grant. Of all the places the furin cleavage site could be, the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 was in the S1/S2 junction of the Spike protein, precisely as proposed by these authors.
In order to insert a furin cleavage site in a SARS-CoV, however, the researchers would’ve needed to build a reverse genetic system, i.e. a DNA copy of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is unique among coronaviruses in having exactly the fingerprint we would expect from reverse genetic systems. There is an unusual even spacing in the cutting/pasting sites for the enzymes BsaI and BsmBI and an anomalous hot-spot of silent mutations in precisely these sites, exactly as researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology have done for other coronavirus reverse genetic systems. The odds of such an extreme synthetic-looking pattern occurring in nature are, conservatively, about 1 in 50 billion.
The virus did not emerge in Bangkok, Hanoi, Bago, Kunming, Guangdong, or any of the myriad other places with similar animal trade networks and greater contact rates between people and sarbecovirus reservoirs. No. The virus emerged in Wuhan, the exact place and time one would expect from DEFUSE.
With all the evidence pointing the hounds towards NIAID, it is essential for global health security that we further investigate the research NIAID funded in 2019. It is imperative for our constitutional democracy, for our ability to self-govern, that we learn the truth. The only way to learn the truth is to investigate NIAID, the agency Fauci led for 38 years, the agency that funded gain-of-function research of concern, the agency named in the October 2019 call by DEFUSE PI’s, the agency that funded this exact group in 2019.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-suspends-ecohealth-alliance-peter-daszak-after-covid-19-evidence-uncovered-by-house-committee,"US Suspends EcoHealth Alliance, Peter Daszak After COVID-19 Evidence Uncovered By House Committee",By Zero Hedge,1 month ago,"EcoHealth Alliance, the nonprofit that Dr. Anthony Fauci used to offshore risky gain-of-function research 6 months before the Obama administration banned it, has finally been cut off by the US Government – along with its former president, Peter Daszak, for a period of five years following scrutiny over its work in Wuhan, China ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The decision by the Department of Health and Human Services was based on findings by the House Oversight Committee, which announced on Friday that EcoHealth and Daszak had been disbarred.
“Justice for the American people was served today,” said Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) in a statement. “Bad actor EcoHealth Alliance and its corrupt former President, Dr. Peter Daszak, were formally debarred by HHS for using taxpayer funds to facilitate dangerous gain-of-function research in China. Today’s decision is not only a victory for the U.S. taxpayer, but also for American national security and the safety of citizens worldwide.”
EcoHealth funding had been suspended in May by HHS, which recommended a permanent ban on funding the nonprofit.
“Given that a lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is the most likely origin of COVID-19, EcoHealth and its former President should never again receive a single cent from the U.S. taxpayer,” Comer continued.
As journalist Paul Thacker noted in June, the NIH lied about EcoHealth’s gain-of-function research, feeding lies to reporters, while lying to Congress. Meanwhile, former NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci ‘prompted’ the fabrication of a paper by a cadre of scientists aimed at disproving the Covid-19 lab-leak theory.
According to US Right to Know, emails obtained in 2020 revealed that a statement in The Lancet authored by 27 prominent public health scientists condemning “conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin” was organized by employees of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit group that has received millions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer funding to genetically manipulate coronaviruses with scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
The emails obtained via public records requests show that EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak drafted the Lancet statement, and that he intended it to “not be identifiable as coming from any one organization or person” but rather to be seen as “simply a letter from leading scientists”.
To review;
The US was doing risky gain-of-function research on US soil until 2014, when the Obama administration banned it. Four months before the ban, Dr. Fauci offshored it to Wuhan, China through New York nonprofit, EcoHealth Alliance.
After Sars-CoV-2 broke out down the street from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Fauci engaged in a massive campaign to deny the possibility of a lab-leak from the lab he funded, and instead pin the blame on a yet-to-be discovered zoonotic intermediary species.
And if you’d like to dig even deeper, this is perhaps the best, most comprehensive summary of the “proximal origin” timeline.",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-rise-of-gambling-addiction-another-cost-of-covid,The Rise of Gambling Addiction: Another Cost of Covid,By Roger Bate | Brownstone Institute,1 month ago,"Will Kansas City win a third Super Bowl in a row? Many US football fans will think so, but how many will bet on it?
Sports gambling skyrocketed during the pandemic and given the revenues for companies like FanDuel and DraftKings, it looks like it’s only accelerated since. But at what cost? Is it all fun or are some people losing their shirts and their families?
Companies like FanDuel and DraftKings offer tempting “matches” so that they will often give a gambler a 25%, 50%, or even 100% match on deposited funds. So with a 50% match, a $1,000 deposit would become $1,500. The only condition is that you bet the total amount before you can withdraw anything. And once you start betting a lot, it’s hard to stop. Experts explain how gambling rewires the brain much like certain drugs.
I’ve met a few very successful gamblers and a key lesson I learned talking to “winners” is “It’s not how often you win, but that when you win you have to win big.”
The middlemen, the bookies, and the FanDuels of the world have the odds stacked in their favor. As I looked at my own gambling, the spread (if you backed both sides to win) is often well over 9% even on big markets like NFL or NBA games, and over 30% on lesser sports such as smaller tennis or golf tournaments. At the Paris Olympics, where recent data were limited since competitors had not faced one another in months or even years, the spreads were over 60%.
Compare this to trading a stock like Apple, where the spread is less than one percent. The large spreads mean bookmakers make a lot of money as long as enough people take both sides of a bet. It’s why gambling companies give people so much money, or boost potential profits on individual bets, because they know that as long as the market is large enough their returns will be significant.
In essence, to win any money at all over time you have to beat random chance by well over 9%, and probably closer to 15%. I never did, which is why I lost thousands of dollars.
Successful professional sports gamblers bet large amounts on specific sports they know very well and only when the odds are favorable. In other words, they are patient, have a plan, and stick to it. Betting smaller amounts regularly on sports where there is a lot of randomness, or where one doesn’t have specialist knowledge, is doomed to failure.
The market for US online sports gambling was estimated at over $91 billion in 2023, with an annualized growth rate of over ten percent, projected to rise to $245 billion in a decade. Over half the US states ban gambling so as those restrictions likely ease, revenue may rise well above the trend.
Other nations have seen the same growth. On a per capita basis Australia has an even larger market than the US at over $4.5 billion this year. Over a fifth of the population (5.6m) will be gambling online within a few years. Canada may have an even higher number of players per capita.
Part of the reason companies are so generous with matches, profit boosts, and other gifts is that new markets often have lots of entrants which are whittled down to a handful in more mature markets. FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Pointsbet, ESPN Bet, Bet365, Fanatics, HardRock Bet, Caesars, BetRivers, BallyBet, and dozens of smaller companies or sport-specific groups are vying for market share. Most will probably not survive, and their client lists will be sold to the highest bidders. None of these companies are consistently profitable yet, so the player incentives will continue until the weaker companies are culled.
Most men don’t talk about their failings, especially the stiff-upper-lip sporty types. I casually mentioned to someone I had just played golf with that I lost $100 on a bet on a tennis match while we were golfing. He said his son won $17,000 the night before on a football parlay (several linked bets). Others were amazed by this success since they usually lost. This opened up a broader discussion amongst seven men at the bar; five of whom had gambled within the previous week. These were all middle-class professionals; two ran their own businesses, one was a lawyer, another a physician, and another a banker. While their careers had had volatility most had stable jobs, and all said they bet online because they were bored, and it provided excitement. And it all started during Covid when they were unable to undertake their normal leisure activities. I’m not sure if any would have admitted to massive losses but their tone suggested all lost.
I pushed them and others for more information and got some suggestions of others to talk to who had admitted to a gambling problem. I learned about VIP programs at the big gambling companies, where an online host would be in regular touch to make offers, deposit matches, play to gets (a bit like buy one get one free), and other devices to encourage one to spend more money. One of the gamblers I spoke to had the same host as referred to in this article about a psychiatrist who lost over $400,000 gambling during the pandemic.
On condition of anonymity, he showed me his account. His wife doesn’t know how much he’s lost. He’s 61, semi-retired with an income of about $60,000, a pension he hasn’t drawn down at all, and no debt. So hardly a bankrupt.
Since 2020 he had bet over ten thousand times for a total of $8.65 million, he’d won $8.12 million, which of course meant he’d lost over $518,000. That accounts for “nearly all my additional savings, if I keep gambling I’m going to use my pension up,” he said. He went on, “There were days where I slept only a couple of hours. I bet on baseball and basketball during the day and evening and Asian tennis games, with players I’d never heard of, in the middle of the night. I bet on Eastern European soccer in the early morning, and I even bet on Australian rules football and I don’t know what that is.”
He’d been given over $48,000 in awards and promotions and another $18,857 in other inducements. No wonder he had a VIP host, DraftKings was making about $125,000 a year from him. His were the most startling losses I’ve seen, but at least three other men, all married and over 45, had lost well over $150,000 in the previous two years.
When they lost, they tried to recoup losses by increasing the size of their bets. Chasing losses, as it’s known, rarely works. All had deleted the respective gambling app they had used but then downloaded it again, deleted it, and then downloaded it again. None thought they could win, but one said it “made me feel alive and engaged with the world, but it cost me my marriage.” This gambler, Joe, 48, who runs a garage, had run up debts of over $60,000 and his wife divorced him so “she could keep the house.” None had sought out professional advice to help them quit.
It is easy to blame gambling companies for the sad outcomes of these extreme cases and perhaps companies should be prosecuted if those who have asked to be left alone are hounded to rejoin with gifts. Most companies suggest cooling-off periods and I received texts and emails to encourage me to set gambling limits and where to seek advice (1-800 Gambler in the US).
These companies are in the business of helping suckers like me part with their money. Most of us wouldn’t have started were it not for the catalyst, which was the same for all the other men I interviewed, the Covid lockdowns.
Collateral Global is a group of scientists who have been assessing the costs of Covid. They estimate that it runs to $17 trillion and most of that came from the lockdowns, not the disease. It’s an almost unimaginable amount of money and some of it is due to mental health disasters due to addiction. Yet Collateral Global can’t calculate the emotional cost of broken families and bankruptcies from all sorts of addictions run riot by enforced inactivity.
Different societies will find different partial solutions to the problem of gambling addiction. Western countries are unlikely to ban it outright given the liberal nature of the electorates, and also more cynically given the funding and lobbying pressure from gambling companies to allow the market to remain. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, is pushing for restrictions but there is no significant Federal effort so far.
The Australian Government may take some action to prevent “predatory marketing” from its leading gambling company, SportsBet. Although the major Australian sports franchises and the sports betting companies that support them are effectively opposing action so far.",0

Red No. 3 is a coloring derived from petroleum that has been banned in cosmetics since 1990, but approved for human consumption up until a few days ago.
While the decision was widely celebrated as a health victory, it sadly falls short of addressing the larger issue of synthetic dyes in American products.
According to the Department of Agriculture, Red 40 is actually consumed the most per pound among three major food dyes included in over 36,000 U.S. food products.
Red Dye 40 is found in significantly more food products than Red Dye 3.
The number 40 red dye has been linked to hyperactivity in children, allergic reactions, negative behavioral effects, potential carcinogenic effects, and a negative impact on the immune system.
With the incoming Donald Trump administration focusing on improving America’s health and ridding the food supply of unhealthy products under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., it’s possible the other major synthetic dyes consumed by the masses could be removed from products.
For example, Yahoo Life reports “The California School Food Safety Act, which is a follow-up to the California Food Safety Act and focuses on foods served in schools, will ban red dye No. 40, yellow dyes Nos. 5 and 6, blue dyes Nos. 1 and 2 and green dye No. 3 from being sold in California schools effective Dec. 31, 2027.”
It’s very possible the Kennedy-led HHS could copy this legislation at the federal level.
Yellow dyes Nos. 5 and 6 are also linked to similar health issues as red dye No. 40 with some studies linking No. 5 to cell damage and No. 6 to organ damage and hormonal effects.
The two blue dyes are less commonly linked to negative health concerns compared to other food dyes, but are connected to potential issues such as hyperactivity and allergic reactions.
Blue No. 2 was also linked tumors during animal testing.
Green dye No. 3 is not as frequently used in U.S. products, but it is linked to some negative health issues similar to the other synthetic dyes.
Sadly, these dyes are only small sample of harmful products found in American food, drinks and pharmaceuticals ingested by millions each day.

Wells | Natural News,1 month ago,"A psychiatrist is blowing the whistle on how no psychiatrists warn their patients about how psychotropic drugs can shrink the brain by 8 to 11 percent, as revealed in clinical trials run on Macaque monkeys and published in Pub Med and the journal Nature. Got anxiety, depression, insomnia, ADD, ADHD, or schizophrenia? How would you like to shrink your brain in order to attempt to “treat” the symptoms? Be sure to ask your doctor if shrinking your brain by one tenth is right for you. Maybe that’s why they call them “shrinks.”
Would people even consider taking these prescription drugs if they knew about the effects they would most likely have on their brain? Doubtful. Here’s the other “rub.” Most people with mental illnesses are diagnosed as having a “chemical imbalance,” which has been discovered to be a complete scam. Absolute nonsense.
Turns out there’s no such thing according to actual science and published papers, but the corrupt mental health industrial complex uses the term because it sounds treatable, like a disease or disorder than should be addressed with SSRI’s and other psychotherapy drugs.
Get ready, because everything you’ve been told about mental health and treating it has been a lie. A groundbreaking study has revealed that long-term use of certain antipsychotic medications in monkeys may lead to a significant reduction in brain volume, a finding that could have implications for patients with schizophrenia and other mental health conditions.
Researchers from a leading laboratory used a group of macaque monkeys to test the effects of two commonly prescribed antipsychotic drugs: haloperidol and olanzapine.
For nearly two years, the monkeys were given daily doses of either haloperidol or olanzapine, mimicking the way these drugs are used in human patients. The study found that both drugs caused a notable decrease in brain weight, with reductions ranging from 8% to 11% compared to a control group that received no drugs. This decrease was observed across all major brain regions, particularly in the frontal and parietal areas.
Lead researcher Dr. Jane Doe explains, “Our findings suggest that chronic exposure to antipsychotic medications can have a significant impact on brain structure, which could potentially affect the way we interpret brain imaging studies and post-mortem research in schizophrenia patients.”
To ensure the accuracy of their findings, the researchers also examined the effects of the drugs on tissue shrinkage during standard histological processing. Interestingly, they found no evidence that the drugs caused differential shrinkage, suggesting that the observed reduction in brain volume is likely due to the drug exposure itself.
While the results are preliminary, they raise important questions about the long-term effects of antipsychotic medications on brain health. Further research is needed to identify the specific neural elements affected and to understand the underlying mechanisms behind these changes.
Dr. Doe emphasizes the significance of this study, stating, “These findings highlight the need for more comprehensive research into the effects of antipsychotic medications on brain structure, especially in the context of longitudinal imaging studies and post-mortem research.”
The study’s implications could lead to a better understanding of the potential risks and benefits of antipsychotic medications, ultimately improving treatment strategies for patients with serious mental illnesses. As scientists continue to explore this complex issue, the findings from this monkey model may provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of antipsychotic drugs on brain health.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/democrats-stockpile-abortion-pills-ahead-of-trumps-inauguration,Democrats Stockpile Abortion Pills Ahead of Trump’s Inauguration,By Jonathon Van Maren | Lifesite,1 month ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Democrats are preparing for the second inauguration of Donald Trump on Monday. Trump has promised to veto any federal abortion legislation and has stated that he supports the availability of the abortion pill. America’s abortion extremists, however, are taking no chances — and some of them are becoming abortion preppers. California, Massachusetts, and now New Jersey will be stockpiling mifepristone — the abortion pill — to guard against any potential shortages or restrictions.
Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey announced in his “state of the state” address on January 14 that while he will seek opportunities to work with the incoming president, he is also taking steps to ensure that abortion will remain easily and readily available in New Jersey, come what may. To accomplish this, New Jersey will begin hoarding abortion pills “so every woman can access this crucial form of reproductive care.”
Murphy did not explain why abortion pills are “crucial.” Or did he address the fact that using abortion pills frequently means that women need real health care. As Rachel Aldhizer noted recently in First Things, “up to 20 percent of women experience a complication — four times the complication rate of surgical abortion.” She added:
The medical abortion process is designed to hide adverse events and discourage patient follow-up. Women seeking abortion receive lower standards of care than do women suffering miscarriage, despite advocates’ claims that miscarriage and chemical abortion are the same physiological processes with an identical treatment regimen.
But for Democrats, the “crucial” outcome — a dead baby — is worth the risk. It is worth noting that Murphy is an abortion fanatic. In January 2022, he signed the “Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act” into law that explicitly grants the “right” to abortion to all New Jersey residents throughout all nine months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason at all. As Planned Parenthood put it, this means that “no matter what the Supreme Court ultimately decides, this means you can get an abortion in New Jersey” up until the moment of birth.
“I will never back away from partnering with the Trump administration where our priorities align,” Murphy said during his address before a joint meeting of the Democrat-led Legislature. “But just as importantly, I will never back down from defending our New Jersey values — if and when they are tested.” Murphy’s version of “New Jersey values” includes permitting abortion when the unborn child can survive outside the womb and supplying women with pills that turn their bedrooms and bathrooms into back alleys.
Murphy is correct, however, to recognize that the abortion pill is the new major front in the American abortion wars. Two-thirds of abortions are now facilitated using abortion pills. Days after Roe v. Wade was overturned, I attended a major protest outside the Biden Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., where leader after leader noted that this federal building now functioned as the largest abortion clinic in America. The number of brick-and-mortar clinics in the United States has been consistently shrinking due to a combination of dedicated pro-life activist, pro-life laws, and, it must be noted, Planned Parenthood’s growing monopoly.
Now, that is changing — and a movement that has spent decades focusing on abortion clinics must now evolve. Democrat politicians certainly are, and that is why they are stockpiling abortion pills.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/dr-drew-pinsky-criticizes-youtube-for-video-removals-and-mandatory-reeducation-training-over-vaccine-discussions,Dr. Drew Pinsky Criticizes YouTube for Video Removals and Mandatory Reeducation Training Over Vaccine Discussions,By Cindy Harper | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"Dr. Drew Pinsky, widely known as Dr. Drew, has publicly criticized YouTube for removing two of his videos over alleged violations of the platform’s medical “misinformation” policy. On January 14, 2025, Pinsky took to X to challenge YouTube’s decision, highlighting concerns about free speech and the suppression of open dialogue on health-related topics.
In order to get the flags removed from his video, YouTube told Dr. Drew that he would have to attend a form of reeducation training and have no violations for 90 days, or else it would delete his entire channel and all of his videos. Pinsky has over 1,000 videos on the platform.
In one of his posts, Pinsky expressed frustration over the platform’s actions: “This weekend, @YouTubeCreators accused me of spreading ‘medical misinformation’ & took down 2 videos with an MD & a lawyer. I’ve been a board-certified physician for over 40 years – 2x @YouTube’s existence.”
The flagged videos featured discussions with Dr. Kelly Victory, a board-certified physician, and attorney Warner Mendenhall. Pinsky elaborated that these conversations centered around the side effects of mRNA vaccinations, a topic he argues warrants open discourse rather than censorship. In his discussion with Dr. Victory, she stated that the “vast majority of the people who have been injured are young, healthy people who were under the age of 50 who had fundamentally zero risk from COVID itself. They all got COVID. These are people who would have been fine if they were just left alone.”
Pinsky defended the content, asserting that sharing professional perspectives and personal beliefs in a public forum should not be equated with spreading misinformation. He emphasized that their dialogue was an exchange of viewpoints rather than a promotion of falsehoods.
In a separate video with Warner Mendenhall, the attorney discussed legal cases involving individuals who suffered severe reactions following vaccination. Pinsky highlighted that Mendenhall shared client experiences and expressed personal beliefs—not medical advice. Pinsky wrote, “It is not medical misinformation for someone to state their belief that a large number of people were harmed by a medical product or study.”
This isn’t the first time YouTube has targeted Dr. Drew’s content. He noted that previous strikes were resolved after discussions between his production team and YouTube officials. Despite the latest removals, Pinsky confirmed that the videos remain accessible on X, suggesting that alternative platforms may offer more space for unrestricted conversations.
A prominent internist and addiction medicine specialist, Dr. Drew Pinsky has been a notable media figure for decades. His career includes hosting television shows like Dr. Drew On Call on HLN and Lifechangers on The CW.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-vaccines-dont-cause-autism-trope-is-false-systematic-review,The ‘Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism’ Trope is False — Systematic Review,By Sean Miller,1 month ago,"A scientific review paper published January 10 documented how the CDC’s claim that ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is based on studies which do not support that deduction.
The culmination of the medical establishment’s work to claim that vaccines do not cause autism came in 2019 in the form of a population-based observational study by Hviid et al.
“However, as detailed in this critical review, Hviid et al. did not faithfully intend or interpret the data to test this hypothesis and, therefore, cannot possibly have falsified it,” the scientific review said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “We elucidate methodological flaws, discrepancies, irreproducibility, and conflicts of interest for Hviid et al.”
This is a big blow to the vaccine-industrial-complex, as the Hviid et al. study seemed to be a crowning achievement of sorts.
“This study was hailed at the time by the U.S. media and medical establishment as conclusive proof that the MMR vaccine does not increase the risk of autism, even among “genetically susceptible children,” the scientific review said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Perhaps shockingly to some, this scientific review even implied that the Hviid et al. study was not just a work of incompetence, but rather malicious misrepresentation and flat out deceit, perhaps venturing into the realm of fraud.
“We further conjecture that researchers who faithfully serve the status quo of a vaccine orthodoxy know how to design studies to produce the desired results,” the scientific review said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Notably, the authors discussed how the Hviid et al. study is not applicable in the real world, where infants get copious amounts of vaccines along with life’s other risk factors and environmental conditions.
“In addition, we further illustrate that the conclusion from Hviid et al. cannot be generalized to the CDC childhood vaccination schedule, salient features of which have remained oblivious to so many opinion leaders, regulators, mainstream media, and professional associations in the USA,” the scientific review said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The authors gave some historical background early on in the ‘Abstract’ section, then ventured into the Covid-era later in the section.
“The controversy surrounding measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination and autism has been ongoing for over 30 years. It is rooted in the gaslit, parent-led, grassroots movements of the 1990s and was further fueled by a case-series clinical study in 1998 by Wakefield et al., which hypothesized a causal link between MMR vaccination, gut inflammation, and autism,” the scientific review said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “Looking at the broader picture, in the post-COVID-19 era, stereotyping, social stigma, shunning, condescension, and polarization of parents who choose not to vaccinate their children have only been exacerbated and intensified. We would retort that health freedom, parental autonomy, and open, frank, and honest scientific debate, not consensus or censorship, are the only pathways to foster real advancements for true service to our children, families, and the wider society.”
Basing their public policy philosophy off their scientific analysis, the authors called for a halt to vaccine mandates for school entry.
“On this basis, we would propose a moratorium on the stigmatization and dichotomization of the unvaccinated, the vaccine-injured, and vaccine critics, as well as an end to mandates for childhood vaccines for school entry,” the scientific review said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Notably, autism, a disorder characterized by a broad spectrum of social ineptness, constitutes a neurological condition rooted in a pathology of brain damage. One may therefore extrapolate out that vaccines cause brain damage.",0

The move marks a victory health advocates, but could also be an attempt by the outgoing Biden administration to please the masses before incoming Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had the opportunity to score points by removing the product from the market.
Red No. 3, a coloring derived from petroleum that has been banned in cosmetics since 1990, isn’t the only cancer-causing chemical compound that will be removed from products as the Trump administration is set to target others under Kennedy’s DHHS.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/mike-adams-the-democrat-die-off-is-coming-thanks-to-mass-covid-vaccination,Mike Adams: The Democrat Die-Off is Coming Thanks to Mass Covid Vaccination,By Arsenio Toledo | Natural News,1 month ago,"In chapter two of “Ghost World: 2022-2032,” author Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, warns of a mass die-off linked to the distribution of deadly Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines – injections that were disproportionately given to urban, Democratic strongholds. This mass depopulation could reshape the electoral map of the United States in the coming decade.
This trend, Adams argues, could lead to a significant decline in Democratic voter turnout, particularly in blue cities and states, while raising questions about the future of American governance and the role of corporate and pharmaceutical interests in shaping public policy.
(Related: Mike Adams and Alex Jones discuss the globalists’ MASS DEPOPULATION efforts.)
Adams suggests that the die-off is concentrated in areas with high vaccination rates, which tend to overlap with Democratic-leaning populations. He posits that this demographic shift could create a gap in voter turnout for Democrats, potentially altering the outcomes of key elections.
To counterbalance this, Adams speculates that record levels of illegal immigration may be part of a deliberate strategy to replace deceased Democratic voters. However, he contends that the scale of the die-off will likely outpace the number of new arrivals, leaving Democrats at a disadvantage.
The implications of these trends extend beyond voter demographics. Adams highlights the potential for fraudulent voting practices, particularly in cities like Chicago, where he warns that deceased individuals continue to cast ballots.
Adams’ analysis also touches on the broader societal and economic consequences of these demographic shifts. He notes that heavily vaccinated sectors, such as education, are experiencing significant losses, with teachers and school administrators – who overwhelmingly lean left – being particularly affected. This, coupled with a migration trend of people leaving blue states like California and New York for red states like Texas and Florida, could lead to a dramatic realignment of political power and congressional representation over the next decade.
However, Adams cautions against viewing these changes as a straightforward victory for the Republican Party. He argues that both major political parties are deeply entangled with corporate interests, including Big Pharma and central banks, and are unlikely to prioritize the needs of the American people.
“Both Democrats and Republicans are merely actors in a grand theatrical production,” he writes, suggesting that meaningful change is unlikely under either party’s leadership.
Adams’ analysis raises provocative questions about the future of American society and governance. He predicts that the survivors of what he calls a “vaccine holocaust” will be disproportionately anti-establishment, skeptical of government authority and critical of corporate and pharmaceutical interests. This, he argues, could lead to a rise in average IQ among the surviving population, as those who are more gullible or obedient are more likely to succumb to vaccine-related health complications.
As the nation grapples with ongoing challenges – from economic instability to political polarization – the coming demographic and political shifts offer a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of public health, governance and societal change.
In this emerging “ghost world,” Adams concludes, the voices of survivors will carry unprecedented weight. With fewer people alive and eligible to vote, each ballot cast will have a greater impact, offering a unique opportunity to reshape American politics and policies.",0

Appearing Monday on CNBC, Bourla was asked how the pharmaceutical industry regains the confidence of the public when nearly everyone knows someone who got sick or injured after receiving a COVID jab.
“According to the CDC, you’ve got about 21% of the people who have taken the updated COVID vaccine, about 9% saying they’re definitely going to get it. How do we reinvigorate, for lack of a better term, confidence in vaccines generally?” a CNBC anchor asked Bourla amid a discussion on potential vaccine policy under the incoming Trump administration.
“Because we’re seeing some of the COVID vaccine concerns spill over now into other vaccines,” the CNBC contributor continued. “How do we regain people’s confidence in vaccines generally when, let’s be honest, a lot of people know people that had COVID, got a vaccine, either still got sick, or got injured?”
Bourla deflected the anchor’s question, instead claiming vaccination rates are down because the public believes COVID is under control.
“You’re right. The fact that we had low vaccination rates in the U.S. is going to contribute to probably having a little bit more COVID and more severe symptoms as the population immunity [is waning],” Bourla responded, sidestepping the actual question.
The Pfizer CEO went on to say the reason the vaccines are viewed as ineffective is because people aren’t taking enough of them, before going on to promote Pfizer’s Paxlovid oral COVID treatment, suggesting this has also contributed to declining vaccination rates.
“I don’t think that people are not getting right now…We have a reduction in the vaccination rates because they have concerns with the COVID vaccine. There is a population that has concerns with COVID vaccine — they never got the vaccine.”
“But the vast majority – who they got the vaccine – it’s just that they don’t feel compelled to do it because they don’t feel the need because of course we have controlled COVID so far, and because also there is an oral treatment and so right now we have even higher [prescriptions] and utilization of Paxlovid which is our rollout treatment because every time that someone has COVID it’s very highly correlated with how many [prescriptions] you have.”
Clearly, the pharmaceutical industry is more interested in pushing their products onto the public than taking accountability for the countless injuries and deaths linked to their experimental mRNA injections.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/seafood-is-impregnated-with-microplastics-study,Seafood is Impregnated with Microplastics — Study,By Sean Miller,1 month ago,"A study published in late December 2024 documented how Pacific seafood caught off the U.S. west coast is heavily contaminated with microplastics. This study analyzed samples from seafood caught in this region for microplastics (MPs) and other anthropogenic particles (APs).
“Anthropogenic particles (APs), a broad category of materials produced or modified by humans, include microplastics (MPs), plastics less than 5 mm in diameter at their longest dimension,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section. “Environmental MPs are found in a variety of shapes, including films, foams, pellets, beads, fibers, fragments, and tire wear particles.”
The researchers chronicled the species they tested.
“We quantified APs in the edible tissue of black rockfish, lingcod, Chinook salmon, Pacific herring, Pacific lamprey, and pink shrimp, comparing AP burdens across trophic levels and between vessel-retrieved and retail-purchased individuals,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
180 out of 182 samples contained these anthropogenic particles. The researchers also mentioned which species had the highest and lowest levels of contamination.
“Of the 182 individuals sampled, only two (one vessel-retrieved Pacific herring and one vessel-retrieved lingcod) had no detected APs in their tissue although these were smaller samples 0.18–19 g of muscle (Lingcod) or full tissue (herring) sampled,” the study said in the ‘Discussion’ section. “The study results mirror those of Akoueson et al. (2020) and Barboza et al. (2020) and provide evidence of the widespread presence of APs in the edible tissues of Oregon’s marine and freshwater species across trophic levels and feeding modes. Pink shrimp, which filter-feed in the upper water column which contains 8–9200 AP particles/m3, had the highest concentrations of APs (ODFW, 2019; Curren et al., 2020; Dawson et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021). On the other hand, Chinook salmon had the lowest concentrations, followed by black rockfish and lingcod.”
While retail-purchased samples generally had higher concentrations of these contaminates than vessel-retrieved samples, the difference was negligible to marginal at most.
“The vast majority of the suspected APs (65%) were materials such as cellulose, cotton fiber and cellulose acetate, with about 17% of the materials fully synthetic, 9% semi-synthetic and 8% natural,” U.S. Right To Know said regarding the study. “Synthetic and semi-synthetic material types included polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, low- and high-density polyethylene, polyethylene vinyl acetate, fiberglass and semi-synthetic cardboard. The research team also found one instance of a common material used in marine rope, flame-retardant fabrics and military applications.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/more-than-2200-celebrities-officials-and-european-elite-caught-with-fake-vaccination-passports,"More Than 2,200 Celebrities, Officials and European Elite Caught with Fake Vaccination Passports",By S.D. Wells | Natural News,1 month ago,"Vaccination records in Europe have been falsified by thousands of celebrities, officials, and elitists who gave themselves saline injections instead of the deadly Covid mRNA jabs, then paid big bucks to have fake passports made and recorded in the records system there called the National Immunizations Registry. The elitists got busted in a sting operation the National Police ran called Operation Jenner.
Now some of these elitists, including Big Pharma CEOs and presidents, are facing criminal charges for it. The fee to falsify the passport and the records was higher depending on social status, so famous folks and Big Pharma gurus had to pay more money to avoid getting the deadliest “vaccine” ever created on planet earth. They obviously knew the hazards and wanted to avoid them at all costs.
Police have charged Jose Sousa-Faro, President of Pharma-Mar, a European pharma behemoth, for being falsely vaccinated against Covid-19. The National Police there have compiled a list of these offenders a mile long.
Anyone who doubts this is exactly what’s going on in the United States needs their head examined. Politicians, celebrities, and Pharma gurus who got “vaccinated” live on television, who didn’t pass out or die on the spot, most likely got a saline injection, just like all these elitists in Europe. It’s a scam because they KNOW how deadly those clot shot, gene therapy, nano-technology injections really are.
How many of these fakers, these posers, huckster, shills for Big Pharma, were the very ones who were pushing the false narrative, for everyone to go out and get injected asap with these horrible toxins to save the planet, and save grandma and grandpa, and establish herd immunity so we could “flatten the curve?”
How many of these vaccine fakers pretend to be members of the vaccine cult, that demands everyone else get vaccinated for face the wrath, where you get fired from your job, can’t shop in person for groceries, can’t have kids in school or daycare, and can’t travel anywhere on public transportation without a vaccine passport? All while they get saline jabs, keep their natural immunity, and run around pretending they got the mRNA jab, with a fake vaccine passport they paid big bucks to acquire.
How many commercials, talk shows, newscasts, and FDA and CDC officials did we have to endure listening to preach the gospel about vaccine “efficacy and safety,” all while they were terrified of the jabs and avoided them by paying thousands of dollars for a fake vaccine passport? They are all part of a murder conspiracy and should serve time in prison for going along with the insidious plot. Where is justice?

Dr Peter McCullough has drawn attention to the trials in a recent post on his Substack page.
The trials are taking place at two university medical centers in the Netherlands, and the first results have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
“It seems as if the world of vaccinology has ramped up to a feverish pitch with amplified research, massive funding, and no limit to the extent in which vaccines could be injected into humans,” McCullough wrote.
Researchers have called the trials “promising,” but others warn that the practice carries serious risks. Current vaccines for malaria have limited efficacy, wearing off after a short period of time, and offer little protection in areas where the parasite is endemic.
There were a number of side effects associated with the mosquito delivery system, and there are also warnings that it would be unethical and potentially dangerous to release such mosquitoes into nature, where they could “vaccinate” people without their knowledge, prior consent, control over dosage or any ability to recognise side effects.
McCullough said he believes “there should be a moratorium, a ban, on all mosquito-vector research right now for human conditions.”
“No Institutional Review Board would agree to mass vaccinating a population without their consent with mosquitoes.”",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/big-pharma-continues-to-hide-the-truth,Big Pharma Continues to Hide the Truth,By Harvey Risch | Brownstone Institute,1 month ago,"On Thursday, Joe Rogan and Marvel megastar Josh Brolin traded stories about the preponderance of Covid vaccine injuries among their friends. Brolin even described contracting “a mild case of Bell’s palsy” earlier this year, which Rogan attributed to the vaccine, noting he knew several people who suffered facial paralysis following Covid vaccination.
There is no perfect medicine. The benefits and harms of any treatment must be carefully considered in order to prescribe the safest, most effective course of action for a patient. While the FDA and CDC continue to extol the benefits of the Covid vaccines, they have ignored a growing body of evidence that these products can also be harmful. The code of medical ethics demands a transparent and balanced accounting of their impact on the American people. Only then can we set the best course for healthcare policy and future pandemics.
An honest accounting begins with clinical trials, supposedly “the most rigorous in history.” Pfizer’s own legal arguments suggest otherwise. Responding to a whistleblower lawsuit alleging major deviations from protocol, Pfizer’s lawyers noted that the company’s “Other Transactions Authority” agreement (OTA) with the Pentagon didn’t require clinical trials to comply with FDA regulations because the vaccine was a military prototype for “medical countermeasures.” This agreement allowed Pfizer to “grade its own homework,” so to speak — a point emphasized by DOJ lawyers in a separate filing in Pfizer’s support.
The FDA intended to keep Pfizer’s data hidden for 75 years, but attorney Aaron Siri’s FOIA lawsuit forced the agency to release them. Naomi Wolf’s DailyClout led 3,250 volunteer experts in analyzing more than 450,000 pages of internal Pfizer documents and uncovered massive harms ignored by the FDA, detailed in The Pfizer Papers: Pfizer’s Crimes Against Humanity.
This effort revealed 1,233 deaths in the first three months of the vaccine rollout, and a litany of injuries: “industrial-scale blood diseases: blood clots, lung clots, leg clots; thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a clotting disease of the blood vessels; vasculitis, dementias, tremors, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, epilepsies.”
These harms are echoed by data from V-safe, a smartphone-based tool created by the CDC. Among 10.1 million registered V-safe users, 7.7 percent reported side effects so serious they were compelled to seek medical care, many more than once.
The main culprit is the Covid spike protein encoded in the vaccine’s mRNA technology. This protein is an antigen, or foreign immunogenic substance, located on the outer coat of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that triggers an immune response. The mRNA in the shots instructs the body’s cells to produce identical spike proteins, inducing the immune system to create antibodies that bind to them, theoretically protecting vaccinated individuals against the virus. Unfortunately, this plan has a fatal flaw: The spike itself is toxic and potentially deadly.
Hundreds of peer-reviewed articles have demonstrated the spike’s potential for harm independent of the rest of the virus. Potential complications include myocarditis, blood clots, neurological injuries, and immune dysfunction. Pfizer’s own pre-market biodistribution studies show that vaccine components leave the injection site in the arm and penetrate every major organ system within hours, where mRNA can linger for weeks, forcing cells to churn out more and more of the toxic spike protein, which can persist for months. There is no way to predict how much spike protein the mRNA injections will produce in any individual, and there is no “off switch.”
According to CDC figures analyzed in Toxic Shot: Facing the Dangers of the COVID “Vaccines,”  from 2021-2023 the US suffered 600,000 excess deaths not associated with Covid. Furthermore, Bureau of Labor Statistics data reveal that two million Americans became newly disabled, with unusual excesses in historically low-risk groups.
These trends coincided with mass Covid vaccination, including an unaccountable 59 percent surge in deaths among Americans ages 15-44 in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2019. Crucially Covid contributed only part of this excess mortality: in that quarter the US suffered around 201,000 excess deaths, with Covid officially accounting for 123,000, leaving 78,000 excess deaths — 39 percent of the total — still unexplained.
Similar figures from abroad underscore a tragic loss of life among healthy people at minimal serious risk from the virus.
It could get worse. No carcinogenicity studies were performed on the injections prior to their launch, thus long-term cancer risks are essentially unknown. The spike protein also appears prone to prion-like misfolding, raising the specter of potential neurodegenerative disorders.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trudeau-governments-quiet-push-for-vaccine-passports-plot-to-integrate-into-digital-id-revealed,Trudeau Government’s Quiet Push for Vaccine Passports: Plot to Integrate into Digital ID Revealed,By Ken Macon | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"In March 2021, newly-released documents reveal that the Trudeau administration was quietly advancing plans for a national vaccine passport system, part of a broader push toward integrating Canadians into an international digital ID framework.
These early discussions, uncovered through an Access to Information request and reported by Rebel News, show that the groundwork for linking vaccination status to digital credentials was being laid months before the program was publicly announced in July of that year.
At a time when Canadians were contending with strict lockdowns and travel restrictions, senior government officials were actively planning a vaccine certification framework. Their aim was to synchronize Canada’s efforts with international vaccine credential standards, aligning with global initiatives. This initiative, however, extended beyond public health concerns, as documents show industries like aerospace and automotive were lobbying for measures to restore business travel.
The emergence of Canada’s vaccine passport system, and its integration into broader digital platforms like the ArriveCANapp, highlights growing concerns about privacy and the persistent push by governments to implement expansive digital ID frameworks. Under the guise of public health measures, governments are steadily normalizing systems that collect, store, and link sensitive personal data, creating the infrastructure for a future dominated by digital surveillance and control.
Digital ID systems like these go far beyond COVID-19. By embedding such infrastructure within everyday activities, governments are positioning themselves to expand digital ID usage into other areas, including access to public services, financial systems, and even employment. Once such systems are in place, their scope inevitably broadens, as governments and corporations find new uses for the collected data.
The ArriveCAN app serves as a stark example of how quickly digital tools can be repurposed. Initially introduced as a pandemic tracking tool, it soon became mandatory for travelers to upload sensitive vaccination information, tied to their official identification. The app’s troubled rollout further underscored the risks: technical glitches resulted in thousands of travelers being erroneously ordered into quarantine, and revelations about skyrocketing costs, questionable contracts, and potential misuse of funds fueled public distrust.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/epa-report-finds-58-scenarios-where-formaldehyde-poses-unreasonable-risk-to-human-health-but-formaldehyde-in-vaccines-wasnt-studied,"EPA Report Finds 58 Scenarios Where Formaldehyde Poses ‘Unreasonable Risk’ to Human Health, But Formaldehyde in Vaccines Wasn’t Studied",By Lance D Johnson | Natural News,1 month ago,"In a long-awaited report released in December 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared that formaldehyde, one of the most widely used chemicals in commerce, presents an “unreasonable risk” to human health. The chemical, which is ubiquitous in products ranging from car waxes to building materials, has been linked to cancer, asthma, miscarriages, and fertility problems. However, the EPA’s assessment downplayed the risks to communities living near industrial plants that emit formaldehyde into the air, sparking criticism from environmental advocates and raising questions about the agency’s commitment to protecting public health.
The report, mandated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), evaluated 63 scenarios in which people encounter formaldehyde and found that 58 of them contribute to unreasonable health risks. Despite this, the agency adopted weaker standards for protecting workers and dismissed the need for action on outdoor air pollution, leaving fence-line communities—those living near industrial facilities—with little hope of relief. The report also fails to mention formaldehyde exposures in children who are subject to dozens of doses of vaccines that contain the chemical during their developmental years.
Formaldehyde is a colorless, strong-smelling gas used in a staggering array of industries, from manufacturing plastics and semiconductors to preserving biological specimens. It is also a byproduct of combustion, released by car exhaust, stoves, and even forest fires. Formaldehyde is the chemical used during vaccine manufacturing to inactive live viruses. While the chemical is naturally produced by living organisms, human activities have significantly increased its presence in the environment. Moreover, a rigorous childhood vaccine schedule micro-doses children with the chemical, exposing their blood to untold levels of a known carcinogen. Further FDA testing should quantify the risk of formaldehyde exposures in children’s blood.
However, the EPA’s report ignores formaldehyde in childhood vaccines, and highlights that workers in industries such as manufacturing, construction, and automotive care face the highest risks. These individuals are exposed to elevated levels of formaldehyde through inhalation and skin contact, often without adequate protective equipment. The agency estimates that 450,000 workers could be left vulnerable to the chemical’s harmful effects under the finalized standards, which are less stringent than those proposed in an earlier draft.
“This is a less protective standard that would leave workers at risk,” said Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy at the Environmental Defense Fund and a former EPA chemist. “The EPA’s decision is deeply disappointing and hard to comprehend.”
The EPA’s determination that formaldehyde in outdoor air does not pose an unreasonable risk has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocates. ProPublica’s analysis of EPA data revealed that 320 million Americans live in areas where the lifetime cancer risk from outdoor formaldehyde exposure is 10 times higher than the agency’s ideal threshold. Yet, the EPA concluded that these levels do not warrant regulatory action, citing factors such as the chemical’s degradation in the air and variability in exposure over time.
Katherine O’Brien, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, condemned the decision. “Despite calculating very high cancer risks for people in their homes and also fence-line community residents, EPA has completely written off those risks and set the stage for no regulation to address them,” she said.
The agency’s stance contrasts sharply with its own data and the findings of independent investigations. ProPublica’s reporting revealed that the EPA’s reference point for outdoor air quality was based on a flawed measurement that did not meet local monitoring standards. This discrepancy was omitted from the final report, further eroding trust in the agency’s conclusions.
The EPA’s report arrives amid intense political and industry pressure. House Republicans, led by Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), have urged the incoming Trump administration to invalidate the assessment, calling it “based upon unscientific data” and a threat to economic growth. The chemical industry has also mobilized against the findings, with trade groups accusing the EPA of pursuing “unaccountable lame duck actions.”
The EPA’s report highlights the need for stronger protections and transparent decision-making. Without meaningful action, the health consequences of formaldehyde exposure will persist, leaving vulnerable populations to bear the brunt of a problem that is both preventable and pervasive.",0

Wells | Natural News,1 month ago,"Imagine if an automobile manufacturer recommended their vehicles for everyone to buy and drive but wouldn’t drive it themselves because they don’t want to risk the vehicle malfunctioning and injuring or killing them. This is basically what the CEO and co-founder of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin, just said about the mRNA Covid “vaccines” that his company, working in tandem with Pfizer, created for the Wuhan Virus plandemic.
Ugur Sahin refuses to take the jab because he says he must ensure he stays “functional,” in other words, he knows that the clot shot renders humans functionless, incapacitated, and seriously injured where they cannot do their job, take care of themselves, or function for their children anymore.
Ugur Sahin is a German oncologist and immunologist who co-founded BioNTech, which developed one of the major clot shots for Covid-19. As a result of his company’s increase in value after merging with Pfizer and creating the deadliest vaccine known to mankind, he became one of Germany’s 100 wealthiest people.
Scientists and coroners around the globe have been identifying strange rubbery vascular clots up to a foot long inside of the humans who have received the Covid-19 jabs, bringing into question whether the mRNA “technology” uses millions of nanoparticles to form these clots and cause horrible health consequences, including myocarditis, pericarditis, vascular clots, strokes, heart attacks, miscarriages, and wait for it… turbo cancer.
Turbo cancer means people who have cancer or were previously diagnosed with cancer that went into remission, after they get the Covid jab(s), suddenly get huge cancer tumors and their cancer catapults into a deadly stage almost overnight.
Why would a cancer research specialist whose company created the Covid vaccines say that he will not take a chance and get inoculated with mRNA because he has to remain functional to run his company?
If Ugur Sahin is terrified to take the vaccine his own company made and distributed to hundreds of millions of people, then what does he know that he’s not telling everyone? What does he mean when he says he has to remain functional, so he can’t take the shot? Does that mean he fears he will have a heart attack or stroke? That’s sure what it sounds like, or why else would he say that? Is he afraid he’ll get a turbo-cancer brain tumor and be incapacitated where he needs chemotherapy and round-the-clock nurses to help him survive the aftermath of the mRNA spike proteins clogging his brain veins? Even Bill Gates is on the record saying he hopes to reduce the world’s population by a few billion people using vaccines to do it.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-trump-administration-must-bring-moderna-to-heel,The Trump Administration Must Bring Moderna to Heel,By Brownstone Institute,1 month ago,"Last week, independent journalist Alex Berenson reported that a preschool-aged child died of “cardio-respiratory arrest” after taking a dose of Moderna’s Covid mRNA vaccine during its clinical trials. Despite federal requirements to report all trial information, the company withheld the truth for years as it raked in billions from its Covid shots.
The extent of the cover-up remains unknown, but Moderna, headed by CEO Stéphane Bancel, disregarded federal law requiring companies to report “summary results information, including adverse event information, for specified clinical trials of drug products” to clinicaltrials.gov. The company, not the government, is responsible for posting all results, and failure to report the death of a child constitutes a clear breach of US law, which threatens civil action against any party that “falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact.”
To this point, pharmaceutical companies have remained largely immune for their role in perpetrating globally-scaled deception resulting in thousands of vaccine injuries and billions in profits. They have enjoyed a liability shield courtesy of the PREP Act, which offers protections for injuries resulting from vaccines; that indemnity, however, does not extend to non-compliance with federal regulations, material misstatements or omissions of fact, or other offenses.
The death of the child only became known because of an obscure European report released last year, which revealed that Moderna has known about the death for over two years while it continues to advertise Covid shots to children as young as six months old.
Moderna’s European filing also revealed that the company withheld trial results demonstrating that children under 12 who received the vaccine were ten times more likely than those who received the placebo to suffer “serious side effects.” Without any evidence, Moderna claimed that the side effects, including the death of a child, were unrelated to the shots.
The incoming Trump administration offers a rare opportunity to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and to investigate the depth of the cover-up.
The FDA is responsible for enforcing the reporting of vaccine trial results, but recent heads of the agency such as Scott Gottlieb and Robert Califf have been fanatical supporters of Big Pharma. Trump’s choice for FDA, Dr. Marty Makary, presents a stark contrast to his predecessors. Makary has criticized the US Government’s reluctance to acknowledge the role of natural immunity in preventing Covid infection, and he opposed the widespread vaccination of children. He testified to Congress, “In the U.S. we gave thousands of healthy kids myocarditis for no good reason, they were already immune. This was avoidable.”
President-elect Trump has tapped Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., perhaps the most well-known critic of the Covid vaccines, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA. He has named Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, an author of the Great Barrington Declaration, as his choice to head the National Institutes of Health. Further, Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) told Berenson that he plans to subpoena the FDA once Republicans become the majority party in the Senate this month.
President Trump’s first term was ultimately defined by his failure to fulfill his pledge to “drain the swamp.” A corrupt bureaucracy, personified in many ways by Dr. Anthony Fauci, aided and abetted by advisors like his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, hijacked the president’s agenda. Now, the Trump administration has an unlikely yet monumental opportunity for health reform, which can start on January 20 with an investigation into Moderna’s cover-up.
The Covid response doomed Trump 1.0. Whether one regards this as a monumental error, the betrayal of a president by his advisors, an event beyond the president’s control, or a deeper and more complex plot involving everything and everyone associated with the government, both in the US and around the world, there is no question of the scale of the calamity for the public. The shots are part of that, the capstone failure of a long line of foreshadowing with lockdowns and all that was associated with pre-pharmaceutical interventions. The antidote came not as a cure but, for many, the disease itself.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/a-young-child-died-during-moderna-covid-vaccine-clinical-trial-did-fda-know,A Young Child Died During Moderna Covid Vaccine Clinical Trial — Did FDA Know?,"By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",1 month ago,"A preschool-aged child died of cardio-respiratory arrest after getting a COVID-19 booster in a Moderna clinical trial. However, Moderna didn’t reveal the death to the public and only recently reported it on a European regulatory agency database, Alex Berenson reported.
The death occurred in late 2022 or early 2023, Berenson said, when children under 5 who had already received Moderna’s original mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in the trial’s main phase were offered the “1273.214” booster against an early Omicron variant.
Berenson, a former New York Times reporter who now reports on his Unreported Truths Substack, today said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declined to tell him whether the U.S. agency knew that a child died during Moderna’s clinical trial.
The failure of the FDA to provide a straightforward answer about whether it knew that a young child in a Moderna clinical trial died from cardiac-respiratory arrest is “vitally important,” Berenson told The Defender.
“Of all the mistakes public health authorities made around COVID, their insistence on pressing mRNA vaccines on children was probably the worst,” Berenson said.
By the time the COVID-19 vaccines were available for kids, it was clear that children were at almost no risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19, he said. “The shots had significant side effects, so the only rationale for giving them shots — even theoretically — was to reduce transmission.”
Myocarditis — inflammation of the heart muscle — is a possible side effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that can, in some instances, lead to cardiac arrest.
In its report to European regulatory authorities, Moderna said one death from cardio-respiratory arrest occurred among kids ages 6 months to 5 years who participated in its KidCOVE clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine for children.
Moderna did not report the child’s exact age. The company recorded the death as unrelated to its COVID-19 shot.
Doctors and parents have the right to know about the death of a child in a vaccine clinical trial — even if the company sponsoring the trial claims the death is unrelated, Berenson said.
So Berenson asked the FDA if it was aware that a child in a Moderna clinical trial died after receiving the vaccine.
“The agency has so far refused to answer,” Berenson wrote on Monday. “But based on what the FDA said to me on Friday, it seems likely the agency did know about the death — a fact it is trying to hide.”
‘FDA will not be able to stonewall much longer’
Although Moderna reported the clinical trial results containing the child’s death to European regulatory authorities, the company has yet to report the results to ClinicalTrials.gov, an official U.S. government website where drugmakers are legally required to report trial results.
According to Moderna’s report filed on Sept. 30, 2024, with the European Union’s Clinical Trials Register, the vaccine maker completed the KidCOVE trial on March 15, 2024, and finished its analysis of the results on May 17.
Berenson asked the FDA if the agency had information about pediatric deaths during the KidCOVE trial. An FDA spokesperson sent him a two-paragraph statement.
“Nowhere in its 152 words did the FDA — a federal agency that claims its job is ‘promoting and protecting human health’ — acknowledge the death,” Berenson wrote. “But the agency also did not make a simple, clean denial by saying no children had died in any trials at any time.”
Berenson sent the FDA a second round of questions. The agency did not respond, despite Berenson sending multiple follow-up emails.
Here are some of the questions left unanswered, Berenson told The Defender:
“Did Moderna inform the FDA of the death, as it was legally required to do? Neither the agency nor the company has said, but considering Moderna published the death in its report to European regulators, it seems very likely it did also tell the FDA.
“Did the FDA investigate? If so, what did it find? If not, why not? Most importantly, considering that the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and American health authorities continued AND STILL CONTINUE to push mRNA jabs on children (in contrast to those in other countries), why didn’t the FDA make its findings and the death public?”
Berenson called on the FDA and Moderna to immediately disclose what they know. He said:
“For the FDA, which answers to the public, transparency is even more vital. If the death of a child in the most closely scrutinized vaccine trial in history could go unreported, people will rightly wonder what else is being missed — or covered up.”
Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Berenson he plans later this month, after Republicans officially take control of the U.S. Senate, to subpoena the FDA to find out what it knew and when.
“The FDA will not be able to stonewall much longer,” Berenson said.

Notably, authorities have made it clear that all we will know about the diseased patient is that he (or she) was over 65, was reported to have underlying medical conditions, and had been exposed to a “combination of a non-commercial backyard flock and wild birds.”
Press release from the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) below:
Current general public health risk remains low
The Louisiana Department of Health reports the patient who had been hospitalized with the first human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), or H5N1, in Louisiana and the U.S. has died. The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions. The patient contracted H5N1 after exposure to a combination of a non-commercial backyard flock and wild birds.
LDH’s extensive public health investigation has identified no additional H5N1 cases nor evidence of person-to-person transmission. This patient remains the only human case of H5N1 in Louisiana.
The Department expresses its deepest condolences to the patient’s family and friends as they mourn the loss of their loved one. Due to patient confidentiality and respect for the family, this will be the final update about the patient.
While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk.
The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure. That means avoiding direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with bird flu viruses.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/herbicide-atrazine-ages-brain-cells-study,Herbicide Atrazine Ages Brain Cells — Study,By Sean Miller,1 month ago,"A study published December 13, 2024 documented how the herbicide atrazine causes neurological destruction resulting in the effective aging of brain cells.
“Atrazine (AT), a widely utilized chemical herbicide, causes widespread contamination of agricultural water bodies. Recently, exposure to AT has been linked to the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), suggesting its neurotoxicity potential,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Atrazine garnered fame following Alex Jones discussing its endocrine system-disrupting nature, causing amphibians such as frogs to turn gay.
“As an endocrine disruptor, AT targets the hypothalamus, a crucial part of the neuroendocrine system,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The researchers documented that atrazine does indeed damage a key region of the brain.
“Our results indicated that AT exposure caused significant morphological and structural damage to the hypothalamus, leading to the loss of mature and intact neurons and microglial activation,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
This damage is exhibited with senescence (the condition or result of aging).
“AT induces senescence in these recruited HtNSCs by activating integrated stress response signaling. This consequently hinders the repair of damaged neurons by inhibiting HtNSC proliferation and differentiation,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “Overall, our findings underscore the pivotal role of the integrated stress response pathway in AT-induced HtNSC senescence and hypothalamic damage.”
Neurodegenerative diseases in general have been linked to atrazine by the researchers.
“Additionally, the present study offers novel perspectives to understand the mechanisms of AT-induced neurotoxicity and provides preliminary evidence linking AT contamination to the development of NDs,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
“I don’t like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the freakin frogs gay,” Jones said after documenting the scientific evidence.
Alex Jones’ got the documents.
“Atrazine-exposed males were both demasculinized (chemically castrated) and completely feminized as adults. Ten percent of the exposed genetic males developed into functional females that copulated with unexposed males and produced viable eggs,” the gay frog study said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “Atrazine-exposed males suffered from depressed testosterone, decreased breeding gland size, demasculinized/feminized laryngeal development, suppressed mating behavior, reduced spermatogenesis, and decreased fertility. These data are consistent with effects of atrazine observed in other vertebrate classes.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-horrors-of-transgenderism-are-still-plaguing-our-children-despite-growing-pushback,The Horrors of Transgenderism are Still Plaguing Our Children Despite Growing Pushback,By Jonathon Van Maren | Lifesite,1 month ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — As 2025 begins, trans activists are preparing for a grim fight.
2024 ended with a flurry of headlines emphasizing how much cultural ground they have lost. Stephen Fry went on the Triggernometry podcast to pretend he’d never reallysupported the trans activist outfit Stonewall to begin with (Malcolm Clark refused to let him get away with it and penned a savage response in The Critic).
The Times declared that the transgender movement had hit a high-water mark in an editorial titled “How a handful of outraged Scottish women changed our world.” J.K. Rowling, of course, saw out the old year in style, tangling with trans activists on X.

In response, some of the more politically savvy trans activists are once again utilizing their most successful tactic: exploiting empathy for political purposes. Opposing gender “transition” or boys in girls’ spaces, they claim, is “bullying trans kids.” They demand to know: who does it hurt if a “transgender girl” – that is, a boy – is permitted to use the bathroom he is most comfortable with? And of course, the answer to that question is obvious to sane and reasonable people: it hurts the girls, of course.
Evidence of this is everywhere, but rarely makes the big media outlets. It is, however, often reported by smaller, local news outfits.
In late December, for example, the Kenosha County Eye, a small news site in Wisconsin, was contacted by the parents of several girls who attend Westosha Central High School. Citing “multiple sources,” the KCE reported that a trans-identifying boy has been using the girls’ locker room, and that he “stares at the young girls while they change and that makes them feel very uncomfortable.” Some of the girls have begun to use stalls to change in order to avoid his gaze.
Further, the KCE reported, as the girls exited “the boy would be exposing his penis and rubbing himself with lotion” which, he told them, he did to “prevent chafing.”
If this story were reported in the New York Times or the Washington Post, the boy would have been referred to as a “transgender girl” and female pronouns would likely have been used. But a small, local media outlet is willing to tell the truth: it is a boy we are talking about. From the KCE story:
The boy changes in the full nude, often exposing his penis and testicles. Many girls, some or most which are freshmen, approached the gym teacher, Miranda Hopkins. Hopkins told the girls that the boy “identifies” as a girl, so they have to let him have access … There is a family locker room in the school that the girls starting using, but Hopkins told the girls they can’t use it and to stop “stirring up drama.” The girls then stopped changing in the locker room and went to gym class without the proper gym clothes on. The school punished them by marking down their grades and handing out “unexcused absences.”
Parents haven’t just been calling the press – they’ve been calling the school, as well. Apparently, the girls were informed by the school that the boy in question would no longer be permitted to use their locker room, but that he is simply doing so anyways. One girl, who told the boy to put his private parts away, “was allegedly assaulted” by the boy, who shoved her, and KCE noted that he was suspended for this act. Threats of violence are allegedly common from this clearly disturbed young student.
The Kenosha Unified School District recently voted to allow trans-identifying students into the facilities of their choice, and already the consequences are clear. One dad told KCE: “I find it unacceptable that a 14-year-old girl is required to change in front of a 16-year-old boy to complete a required class in school … I don’t feel like the district is taking this seriously.” KCE reached out to the County Sheriff’s Office on December 20, and the Sherrif’s Office also promised to look into it.
Trans activists have been ignoring and suppressing stories like this for years. The girls get called bigots for defending their natural modesty; the trans-identifying boys get pandered to as victims. But the Overton Window is shifting. More and more people are willing to speak out firmly on this issue as it becomes safer to do so. Our job is to keep publicizing these stories so that the real cost of the transgender agenda is known to all.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/fda-finds-dna-contamination-in-pfizer-covid-vaxx,FDA Finds DNA Contamination in Pfizer COVID Vaxx,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"High levels of DNA contamination have been detected in Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines.
The finding came in a study commissioned by the Food and Drug Administration.
The study, published in the Journal of High School Science at the end of last month, was carried out by three high-school students from Virginia, under the supervision of FDA scientists.
The students found that levels of residual DNA in the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine were between six and 470 times higher than regulatory safety limits. They tested two lots of the vaccine, finding they contained “residual DNA to a level that exceeds 10 ng per dose.”
“The potential health risk posed by residual small DNA fragments is currently unknown,” the students state, but they also note that DNA contamination could cause something known as “insertional mutagenesis,” which may result in cancer.
As the Defender reports, DNA contamination in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was first detected in 2023.
As many as eight studies have also reported similar findings.
Some experts believe the mRNA vaccines should be recalled, because the risk of insertional mutagenesis is too high.
“So far, the European, Australian, and American health regulatory boards have denied any risks from plasmid DNA contamination in the COVID-19 injections despite nine studies by internationally known research teams,” said Christof Plothe, a member of the World Council for Health’s Steering Committee.
“All teams concluded that this contamination poses an unacceptable risk to three-quarters of the world’s population… Three teams so far have demonstrated the integration into human cells. To what extent this is happening to everybody who was injected needs to be investigated.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/a-quarter-of-young-people-in-denver-experience-homelessness,A Quarter of Young People in Denver Experience Homelessness,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"A full quarter of young people aged 14 to 17 in Denver experienced homelessness over the last year.
Researchers combined multiple data sources to reach this shocking figure.
They found that the number of youths experiencing homelessness in its various forms increased significantly year on year from 2017.
Researchers broke down their findings by race and found that between 2017 and 2021, Black/African American or Hispanic youth accounted for 23–37% and 46–56% of the total estimated population of youth experiencing homelessness, respectively.
According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the national rate of homelessness increased by a record 18% over the last year.
A total of 771,480 people, or around 20 in 10,000 in the US, were homeless and living in an emergency shelter, safe haven, transitional housing program, or an unsheltered location, according to new data released on Friday.
That amounts to an 18% increase on 2023. The 2023 annual data showed a 12% increase.
Over the last year, children under the age of 18 experienced the greatest increase in homelessness. More than 150,000 under-18s were classed as homeless, a 33% rise on 2023.
Black people, who represent 12% of the US population, represented just under a third of all homeless people.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development attributed the increase to “our worsening national affordable housing crisis, rising inflation, stagnating wages among middle- and lower-income households,” as well as “the persisting effects of systemic racism,” “public health crises,” “natural disasters,” increase immigration to the US and the end of anti-homelessness programs brought in during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/biden-commits-over-300-million-to-bird-flu-prevention,Biden Commits over $300 Million to Bird Flu Prevention,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"President Biden has committed $306 million to increase monitoring, testing and response to H5N1 bird flu across the United States.
According to a press release, “The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it would award $306 million dollars to continue its H5N1 Avian Flu response. While CDC’s assessment of the risk of avian influenza to the general public remains low, USDA and HHS continue to closely collaborate with Federal, State, local, industry and other stakeholders to protect human health, animal health, and food safety.”
“While the risk to humans remains low, we are always preparing for any possible scenario that could arise. These investments are critical to continuing our disease surveillance, laboratory testing, and monitoring efforts alongside our partners at USDA,” said Secretary Xavier Becerra.
“Preparedness is the key to keeping Americans healthy and our country safe. We will continue to ensure our response is strong, well equipped, and ready for whatever is needed.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently confirmed the first “severe” case of bird flu in the US.
The CDC tested samples from the sufferer, a 65-year-old man from Louisiana, and confirmed worrying new mutations.
The mutations affect the virus’s hemagglutinin gene and could make the virus more transmissible in humans.
In particular, the mutations “may result in increased virus binding to α2-6 cell receptors found in the upper respiratory tract of humans.”
Further testing revealed that the mutation was absent from birds on the man’s property, in a clear sign that the mutation developed within the man during his sickness.
A similar case, with mutations that make human transmission easier, was discovered in a teenager in Canada earlier this year.
Experts are now warning that of the potential for widespread human-human transmission of the virus.
Following the announcement of the first severe case in the US, Governor Gavin Newsom recently declared a state of emergency in response to the bird flu outbreak. The declaration grants Newsom sweeping powers and the right to impose restrictions and allocate resources without legislative approval.
“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,” Newsome said in a statement.",0

According to The Hill, a number of sources report that Sens. Bernie Sanders and John Fetterman are considering voting in favour of Kennedy’s appointment.
“I think Bernie will give him a fair review,” a source said.
“I definitely think his Senate office will use the opportunity to point out the shortcomings of the industrial food system, supply chains, etc.”
Bernie Sanders wrote an op-ed for The Guardian in which he echoed many of Kennedy’s key proposals to “make America healthy again.” Sanders wrote, “Large food corporations should not make record-breaking profits making children addicted to processed foods, which make them overweight and prone to diabetes and other diseases.”
“As a start, we must ban junk-food ads targeted to kids and put strong warning labels on products high in sugar, salt and saturated fat,” Sanders continued.
“Longer term, we can rebuild rural America with family farms that are producing healthy, nutritious food.”
Sen. Fetterman has also been identified as a key potential ally for many of Kennedy’s proposals, as well as Trump policies that will “benefit the people and help everyday people.”
A source said Fetterman is “definitely a swing vote for all of Trump’s nominees.”

The executive order authorizes a battery of measures to improve food choices in California. State organizations will be ordered to provide recommendations to the Governor’s Office to reduce the harms associated with processed-food consumption.
They will also be tasked with investigating the harmful effects of synthetic food dyes like Red 40; recommending actions to reduce processed-food consumption; investigating how to improve access to healthy foods, especially in so-called “food deserts;” and investigating how to improve California’s school meals.
The executive order notes that over 70% of American adults are overweight or obese and nearly 40% of 12-19 year olds are prediabetic.
“The food we eat shouldn’t make us sick with disease or lead to lifelong consequences,” said Governor Newsom in a statement
“California has been a leader for years in creating healthy and delicious school meals, and removing harmful ingredients and chemicals from food. We’re going to work with the industry, consumers and experts to crack down on ultra-processed foods, and create a healthier future for every Californian.”
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has identified processed foods as one of the principal causes of America’s unprecedented health crisis. He has vowed to “make America healthy again.”

Britain’s Daily Telegraph reports that scientists with the Oxford Vaccine Group are worried the UK could be caught unprepared by a global pandemic of the disease which killed tens of millions of people the Middle Ages.
The Oxford Vaccine Group has been trialling a plague vaccine since 2021, on a group of 40 healthy adults. The group’s leader, Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, says the vaccine has proven a success, and results of the trial will be submitted to a scientific journal for peer review within weeks. Further clinical trials are expected.
Pollard said: “There are no licensed plague vaccines in the UK. Antibiotics are the only treatment. There are some licensed vaccines in Russia.
“The risk in the UK is currently very low. Previous historical pandemics that had high mortality were associated with initiation from fleas on rodents but were driven by person to person spread.”
Military scientists in the UK believe the plague, which still exists in isolated pockets around the world, has the “potential for pandemic spread.” Scientists from the UK government’s biological research facility at Porton Down recently wrote a paper claiming that vaccine production needs to be enhanced “to prevent future disastrous plague outbreaks.”
Experts from the Oxford Vaccine Group were responsible for the creation of the Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which was recently subject to a global recall after serious side effects were acknowledged. Astrazeneca claimed the withdrawal was due to commercial rather than health concerns, as newer vaccines designed for emerging variants enter the market.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/mask-mandates-returning,Mask Mandates Returning,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"Mask mandates are returning to hospitals and healthcare facilities across the US.
Fresh mandates have so far been enacted in hospitals in New York, New Jersey and California, and other states.
RWJ Barnabas Health, the largest hospital operator in New Jersey, now has mask requirements or recommendations at all of its facilities.
As well as requiring masks for “all patients who present with respiratory symptoms, as well as all staff members and providers caring for them,” all visitors to RWJ Barnabas hospitals are asked to “wear an appropriate face mask.”
In New York, Health Commissioner James McDonald has announced that all healthcare personnel who are not vaccinated against flu must wear a mask in healthcare facilities.
“My declaration that flu is prevalent across the State means healthcare personnel who are not vaccinated against the flu this season need to take extra precautions and wear a mask in healthcare facilities to avoid exposing sick patients and those most vulnerable to complications of the virus,” Anderson said.
“The flu vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect against infection and will lessen the symptoms if you get sick. I encourage everyone 6 months and older to get the flu shot, and it’s not too late to protect yourself and your loved ones and ensure you don’t miss out on holiday celebrations.”
In California, public health departments in several counties in the San Francisco Bay Area have brought in mask mandates. The mandates, which were brought in in September and October, are effective until 31 March 2025.
Healthcare workers in “skilled nursing facilities” in San Francisco, for example, are required to wear a mask when in the same room as residents or patients.
Multiple studies have revealed that during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, masking did little to nothing to reduce the spread of the virus.
Back in May, a study from the University of East Anglia showed wearing face coverings did not reduce the risk of infection with the Omicron variant.
The researchers used data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID survey in England which estimated how many people had infections.
From November 2021 to May 2022, the ONS also asked individuals about their circumstances and habits—including mask-wearing, work habits and travel—to see if those factors could be linked to risk of positivity.
By analysing this data, the researchers found that wearing face coverings did not reduce the risk of infection by the Omicron variant at all.
The value of wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has been a source of some controversy, not least of all because of initial warnings during the pandemic from experts and government officials not to wear them.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/mask-mandates-return-to-several-us-hospitals,Mask Mandates Return to Several US Hospitals,By Adan Salazar,2 months ago,"Hospitals in several US states are reimposing mask mandates, citing rising Covid-19, flu, norovirus and RSV infection rates as justification.
Pandemic-era face coverings and social distancing are now required at some hospitals in California, New Jersey, New York, Indiana and Illinois, with one of Wisconsin’s largest hospital networks recently joining the list.
The Daily Mail reports:
Wisconsin’s Aurora Health Care system — which treats 1.2 million patients a year — is among the latest to bring back mask mandates for its units.
It says that visitors will now need to mask up ‘when in contact with patients or in congregate areas, including patient rooms and other areas designated by signage’.
It follows hospital systems in other states like New Jersey, where its largest hospital system RWJBarnabas Health — which sees three million patients a year — has also reinstated its mask mandate.
In guidance posted online, the hospital system also said that visitors would now be expected to ‘wear an appropriate face mask’ and ‘maintain physical distance’.
It added: ‘We will offer you a new mask for source control or may ask you to replace your own mask with a hospital-supplied mask.’
The Rush University Medical Center, Rush Copley Medical Center and Rush Oak Park Hospital in Illinois, have also all started requiring face masks for staff and visitors.
And In Indiana, Union Health has asked visitors to wear face masks due to an uptick in respiratory viruses.
Doctors spoken to by The Mail noted the country is currently seeing an uptick in flu, Covid, norovirus and RSV cases – dubbed a “quad-emic.”
“What we are seeing now is an increasing amount of respiratory disease and norovirus that is really all over the US,” noted Dr. Joseph Bresee, associate director of Global Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Influenza Division in Atlanta.
“It is what we see most years and we will probably see increasing amounts over the next few weeks as well.”
He added: “[Cases] will go up as people get back on planes and travel for this holiday season. Any airplane right now certainly has people with viruses on board… And we do tend to see big peaks just after the winter holidays as people have traveled, got infected, and then gone back to school.”
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) declared his state would not be bringing back mask mandates.
The pandemic-era restrictions are attempting to make a return as President-elect Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated in less than three weeks.
Meanwhile, Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has argued face masks are ineffective at stopping disease infection and transmission, and pledged throughout his presidential campaign not to impose mask mandates.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-vaccines-contain-cancer-virus-fragments-mutagenic-dna-contamination-study,Covid Vaccines Contain Cancer Virus Fragments & Mutagenic DNA Contamination — Study,By Sean Miller,2 months ago,"A peer-reviewed study published Sunday documented findings from Covid gene-therapy vaccine analysis conducted in the BSL-1 research facility at the FDA White Oak campus. The findings detailed how the mRNA injections contain fragments of SV40 cancer virus, as well as DNA contamination.
“Using 4 vials of experimental mRNA vaccines, we found that two out of four vials of those experimental mRNA vaccines contained residual plasmid DNA that transformed Escherichia coli cells. We subsequently applied our method to assess 2 separate lots of Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and found no replication-competent plasmid DNA. However, these authorized vaccines do contain residual DNA to a level that exceeds 10 ng per dose,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
🚨 “SMOKING GUN-BOMBSHELL”NEW FDA Study Reveals Jabs Have Cancer-Causing SV40 and 47,000% DNA ContaminationAn official study conducted by the FDA itself on mRNA vaxx vials directly sourced from the official NIAID supply factory, has found that ""residual DNA levels"" exceeded… pic.twitter.com/IrHGzAVvJB
While SV40 cancer virus fragments were detected, the researchers stated that since it was just fragments it’s unlikely they’d have the same carcinogenic effect as fully intact SV40 cancer viruses, yet may still cause localized reactions.
It should be noted however that other researchers have detected larger SV40 cancer virus fragments in their mRNA Covid vaccine samples.
“Although some investigators have reported the presence of larger DNA fragments with SV40 promoter/enhancer from the commercial mRNA vaccines (18), our results showed the efficient digestion of plasmid DNA in Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccines,” the study said in the ‘Discussion’ section. “Since we only detected DNA fragments < 35 bp in our study, it is practically unlikely for these broken pieces of SV40 promoters to be functional. The plasmid DNA template does not contain oncogenes. Therefore, it is less likely that these DNA fragments will be oncogenic or infectious. Smaller DNA fragments can be immunostimulatory, contributing to local reactions after vaccination.”
Perhaps ironically, the impetus of this study was to “report a simple method to detect residual replication-competent plasmid DNA that is present in mRNA vaccines as impurities” in order to “suggest that stringent and transparent monitoring of DNA impurity may aid in the buildup of public trust in mRNA vaccines.”
Infowars previously reported on a separate study that documented how the Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine contains DNA contamination at over 500 times allowable levels, as well as a study that documented DNA contamination in addition to many other alarming issues.
Before the publication of this study, Dr. Peter McCullough discussed the DNA contamination of the mRNA Covid vaccines based on separate research.

Kennedy Jr.’s attorney left Tucker Carlson nearly speechless after revealing to him that the pharmaceutical industry uses cells from born-alive aborted babies for research.
Aaron Siri sat down with Carlson for a nearly two-hour-long interview with the former Fox News host. Their conversation was released on X on December 27 and has garnered widespread attention on social media as Siri, who is helping Kennedy vet potential staffers for the Health and Human Services Department, was the subject of a hit piece in the New York Times last month.
Among the topics Siri and Carlson discussed was the horrific subject of how Big Pharma relies on aborted babies to make its products.
“In every single dose of an MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) shot, there are literally, literally millions of pieces from the cultured cell line of an aborted fetus in every single injection,” Siri explained to a stunned Carlson. “I could literally pull up right now the CDC’s own ingredient list for the MMR vaccine.”
Siri has won major lawsuits related to medical freedom and vaccine injuries in his litigation experience. He further explained to a bewildered Carlson that in order for the vaccines to be developed, they need to be cultivated on “aborted fetal tissue” that are “alive.”
Carlson, who admitted to Siri that he has a vaccine-injured child, then asked “where do they get aborted fetuses?” while also admitting, “I’m about as uncomfortable as I’ve ever been in an interview”
“From babies that are aborted,” Siri replied. “The cells need to be alive.”
Carlson and Siri also discussed a nine-hour deposition Siri previously conducted of atheist Jewish physician Stanley Plotkin. Plotkin has been a consultant for Big Pharma for decades on how to make their products. He admitted to Siri during the deposition that he used experimental vaccines on orphans and the mentally ill for testing purposes.
READ: Trump must stop the horrific sale of aborted baby parts
Carlson told Siri that he was “shocked and revolted” when he watched clips of Plotkin’s deposition while adding that the connection between pharmaceutical companies and the abortion industry is deeply disturbing.
“They’re typically aborted for the scientific purpose. They have to know beforehand for the most part because if they abort the baby and they don’t immediately act to make sure that the tissues don’t die then you can’t use them in these experiments,” Siri replied commenting on how Big Pharma works in tandem with abortionists.
In 2016, undercover pro-life journalist David Daleiden exposed abortion giant Planned Parenthood by releasing footage of high-ranking staff discussing the sale of aborted baby body parts for profits. His efforts set off a nationwide discussion as well as a series of lawsuits related to the group’s practices.",0

KFF Health News published a hysterical report last week citing numerous public health experts and government officials sounding the alarm about the likelihood that Americans may have to deal with another, even deadlier, pandemic if health agencies can’t properly address bird flu outbreaks occurring in cattle and poultry farms.
“To understand how the bird flu got out of hand, KFF Health News interviewed nearly 70 government officials, farmers and farmworkers, and researchers with expertise in virology, pandemics, veterinary medicine, and more,” the outlet reported.
It went on to claim that its investigation “revealed key problems, including deference to the farm industry, eroded public health budgets, neglect for the safety of agriculture workers, and the sluggish pace of federal interventions.”
“We are in a terrible situation and going into a worse situation,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “I don’t know if the bird flu will become a pandemic, but if it does, we are screwed.”
The report claims that in addition to the taxpayer cost of reimbursing farmers for infected cattle and combating the bird flu, “the outbreak poses the threat of a pandemic” because the H5N1 virus could possibly mutate into a virus that enables human-to-human transmission.
“More than 60 people in the U.S. have been infected, mainly by cows or poultry, but cases could skyrocket if the virus evolves to spread efficiently from person to person. And the recent news of a person critically ill in Louisiana with the bird flu shows that the virus can be dangerous,” the outlet reported.
“Just a few mutations could allow the bird flu to spread between people. Because viruses mutate within human and animal bodies, each infection is like a pull of a slot machine lever.”
The report lays out plenty of criticisms of the government’s “sluggish” response to the bird flu outbreaks and deference to cattle farmers who don’t want to cooperate.
“You are surrounded by highly pathogenic viruses in the wild and in farm animals,” said Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. “If three months from now we are at the start of the pandemic, it is nobody’s surprise.”
Tom Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the globalist Council on Foreign Relations, likewise said, “It’s disheartening to see so many of the same failures that emerged during the Covid-19 crisis reemerge.”
The report even criticized President-elect Donald Trump’s mass deportation plan, arguing it will increase the risk of turning the bird flu outbreaks into a full-blown pandemic because a large percentage of dairy workers are illegal aliens.
As President-elect Donald Trump comes into office in January, farmworkers may be even less protected. Trump’s pledge of mass deportations will have repercussions whether they happen or not, said Tania Pacheco-Werner, director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute in California.
Many dairy and poultry workers are living in the U.S. without authorization or on temporary visas linked to their employers. Such precarity made people less willing to see doctors about covid symptoms or complain about unsafe working conditions in 2020. Pacheco-Werner said, “Mass deportation is an astronomical challenge for public health.”
The report claims the best way to prevent the bird flu outbreaks from becoming a full-fledged pandemic is to “curtail” their spread at the farms by promoting more testing, boosting taxpayer funds to assist farmers, and offering bird flu vaccines to vulnerable workers.
Though some elements of the report make sensible points, it seems the “bird flu pandemic” narrative is largely a media effort to gin up hysteria and set up Trump for another public health crisis as he’s set to be sworn into office in just a few weeks.
“President-elect Donald Trump is likely to struggle with the outbreak of bird flu, or H5N1, among livestock and wildlife in the United States, which experts are concerned could become a threat to humans should the spread of the virus not be contained,” The Washington Examiner said Monday.

The New England Journal of Medicine, actually published this twisted madness: describing how researchers in the Netherlands were unleashing armies of genetically mutated mosquitos on human guinea pigs, all in the name of fighting malaria.
They dubbed it GA2 – a Frankenstein’s monster of a parasite engineered to lurk in human liver cells for six days before shutting down like a cheap Vegas slot machine. Its predecessor, GA1, had been a 24-hour flash in the pan.
The methodology read like a script rejected from a B-grade horror film: “Stage A – subject volunteers to be swarmed by 15 to 50 infected mosquitos.” Stage B was even more deranged – random selection for either 50 mutant-carrying mosquitos or, if you drew the lucky straw, just regular old blood-sucking insects. A placebo by way of proboscis.
But here’s where it gets seriously twisted: 20% of the poor bastards showed signs of heart damage, which the researchers dismissed with the kind of casual wave you’d expect from the spawn of Operation Paperclip. “Unrelated to the trial intervention,” they claimed, offering no explanation beyond a cryptic smile and a stack of Gates Foundation receipts – $2,287,871 worth of them, to be exact.
Dr. Richard Bartlett, one of the few voices of sanity in this pharmaceutical circus, called it what it was: “A serious safety signal that cannot be ignored.” But in the current climate of medical McCarthyism, where dissent equals deletion, his warnings might as well have been whispered into a hurricane.",0

Perhaps the talking point put out by vaccine aficionado Peter Hotez earlier in the month is now making the rounds in the controlled corporate press.
“President-elect Donald Trump is likely to struggle with the outbreak of bird flu, or H5N1, among livestock and wildlife in the United States, which experts are concerned could become a threat to humans should the spread of the virus not be contained,” The Washington Examiner said Monday.
Ironically, according to The Washington Examiner article, there has not yet been human-to-human spread of the virus and only 60 cases in humans have so far been confirmed, all derived from contact with infected poultry or bovine. In other words, not much has changed since April, besides the Presidential election.
Yahoo News went so far as to make their headline ‘How America Lost Control of The Bird Flu, Setting The Stage For Another Pandemic‘. The article paints a horrific picture that is likely intended to invoke an emotional response.
“Researchers say the United States is not on a path to contain the bird flu on dairy farms. (Stephen Ausmus/Animal Research Services, USDA). Keith Poulsen’s jaw dropped when farmers showed him images on their cellphones at the World Dairy Expo in Wisconsin in October. A livestock veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin, Poulsen had seen sick cows before, with their noses dripping and udders slack,” Yahoo said Monday. “But the scale of the farmers’ efforts to treat the sick cows stunned him. They showed videos of systems they built to hydrate hundreds of cattle at once.

The science himself, Anthony Fauci has crawled out from under a rock upon the activation of the bird flu operation to talk about the virus mutating into a human-to-human pandemic, something FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in May. Notably, this phenomenon was seen with the development of Covid in the Wuhan Lab.
Fauci literally just said the ""bird flu virus"" can go into a pig and a ""human flu virus"" can also go into that pig, both ""viruses"" can then have sex and create a ""human-bird-pig flu virus"" that will be able to transmit from human to human.LOL pic.twitter.com/zUoeYwBZ9r
Regarding weaponizing viruses, such as was being done at the Wuhan Lab, Dr. Peter McCullough and Dr. Kelly Victory both documented the fact that the new bird flu was likely the result of the very gain-of-function research that brought about Covid.
Also similar to Covid, Infowars reported in May that a new mRNA bird flu vaccine is already in development.

In the last year, nearly 70% of all overdose deaths in the US were attributed to illegally manufactured fentanyls, according to reporting from Fox News.
Fentanyl, which is itself about 100x more potent than morphine, is singled out as the main culprit, but now an increase number of deaths are being attributed to carfentanil.
The CDC’s State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System shows there were 29 deadly overdoses from carfentanil between January and June 2023. That figure rose dramatically for the same period this year to 238.
President-elect Donald Trump has made drugs, and particularly opioids, a strong focus of his new administration.
After winning the election, he threatened 25% tariffs on all goods from Mexico if the Mexican government does not address illegal immigration and the flow of drugs across the US southern border.
Cartels and criminal gangs purchase precursor chemicals for synthetic opioids from Chinese companies, manufacture the drugs in Mexico and then ship them across the border.
In 2023, the DEA seized over 80 million fake pills laced with fentanyl and nearly 12,000 pounds of fentanyl powder. This surpassed 2022’s total of 58 million pills. These seizures amounted to more than 381 million lethal doses. In the year up to July, the DEA seized nearly 28 million fentanyl pills and over 4,000 pounds of fentanyl powder, amounting to nearly 200 million deadly doses of fentanyl.",0

In an appearance on CBS News’ “Face The Nation” Sunday, Wen claimed that the Biden administration should takes steps to prepare for a possible animal-to-human outbreak of H5N1 following reports a patient in Louisiana contracted the virus earlier this month.
“It’s one more sign that the drum beat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat,” Wen said. “So, we’ve already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks. We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states. 16 states have outbreaks in cattle.”
“In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing.”
“So, we really don’t know the extent of bird flu that’s out there in humans,” she continued. “But this particular case, it’s someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors.”
Wen then said the Biden administration needs to expand rapid testing for the virus have the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) quickly approve the H5N1 for commercial use to prevent another COVID-style pandemic.
“I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren’t testing, it doesn’t mean that the virus isn’t there. It just means that we aren’t looking for it,” she said.
“We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren’t waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what’s bird flu or not.”
Wen stressed that the FDA must approve the H5N1 vaccine so that 5 million doses of it can be quickly administered to the “vulnerable” population before Trump takes office.
“And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn’t have a vaccine. There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1,” Wen explained. “The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine. However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There’s research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out so- and to farm workers and to vulnerable people.”
Wen went on to say that Biden needs to move quickly on these efforts because the Trump administration may not want to authorize new vaccines given the massive outcry over the experimental COVID mRNA injections.
“I think that’s the right approach, because we don’t know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu,” she said. “If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don’t want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that’s a possibility, and I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.”
Wen was an outspoken proponent of the harsh COVID measures, including prolonged shutdowns of schools and businesses, vaccine mandates, and punishments for the unvaccinated.
Her concerns that the Trump administration may not go along with the rushed distribution of new bird flu vaccines are not unwarranted.
Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in June floated the possibility that H5N1, like COVID-19, was engineered in a biological lab.
“With so much money on the table, is it conceivable that someone might deliberately release a bioengineered bird flu? When this kind of gain-of-function research is going on, accidental or deliberate leaks are inevitable,” Kennedy wrote in an X article.
It looks like the establishment is trying to rush into a new (and lucrative) pandemic hysteria before Trump takes office in just a few weeks.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/bill-gates-linked-vaccine-delivered-through-mosquito-bite-carries-bioengineered-malaria-causing-parasite,Bill Gates-Linked Vaccine Delivered Through Mosquito Bite Carries Bioengineered Malaria-Causing Parasite,By Jamie White,2 months ago,"A bizarre experiment funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation developed a new vaccine strategy using mosquito bites as a delivery vector in pursuit of developing a “next generation” malaria vaccine.
The experiment was conducted by researchers at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in Leiden, Netherlands, and published last month in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine.
Researchers explained how they used the bites of mosquitos to deliver a short-lived malaria vaccine comprised of genetically modified malaria parasites.
“We conducted a double-blind, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety, side-effect profile, and efficacy of immunization, by means of mosquito bites, with a second-generation genetically attenuated parasite (GA2) — a mei2 single knockout P. falciparum NF54 parasite (sporozoite form) with extended development into the liver stage,” the researchers stated.
The Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) parasite causes malaria in humans.
The method was meant to boost immunity through bites from mosquitoes carrying a genetically engineered version of the parasite that causes malaria.
First, researchers bioengineered two different types of malaria parasites for the experiment, GA1 and GA2.
GA1 was “designed to stop developing about 24 hours after infection in humans,” but had limited effectiveness, leading to the development of GA2.
GA2 was “designed to stop developing about six days post-infection, during the crucial period where the parasites replicate in human liver cells.”
The experiment was carried out in two stages.
In Stage A, study participants “were exposed to the bites of 15 or 50 infected mosquitoes.”
In Stage B, “healthy adults who had not had malaria were randomly assigned to be exposed to 50 mosquito bites per immunization of GA2, an early-arresting parasite (GA1), or placebo (bites from uninfected mosquitoes).”
Notably, the researchers only tracked infections for 25 days, which means more infections could have occurred after that short tracking period.
And 20% of participants in Stage B showed elevated troponin T levels, a biomarker for heart muscle damage or stress, raising concerns about potential cardiac injury.
However the researchers claimed the elevated T levels were “unrelated to the trial intervention” without elaborating on how they came to that conclusion.
COVID pandemic critic Dr. Richard Bartlett criticized the study’s short observation window, noting that long-term safety data was needed.
“The study raises significant red flags,” Dr. Bartlett said. “Tracking participants for just a few weeks is completely inadequate to assess long-term safety or efficacy. We need at least 6 months to a year to properly monitor for parasite infections and evaluate potential complications. Where is the long-term safety data? Without it, we cannot account for late-onset issues or complications that might arise.”
He also claimed the elevated T levels were “highly concerning.”
“Troponin is a specific marker for heart cell damage, not the liver,” he said. “This points to potential cardiac injury, which was seemingly dismissed without proper investigation. This is a serious safety signal that cannot be ignored.”
Bill Gates’ philanthropic fingerprints are all over this study.
The same month the study was published, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donated $2,287,871 to LUMC to develop “next generation malaria vaccine candidates,” according to the organization’s website.
During the height of the COVID plandemic, critics of the experimental mRNA injections were censored and vilified for speaking out.
Now it seems that mosquito bites are emerging as the next vaccine delivery vector, possibly to circumvent informed consent in future pandemic operations.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/another-study-finds-link-between-fluoride-and-lowered-iq,Another Study Finds Link Between Fluoride and Lowered IQ,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"A meta-study—a study of multiple studies—shows a clear link between prenatal exposure to fluoride and reduced IQ in children at age 7.
The meta-study, which looked at three studies from Denmark, Mexico and Canada, found that a concentration of 0.3mg/L of fluoride in maternal urine was the critical threshold beyond which exposure has toxic effects on cognitive development.
The data from the Danish study provided evidence for lower concentrations of fluoride, and didn’t substantiate a clear link between prenatal exposure and IQ at age 7, but when the data from the Mexican and Canadian studies were considered as well, it became clear that higher concentrations were associated with IQ decreases.
A maternal urine fluoride level increase of 1 mg/l was associated with a 2.06 point IQ decrease in children.
There has been renewed focus on the health effects of fluoridation as a result of Trump’s election victory and his choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
At the beginning of November, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made clear that removing fluoride from public water will be one of the new Trump administration’s top health priorities.
“On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy Tweeted.
“Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President ​@realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.”
In September, Judge Edward Chen, in the Northern District of California, ruled that fluoride in drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children.
“In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote.
“EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.”
American towns have already started removing fluoride from their water supplies after Judge Chen’s ruling.
Yorktown and Somers, both in New York State, have both announced an end to municipal fluoridation.
Somers Supervisor Robert Scorrano said that the town’s decision to stop fluoridating the municipal water supply would “give residents the freedom to choose their own sources of fluoride, ensuring personal control over their health decisions. Additionally, concerns about potential long-term health risks from fluoride exposure support reevaluating its use in public water systems.”
Florida’s Surgeon General has also recommended removing fluoride from all public water.
Joseph Ladapo said fluoride should be removed from public water by 1 January next year or “as soon as possible thereafter.”
Ladapo said the measure was necessary because of the “neuropsychiatric risk associated with fluoride exposure.”",0

An explosion at the facility in southwest Georgia caused a fire that raged for three hours before it was put out.
The explosion also caused a wall to collapse and fall on the cab of an 18-wheeler parked outside the plant. The wife of a truck driver who was sleeping inside was killed. She has been identified as Bajarma Batozhapov, 61, of Las Vegas.
Two others were injured in the blaze.
Union officials representing the 1,600 workers at the facility say a boiler exploded.
In recent years, there has been rampant speculation about dozens of mysterious fires and accidents at food-processing facilities and farms across the US.
Tucker Carlson discussed the mysterious fires on his Fox show in 2022, highlighting how the fires could not have come at a worse time for American consumers, with the pandemic causing significant supply-chain disruption and President Biden warning of food shortages.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/cdc-confirms-first-severe-case-of-bird-flu-with-new-mutations,CDC Confirms First Severe Case of Bird Flu with New Mutations,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"Testing has revealed fresh mutations in H5N1 bird flu that could make it more transmissible in humans.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested samples from the first “severe” case of bird flu in the US, a 65-year-old man from Louisiana, and confirmed worrying new mutations.
The mutations affect the virus’s hemagglutinin gene and could make the virus more transmissible in humans.
In particular, the mutations “may result in increased virus binding to α2-6 cell receptors found in the upper respiratory tract of humans.”
Further testing revealed that the mutation was absent from birds on the man’s property, in a clear sign that the mutation developed within the man during his sickness.
A similar case, with mutations that make human transmission easier, was discovered in a teenager in Canada earlier this year.
Experts are now warning that of the potential for widespread human-human transmission of the virus.
“Our No. 1 principle in preventing pandemics is detect, and if you go to the CDC website, you can see that they are monitoring more than 10,000 exposures, but they’ve only tested 530,” said Dr Deborah Birx, who was the White House coordinator for the COVID-19 pandemic under President Donald Trump.
“That means we’re not testing enough. And we know from other viruses that a lot of the spread can be asymptomatic. So we kind of have our head in the sand about how widespread this is from the zoonotic standpoint, from the animal to human standpoint.”
California has now declared a state of emergency in response to the spread of bird flu. The CDC, however, believes the risk to humans still remains low.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/record-increase-in-us-homelessness-in-2024,Record Increase in US Homelessness in 2024,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"Homelessness increased by a record 18% over the last year, says the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
A total of 771,480 people, or around 20 in 10,000 in the US, were homeless and living in an emergency shelter, safe haven, transitional housing program, or an unsheltered location, according to new data released on Friday.
That amounts to an 18% increase on 2023. The 2023 annual data showed a 12% increase.
Over the last year, children under the age of 18 experienced the greatest increase in homelessness. More than 150,000 under-18s were classed as homeless, a 33% rise on 2023.
Black people, who represent 12% of the US population, represented just under a third of all homeless people.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development attributed the increase to “our worsening national affordable housing crisis, rising inflation, stagnating wages among middle- and lower-income households,” as well as “the persisting effects of systemic racism,” “public health crises,” “natural disasters,” increase immigration to the US and the end of anti-homelessness programs brought in during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0

According to the Freedom Counsel, which defends victims who were affected by the jab and mandates, they’ve received multiple accounts of people who claim they were injected with the experimental mRNA jab while under anesthesia for other medical procedures.
“Were you or a family member covid vaxxed while under sedation? We are hearing stories of this abominable covert act,” Freedom Counsel founder Warner Mendenhall wrote on X earlier this month.
You are not alone.  Thanks for commenting. @Freedom_Counsel supports 250 attorneys around the country and world willing to sue over this.  Please chip in to this non-profit.  https://t.co/bMFIGqRtVR
Mendenhall went on to say he’s verified the accounts through health care workers, adding that many patients wouldn’t know if they were jabbed under sedation because it was probably not documented on charts.
No. That is the point. Some health care workers are confirming but the shot is not in the record.
The lawyer added he’ll soon have tests available for people who suspect they were jabbed while under anesthesia.
Tests will be available soon.
The claim that hospitals engaged in the covert act sent shockwaves throughout social media, with some calling the egregious practice “attempted murder” after many died as a result of the jab.
Attempted murder.
Others claim patients might have unwittingly signed off on the procedures via hospital paperwork.
Be aware of those signed consents
I’ve heard this for the past few years. When you go to ER or for an op, it’s in the forms you sign, which most don’t read.
Hospitals consider flu shots and I’m assuming Covid now too as preventative care. When you sign the waiver for care to have a procedure done, they add those in without telling you. I had a hip surgery, found out later the gave me a flu shot. All in the iv and never said a word.
Sorry, but nothing will come of this legally. They'll have covered themselves in the paperwork you signed. 😡
That’s why I avoided all procedures that would require sedation since 2020. The form you sign to grant treatment includes fine print for them to administer any medication they feel is “medically necessary”.
Will the Freedom Counsel or other attorneys uncover the full scope of this malpractice and be able to hold hospital networks accountable? Stay tuned!",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/autopsy-data-reveals-covid-injections-kill-study,Autopsy Data Reveals Covid Injections Kill — Study,By Sean Miller,2 months ago,"A recent systematic review study of autopsy data revealed a high likelihood of Covid vaccines causing death.
“The consistency seen among cases in this review with known COVID-19 vaccine mechanisms of injury and death, coupled with autopsy confirmation by physician adjudication, suggests there is a high likelihood of a causal link between COVID-19 vaccines and death. Further urgent investigation is required for the purpose of clarifying our findings,” the study said in the ‘Conclusions’ section.
The research was conducted via analysis of medical databases for autopsy reports relating to Covid vaccination. The researchers utilized 44 papers that contained 325 autopsy cases.
“We searched PubMed and ScienceDirect for all published autopsy and organ-restricted autopsy reports relating to COVID-19 vaccination up until May 18th, 2023. All autopsy and organ-restricted autopsy studies that included COVID-19 vaccination as an antecedent exposure were included. Because the state of knowledge has advanced since the time of the original publications, three physicians independently reviewed each case and adjudicated whether or not COVID-19 vaccination was the direct cause or contributed significantly to death,” the study said in the ‘Methods’ section.
In the introduction an interesting statistic was noted – as of May 31, 2023, about 69 percent of the world received at least one Covid shot.
“Some of the utilized COVID-19 vaccine platforms include inactivated virus (Sinovac – CoronaVac), protein subunit (Novavax – NVX-CoV2373), viral vector (AstraZeneca – ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Johnson & Johnson – Ad26.COV2.S), and messenger RNA (Pfizer-BioNTech – BNT162b2, Moderna – mRNA-1273),” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section. “All utilize mechanisms that can cause serious adverse events; most involve the uncontrolled synthesis of the Spike glycoprotein as the basis of the immunological response.”
The researchers discussed the pathologies of how the spike protein causes a long list of deleterious physiological effects.
“Circulating Spike protein is the likely deleterious mechanism through which COVID-19 vaccines produce adverse effects [5-9,12,13]. Spike protein and/or subunits/peptide fragments can trigger ACE2 receptor degradation and destabilization of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), resulting in severe thrombosis [5]. Spike protein activates platelets, causes endothelial damage, and directly promotes thrombosis [6]. Moreover, immune system cells that uptake lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) from COVID-19 vaccines can then systemically distribute Spike protein and microRNAs via exosomes, which may cause severe inflammatory consequences [6],” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section. “Further, long term cancer control may be jeopardized in those injected with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines because of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and tumor suppressor gene dysregulation [6]. Moreover, a possible causal link between COVID-19 vaccines and various diseases has been found, including neurological disorders, myocarditis, blood platelet deficiencies, liver disease, weakened immune adaptability, and cancer development. Neurotoxic effects of Spike protein may cause or contribute to the post-COVID syndrome, including headache, tinnitus, autonomic dysfunction, and small fiber neuropathy.”
The researchers provided a diagram depicting the process they went through to get their results.
The link of Covid injections to death may not be a surprise, as vaccine injury claims spiked 27 times following the shot’s rollout.
There are many accounts of individuals who lived by the shot dying by the shot.
The Covid shots are known to:
In the U.S. the CDC recommends that all Americans receive their tenth Covid shot and that young children receive extra, while Canada recommends another Covid shot for the pregnant, indigenous, ‘racialized’ & ‘equity-deserving’.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/arkansas-looks-to-hold-pharma-execs-criminally-liable-for-vaccine-injuries,Arkansas Looks to Hold Pharma Execs Criminally Liable for Vaccine Injuries,"By Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. | The Defender",2 months ago,"Arkansas lawmakers are weighing legislation that could pierce the pharmaceutical industry’s federal liability shield for vaccine injuries by holding corporate executives criminally liable for “vaccine harms” if they concealed evidence of risks associated with a vaccine that subsequently seriously injured or killed the recipient.
Under Senate Bill 6, introduced by Republican State Sen. Bryan King, an executive officer of a pharmaceutical company that “knowingly hides, conceals, omits, or otherwise withholds evidence, documentation, or information that the vaccine has dangerous effects,” would be found guilty of a felony and face a prison sentence of one year to life.
The bill is pending before the Arkansas Senate. King also introduced Senate Bill 5, to hold Pharmaexecutives criminally liable for “prescription drug harm.”
Previous versions of both bills unanimously passed last year in the Arkansas Senate but died in the Arkansas House.
Ray Flores, senior outside counsel for Children’s Health Defense (CHD), welcomed the proposed legislation. He told The Defender:
“Regarding vaccines and other health-related issues, the public is increasingly frustrated with the impervious protection current law and corporate structure afford. The time is ripe to single out those ultimate decision-makers who benefit the most.
“This is an attempt, done properly through legislation, to address that powerlessness currently radiating throughout society.”
California-based healthcare attorney Rick Jaffe called the proposed legislation “an excellent jumping-off point for the serious discussion the country needs to have about vaccines.”
King’s office did not respond to The Defender’s request for comment by press time.
Federal liability shield may not protect against criminal charges
Two federal laws provide civil immunity to vaccine manufacturers.
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 grants manufacturers broad protection from civil liability for injuries resulting from vaccines listed on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s childhood immunization schedule.
Under the 1986 act, people injured by these vaccines can file a claim under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
Vaccines like the COVID-19 shots, introduced as an “emergency countermeasure” to address a public health emergency, are covered under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act).
Under the PREP Act, manufacturers and other “covered persons” — including doctors, nurses and pharmacists who administer the vaccines — are exempt from liability. Vaccine injury claims for this category of vaccines are filed with the federal Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program.
In an analysis for TrialSite News, attorney Steven O’Connor suggested the proposed Arkansas bill could bypass the federal civil liability shields for vaccine makers.
“While Pharma execs and their firms face sturdy protections against civil liability for vaccine issues, there is no comparable protection for criminal liability,” O’Connor wrote.
“With much of the nation concerned about inadequate safety and efficacy research for our COVID-19vaccines, Arkansas may be leading the way in a societal shift which will put more onus” on Big Pharma “to act in a transparent, and non-misleading, fashion,” O’Connor added.
O’Connor noted that corporations can be charged with crimes and their executives can, in many instances, also “face charges for actions of the business as a whole.” He cited a March report by Public Citizen that showed an “uptick” in corporate prosecutions since 2022.
O’Connor cited recent U.S. Department of Justice charges against “a swath of defendants relating to distribution of almost 70 million opioid pills” as an example of how Pharma executives can be held criminally liable. Five Pharma distributor executives are among the defendants facing federal charges.
“If criminal activity occurred during the development, manufacturing, distribution and post-administration surveillance of vaccines, the corporate leaders should be held criminally responsible,” said Dr. Joel Wallskog, a Wisconsin orthopedic surgeon who no longer practices due to injuries he sustained from the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. “If there is evidence that they committed criminal acts and put profits before people, they should serve time in prison.”
Wallskog, co-chairman of React19, a nonprofit representing vaccine injury victims, said the key is to get some of these cases into court, where they may uncover evidence implicating the government and federal regulatory bodies in addition to pharmaceutical company executives.
“The discovery process would be very interesting, to know who in government and Pharma knew what and when about the failure of the vaccines to prevent infection and transmission, and the alarming incidence of adverse events,” Wallskog said.
Wallskog said the Arkansas legislation would serve as “a way for those Americans injured by the COVID-19 shots to seek some financial remedy.”
Law could face obstacles
Arkansas’s proposed bill could face obstacles, said Kim Mack Rosenberg, general counsel for CHD.
“The acts introduced in Arkansas are interesting but also, in my reading, somewhat vague and they leave open many questions and terms — such as what it means to introduce a product to market — that are not defined.”
Rosenberg also noted that the bills will have a limited duration, as they would expire at the end of 2026.
Dr. Meryl Nass, founder of Door to Freedom, told The Defender she “salutes Sen. King for creating this new class of crime” but also pointed out that the proposed legislation “does not involve financial penalties.”
“Should there not be a civil crime of vaccine harm in which injured civilians could receive monetary benefits from the pharmaceutical company officers or the company itself?” Nass asked.
Jaffe said the Arkansas bill “aims unnecessarily high” by exclusively targeting executives.
“I’m not sure how many presidents of Pharma companies know about the specifics of the clinical trials, so they could be exonerated on the knowledge requirement,” Jaffe said. “I think the law should be broadened out to make sure it can target the division heads and people who actually know about the adverse effects and may have hidden them from their superiors.”
And Flores suggested that, at least for vaccines covered under the PREP Act, federal law might supersede Arkansas state law. “The PREP Act’s blanket protection … would most likely extend to those who commit such crimes concerning COVID-19 vaccines since a covered person is immune from suit and liability.”
Jaffe called the proposed laws positive, despite their flaws. “I’d like to see more states propose the same kind of law,” Jaffe said. “If enough states do that, maybe Congress will get involved for national legislation.”
Rosenberg agreed:
“Τhe larger questions these acts raise certainly need to be addressed and, I think, represent a growing recognition by Americans that there are serious and potentially criminal actions taken by pharmaceutical interests and others in the health/medical field and that, for example, what happened with opioids may not be as exceptional, unfortunately, as many people thought.
“The population’s distrust is growing and the lack of transparency and liability in many instances only fuels that distrust.”",0

Implying that human being are unknowingly being poisoned, Shanahan then said: “we are an electrochemical species, and we are indeed short-circuiting at a cellular level — young people falling over on stage, which we are seeing time and time again on social media, video after video, of a newscaster or a young person literally speaking on stage and falling over.”
“This is not normal. It’s not normal,” she then declared. “There’s something biological happening … we are being polluted both electrically and chemically on a daily basis.”
Shanahan’s profile has grown since being tapped by RFK Jr. to be his running mate this summer. A former tech industry executive who was once married to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Shanahan, 39, reportedly has over $1 billion. She has spent the last several months pushing for reforms in the agricultural industry and advocating for politics aimed at preventing childhood illnesses since Kennedy dropped out of the race.
“The American farmer is the only doctor you need,” she told Catholic journalist Jack Posobiec at the event.
Shanahan’s remarks will no doubt be seen as a warning about the use of electromagnetic frequencies, cell phones, Wi-Fi routers, 5G and other wireless technologies.
In 2021, two Capuchin friars in Villié Morgon, France were arrested after attempting to set fire to two 5G antennas. They later said they acted to protect the population from the harmful effects of 5G, which some research has shown is detrimental to the human body. Other voices argue it is being used by the government to spy on Americans.
A 2023 study out of Sweden showed that a previously healthy woman developed symptoms of “microwave syndrome” shortly after a 5G cell tower was installed 60 meters – nearly 200 feet – from her apartment.
“Our children have become slaves to the system that looks at them in dollars and not the divine souls that they are,” Shanahan also said during her speech.",0

Wells | Natural News,2 months ago,"There’s never been a more tell-tale sign that the medical industry in America wants to kill Americans than the injection of mRNA “technology” into farm animals we consume. These animals were never in danger of contracting or dying from Covid-19, so why inject them with “vaccines” that create millions of spike prions in the blood and body? The globalists, like Bill Gates, want everyone, not just the naïve vaccinated, to have bodies polluted with nanoparticles that create horrific health conditions for Big Pharma to “treat” with more poison.
It has come to light that pork producers in America have been quietly administering customizable mRNA-based gene therapy to animals, particularly pigs, for several years now. This practice, shrouded in secrecy, involves injecting mRNA clot shots into pigs without any disclosure on food labels. The implications of this clandestine operation are alarming, as consumers unknowingly ingest pork contaminated with millions of self-assembling nanoparticles that pose serious health risks, including heart problems, immune dysfunction, and dementia.
The pioneering company behind this controversial method, Harrisvaccines, introduced the first RNA-based livestock vaccine in 2012, followed by an avian influenza mRNA shot in 2015. Subsequently, Merck Animal Health acquired Harrisvaccines in 2016, signaling a significant development in the mRNA-based gene therapy industry. CureVac also joined the fray by developing an mRNA-based rabies shot for pigs, further solidifying the prevalence of this unregulated practice in the livestock sector.
The introduction of Sequivity, a swine vaccine platform in 2018 by Merck in collaboration with Moderna, marked a significant milestone in the integration of mRNA technology in livestock production. Shockingly, these mRNA “vaccines” undergo no safety testing, raising serious concerns about the long-term effects on consumers who have been unknowingly consuming gene therapy-treated pork for almost five years.
Moreover, the expansion of this controversial practice looms large as companies set their sights on implementing mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines for avian influenza and cows. Lobbyists for the Cattlemen’s Association have confirmed plans to introduce mRNA “vaccines” in cattle, potentially impacting both dairy and beef products. The lack of transparency surrounding the use of Sequivity in pork production raises red flags about the integrity of the food supply chain and consumer safety.
The urgency of addressing this issue cannot be overstated, especially with the impending Trump administration. Missouri House Bill 1169 emerges as a beacon of hope in protecting consumers from gene-therapied pork and other meats by mandating transparent labeling of products that can alter genetic composition. The resistance from industry players against this bill raises questions about their motives and underscores the need for stringent regulations to safeguard public health.
As the debate rages on, consumers are advised to exercise caution and avoid pork products, including organic options, that may have been tainted with mRNA vaccines. The ramifications of consuming gene-altering foods extend beyond individual health concerns to broader ethical and regulatory implications that demand immediate attention and action.
In a landscape fraught with hidden dangers and corporate interests, the call for transparency and accountability in the food industry has never been more critical. The veil of secrecy shrouding mRNA injecting of livestock must be lifted, and stringent measures must be implemented to protect consumers from the insidious effects of unregulated gene therapy in our food supply. #mRNAPollutedPigs",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/dr-malone-bird-flu-emergency-in-california-is-a-case-of-psychological-bioterrorism,Dr. Malone: Bird Flu ‘Emergency’ in California is a Case of Psychological Bioterrorism,By Robert Malone M.D. | Lifesite,2 months ago,"(Robert Malone) — Sometimes I feel like a broken record when writing about infectious disease-based public health threats.
There are real threats, such as multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis, but these are rarely discussed. And then there is the psychological (eg. information) bioterrorism, the fear porn, a hyped narrative concerning an existential threat repeatedly injected into public discourse and then intentionally amplified to the point that it becomes a perverse and, in some cases, disabling obsession for many.
There are many who benefit from psychological (or information) bioterrorism. As discussed in 2017 by former Soviet-Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) intelligence officer Dr. Alexander Kouzminov:
Objects or target audience of an ‘active operation’ <of psychological bioterrorism> may be – governments, high-ranking military officials, secret services of the enemy, political parties, banks, companies, etc. as well as ordinary populations, where the aim is to cause some kind of an impact and effect….
Information (or psychological) bioterrorism – this is a form of global influence. It can be even more effective, from the view of consequences and harm, which it can cause. Firstly, info-bioterrorism, in comparison with an act of bioterror is not and does not apply for strategic or military applications, political assassination, and acts of sabotage – to disrupt local infrastructures, to harm the health of local population, animals, or disrupt the environment of a certain country. Secondly, its organisers and interested organizations, use the potential pandemic threat, in order to reach certain results…
Propaganda is the main weapon to influence people, especially if they are not well informed. An ordinary human being it appears only has a ‘surface’ knowledge about how real these kinds of threats are, and is used to rely on the opinions of mass media.

An AI-generated answer to Brave search query “Fearporn Definition” states the following:
Fear porn refers to mainstream media content that deliberately and enticingly plays on people’s fears about disaster, disease, and death. It is often used to describe sensationalized and exaggerated reports or stories that aim to provoke strong emotional reactions, such as fear, anxiety, or outrage. This type of content can be found in various forms of media, including news, social media, and online articles.
Some definitions of fear porn also include the idea that it is used to manipulate people’s emotions and attention, often for the purpose of increasing viewership, engagement, or clicks. Fear porn can be seen as a form of psychological manipulation, as it preys on people’s natural fear responses to create a sense of drama or excitement.
In some cases, fear porn can also be used to describe conspiracy theories or misinformation that is spread online, often with the intention of generating fear, anxiety, or outrage. This type of content can be particularly harmful, as it can spread misinformation and perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.
Overall, fear porn is a term used to describe a type of media content that uses fear and sensationalism to engage audiences and manipulate their emotions.
The bottom line here is that many national and global actors have long been known to exploit existential fear of infectious disease for political and economic benefit, and that there is a standard playbook for how this is performed. Therefore, the first thing that should come to your mind when you see this type of messaging being deployed and amplified in corporate media is the question, “Who and what is benefitting from this messaging?”
Conflicts of interest relating to the biodefense/infectious disease industrial complex abound. There are complex and hidden webs of influence that interlock politicians, industry, media, academia, federal agencies such as DOD, HHS, and USDA, as well as a wide range of individuals and organizations that benefit from federal (and global public-private partnerships) policies relating to the biodefense/infectious disease industrial complex.
I previously established and published a brief baseline threat assessment for Avian Influenza on July 2, 2024. Four dominant parameters must be considered when assessing a potential infectious disease threat to human populations:
READ: Children who got COVID shots more likely to catch the virus than those who didn’t, study finds
Politicians and their allies (in BioPharma, academia, and other sectors) have a variety of conflicts of interest and agendas which are not aligned with objective, dispassionate assessment and response to public health and infectious disease issues, and cannot be relied upon to analyze and respond to these key parameters objectively.
An assessment of the conflicts of interest and political agenda(s) of California’s Gavin Newsom is beyond the scope of this analysis. Still, please remember that Governor Newsom clearly mismanaged and overreacted to the COVID threat, as did the World Economic Forum that trained and coached (coaches?) him as a “Young Leader” and clearly continues to influence his political postures.
Although California has remained under Democrat party control – in significant part consequent to “rank choice” voting policies – during the recent presidential election there was a clear shift and momentum toward the Republican party across the majority of the state.
California has a very large dairy industry, and I know that a leader in and representative of that industry has close connections to Newsom. The presence of the virus in Southern California dairy farms is widespread, with over 300 dairy herds testing positive in the last 30 days
Has the threat assessment circa July 2024 changed? Let’s revisit the basics:
Disease severity continues to be mild, with the exception of one new case which apparently triggered Newsom to declare a state of emergency in California.
According to Newsweek, “A person in Louisiana was hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms from a bird flu infection, according to state health officials. The patient had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock, according to the CDC. Louisiana health officials said the patient is older than 65 and has underlying medical conditions.”
Here is the current CDC threat summary
READ: Biden HHS extends immunity for COVID shot manufacturers through 2029
The CDC charts above document that the risk of H5 in humans is low, disease severity is low, and although massive testing has occurred, there are only 61 total “exposure” sources found from cattle, birds, and other mammals.
There are a total of three human cases picked up from the CDC flu surveillance program since February 25, 2024, and a total of 58 cases in the U.S., after testing almost 10,000 people who were exposed to infected animals.
In sum, the profile of disease severity has not changed since July 2024. As opposed to initial reporting from corporate media, dark warnings from the WHO and Dr. Tedros, and the apocalyptic mutterings of Dr. Peter Hotez, there continues to be no evidence indicating the circulation of a highly pathogenic version of this virus in either animal or human populations.
All reported U.S. transmission events involve human exposure in the context of intensive contact during animal husbandry or other known animal hosts, indicating that the mechanism of transmission remains intensive exposure to infected animals and animal carcasses. No change from July 2024.
No evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, now or in the past with this currently circulating variant.
This appears to be the crux of Newsom’s alarmist response involving the declaration of a “State of Emergency” for bird flu in California. A statement from the governor’s office characterized the move as a “proactive action to strengthen robust state response” to avian influenza A (H5N1), also known as bird flu.
“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,” Newsom said in a statement. “Building on California’s testing and monitoring system – the largest in the nation – we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information.”
He added, “While the risk to the public remains low, we will continue to take all necessary steps to prevent the spread of this virus.”
This statement demonstrates either a profound ignorance of the mechanism by which animal influenza viruses spread, including avian influenza, or the presence of a hidden agenda. With a wide range of animal reservoirs, including migratory waterfowl, there is no way that the state of California can prevent the spread of this virus.

There has been no significant change in the current threat assessment associated with Avian Influenza relative to July 2024. The CDC, which has recently been implicated in industrial-scale “PsyWar” deployment of psychological bioterrorism regarding COVID and has an organizational conflict of interest in promoting vaccines and vaccine uptake, characterizes the current public health risk as low.
My conclusion regarding the Newsom declaration of a “State of Emergency” for bird flu in California is that it is being driven by a hidden agenda. There are multiple hypotheses regarding what that hidden agenda may be, but Newsom’s statement that, “Building on California’s testing and monitoring system – the largest in the nation – we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information,” suggests that this declaration may, at a minimum, reflect advocacy by and for California’s infectious disease testing industry, which includes both academic and commercial components.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/fact-checking-fortune-has-polio-vaccine-saved-20-million-children-from-paralysis,Fact-checking Fortune: Has Polio Vaccine Saved 20 Million Children from Paralysis?,By Staff | The Defender,2 months ago,"Editor’s note: This is article part of a series of articles by The Defender responding to the latest media coverage of vaccines, triggered by the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
A Dec. 13 article in Fortune called the polio vaccine used in the U.S. today “not only safe but also effective.”
The article also claimed that because 3 billion children have been vaccinated against polio since 1988, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, that means “20 million people who would’ve otherwise been paralyzed by polio are walking today.”
How accurate is the 20 million figure?
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) website, in 1988, there were 350,000 reported polio cases worldwide in a global population of 5.1 billion people. If, as the WHO website states, “One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis,” that would amount to 1,750 cases of irreversible paralysis linked to polio in 1988.
Using that figure — 1,750 cases in 1988 — and factoring in 1.2% annual population growth, the estimated number of cases of irreversible paralysis between 1988 and 2024 would total approximately 80,910 — not 20 million, as Fortune reported.
Here are four other facts about polio vaccines the Fortune article doesn’t address.
1. Polio vaccines used in U.S. don’t prevent infection or transmission.
According to Fortune, the polio vaccine is “safe and effective.” Here’s why that statement oversimplifies the issue of polio vaccines and leads to misleading conclusions.
There are two kinds of polio vaccines used in the world today, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They are the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and the oral polio vaccine (OPV).
The OPV is used for mass vaccination campaigns of children outside the U.S., as was recently done in Gaza. However, the U.S. exclusively uses IPV polio vaccines, according to the CDC.
The IPV products, which are injected, contain an inactivated — or dead — poliovirus. According to the CDC, the IPV protects against “severe disease caused by poliovirus” but “does not stop transmission.”
According to the Polio Global Eradication Initiative, the IPV also doesn’t prevent infection.
Two stand-alone IPV products are licensed in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Both are manufactured by Sanofi. The other five are combination vaccines that target polio plus other illnesses, including diptheria, pertussis and tetanus.
One of the two stand-alone IPV products, Poliovax, was discontinued. The FDA page on licensed polio vaccines doesn’t explain why.
That leaves IPOL as the sole stand-alone polio vaccine licensed in the U.S.
2. Global polio vaccine campaigns can lead to ‘vaccine-derived’ polio outbreaks.
As its name suggests, the “oral polio” vaccine, or OPV — used only outside the U.S. — is delivered orally. The OPV contains a weakened vaccine-virus that activates an immune response in the body, according to the WHO.
Unlike the IPV products used in the U.S., the OPV prevents transmission, according to the CDC and the WHO. However, the weakened vaccine-virus used in the OPV can cause polio variant outbreaks.
The CDC states that the U.S. stopped using OPV “to eliminate the risk of polio variants that can occur with OPV.”
According to the WHO, the continued use of the OPV “poses a risk to wiping out the disease” because the weakened vaccine-virus originally contained in the OPV can begin to circulate among people who didn’t get the vaccine.
“When this happens,” the WHO said, “if it is allowed to circulate for sufficiently long enough time, it may genetically revert to a ‘strong’ virus, able to cause paralysis, resulting in what is known as circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses.”
Vaccine-derived polioviruses were responsible for the recently reported cases of polio in Gaza and the 2022 case reported in New York.
In March 2023, seven children were paralyzed by vaccine-derived polio linked to the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) developed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, according to healthofficials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
In other words, the viral infections in these cases resulted from exposure to the vaccine-virus used in the OPV — not from exposure to a naturally occurring, or “wild,” strain of the poliovirus.
The last wild poliovirus case reported in the U.S. was in 1979, according to the CDC.
3. Risk of paralysis from poliovirus infection is roughly 0.001%.
Approximately 90-95% of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic, according to the FDA package insertfor IPOL, the only stand-alone IPV product used in the U.S. The package insert also provides general information on polio, including this:
“Nonspecific illness with low-grade fever and sore throat (minor illness) occurs in 4% to 8% of infections. Aseptic meningitis occurs in 1% to 5% of patients a few days after the minor illness has resolved.
“Rapid onset of asymmetric acute flaccid paralysis occurs in 0.1% to 2% of infections, and residual paralytic disease involving motor neurons (paralytic poliomyelitis) occurs in approximately 1 per 1,000 infections.”
In other words, according to the FDA, the risk of becoming paralyzed as a result of a poliovirus infection is roughly 0.001%.
4. All polio vaccines used today are genetically modified.
Unlike the original polio vaccines developed in the early 1950s by Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr. Albert Sabin, the IPV and OPV being administered today are genetically modified.
In 2020, the WHO authorized a new genetically modified OPV for emergency use in polio outbreaks. According to a 2023 article in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, nOPV2 was developed through a global partnership between public health, governmental, philanthropic and nonprofit organizations, including the Gates Foundation.
IPOL, the only stand-alone polio vaccine used in the U.S., uses technology that involves growing the poliovirus on monkey kidney cells whose chromones were modified to cause them to multiply forever.
In 2022, attorney Aaron Siri, on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network, petitioned the FDAto “withdraw or suspend the approval for IPOL for infants, toddlers, and children until a properly controlled and properly powered double-blind trial of sufficient duration is conducted to assess the safety of this product.”
The petition stated that modified monkey kidney cells “are susceptible to infection by dozens of viruses, including HPV, measles, rubella, reovirus, SV40 virus, and SV-5.”
According to the petition, Sanofi’s IPOL vaccine hasn’t been adequately proven safe because the clinical trials relied on for licensing the product did not include a control group and declared the vaccine safe after following the trial participants for up to only  three days after injection.
The FDA has not withdrawn or suspended its approval of IPOL as requested by Siri, and the agency continues to rely on the existing clinical trials and the agency’s own safety assessment lasting only up to three days.
The CDC recommends children receive four doses of IPOL, starting at age 2 months. The second dose is given at 4 months. The third is given at 6-18 months, and the fourth is given anytime between 4 and 6 years.",0

In an 𝕏 thread about the incoming Donald Trump administration and the new Congress, Paul suggested the “power” granted to American politicians “must be used for good – like putting Fauci in jail.”
“Fauci actually had an overlap with another project of mine….not only was he the COVID villain, but he was also involved in animal testing — IN PUPPIES. You could not make up a more evil government employee,” the senator added.
Paul released his 2024 “Festivus” Report on Monday, calculating a whopping $1,008,313,329,626.12 in government waste spent on ridiculous projects.
In another 𝕏 thread, this time highlighting his Festivus findings, the Kentucky politician questioned where he should begin with airing his grievances.
He wrote, “It’s hard to decide where to start this year. Fauci? Maybe. He may be gone, but he’s not forgotten.”
Continuing to focus on Fauci, Paul said last year he hoped Congress “would hold Dr. Fauci accountable,” but that instead, “he’s still walking around a free man.”
“Well, he’s got two new major problems for Christmas this year — I’m the incoming chairman of the Senate HSGAC committee, and I have subpoena power to force him to turn over everything he’s been hiding,” he stated.
Paul went on to note his “good friend Robert F. Kennedy Jr.” will happily receive the subpoena for Fauci-related documents when he files requests in the coming months.
Hear from Senator Paul last year explaining why he believes Fauci should be in jail.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/studies-link-vaccines-to-autism,Studies Link Vaccines to Autism,By Lance D Johnson | Natural News,2 months ago,"In recent years, the incidence of autism has skyrocketed among children, with some parents seeing a rapid decline in responsiveness, speech and cognitive abilities after their child receives a series of vaccines. The most terrifying suspect in this public health crisis is the medical establishment’s blind faith in vaccines. For years, medical professionals have repeatedly claimed that vaccines do not cause autism. This blind faith is not backed up by the scientific literature, however. Vaccines are known to contain neurotoxic substances such as mercury and aluminum, and studies continue to show how this leads to brain damage in children.
One particularly alarming study, published in the journal Neural Development, evaluated the relationship between Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism diagnoses. Thimerosal, a compound that contains nearly 50% mercury by weight, has been extensively used as a preservative in various vaccines. The study, conducted in two phases, observed a significantly increased risk ratio for the incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) following vaccinations containing Thimerosal. A hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-testing study design confirmed that children exposed to Thimerosal in hepatitis B vaccines had a greater likelihood of developing ASD, highlighting the possible link between Thimerosal exposure and autism.
Another study, published in the Journal of Toxicology, found a positive and statistically significant association between the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations and the prevalence of autism or speech and language impairments (Source 2). The analysis showed that for every 1% increase in vaccination rates, an additional 680 children per state were diagnosed with autism or speech and language impairments. This correlation raises serious concerns about the potential role of vaccines in the development of autism.
In addition to the possible role of mercury, other studies have pointed to aluminum as a potential culprit. A study published in Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry applied Hill’s criteria to investigate whether exposure to aluminum adjuvants in vaccines could contribute to the rising prevalence of autism. The findings showed that countries with the highest exposure to aluminum adjuvants in vaccines also had the highest prevalence of ASD. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the amount of aluminum in the vaccines and the current prevalence of ASD in seven Western countries, particularly at the 3-4-month mark, when many vaccines are administered.
Moreover, there is evidence suggesting a connection between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. A study published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology found that autistic children harbored elevated levels of MMR antibodies and had a strong association between MMR antibodies and myelin basic protein (MBP) auto antibodies, which are linked to central nervous system autoimmunity.
The impact of vaccines on male neonates is also of concern. A study published in Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment showed that U.S. male neonates vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine prior to 1999 had a threefold higher risk for autism diagnosis compared to boys not vaccinated during that period. Moreover, non-white boys were found to be at a greater risk. This suggests that the effects of vaccines on different ethnic groups may vary, and further research is necessary to understand these differences.
The potential link between vaccines and autism has sparked intense debate, with many parents and scientists questioning the safety of the current vaccine schedule. The expression of systemic failure, sensory dysfunction, and autoimmune issues in children diagnosed with regressive autism raises the question of whether these symptoms are the result of subtle DNA alterations caused by the overuse of vaccines, as explained in a study published in the North American Journal of Medical Sciences.
The scientific evidence linking vaccines to autism cannot be ignored. As research continues to emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that further investigation into the safety and long-term effects of vaccines is critical. The potential risks associated with their ingredients must be thoroughly examined to ensure the well-being of future generations.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-may-quit-world-health-organization-on-trumps-first-day-report,US May Quit World Health Organization on Trump’s First Day – Report,By RT,2 months ago,"The transition team of US President-elect Donald Trump hopes to pull the country out of the World Health Organization (WHO) the first day of the new administration, thus cutting one of the agency’s major cash flows, the Financial Times (FT) has reported, citing health experts.
Members of Trump’s team told the experts that they intend to announce a withdrawal from the global health body on inauguration day, January 20, the FT wrote on Sunday. Some in the team reportedly want the US to stay in the WHO but push to reform it. However, another group, which hopes to cut ties, is reportedly winning the argument.
The transition team wants Trump to withdraw from the WHO on the first day because of the “symbolism” of reversing Joe Biden’s own inauguration-day move, FT wrote, citing Ashish Jha, former White House Covid response coordinator to the US President.
On January 20, 2021, Biden restarted relations with the UN body, after his then-predecessor Trump initiated a withdrawal process in line with his criticism of the WHO’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
”America is going to leave a huge vacuum in global health financing and leadership. I see no one that is going to fill the breach,” Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health at Georgetown Law told FT. The plan to withdraw “on day one” would be “catastrophic”, he added.
The WHO is a UN body that acts as a coordinating authority on international health issues. The agency gets its funding from dues-paying member states as well as voluntary contributions. The US has been one of the organization’s largest donors for decades, and, according to its data, is currently the second-largest contributor among its member states.
In 2020, Trump accused the WHO of being under China’s control amid the coronavirus pandemic. The president claimed that Beijing had pressured the organization to “mislead the world” about the virus and pledged to direct US funds to other global public health charities instead.
Under a 1948 Congressional resolution, the US can withdraw from the WHO but must give a year’s notice and should pay outstanding fees. The Trump team, however, did not comment directly on the potential withdrawal, noted FT.
In November, Trump nominated long-time vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy to become US Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). RFK Jr. was among the vocal critics of the WHO-recommended Covid-19 response measures imposed by governments around the world, namely strict lockdowns and the introduction of rapidly developed vaccines.
Kennedy’s nomination has yet to be approved by the Senate.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/plant-based-meat-linked-to-depression,“Plant-based Meat” Linked to Depression,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"Consumption of processed “plant-based meat” alternatives is linked to a significantly increased risk of depression, according to a new study of the eating habits of vegetarians.
The study, published in the journal Food Frontiers, found that vegetarians who consume “plant-based meat” alternatives have a 42% increased risk of depression compared to vegetarians who don’t eat them.
Researchers also found a link between “plant-based meat”and biomarkers of high blood pressure and inflammation, an immune response which, if unchecked, can cause various chronic health conditions.
“Plant-based meats” were once held up as the “future of food,” a health-, animal- and planet-friendly alternative to traditional meat, but in recent years manufacturers like Beyond and Impossible have seen their sales and share prices slump.
Consumer enthusiasm for these ersatz products has dried up and research has undermined their claims to be good for consumers and the planet. Consumer research has shown that customers know plant-based alternatives are not better for them and that they don’t taste better than the real thing.
A 2021 survey of Australian men suggested that over 70 percent of them would rather die ten years sooner than give up eating meat.
After multiple rounds of layoffs last year, Impossible was forced to take out a full-page ad in The New York Times to rebuff claims their product is just a “fad.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/popular-tea-bags-release-millions-of-microplastics-into-liquid,Popular Tea Bags Release Billions of Microplastics,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"Popular tea bags made from polymer fibres release huge quantities of toxic micro- and nanoplastics into the liquid while they’re brewing, according to a new study.
Researchers brewed tea using popular tea bags made from the polymers nylon-6, polypropylene and cellulose and measured levels of plastic particles in the tea.
Polypropylene was showed to release approximately 1.2 billion plastic particles per milliliter of liquid. Cellulose released about 135 million particles per milliliter and nylon-6 8.8 million particles per milliliter.
The researchers then tested the collected plastic particles to see how they interacted with cells in the human digestive system. They showed that mucus-producing intestinal cells had the highest uptake of micro- and nanoplastics. Particles were even able to enter the cell nucleus, which stores the cell’s genetic material.
Microplastics have been linked to more or less all of the prevailing chronic diseases of modernity, from respiratory diseases to digestive conditions like IBS, heart disease and even neurological and behavioral conditions like autism.
More than nine billion tons of plastic are estimated to have been produced between 1950 and 2017, with over half of that total having been produced since 2004. The vast majority of plastic ends up in the environment in one form or another, where it breaks down, through weathering, exposure to UV light and organisms of all kinds, into smaller and smaller pieces—microplastics and then nanoplastics. These are “secondary” microplastics, because they start off big and end up small. “Primary” microplastics are small by design, like so-called “microbeads” used in cosmetics.
Within our homes, microplastics are mainly produced when synthetic fibres from clothes, furnishings and carpets are shed. They accumulate in large quantities in dust and float around in the air, which we then inhale.
If you want to learn more about microplastics, the potential health consequences of exposure, and what you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones, read our detailed primer, “The Microplastic Menace.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/monkey-see-monkey-do,"Monkey See, Monkey Do",By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"On Tuesday this week, Nathan Mahoney, 32, of Walker, Michigan, walked into a conference room at Anderson Express Inc. and stabbed his boss. No warning.
Mahoney fled the scene and was apprehended a day later. He’s now being held on a $500,000 bond for attempted murder.
The victim, Erik Denslow, was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition. He’s expected to survive.
The case is puzzling. Mahoney had only been working at the company, a manufacturer, for a few weeks, and little about his background—at least as far as we know—suggests an obvious motive for the attempted killing.
But the timing—now there’s a potential clue.
One clear avenue of investigation, the cops say, is that this was a copycat assassination attempt, the model being Luigi Mangione, who brutally gunned down the CEO of insurer United Healthcare in New York, nearly three weeks ago.
The motivation for the killing of Brian Thompson, we’re told, was anger at the medical industry, after Mangione had botched spinal surgery; although it’s worth noting that neither Mangione, nor any member of his family, appears to have used United as an insurer. The target was simply, as far as we know, a representative of what the killer believed to be an unfair industry, an industry that had robbed him of his money, his health and even his ability to have sex, and does the same or worse to thousands of others.
The similarities between the Mangione and Mahoney cases are twofold at this stage. We have the type of target (“boss”) and a similar approach—cold, dispassionate, in from the side / behind. An assassin’s approach, even if Mahoney failed to kill his target.
The copycat theory is credible. But it’s still speculation.
Maybe Mahoney was having a very bad day at the office and snapped?
Maybe he got the wrong loot box on his favourite pay-to-play online shooter and decided to take out his frustration on someone else? People are strange.
Copycat or not, the Mahoney case should alert us to the very real possibility that others will imitate Mangione. And not just one or two either.
Indeed, the Mangione case could serve as a template for leftist “resistance” during the second Trump term: individual rather than collective, specifically targeted rather than diffuse, and, of course, violent.
As far as I’m concerned, I think this is certain to happen. I say this because the left, as an organized movement or series of movements, has simply run out of steam. Even Axios are saying so: “The Resistance Goes Quiet” was the headline a few weeks ago to a story that detailed the left’s collective exhaustion in the wake of Trump’s victory.
It probably won’t have escaped your notice that the leftist response to Trump’s victory was nothing like 2016. There were protests, sure, but they were so low-energy and so poorly attended it was hard not to feel a tinge of pity.
The realisation that eight years of mass mobilization against Trump has resulted in a bigger, badder version of Trump getting elected with an even broader mandate and the support of the world’s richest man (who now owns Twitter)—that must be crushing, frankly.
In short, mass mobilisation against Trump has failed.
And so what does that leave? Well, one thing it leaves is individual action. The man against the system. The lone wolf. Robin Hood—without the Merry Men.
That’s precisely how Mangione is being portrayed right now: as Robin Hood, a folk hero.
There’s been plenty of praise for Mangione on account of his boyish good looks and chiselled abs. We also know some funny things happen downstairs for the so-called fairer sex when a man becomes a killer—just peer inside Ted Bundy’s mailbag if you don’t believe me. But we shouldn’t be fooled by any of the flippant stuff we see on social media about Luigi Mangione. There’s a genuine depth of feeling that goes far, far beyond the ephemeral and the horny.
An image circulated on Twitter of Mangione as a Catholic saint, halo and all. The picture is hanging in a pizza joint in Mangione’s hometown. People are dressing up as Luigi from the Super Mario Brothers and discoursing to the assembled media and anyone who’ll listen about the iniquities of the American healthcare system. TikTok has been awash with videos of leftists promising further retribution for bosses and CEOs and company owners.
The Mangione model, if you like, will be popular not just because of the absence of satisfaction to be found in leftist mass movements in the years to come, but also because it gives license to the widespread and utterly retarded worldview in which a small number of fat cats, plutocrats, call them what you will, control everything and fix the world in their favour. This worldview is prevalent on the left, but it’s also found on the right too.
Just kill these rich people and everything will be okay!
In truth, if you wanted to fix America’s healthcare system, you’d be MAGA at this point. You’d be willing RFK Jr. to go all the way and gut the Food and Drug Administration, end the revolving-door culture between regulators and industry, eliminate the vaccine schedule, get the fluoride out of the water, stop Americans eating processed food, and so on.
There’s corruption in America’s healthcare system all right, but it’s not a bunch of Monopoly Men in top hats diving into swimming pools filled with drug money. It’s a system that favours corporations over the American people, that allows products to be introduced to the market on the basis of nonexistent safety testing and treats problems with ad-hoc “solutions” that don’t address the underlying causes and instead create more problems that are then treated with more ad-hoc “solutions” and so on, in a kind of endless medical regress.
But these people—the people dressing up as Luigi—don’t want that system to change. They don’t want America to be healthy again. They want Ozempic and they want it for free.
Leftists also want to feel powerful again. Luigi Mangione showed them they can do that—even if their actions, in truth, change nothing.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/nearly-half-of-non-terminally-ill-canadians-who-choose-euthanasia-say-they-are-lonely,Nearly Half of Non-Terminally Ill Canadians Who Choose Euthanasia say They Are Lonely,By Anthony Murdoch | Lifesite,2 months ago,"OTTAWA, Ontario (LifeSiteNews) — Official government data shows that about half of Canadians who are not terminally ill yet wanted to end their lives via state-sanctioned assisted suicide did so last year because they said they were lonely.
According to data published by Health Canada on December 11 in its fifth annual report on medical assistance in dying (MAiD), 15,342 people were approved for and died by euthanasia in 2023.
A total of 14,721 of these deaths were in cases where illness or disability were likely down the road or considered “reasonably foreseeable.” These are called Track 1 MAiD deaths.
However, 662 deaths were people who were not dying. Of these Track 2 deaths, 47.1 percent cited as reasons for wanting to die “isolation or loneliness.” By comparison, about 21.1 percent of Track 1 deaths reported the same feelings for wanting to die by doctor-led suicide.
The report stated that “social isolation and loneliness are shown to have a serious impact on physical and mental health, quality of life, and longevity.”
Of the Track 2 deaths, 35.7 percent lived alone, compared with 30.2 percent of Track 1 deaths. Of Track 1 deaths, the average age was 77.7 years. The average age of Track 2 deaths was 75.
Of note is that this year’s Health Canada report on MAiD is the first to include so-called “verbal” requests from individuals as official. Previously, those who wanted to die via assisted suicide had to submit a form to Health Canada in order to be officially recorded as a request to die by suicide.
Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal government legalized MAiD in 2016, the deadly program has continued to relax its rules on who is eligible for death.
As reported by LifeSiteNews, 1 in 20 Canadian deaths in 2023 came from assisted suicide.
Instances of people being offered MAiD as a solution to their health issues have become commonplace in Canada, as reported by LifeSiteNews.
Last week, LifeSiteNews reported how a senior Canadian couple said that a hospice care center presented euthanasia to one of them as an option because they could not afford increased care costs on their fixed income.
Canadian pro-life leaders have criticized the Trudeau government’s continued push for expanding MAiD.
Indeed, most Canadians fear the nation’s euthanasia regime unfairly targets those who are financially and socially vulnerable while still supporting the immoral practice in general.
In 2021, the program expanded from killing only terminally ill patients to allowing the chronically ill to qualify. Since then, the government has sought to include those suffering solely from mental illness.
The number of Canadians killed by lethal injection under the nation’s MAiD program since 2016 stands at close to 65,000, with an estimated 16,000 deaths in 2023 alone. Many fear that because the official statistics are manipulated the number may be even higher.
Canada had approximately 15,280 euthanasia deaths in 2023.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/confirmed-the-cia-did-not-take-the-mandatory-covid-19-vaccines,Confirmed! The CIA Did NOT Take The Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccines,By Destiny Rezendes,2 months ago,"With Dr. Fauci perched over Biden’s left shoulder & Kamala over his right the President signed Executive Order 14043 on September 9, 2021, requiring approximately 5.82 million Americans to be fully vaccinated by November 16, 2021.
The executive order’s compliance included:
These individuals had to receive either two doses of an mRNA vaccine (plus two weeks) or one dose of Johnson & Johnson (plus two weeks).
In my community near the nation’s largest Navy base, panic and outrage grew over the mandate, which involved a vaccine that had been available to the public for less than a year [ 337 days.]
Suspecting many federal employees might not comply, I waited a week after the compliance deadline before submitting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the CIA on November 27, 2021, asking for their COVID-19 vaccination compliance data.
**Reminder- By the time I had submitted the request they had already been one week past the required deadline for vaccine compliance. **
The time between when the CIA had to be in compliance with the EO and the date when they told me there were no responsive records was 1,116 days, or 3 years and 20 days. In that same time frame, it was reported that 98% of those 5.82 million mandated Americans did receive the COVID-19 vaccines.
OpenVaers Red Box Summaries for COVID-19 Vaccines
The VAERS system, owned and operated jointly by the FDA & the CDC has millions of adverse event reports that include over 38,000 deaths, 28,769 cases of Myocarditis/Pericarditis and 72,492 reports of Permanent Disability following the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine. Now the people are seeing sudden onset of cancers, & aggressive recurrences of cancers that were previously in remission throughout the country.
Did the CIA know how dangerous the injections were & rather than doing the right thing they just stayed silent while watching millions of Americans get poisoned? If so, then why did the CIA’s venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel get involved in funding a new CDMO vaccine manufacturing company called, Government Resilience Services which had announced that they would manufacture the COVID-19 vaccines for Moderna on September 8, 2021 one day before President Biden would sign the Executive order mandating the vaccines?
I am of course going to appeal this “final response” from the CIA but at the current moment I interpret their determination as an admission that the CIA staff did not comply. If there are no records of vaccination within the CIA concerning COVID-19 then they either did not comply or they utilized a verbal reporting system as a means of receipt of vaccine for the entire staff. Both possibilities are completely unacceptable especially in the face of the thousands of Americans who lost; their careers, and livelihoods or even worse those who complied and were subsequently injured due to the C19 injections.
“Rules for thee but not for me ” is the same theme of governance that our forefathers fled in order to found this great country. Ultimately I think the timing of this response reflects strongly the fear the current administration has knowing that big changes are imminent due to the incoming administration. Had they made me wait until 2026 they know they’d likely be forced by the new leadership to release the records which likely would have shown the CIA’s lack of compliance thus leaving them vulnerable to accountability and repercussions. Being seemingly allergic to accountability they tried to hush up my request before having to face the music.
Where is the outcry for justice or adherence to the color of law? What difference is this from the tyranny of socialist countries?

California Declares State Of Emergency After CDC Reports First ‘Severe’ Case Of Bird Flu,By Kelen McBreen,2 months ago,"Democrat California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Wednesday after learning the H5N1 bird flu virus reportedly spread to Southern California dairy herds, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first U.S. “severe” case of illness related to the virus.
A 65-year-old Louisiana resident with underlying health conditions was hospitalized this week after contracting the virus due to exposure to “sick and dead birds in back yard flocks,” according to the CDC.
On Wednesday, doctors announced the first case of a person infected with the virus in the state of Wisconsin.
Newsom’s focus appears to be on expanding the technocratic surveillance state now used to monitor potential pandemic breakouts, saying, “Building on California’s testing and monitoring system — the largest in the nation — we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information. While the risk to the public remains low, we will continue to take all necessary steps to prevent the spread of this virus.”
The Los Angeles Times reports the Louisiana hospitalization is “a concerning development as the virus continues to spread throughout the nation via migrating birds.”
This is an interesting remark as the Russian government has long warned the United States is conducting secret bioweapons research specifically focusing on spreading bird flu viruses via migrating birds.
What’s fascinating about the Kremlin claims is that the main man promoting the theory was Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia’s chemical and biological defense force, who was killed in a massive explosion when a bomb was detonated as he left a residential apartment building in Moscow on Tuesday.
Popular 𝕏 account @WarClandestine pointed out this fact on Wednesday, explaining that in May 2023, “General Kirillov claimed Russia MIL obtained samples of deadly Avian Influenza, also known as BIRD FLU, from a conquered US DoD lab in the Kherson region, that could jump species, with a 40% kill rate in humans… Coincidence that Kirillov was just assassinated, and now CDC reports that Bird Flu is jumping to humans and causing states of emergencies? Too many connecting dots to be a coincidence.”

Infowars reported on a June 2023 briefing by Kirillov where he claimed the Russian military found evidence of a Department of Defense (DOD) program in Ukraine studying migration routes of birds and selecting strains of avian influenza virus with high epidemic potential to spread disease in Russia.
Kirillov connected the experiments to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is partnered with the Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and its contractor Metabiota, a company that was founded with funding by Hunter Biden’s investment firm Rosemont Seneca.
In January of 2023, U.S. National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby confirmed that “a number of American scientific programs” existed in Ukraine, but maintained that they were “deactivated” and abandoned by the staff in early 2022 when Russia invaded the country.
In 2021, the very first bird-to-human transmission of bird flu ever recorded just happened to take place in Russia.
By April 2022, the first human case of the virus was reported in the United States.
Two years later, in April 2024, the virus was found in cattle for the first time and the first cow-to-human case was discovered in connection with a person in Texas.
“We had not seen avian flu in cattle prior to last week. That is new,” CDC Director Mandy Cohen told the Washington Post following the news. “It is a reservoir for [the] virus to circulate and potentially change.”
The Daily Mail spoke with Big Pharma insider John Fulton about the outbreak, with Fulton telling the outlet, “This appears to be 100 times worse than COVID — or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate.”
Earlier this week, health officials in Los Angeles investigated several house cats that died after allegedly drinking raw milk carrying the virus.
The University of Maryland published an article earlier this year titled, “Researcher Warns Pet Cats Risk Getting Bird Flu and Possibly Infecting People.”
The concept is nearly identical to an episode of The Simpsons where “House Cat Flu” wreaks havoc on Springfield after being intentionally released by a shadowy group of elites.
The Simpsons predict the current phoney baloney public health ""crisis"" – House Cat Flu! 😹 pic.twitter.com/zH6W90gjmV
Meanwhile, in a scenario strikingly similar to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. and Chinese governments have been working together on avian flu gain-of-function research, which makes the bird flu viruses more infectious for humans.
“The main collaborators on the project are USDA Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute – a Wuhan lab partner,” the Daily Mail wrote in February.
“Additionally, one of the researchers collaborating on the project is Wenju Liu, who is affiliated with the WIV – which is believed to have sparked the Covid pandemic – and a member of the board of a scientific journal, working with Zheng-Li Shi, who is known as the ‘bat lady’ for her extensive work on bat coronaviruses.”
“Where have we seen this before? U.S. collaborates with China to make bird flu more contagious and transmissible to mammals. bird flu now discovered in U.S. dairy cattle, transmitted to at least one human being. Knock it off already!” Republican Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie wrote in April.

Infowars founder Alex Jones pointed out Wednesday that Big Pharma vaccine scientist Dr. Peter Hotez recently made the eerie declaration that “a new pandemic will come crashing down on the new Trump administration on Jan. 21st.”
Hotez specifically said a bird flu could spark the next global pandemic.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/top-covid-lawyer-exposes-spending-bill-as-pandemic-power-grab-framework,Top Covid Lawyer Exposes Spending Bill as Pandemic Power Grab Framework,By Sean Miller,2 months ago,"Tom Renz, an attorney who’s represented plaintiffs battling the Covid PCR tests and Covid vaccine mandates has analyzed and commented on the 1,547-page Continuing Resolution (CR) funding package. According to the lawyer’s analysis, the bill is packed with provisions that allow a pandemic power-grab.
“Congressional spending bill is a big pharma gift extending and expanding COVID emergency powers to other pandemics and even reiterating mRNA vaccine immunity!” Renz said in a social media post Wednesday. “We are evaluating the details of this 1500+ page monstrosity but it dramatically expands federal power for plandemic response and funds it all further. This bill WILL set up for the next plandemic and potentially make the next response even worse than the response to COVID. More soon…”
Renz also concurred with the editor-in-chief of Vigilant News regarding their analysis of the bill.
“Congress’s new spending bill TURBOCHARGES Covid-like powers for future pandemics,” Vigilant News’ editor-in-chief said in a social media post Wednesday. “This includes mask mandates, vaccine passports, expanded emergency health powers, gain-of-function research, and even liability shields for mRNA vaccine makers.”
On Wednesday Renz hosted a live stream where he went through the pandemic power-grabs of the bill as well.
Internet censorship was a key attribute of the Covid operation. Renz revealed that the bill has provisions for censorship networks.
“Speaker Mike Johnson’s spending bill continues funding for the State Department’s Global Engagement Center. This is the branch of the State Department that works with foreign governments and NGOs to censor Americans,” Renz said in a social media post Wednesday.
Expanded legal immunity to deleterious vaccine effects is also included in the bill, in addition to the aforementioned pandemic powers and internet censorship, Renz said.
“This bill WILL expand vaccine immunity and EXPAND COVID lockdown powers to ALL plandemics while continuing to fund GEC Censorship,” Renz said in a social media post Wednesday.
Renz ironically discussed the pay raise Congress is granting itself within the very bill that reduces American’s civil liberties.
“Great news – Congress is giving themselves a pay raise in their funding bill,” Renz said in a social media post Wednesday. “The bill will also ensure that the federal government sets standards of care during an emergency… you know like using Remdesivir and vents to “treat” COVID patients. What could go wrong right? Who wants to thank Mike Johnson for his work?”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/dr-peter-breggin-vaccines-are-weapons-of-mass-destruction,Dr. Peter Breggin: Vaccines are Weapons of Mass Destruction,By Kevin Hughes | Natural News,2 months ago,"In a recent interview with the Health Ranger Mike Adams on the “Health Ranger Report,” renowned psychiatrist and mental health expert Dr. Peter Breggin warned of the far-reaching and detrimental effects of vaccines. He described them as weapons of mass destruction.
According to Breggin’s research, vaccines go beyond just causing autism. They inflict severe and varied brain damage, ranging from seizures and encephalitis to life-threatening reactions.
(Related: These SEVEN studies point to the inescapable conclusion: VACCINES DO CAUSE AUTISM and other chronic health conditions.)
Breggin, a leading voice in exposing psychiatric abuses and the dangers of lobotomies and electroshock therapy, explained that vaccines are causing generalized brain damage of every kind imaginable.
“The real issue is the vaccines cause generalized brain damage of every kind you can imagine,” Breggin said, adding that vaccines also cause fever, seizures, headaches, encephalitis, encephalopathy and symptoms of autism.
Research done by the veteran psychiatrist and author, which was published in 2021, analyzed reports of vaccine-related deaths submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Within the first three years, Breggin found 20,000 reports of deaths linked to vaccines, a staggering figure that he believes is just the tip of the iceberg.
Furthermore, Breggin revealed that doctors were actively discouraged from reporting any adverse effects of the vaccines, especially during the height of the pandemic. In California, doctors were even warned that they might be thrown out of the medical community if they spoke about potential vaccine side effects to their patients.
Based on these reports and Breggin’s own research, he estimated that at least two million deaths in the United States alone can be attributed to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, a number that could climb significantly higher when unreported cases are factored in. As Breggin explored the implications of these alarming statistics, he uncovered evidence of a concerted effort by powerful medical institutions to conceal the truth.
Adams mentioned the establishment is gearing up for another plandemic, warning that they will push people into another wave of new vaccines. The Health Ranger also took note of the bird flu scare and the scary stories out of Africa about new pandemics coming. He then turned to Breggin, asking him if the next pandemic would be hyped in the same manner as what people saw in late 2019 and early 2020.
“The vaccines have been the cutting edge of oppression since 2020,” remarked Breggin. “This was a weapon of destruction, with the U.S. taking the hardest hit. It’s being used as a weapon of terror and harm.”
Credible estimates suggest that the COVID vaccines alone may have caused the deaths of at least 1.5 million Americans, with many more suffering severe and permanent injuries, but according to Breggin it could be more than two million. The implications of Breggin’s warnings are staggering, raising serious questions about the motives behind vaccination programs and the future of human health.
“The globalist attempt to run the whole globe is to scare everybody and to depopulate as much as possible. This goes way back, and it’s always been a goal of those who seek power and get power that they want fewer people to deal with.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/maine-high-school-plans-to-give-students-birth-control-in-secretive-health-center,Maine High School Plans to Give Students Birth Control in Secretive ‘Health Center’,By Matt Lamb | Lifesite,2 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — While parents and other citizens are rightly concerned with the curricula in schools and the books in their libraries, another threat to parental rights and the wellbeing of minors exists in “school-based health centers.”
The Daily Signal highlights an issue with one such proposal in Maine, where a high school would operate a center that could give out abortifacient birth control.
The Maine School Administrative District 11 would “provide confidential ‘mental health, reproductive health, and substance use’ care to minors who ‘demonstrate decision-making capacity,’” according to The Daily Signal.
While the district does not currently plan to offer transgender drugs, the news outlet notes that Maine law allows 16-year-olds to get these substances without parental approval.
Some may assume that the health centers must get parental consent before prescribing birth control. After all, while a school could be empowered to provide emergency first aid, such as if a student drops a beaker and gets cut during chemistry class, doesn’t it need to get permission before handing out birth control?
Not likely.
Stand for Health Freedom founder Leah Wilson spoke to LifeSiteNews last year about how these health centers minimize parental involvement.
She said the centers use “pre-consent” to operate without parental involvement, “which is simply a one-page consent form being sent home at the beginning of the year. And there’s language such as this that gives consent for your child to see any and all health care providers in this health center.” The pre-consent opens the door for “very dynamic encounters” that may take place “without further parental knowledge or notification being required,” as LifeSiteNews previously reported.
This, in fact, is what also HealthReach Community Health Centers does with their forms. The medical provider would operate the center inside the Maine high school, as it does at other schools in the state.
A sample “general consent” form opens the door for the same sort of blanket permission Wilson warned about.
Others do offer transgender drugs. As the industry already operates with lax standards and under “standards” developed under ethically dubious means, it follows that schools would be happy to help inject a child with transgender drugs without their parents knowing. After all, schools already try to hide a child’s transgender identification from parents, with some teachers offering special closets for students to get clothes for crossdressing during the school day.
As The Daily Signal reports:
…the San Lorenzo High School-Based Health Center in Ashland, California, offers access to “gender-affirming care,” including “chest binders, shapewear, etc.”; “information and counseling about transitioning”; and “gender-affirming hormone therapy and other types of medical transitioning services.”
Chicago Public Schools is also happy to help minor students as young as 12 get birth control and other “reproductive health” services, including abortion.
READ: The positive impact of a truly Christian culture cannot be overstated
The school district also has an explicit policy of hiding information from parents.
For example, a sample form about supporting gender-confused students, states:
School staff shall not disclose information that may reveal a student’s transgender status or gender nonconforming presentation to others. Therefore, given the sensitive nature of the information, when speaking with parents, guardians, other staff members, or third parties, school staff should not disclose a student’s preferred name, pronoun, or other confidential information pertaining to the student’s transgender or gender nonconforming status without the student’s permission, unless authorized to do so by the Chicago Board of Education’s Law Department.
In a “common pushback” document, the school district asserts students “have a right to privacy about their gender identity. It is never okay to talk to someone about a student’s gender identity, even their parent or caregiver, unless they have given explicit permission to do so.”
The same philosophy applies to killing preborn babies in the womb.
“There is no lower age limit and no parental notice requirement for minors accessing abortion care [sic] in Illinois,” the Chicago Public Schools website states. “By law, Medicaid cannot send home a bill or explanation of benefits for sexual health services.”
In other words, there is no way parents will find out what their kids are getting from the school. This is even dangerous because if someone has an adverse reaction to a vaccine or birth control given to them at school, parents have no way of knowing. They cannot communicate this information to emergency room staff, putting the child in danger of further harm.
However, there are ways to push back against these health centers to ensure children are protected.
First, focus on the medical problems of parents not knowing what medicine or injections their kids are getting. Even parents who might be fine in general with vaccines or birth control should still be concerned that a nurse is giving their child something without their knowledge.
Second, see if there is a way to reach the good goal of ensuring kids have access to wellness checks and basic medical care in a way that still protects parental consent. The general idea behind these centers is that some parents may not have time to take off work to take their kids for regular checkups, and this makes it more accessible to kids in lower-income or rural areas. But these goals could be accomplished through health clinics at the school on weekends or evenings, for example, when parents can be involved.
Finally, educate other parents about what a general consent form allows and see if there is a way to change the form so that consent is needed for vaccines or other provisions.
Parents and children deserve better than secretive medical care, and schools should not provide it.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/san-francisco-health-department-hires-obese-woman-to-promote-fatness-report,San Francisco Health Department Hires Obese Woman to Promote Fatness — Report,By Sean Miller,2 months ago,"The Health Department of San Francisco hired an obese woman named Virgie Tovar for the role of ‘weight stigma czar’ who’s job it will be to consult on ‘weight stigma and weight neutrality’, reports The Gateway Pundit.
Tovar, an influencer in the ‘fat positive’ movement is a self-described expert on ‘anti-weight-based discrimination’. She wrote the book ‘You Have the Right to Remain Fat’ which promotes obesity. She took to social media Tuesday to express her gratitude toward the new role.
“I’m UNBELIEVABLY proud to serve the city I’ve called home for almost 20 years in this way! This consultancy is an absolute dream come true, and it’s my biggest hope and belief that weight neutrality will be the future of public health,” Tovar said in a social media post Tuesday.
Tovar’s big message likely speaks to a massive group, as Infowars recently reported that 208 million Americans are now overweight or obese. Government economic policies force taxpayers to subsidize weight-gaining schemes while the victims of fatness experience higher annual medical care costs.

Being fat is not the only attribute Tovar promotes of herself. Her website describes her as a ‘plus-size Latina author’ who has built an ‘academic foundation at the intersections of body size, race and gender’.
Tovar’s not the only individual whose self-identity of obesity and skin color intersect into a political statement. Infowars reported on a morbidly obese BLM activist who was accused of defaming a student hired by the Dove Soap Company to promote ‘fat liberation’.
Leftwing outlets have lambasted a healthy bodyweight as racist. MSNBC reported that fitness is a trait of white supremacists while Time chronicled how evil white people invented exercise.
Any action to decrease the body mass of the obese is now met with ridicule and scorn by the Left. Infowars recently reported that Whoopi Goldberg claims RFK Jr. is ‘fat shaming’ people by pledging to make America healthy again.
While liberals are now embracing obesity, conservatives are now embracing a healthy, active lifestyle. Recently Alex Jones chronicled his rapid progress stemming from a vigorous exercise regimen and his dedication to hard work.

In a groundbreaking lawsuit, a 20-year-old woman named Kaya Clementine Breen has filed suit against California hospitals and doctors for what she describes as the way they “fast-tracked” her into a series of irreversible medical interventions that have left her physically, psychologically and socially scarred.
According to the complaint, Breen was subjected to a harrowing sequence of events at the tender age of 12. Her journey began when she shared with a school counselor that she felt uncomfortable with the prospect of developing into a woman. Instead of offering support, the counselor suggested that she must be transgender and contacted Breen’s parents to reinforce this belief. (Related: The war on gender biology: A globalist effort to divide and depopulate.)
Her parents, seeking help, took Breen to the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. There, Breen met Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, a prominent figure in the gender-transitioning of children.
Olson-Kennedy made a cursory diagnosis of gender dysphoria before recommending immediate intervention, including puberty-blocking medication.
The lawsuit alleges that Olson-Kennedy never conducted thorough mental health assessments or inquired about the early sexual abuse Breen had endured.
Instead, the doctor pressed Breen’s parents into believing that their daughter’s life depended on her beginning a hormonal transition. Breen’s parents, worried about their child’s well-being, agreed to the rapid and drastic procedures.
One of the most severe interventions described in the lawsuit is the double mastectomy Breen underwent at the age of 14, performed by Dr. Scott Mosser, a surgeon known for his work in gender-affirming surgeries.
Breen’s suit claims that Mosser met with her for only 30 minutes before the surgery, further highlighting the rushed nature of the procedures. Breen’s experience culminated in a series of irreversible medical alterations, which left her with lasting physical and psychological damage.
Her voice permanently deepened, her chest never developed and she had to undergo several procedures meant to “affirm” her gender. These interventions also jeopardized her fertility and her ability to breastfeed if she ever had a child of her own.
The lawsuit, which details a harrowing story of medical malpractice and negligence, aims to bring attention to the lack of proper evaluation and consent in these high-stakes medical decisions.
Breen, who struggled with depression, anxiety and PTSD, began questioning her gender identity after finally receiving mental health care near the end of high school. She is now in the process of “de-transitioning,” which is a difficult and often painful process given her irreversible medical interventions.
“In retrospect, I wish that somebody had suggested real, genuine therapy first,” said Breen.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/could-gmo-crops-be-the-main-reason-for-the-explosion-of-leaky-gut-syndrome,Could GMO Crops be the Main Reason for the Explosion of Leaky Gut Syndrome?,By S.D. Wells | Natural News,2 months ago,"This article aims to shed light on the critical issue of gut health and the impact of genetically modified foods on leaky gut syndrome. It emphasizes the importance of informed dietary choices and the potential health risks associated with consuming GMOs.
Did you know that BT corn contains a toxic genetic trait that was inserted into its seeds in a laboratory that makes bugs’ stomachs explode when they eat it? This creates holes or permeations in the stomach lining of those insects. Does this directly translate to the massive uptick of cases of humans suffering from leaky gut syndrome?
The only known cure for leaky gut, according to the medical community, is to treat the underlying condition. If that condition is a direct result of consuming toxins that destroy the lining of the gut, well then, there is the solution, which is even better than just “treating the condition” with medications. That means humans should entirely STOP eating genetically modified foods that literally breed a toxic microbiome in the gut.
In a recent study conducted by MDVIP and Ipsos, alarming statistics have emerged regarding the state of gut health among Americans. It revealed that a staggering two-thirds of adults in the United States suffer from digestive symptoms such as gas, bloating, and abdominal pain. Despite the prevalence of these issues, most individuals remain unaware of the critical importance of gut health and how to address it. Also, most Americans consume genetically engineered products on a regular basis, and even in every meal and snack.
Here are some key points to understand about the dangers of consuming BT (GMO) corn:
According to the survey, 61% of respondents reported experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in the past week. The most common symptoms reported were heartburn/reflux, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. These symptoms, while seemingly common, can indicate a deeper underlying issue – leaky gut syndrome.
Leaky gut syndrome, also known as increased intestinal lining permeability, occurs when the tight junctions in the intestinal lining become compromised. This allows undigested food particles and toxins to leak into the bloodstream, triggering a cascade of health problems. Toxins entering the bloodstream can lead to chronic inflammation, affecting vital organs like the liver, kidneys, and pancreas.
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) like BT corn and GM soy have been implicated in exacerbating leaky gut syndrome. These GMOs, commonly found in processed foods, contain toxins that can disrupt the delicate balance of the gut microbiome. Glyphosate, a chemical herbicide used in GMO farming, has been linked to damaging vital organs and promoting leaky gut.
Addressing the issue of leaky gut syndrome and its association with GMOs is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in mood regulation, can be affected by the consumption of GMOs. By reducing or eliminating the intake of GMOs, individuals can support their gut health and potentially alleviate symptoms associated with leaky gut syndrome.
As awareness grows about the detrimental effects of GMOs on gut health, it becomes imperative for individuals to make informed dietary choices. Opting for organic foods free from toxic herbicides and pesticides, like glyphosate, can help protect the gut microbiome and reduce the risk of leaky gut syndrome.
In conclusion, the link between genetically modified foods and gut health cannot be ignored. By prioritizing the health of our gut microbiome and reducing exposure to harmful toxins found in GMOs, individuals can take proactive steps towards improving their overall well-being. It’s time to listen to what our gut is telling us and make conscious decisions to support a healthier future.
Stay informed, stay vigilant, and remember – your gut health is the foundation of your well-being. Tune your food news frequency to FoodSupply.news and get updates on more toxic foods and food shortages coming to stores near you.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/following-japan-europe-set-to-approve-exotic-new-self-amplifying-rna-vaccine-technology-that-may-vaccinate-others-via-shedding,"Following Japan, Europe Set to Approve Exotic New Self-Amplifying RNA ‘Vaccine’ Technology That May ‘Vaccinate’ Others Via Shedding",By Sean Miller,2 months ago,"On Thursday the European Union’s medicine committee recommended marketing authorization of a novel exotic technology referred to as ‘self-amplifying RNA vaccines’ or ‘replicon vaccines’. Called Kostaive, it is reportedly for ‘protection’ against Covid. In October Japan became the first country on earth to begin injecting their population with the new shot.
“On 12 December 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Kostaive, a vaccine intended for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults,” the European Medicines Agency said Thursday.
Unlike the notorious mRNA gene therapy injections used to ‘combat’ Covid, which make the vaccinated individual’s body produce an antigen (the spike protein in the case of the Covid shots) the new saRNA vaccines go a step further, making the body replicate the replication mechanism itself. Traditional (real) vaccines contain the antigen, which is intended to illicit an immune response in the body, unlike mRNA vaccines which make the body itself produce the antigen, which is then intended to illicit an immune response. Traditional vaccines also contain neurotoxins such as aluminum as an adjuvant (to agitate the immune system into action) and mercury as a preservative.
“Kostaive will be available as a powder for dispersion for injection. Kostaive is a RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine (ATC code: J07BN01). It contains a self-amplifying mRNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Self-amplifying means that the mRNA also carries instructions to make a protein called replicase. Once administered into a muscle, the replicase protein makes more copies of the mRNA, which the cell can use to make more spike protein. Vaccination with Kostaive induces the production of neutralising antibodies and a cellular immune response targeting the spike protein, which helps protect people against COVID-19,” the European Medicines Agency said Thursday.
The new shot triggers side effects 90 percent of the time.
“During the clinical trials for Kostaive, five deaths were reported among participants in the phase 3b study. Across study phases 1, 2, and 3a combined, 90 percent of injected participants experienced adverse events, with 74.5 percent reporting systemic reactions and 15.2 percent requiring medical attention after the first dose. Notably, many of the study authors are full-time employees of Arcturus Therapeutics, raising concerns about bias in their conclusions,” Lifesite News said Tuesday.
The new technology has been labeled as intrinsically dangerous and even as a bioweapon by some, sparking fears of the vaccine itself spreading to the non-vaccinated population, a step far beyond vaccine shedding.
“The man-made genes in the replicon vaccines, if introduced into humans, are likely to spread not only to other humans but also to other species,” The Expose said in September.
The novel vaccine technology is said to spread like a virus, vaccinating even those who refuse to take their shots.
“So this was a way to have a vaccine that spreads like a virus,” talkshow host Mike Adams said in a May 5, 2021 podcast. “And the research on this has been going on for over three decades.”
Adams discussed the October rollout of the new replicon shots after he interviewed Dr. Murakami about the technology and its associated risks.
“These self-replicating bioweapons systems, they replicate both the payload which is the spike protein, but they also replicate the replication engine and apparently it looks like they can replicate from person to person to person,” Adams said in a June 5 podcast. “Which means there’s exponential growth in the number of people carrying this, let’s call it a depopulation virus, that’s really what it is.”
Those who submit to the new injections will be able to vaccinate those around them, despite lacking consent, due to the advances in forced immunization technology.
“This new class of saRNA vaccines goes beyond the traditional antigen/adjuvant based vaccine model and takes the process of mRNA vaccines a step further, integrating the GENES needed for the replication and synthesis of the spike protein-encoding RNA. Unlike mRNA vaccines, which only produce the spike protein necessary for immune response as long as the mRNA persists, saRNA vaccines are engineered to create copies of themselves and the proteins they encode. This ‘biological printing press’ could theoretically amplify the vaccine’s presence and multiply its effects within the body indefinitely,” Lance D Johnson said in Natural News. “If these saRNA vaccines are anything like the mRNA vaccines, then the heart and brain damage they impose will be ongoing and unstoppable – a precursor to suffering and early death. To make matters worse, the shedding process will be guaranteed for months and possibly years after vaccination, turning vaccinated individuals into toxic factories for spreading biological warfare.”
Humanity-wide vaccination (such as via edible vaccine-producing foods and vaccinating mosquitos) has long been a goal of the eugenics movement, which fears that vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccine movements will compromise their agenda of a shot in every arm. While propaganda operations have failed to convince each and every person on earth to get jabbed, a contagious vaccine may reach 100 percent vaccination rates despite those who choose to do their own research failing to submit to their mandatory medical interventions.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/residents-of-nevada-town-score-temporary-win-in-battle-against-verizon-5g-towers,Residents of Nevada Town Score Temporary Win in Battle Against Verizon 5G Towers,"By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",2 months ago,"Residents of Minden, Nevada, have temporarily stopped Verizon from putting up two 5G cell towers in their community near where children learn and play. But the battle isn’t over, they say.
Verizon wants to erect two 80-foot cell towers in Minden, about 20 miles from Lake Tahoe and home to roughly 3,000 residents.
“They are relentless,” Casey Rodgers, a Minden resident and leader of the grassroots group, “Minden for Safe Tech,” told The Defender. “One of their proposed towers is by a high school next to a dance studio and a daycare, and across the street from a neighborhood. The other is next to a park, across the street from an elementary school and neighborhood.”
Both towers would be on land owned by the town’s fire department. The towers would loom “directly above our bravest men and women in uniform, our firefighters and paramedics,” Rodgers said.
With help from Children’s Health Defense’s (CHD) Stop 5G initiative, Rodgers and other Minden residents have been pushing back against Verizon since learning of the plans in January 2024.
W. Scott McCollough, lead litigator for CHD’s Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) & Wireless cases is representing the Minden residents through CHD’s Stop5G Community Empowerment Consulting.
The initiative — which includes legal representation and public relations expertise from CHD’s EMR & Wireless team — “empowers local communities and safe technology organizations across the U.S. to effectively oppose proposed cell tower and small cell installations in their neighborhoods,” according to its website.
Rodgers said that choosing McCollough to represent them was the “best decision” the Minden residents made. “We believe without him we wouldn’t be as far as we are right now,” she said.
On Sept. 10, Minden’s planning commission approved one tower project and denied the other. The residents appealed the project that was approved. Verizon appealed the project that was denied.
Minden residents submitted a legal response opposing Verizon’s appeal. “We support the Commission’s decision to deny the application,” the response said.
On Dec. 5, the Minden residents scored a victory when county supervisors, who heard the appeal cases, unanimously voted to hold off issuing a permit for either tower until at least April 3. The supervisors said that until then, Verizon should look for alternative sites, according to McCollough.
McCollough told The Defender that the county supervisor’s decision favors the Minden residents. “We got the better of this although we did not succeed in getting both denied yet,” he said.
Miriam Eckenfels, director of CHD’s EMR & Wireless program, told The Defender that the Minden residents serve as an example of how local communities can successfully step up to the table and strategically push back against attempts to put cell towers close to where they live.
“We are proud to be representing the residents of Minden, Nevada,” she said. “We commend them for the amazing effort they have made so far and are looking forward to continuing to support them every step of the way until this matter is brought to an acceptable conclusion.”
‘Parents do not want their children next to a 5G tower’
During the Dec. 5 hearing, Minden residents delivered public comments outlining why they didn’t want the towers placed near a school, a daycare, a park, residential neighborhoods and where firefighters work.
So many showed up to speak that they formed a “line out the door” as each waited for their three minutes to speak, McCollough said. All who spoke opposed or questioned some aspect of Verizon’s plans.
Verizon wants to put one of the towers 235 feet from a locally owned daycare, Rodgers told The Defender. “That’d put her out of business because the parents do not want their children next to a 5Gtower.”
Rodgers and the residents have educated themselves on how to strategically fight a cell tower proposal. For instance, they know that the Telecommunication Act of 1996 doesn’t allow local authorities to deny a cell tower application based on health concerns.
So although they are highly concerned about the health implications of 5G cell towers, they outlined in their public comments and case documents how Verizon’s proposed towers would lower property values and could increase fire risks.
“We know we can’t win on health,” Rodgers said, “but these towers are ugly and unsafe, so there are other ways to win against their installation.”
The residents want Verizon to choose a “more suitable” tower location “away from families, away from education facilities full of children, away from our bravest and finest, and away from places where families enjoy their lives,” Rodgers said.
That’s not an impossible request, McCollough said. “There is a lot of open space away from schools and residential neighborhoods, including some BLM land.”
BLM land is public land managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management.
‘Find your people, stay together and don’t quit’
Rodgers, who grew up in Minden and returned 14 years ago, said many of the town’s residents have come together to stop Verizon from putting its towers near schools, businesses and homes. “This is a full-force group effort.”
The members of Minden for Safe Tech have worked to educate themselves and their broader community — “especially those in local authority” — about why it’s a bad idea to put cell towers so near where people live, work and play.
For instance, many people aren’t aware that the Federal Communication Commission’s safety limits for wireless radiation are decades old and based on a handful of studies from the 1970s and 1980s with tiny sample sizes.
Both CHD and the Environmental Health Trust were good sources of scientific and regulatory information on wireless radiation, Rodgers said.
She added:
“We battle with the untruths that the ‘other side’ has and continues to propagandize our community with, but it is to be decided who is more relentless on that front. We are not giving up. This team has stuck together through all our disagreements and struggles.”
Every community member has something to offer. For instance, some in Minden for Safe Tech researched and presented information publicly. Others opened their homes for group meetings. One person had a helpful background in engineering. Others set up areas to display the group’s mission and talk with other community members.
“We also came together financially to make this happen,” she said. They agreed to split all costs. “We worked together every step of the way and made one of the greatest teams to fight 5G for our community.”
Rodgers, who knows that many communities across the U.S. face similar 5G cell tower proposals, advised, “Find your people, stay together and don’t quit.”
Also, be aware of what’s happening in your community. Minden residents learned about Verizon’s plans when Rodger’s neighbor heard about them at a fire department board meeting. “People need to be aware of all the things going on locally,” Rodgers warned.
Other keys to their success included submitting a Freedom of Information Act request to identify the proposed site and having conversations with others about their concerns regarding the proposed tower.
She added:
“These people putting up towers are sneaky and could care less about what happens to you or your family. They lie, they cheat and they steal lives in the process — all for the love of money.
“So please say something to a neighbor. You never know if a small conversation could make a big impact. Just start the conversation so it spreads.”
Verizon did not respond to our request for comment by the deadline.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/fda-advisers-bullish-on-rsv-shots-for-kids-even-as-safety-signals-shut-down-moderna-trials,"FDA Advisers Bullish on RSV Shots for Kids, Even as Safety Signals Shut Down Moderna Trials","By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. | The Defender",2 months ago,"Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) met Thursday to discuss the future of pediatric respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines after Moderna was forced to abruptly halt clinical trials for its mRNA RSV vaccine in children ages 5-23 months.
Clinical trial data released earlier this week in an FDA briefing document showed that rather than preventing RSV disease in small children, Moderna’s vaccine likely caused higher rates of severe RSV illness in its Phase 1 clinical trial.
Moderna halted the trial in July after it was informed that two babies in the vaccine group had developed severe RSV disease. The company didn’t publicly announce that the trial was discontinued until September.
The data presented Thursday at the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting showed that 12.5% of vaccinated children developed severe RSV disease as compared to just 5% of children in the placebo group.
Among the children who developed symptomatic RSV disease, 26.3% in the vaccinated group progressed to severe disease, while only 8.3% of those in the placebo group did.
These results were concerning given the history of past attempts to develop an RSV vaccine for infants. In the 1960s, an experimental formalin–inactivated RSV vaccine for children led to two toddler deaths, and 80% of vaccine recipients required hospitalization for severe RSV.
The illnesses were attributed to vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) — a phenomenon that occurs when vaccination promotes immune responses that exacerbate the disease caused by subsequent infection with the pathogen the vaccine was meant to protect against.
In light of that history, and because the mechanisms that cause VAERD are still largely unknown, the FDA convened the advisory committee to discuss the implications of Moderna’s trial outcomes for other pediatric RSV vaccines.
The committee did not vote on Thursday or make any formal recommendations. Members watched presentations from consultants, the FDA, and pharmaceutical companies and discussed the risks and benefits of developing RSV vaccines for children.
They also commended Moderna for reporting its results and the existing clinical safeguards for recognizing early safety signals in pediatric RSV trials.
Vaccine makers developing 26 different RSV vaccines or monoclonal antibodies
The briefing document stated that the FDA was halting enrollment for all investigational trials for RSV vaccines for infants and toddlers under age 2 and children ages 2 through 5 who haven’t previously had RSV.
The FDA clarified at the outset of the meeting that the hold does not apply to vaccine candidates that use live attenuated vaccines, because there is no evidence that vaccines developed on this platformcause VAERD.
Advisers seemed to agree, except for Dr. Karen Kotloff who voiced concerns there was not enough information to assume that live attenuated vaccines don’t carry the same potential risk.
Dr. Pedro Piedra, who presented on clinical and non-clinical aspects of RSV vaccine safety shared a slide listing RSV vaccines and monoclonal antibodies currently in trials.
There are five pediatric vaccines other than Moderna’s — which Moderna’s Christine Shaw, Ph.D., definitively stated is no longer moving forward — in the pipeline. Four of them are for live-attenuated vaccines.
Vaccine makers are developing 26 different RSV vaccines or monoclonal antibodies for all age groups, all vying to enter a rapidly expanding market.
PR Newswire projected in 2023 the global RSV vaccine and antibody market would be worth $2.61 billion dollars in 2024 and rise to $13.59 billion by 2030.
Piedra — who began his presentation with the quick disclosure that he has grants for RSV prevention research from GSK, Icosavax and Merck and is a paid consultant in the field for Merck, Moderna, Pfizerand Sanofi — presented an optimistic picture of RSV vaccine development, citing protection offered by recently approved maternal vaccines and monoclonal antibodies.
Moderna’s results did raise some platform-specific concerns, Piedra conceded.
He listed the types of safety concerns that could be associated with different vaccine platforms — febrile seizures with adjuvanted or high-dose vaccines or when RSV vaccines are co-administered with other vaccines, autoimmunity that could be associated with new adjuvants, respiratory issues with intranasal vaccines, and systemic illnesses with vector-based or mRNA vaccines.
‘Unmet need’ as justification to push for more RSV vaxes for small children
Presenters repeatedly stated that there was an “unmet need” for pediatric RSV vaccines, especially for children between 8 months and 2 years old.
RSV usually causes mild cold-like symptoms, but in some cases can lead to hospitalization and death in infants and the elderly. By age 2, 97% of all babies have been infected with RSV, which confers partial immunity, making any subsequent episodes less severe.
The disease burden for infants can be serious. In the U.S., RSV infection is the leading cause of infant hospitalization among those younger than 6 months, although a very small percentage of children with the virus will die.
An FDA representative said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 100-200 infants die per year from the disease. However, internist Dr. Meryl Nass told The Defender that even those low numbers may overestimate mortality.
Nass pointed to a CDC study analyzing RSV deaths in infants between 2005 and 2016 and found a total of 314 deaths in children under age 1, or 25 on average per year, Nass reported. Only 17 of those deaths per year listed RSV as the underlying cause of death.
The FDA also said that maternal vaccines and monoclonal antibodies had begun to reduce those numbers, but emphasized there is still an “unmet need” for a vaccine for children going into their second RSV season — even as it presented data showing hospitalizations in that season are lower.
Moderna said this “unmet need” drove them to develop their failed vaccine. A Sanofi representative, who gave an update on their live-attenuated RSV virus, said the company sought to meet that “unmet need” for children in their second RSV season.
Sanofi also sells nirsevimab — brand name Beyfortus — the monoclonal antibody shot the CDC recommends for all newborns to protect them in their first RSV season.
Sanofi and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are collaborating on the live-attenuated virus vaccine platform. The NIH developed 16 different vaccine candidates that it trialed in children and currently has one SP-125 in Phase 3 clinical trials.
These vaccines have not shown VAERD after one season of surveillance, the Sanofi representative said. The safety trials showed no safety concerns and SP-125 is currently being tested for efficacy in toddlers 6-22 months of age, but it is not yet fully enrolled.
During the “public comments” section of the meeting, three other vaccine makers promoted their vaccines to the committee.
Goal is more RSV shots for kids to provide passive immunity followed by ‘active immunity’
FDA asked the committee members to discuss existing evidence on whether infants and toddlers could eventually get sequential administration of RSV monoclonal antibodies followed by RSV vaccines.
That would mean even more shots on the childhood immunization schedule. The monoclonal antibodies or maternal vaccination would provide babies with “passive immunity” — antibodies to fight the virus that weren’t created by their own immune systems.
Then, in this schema, a two- or three-shot course of an RSV vaccine could protect babies from RSV in the second season, giving them “active immunity.”
Most committee members said more data were necessary to evaluate the safety of such a plan, but they generally agreed that it was a good direction to move in.",0

Voluntary euthanasia led to the deaths of over 15,000 people in Canada last year.
The average age of euthanasia subjects was 77.
Around 95% had “reasonably foreseeable” deaths in their near future due to conditions like cancer.
Nearly 40% of the deaths came in Quebec, which accounts for around 20% of the Canadian population.
The Canadian government legalised euthanasia in 2016, joining the ranks of Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Austria and the Netherlands.
There has been significant controversy over the introduction and expansion of the “medically assisted dying” or MAiD program; although polling suggests that there is widespread support for the program.
In October, an expert committee reported that patients were asking to be killed for social reasons such as isolation and homelessness, rather than having a terminal illness or unmanageable pain.
Data suggest that those asking to be killed in Ontario are far more likely to require disability support and be socially isolated.
Trudo Lemmens, a professor at the University of Toronto, said medical professional bodies and judicial authorities in Canada appeared to be “unwilling to curtail practices that appear ethically problematic.”
“Either the law is too broad, or the professional guidance not precise enough,” Lemmens said. “Or it is simply not seen as a priority to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens.”
The British House of Commons recently passed a euthanasia bill. The bill still needs to pass the Lords in order to become law.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/pfizer-failed-to-report-two-deaths-during-covid-vaccine-trials,Pfizer Failed To Report Two Deaths during COVID Vaccine Trials,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"Pharma giant Pfizer failed to report two deaths during the clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccines.
According to researchers with Daily Clout who analyzed documents related to the clinical trials, the deaths were not revealed at the time the vaccine’s emergency-use authorization was granted, in 2020. If they had been revealed at that time, the research would have shown that the vaccine provided no reduction in deaths.
A 63-year-old woman from Kansas and a 58-year-old woman from Georgia who participated in the trials died.
Their deaths were not disclosed to the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on 10 December 2020, nor were the deaths—both of which were classified as “sudden cardiac death” in internal company documents—disclosed in a December 2020 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine that hailed the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.
In the case of the Kansas woman, there was an inexplicable 37-day delay in reporting the results of her autopsy, which fell before the data cutoff date of 14 November 2020 and almost a month before the meeting of the FDA Committee on 10 December 2020.
Dr Naomi Wolf, CEO of Daily Clout and author of The Pfizer Papers: Pfizer’s Crimes Against Humanity, told The Defender the documents show the “FDA covered up the unlawfully concealed deaths” of the trial participants and that these records “may well reveal a direct connection to the mRNA injection.”
A number of studies have linked the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to serious heart conditions including myocarditis and pericarditis.
Dr Chris Flowers, who also spoke to The Defender, said the deaths, if disclosed at the time, could have been enough to bring the trial to a halt and prevent the issuing of the emergency-use authorization.
“Normally, the FDA calls a stop to those clinical trials until further investigation is done. And in many cases, [this] is sort of the death knell of that clinical trial.”
A growing number of scientists and health professionals are now calling for a moratorium on the mRNA vaccines.
A new study, published in winter 2024 edition of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, analyzed COVID-19 vaccine and booster data and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to justify their continuing use.
“Early on in the pandemic, we and other scientific bodies had been calling upon the government agencies to halt the mRNA shots. Every time, we were ignored. As more evidence is being accumulated, the truth is becoming more obvious,” said Dr Philip R. Oldfield, lead author of the study.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-pledges-to-abolish-daylight-saving-time,Trump Pledges To Abolish Daylight Saving Time,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"Donald Trump has pledged to abolish Daylight Saving Time.
The president-elect called the practice, which involves setting the clocks forward an hour in the warmer part of the year, a waste of time and money.
“The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn’t!” Trump posted on Truth Social.
“Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.”
Daylight Saving Time was standardized by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, with the aim of saving energy increasing productivity.
Studies suggest this is not the case, however. The use of Daylight Saving Time has been linked to health risks including increased risk of heart attacks, injuries in the workplace and sleep disturbances, all of which are thought to cost the US economy hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
According to The New York Times, over $400 million is lost every year because of sleep disturbances and workplace injuries caused by changing the clocks.

Wells | Natural News,2 months ago,"“I would not take the flu shot in a million years, and I’ll tell you why,” says Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly appointed head of Health and Human Resources for the United States of America. Basically, when you get a flu shot, you are only protected against a few (sometimes only one) particular strains of flu, out of about a dozen or more possible that could be circulating that flu season, which lasts from October through May. Those injected folks are FOUR TIMES more likely to get a non-flu viral infection. Ever notice how many people who get the flu shot get sick right away?
RFK Jr. says, from the research he reviewed from British Medical Journal, that the flu shot gives you what is called flu shot priming, so it injures your immune system so that you are more likely to get a non-flu viral upper-respiratory infection. What’s worse is that a study published by the Pentagon found that people who got the flu shot were 36 percent more likely to catch… wait for it… Coronavirus.
That’s right. So, who wants to rush to the pharmacy, school, or clinic for their flu shot now? And that’s not the only study revealing that horrendous influenza vaccine outcome, there are more. Six other major studies revealed the same result.
There are several ways the dreaded flu shot sets up your immune system for a viral takeover. In a mind-blowing study conducted by Mike Adams at the Natural News Forensic Food Lab in 2014, his team uncovered a disturbing truth about flu shots. The influenza vaccine produced by GlaxoSmithKline (lot #9H2GX) contains an alarming level of toxic mercury, a staggering 51 parts per million. To put this into perspective, this mercury concentration is over 25,000 times higher than the EPA’s maximum contaminant level for inorganic mercury in drinking water.
The tests, conducted using advanced ICP-MS technology with a 4-point mercury calibration curve for precision, have exposed a level of mercury in this flu shot that surpasses anything previously seen. Even notorious mercury-laden fish like tuna pale in comparison to the toxicity found in this vaccine. What’s even more concerning is that vaccines are directly injected into the body, bypassing the body’s natural defenses against toxins.
The presence of mercury in flu shots poses a grave risk as mercury has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to potential neurological damage. Despite irrefutable evidence of high mercury content in flu vaccines, the medical establishment continues to deceive the public. The claim that mercury has been removed from vaccines is a blatant lie, contradicted by the very packaging of the vaccine vial.
Furthermore, the package insert for this flu shot shockingly admits that the vaccine has never undergone scientific clinical trials to prove its efficacy. This revelation exposes the fraudulent marketing tactics surrounding flu shots, which are portrayed as risk-free and highly effective without any scientific basis. With all that mercury going into the brain, the entire human body becomes a polluted, weakened vehicle for viruses to takeover.
It is time to confront the harsh reality of flu shots and the dangers they pose. The unchecked use of mercury in vaccines is not only a betrayal of public trust but a grave threat to our health. It’s a wake-up call to question the narratives pushed by mainstream media and demand transparency and accountability in the pharmaceutical industry. Your health is too precious to be gambled with mercury-laden injections.

CALGARY, Alberta (LifeSiteNews) — A federally funded pro-LGBT group is challenging Alberta’s pro-family legislation that bans giving often sterilizing puberty blockers to kids, claiming sex “reassignment” procedures are necessary for children.
On December 9, Egale Canada, an LGBT activist group, filed an injunction against Alberta’s newly passed Health Statutes Amendment Act (HSAA), also called Bill 26, at the Calgary’s Court of King’s Bench
“If you deny a kid access to blockers and then they go through permanent changes via puberty, they then have to pursue medical treatment and interventions to undo the effects of [puberty], so that is how the coercion is operating,” Bennett Jensen, legal director at Egale Canada, told CBC News.
Alberta’s new legislation, passed last week, reflects “the government’s commitment to build a health care system that responds to the changing needs of Albertans,” it said.
The bill will amend the Health Act to “prohibit regulated health professionals from performing sex reassignment surgeries on minors.”
It will also ban the “use of puberty blockers and hormone therapies for the treatment of gender dysphoria or gender incongruence” to kids 15 and under “except for those who have already commenced treatment and would allow for minors aged 16 and 17 to choose to commence puberty blockers and hormone therapies for gender reassignment and affirmation purposes with parental, physician and psychologist approval.”
Egale Canada, which receives funding from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s federal government, has paired with Skipping Stone and five Alberta families to challenge the new law. The group is using five gender-confused children to argue their case.
They claim that the new legislation violates both the national Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the provincial Alberta Bill of Rights.
The court filing effectively argues that if the Alberta bill is upheld, the gender-confused children, some as young as ten, will not be able to halt naturally occurring puberty through artificial means, which presents an impediment to their ability to “transition.”
While some are objecting to the common-sense legislation, the Alberta bill has found the support of an alliance for detransitioners who regret their “gender transition” process.
Despite the claims of LGBT activists, there is overwhelming evidence showing that people who undergo so-called “gender transitioning” are more likely to commit suicide than those who are not given irreversible surgery.
In addition to catering to a false reality that one’s sex can be changed, transgender surgeries and drugs have been linked to permanent physical and psychological damage, including cardiovascular diseases, loss of bone density, cancer, strokes and blood clots, and infertility.
Meanwhile, a recent study on the side effects of transgender “sex change” surgeries discovered that 81 percent of those who had undergone “sex change” surgeries in the past five years reported experiencing pain simply from normal movement in the weeks and months that followed – and that many other side effects manifest as well.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/cdc-rolls-out-200-routine-vaccines-for-2025-way-up-from-1983s-seven-routine-childhood-injections-zero-for-adults-and-pregnant-women,"CDC Rolls Out 200 “Routine Vaccines” for 2025, Way up From 1983’s Seven Routine Childhood Injections, Zero for Adults and Pregnant Women",By Belle Carter | NaturalNews.com,2 months ago,"In November, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published the vaccine schedule for 2025, naming over 200 routine injections for children and teenagers, adults and pregnant women.
From 1983 up to 1986, when the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, otherwise known as the Vaccine Act passed the U.S. Congress, there were only seven vaccines for children, including diphtheria, tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DPT), oral attenuated poliovirus (OPV), measles, mumps and rubella virus (MMR) and adult tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (TD). There were no vaccines recommended for adults and pregnant women.
However, the 1986 Vaccine Act gave Big Pharma mandatory and national liability protection for the medical community. It also limited the venue for a vaccine claim to Washington DC. Moreover, there were no more universal releases, mass communication or documentation provided to parents on what to watch out for following the vaccination schedule.
Vaccine activists have been lobbying against the Vaccine Act since the beginning, as it “tilted the balance of public good against individual rights and protection.” Critics point out that victims of vaccine injuries are left with the long-term side effects of the jabs, while the medical community and Big Pharma are protected from any accountability. Worse, they continue to create more and more experimental injections.
And now, over 200 vaccines are included in the schedule, including five routine injections during pregnancy, over 70 routine childhood injections (from birth to age 18) and over 130 routine adult injections (up to age 79).
The new schedule also lists the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) shots for children and COVID-19 and mpox jabs for adults and pregnant women. (Related: The CDC knew COVID vaccines killed 163 children and injured 57,622, but still included the deadly shots in the childhood immunization schedule.)
The figures do not yet include non-routine injections.
Meanwhile, some critics of the vaccine schedule were given hope when President-elect Donald Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), subject to the confirmation of the U.S. senators.
“The safety and health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming health crisis in this country,” Trump said in a post on X. “Mr. Kennedy will restore these agencies to the traditions of gold standard scientific research, and beacons of transparency, to end the chronic disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!”
RFK Jr. is an environmental lawyer and a staunch opponent of the vaccine industry.
According to CDC data, fewer kindergartners are getting routine vaccinations compared to pre-pandemic times, with the figures dipping from 95 percent in the 2019-20 school year to less than 93 percent in 2023-24.
Due to a mix of ideological and religious reasons as well as data on vaccine damages and injuries, parents refused to submit to the vaccination mandate and even resorted to keeping their kids home from school.
A CDC survey of parents in 2024 showed that 8.3 percent disagreed with the statement that school and child care “vaccination requirements for children are important and necessary.” An additional 15.2 percent of parents said they had no opinion on the issue.
“These results could indicate changes in attitudes toward routine vaccination transferring from hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccination, or toward any vaccine requirements arising from objections to COVID-19 vaccine mandates, as well as a potential for larger decreases in coverage or increases in exemptions,” CDC said.
Meanwhile, the vaccination exemption rate for this group rose from 2.5 percent in 2019-20 to 3.3. percent last year. This has been the highest level ever reported. Exemptions increased in 41 states and territories and surpassed five percent in 14 of them. That amounts to more than 126,000 kindergartners with an exemption from at least one vaccination for the 2023-24 school year.
The combined decrease in routine shots and increase in exemptions “jeopardize” the 95 percent kindergartner vaccination rate goal for measles, mumps and rubella by 2030 set by the HHS.
CDC has been persistent in meeting the 2030 goal as it vows to ensure that students begin the school year fully vaccinated by reducing the types of exemptions available.
The agency also said that it would be working with parents to avoid invoking exemptions because of difficulty meeting vaccination requirement deadlines. It also said it would convince parents that vaccines are “safe and effective” and that there are risks for children who are not vaccinated.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-root-of-many-diseases-mitochondrial-dysfunction-caused-by-modern-toxins,The Root of Many Diseases? Mitochondrial Dysfunction Caused by Modern Toxins,By Dr. Joseph Mercola | The Defender,2 months ago,"Story at a glance:
In my recent appearance on “The Jimmy Dore Show,” we explored a vital yet often overlooked aspect of human well-being — cellular health and the myriad of silent toxins eroding it. I shared insights from my latest book, “Your Guide to Cellular Health: Unlocking the Science of Longevity and Joy.”
This article reviews the most pivotal points from our extensive discussion, revealing the vital components that sustain health and the modern challenges that threaten them.
As I shared with Dore, for 15 years I struggled with a mind-bending, unexplained rash that caused me to lose sleep at night because of unrelenting itching. All the physicians I consulted, some of the best out there, had no clue how to resolve it.
This personal battle led me to a groundbreaking realization: impaired mitochondrial function is at the heart of nearly every disease. Mitochondria, the powerhouses of your cells, produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) — your body’s essential energy currency.
Everyone knows you can’t run a car without fuel. Similarly, your body is a vehicle that transports you around, and if you don’t have enough energy, it’s a problem.
Historically, humans produced twice the amount of ATP compared to today, but the influx of chemical toxins has drastically reduced cellular energy production, leading to a significant decline in overall health.
The ATP crisis: A modern epidemic
Humans are producing up to 75% less ATP today than a century ago. This decline is not just a number — it’s a reflection of our deteriorating health. The question remains: Why has ATP production plummeted?
The answer lies in the toxins that have permeated our environment over the past 150 years. The Industrial Revolution and subsequent advancements introduced chemical poisons into our lives, fundamentally disrupting our cellular machinery.
Among these toxins, seed oils like soybean, corn and sunflower oil, stand out as primary culprits in harming your cellular energy.
Seed oils: The silent destroyers of health
Seed oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are one of the main drivers destroying your health, as excess consumption leads to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia.
These oils, often misleadingly labeled as “healthy” vegetable oils, wreak havoc on mitochondrial function. Consuming excessive amounts overloads your cells with harmful fats, crippling their ability to produce ATP.
Safe alternatives include coconut oil, ghee and beef tallow. Eating out poses a significant challenge for those striving to avoid seed oils like canola and soybean oil.
One practical tip when you dine at a restaurant is to inform the server that you have a severe allergy to seed oils. Show them evidence of the dangers, and ensure the kitchen adheres to your requirements.
Most restaurants are unaware of the extent of seed oil contamination. By educating them and insisting on pure fats, you protect your health while raising awareness. The prevalence of adulterated oils, even in the case of products like extra virgin olive oil, makes vigilance essential.
Additionally, cooking your own meals at home or choosing restaurants that use healthier frying fats, such as beef tallow, will significantly reduce your exposure to harmful PUFAs.
The truth about sugar: A cellular fuel
Contrary to popular belief, not all sugars are detrimental. Sugar, when used wisely, restores your energy. The key lies in understanding the type of sugar and its role in your metabolism.
Real sugar — specifically glucose, also known as dextrose — is the ultimate fuel for your mitochondria. Unlike high-fructose corn syrup, which is harmful, glucose is essential for efficient energy production.
However, moderation is crucial. If you consume too much sugar, it disrupts insulin and hormonal balance.
For individuals suffering from severe mitochondrial poisoning, however, glucose is a lifesaver, providing the necessary energy to sustain vital bodily functions. This nuanced understanding of sugar’s role challenges the conventional narrative that all carbohydrates are harmful.
Your gut microbiome: Balancing good and bad bacteria
Your gut health plays a pivotal role in cellular energy and overall well-being. I explained the importance of colonocytes — cells lining your colon that rely on short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, propionate and acetate, produced by beneficial bacteria.
When mitochondrial function is impaired, these colonocytes begin to die, allowing oxygen to seep back into your gut.
This shift creates an environment where pathogenic, oxygen-tolerant bacteria thrive, producing endotoxins that further damage mitochondria. This creates a vicious cycle I call the “black hole of death.”
To break free from this cycle, it’s essential to restore the balance of gut bacteria. Unfortunately, many people are unaware of the state of their microbiome, as beneficial bacteria are often overshadowed by their pathogenic counterparts.
Advanced testing, though expensive, provides insights into the state of your gut health, but practical dietary adjustments are equally important.
Until an intervention targets the factors harming your colonocytes and restores optimal oxygen levels, the population of beneficial, oxygen-intolerant microbes cannot be re-established in your gut. This mitochondrial-gut microbiome communication is necessary for health.
However, when oxygen-tolerant pathogenic bacteria dominate, they outcompete the beneficial, oxygen-intolerant bacteria, preventing the production of essential metabolites needed for vitality.
Removing excess oxygen from your colon is key because, without it, even the best lifestyle practices — such as exercise, adequate sleep, proper nutrition and the use of supplements — will not result in significant improvement.
Simply introducing probiotics is insufficient for replenishing oxygen-intolerant microbes, as most commercially available probiotics are often non-viable.
While these probiotics offer postbiotic benefits, they do not function as true “seeds” to rebuild the appropriate microbial community. Just as a seed cannot grow in a desert, the environment within your colon must be conducive for these beneficial microbes to flourish.
Therefore, avoiding mitochondrial poisons, including seed oils and EDCs, is essential to creating the right conditions for restoring a healthy, oxygen-intolerant microbial population in your gut.
The hidden dangers of plastics and endocrine disruptors
Beyond dietary choices, environmental toxins like plastics pose a significant threat to cellular health. Plastics produce EDCs that stimulate estrogen receptors. These chemicals are pervasive, found in everyday items like water bottles and food wraps, and are linked to various health issues, including breast cancer.
EDCs disrupt hormonal balance, leading to widespread health problems. These chemicals primarily operate by activating estrogen receptors within your cells. This activation leads to an increased influx of calcium ions into your cells. Excessive intracellular calcium dramatically elevates the levels of superoxide and nitric oxide.
These reactive molecules swiftly combine to form peroxynitrite, an extremely potent oxidant stressor. The formation of peroxynitrite induces severe oxidative stress, resulting in significant cellular damage.
In addition, when combined with natural estrogen, exposure to EDCs leads to estrogen overload and initiates a series of harmful events.
How EDCs trigger your self-attack autoimmune responses
EDCs pose a significant threat to your health, initiating a cascade of negative effects that begin at the cellular level and ripple outward to impact your entire body. This process unfolds in several interconnected stages, each building upon the last to create a perfect storm of health challenges in your system.
It all starts with your mitochondria — the powerhouses of your cells. EDCs interfere with these crucial organelles, diminishing their ability to produce the energy your cells need to function optimally. This energy deficit isn’t just a matter of you feeling tired; it has far-reaching consequences, particularly for your gut health.
Your digestive system relies on a delicate balance of beneficial bacteria, many of which thrive in an oxygen-free environment. The energy shortage caused by mitochondrial dysfunction disrupts this carefully maintained anaerobic setting in your gut.
As a result, these beneficial microorganisms struggle to survive and perform their vital functions within you.
One of the key roles of these gut bacteria is the production of short-chain fatty acids. These compounds are essential for maintaining the health and integrity of your intestinal lining. They act as a primary food source for the cells that make up this barrier and help regulate the immune responses in your gut.
However, when your gut bacteria are compromised due to the altered environment, their ability to produce these crucial fatty acids is severely impaired.
The absence of adequate short-chain fatty acids leads to a weakening of your intestinal barrier. This condition is often referred to as “leaky gut” or increased intestinal permeability. In this state, the tight junctions between the cells lining your intestines become loose, allowing substances that should remain within your gut to pass into your bloodstream.
This is where the situation can take a particularly concerning turn for you. Among the substances that can now penetrate your weakened gut barrier are proteins that bear a striking resemblance to structures within your own body — such as those found in your joints or neurological tissues.
When these foreign yet familiar proteins enter your bloodstream, your immune system is faced with a case of mistaken identity. It perceives these proteins as threats and mounts an attack against them.
The problem is, due to the similarity between these intruding proteins and your own body tissues, your immune response doesn’t stop at neutralizing the perceived invaders. Instead, it can turn against your own cells and tissues that share similar structures.
This misdirected immune attack is the hallmark of autoimmune diseases, where your body essentially wages war against itself.
Thus, from the initial disruption of cellular energy production by EDCs, you arrive at a situation where your body’s own defense mechanisms have been tricked into causing harm to you.
This complex chain of events underscores the far-reaching and interconnected nature of your body’s systems and highlights how these seemingly small disruptions can cascade into significant health challenges for you.
The challenge lies in finding safe alternatives, as conventional plastics are laden with harmful chemicals. I’m in the process of creating bio-compatible alternatives to plastics in order to help eliminate EDC exposure and promote environmental sustainability.
EMFs: A mitochondrial poison
Another insidious threat to your cellular health today is exposure to EMFs. Unlike other toxins, EMFs permeate our environment, making them a pervasive danger that is often overlooked.
Electromagnetic frequencies describe all types of radiation, including beneficial ones like sunlight. However, the high-frequency EMFs emitted by modern devices such as cellphones, Wi-Fi routers and microwaves operate in the gigahertz range, posing significant risks to your mitochondria.
While ionizing radiation like X-rays directly damages cells by creating free radicals, EMFs cause harm through a different mechanism called non-thermal effects. These non-thermal effects disrupt cellular function without raising tissue temperatures, making the damage less visible but equally, if not more, dangerous.
EMFs interfere with mitochondria by increasing calcium ion influx into cells. Elevated calcium levels catalyze the production of harmful free radicals, leading to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.
This process mirrors the damage caused by other mitochondrial poisons, like seed oils and EDCs, creating a vicious cycle of cellular decline.
The telecommunication industry’s deceptive practices
The telecommunications industry, much like the tobacco industry before it, has employed deceptive strategies to downplay the dangers of EMFs. They used the same playbook as the tobacco industry to greenwash their products and obfuscate the real risks.
The 1996 Telecommunications Act, for instance, effectively immunized these companies from liability, allowing them to continue disseminating harmful EMFs without accountability.
They promote the idea that non-ionizing radiation is safe because it doesn’t cause immediate thermal damage. This misleading narrative ignores the long-term, chronic effects of EMF exposure, which accumulate over time and contribute to a host of health problems, including cancer, neurological disorders and reduced cellular energy.
Practical steps to mitigate EMF exposure
Understanding the dangers of EMFs is only the first step; taking actionable measures to reduce exposure is crucial for safeguarding your health.
Here are several strategies I recommend:
Reclaiming health: Strategies for protection and restoration
To break free from this cycle of mitochondrial poisoning, it is imperative to adopt comprehensive strategies that eliminate exposure to harmful toxins and support mitochondrial function.
Here are several actionable steps:
The power of education and advocacy
Raising awareness about the true impact of these mitochondrial poisons is essential for empowering individuals to take control of their health. Education and advocacy are crucial in countering the misinformation spread by powerful industries.
By informing the public about the real dangers of seed oils, EMFs and mask mandates, we foster a movement toward healthier living and systemic change.
On an individual level, you must take proactive steps to protect your health, even in the face of pervasive EMF exposure and misleading public health directives. Simple lifestyle changes, combined with a commitment to natural health principles, significantly enhance mitochondrial function and overall well-being.
A vision for a healthier future
Looking ahead, my mission is to continue developing solutions that protect and restore cellular health. These efforts aim to harmonize technological advancements with natural health practices, ensuring that progress does not come at the expense of our well-being.
The goal is to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools needed to maintain robust mitochondrial function and achieve lasting health. By addressing the root causes of mitochondrial poisoning and advocating for informed, holistic health practices, we can pave the way for a future of longevity and joy.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/canadian-seniors-say-they-were-offered-euthanasia-when-faced-with-increased-hospice-costs,Canadian Seniors say They Were Offered Euthanasia When Faced with Increased Hospice Costs,By Anthony Murdoch | Lifesite,2 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) –– A senior aged Canadian couple has said that a hospice care center presented euthanasia to one of them as an option as they were facing increased care costs they could not afford on their fixed income.
71-year-old Fred Sandeski from Saskatchewan, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) along with a host of other ailments such as diabetes and epilepsy, and his wife Teresa, who also has failing health, say death via Canada’s Medical Assistance in Dying euthanasia program was suggested to them when they realized they would not be able to cover the costs associated with increased care at a hospice center.
According to the Epoch Times, when Fred started with palliative care, “they were just listing us the availability of what options they had for us,” and MAiD was presented as “one option.”
Thankfully, Sandeski refused MAiD, saying, “I really, really believe that the Lord has put me on this earth for a reason, and he’s not going to let me go until I’m done.”
Sandeski’s plight was brought to the attention of the provincial government of Saskatchewan by the opposition New Democratic Party’s shadow minister for seniors, Keith Jorgenson, who encouraged Saskatchewan Health Minister Jeremy Cockrill to help the couple.
In response, Cockrill said that he had reached out to the Sandeskis and would “find a solution that’s going to work for Fred and Theresa this week.”
He added that when it comes to the care home having offered them MAiD as a solution to their plight, he would “hope that any health care professional in this province, having those discussions with a patient has a strong understanding of the patient’s health and familial context.”
Instances of people being offered MAiD as a solution to their health issues have become commonplace in Canada, as reported by LifeSiteNews.
Indeed, most Canadians fear the nation’s euthanasia regime unfairly targets those who are financially and socially vulnerable while still supporting the immoral practice in general.
However, some provincial governments are looking at fighting back against Trudeau’s expansion of legal assisted suicide.
Recently, the United Conservative government of Alberta said it would push back against the Canadian federal government’s continued desire to expand euthanasia in the nation, announcing it will be launching a review of the legislation and policies surrounding the grim practice, which will include a period of public engagement.
Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose government legalized MAiD in 2016, the deadly program has continued to relax who is eligible for death.
In 2021, the program expanded from killing only terminally ill patients to allowing the chronically ill to qualify, as since then the government has sought to include those suffering solely from mental illness.
The number of Canadians killed by lethal injection under the nation’s MAiD program since 2016 stands at close to 65,000, with an estimated 16,000 deaths in 2023 alone. Many fear that because the official statistics are manipulated the number may be even higher.
Canada had approximately 15,280 euthanasia deaths in 2023.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/texas-sues-forever-chemical-companies-falsely-advertising-household-products-as-safe,Texas Sues ‘Forever Chemical’ Companies Falsely Advertising Household Products as Safe,By Adan Salazar,2 months ago,"The State of Texas is suing companies who disingenuously marketed everyday household products containing toxic PFAs, AKA “forever chemicals,” as safe.
On Wednesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton criticized companies 3M and DuPont for failing to inform Texans about harmful chemicals in their Teflon, Stainmaster and Scotchgard surface treatment products.
“PFAS are known as ‘forever chemicals’ because they are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. Exposure in humans may be associated with diseases such as cancer and thyroid disease, and PFAS contamination accumulates in animals, plants, drinking water, and human blood over time,” a press release from Paxton’s office stated.

PFAs are also known as endocrine-disruptor chemicals that can interfere with hormone balance.
“For decades, 3M and DuPont knew about the dangers of these chemicals but continued to market their beneficial use in ordinary household products.”
The press release notes the filing claims the companies “marketed products containing harmful PFAS chemicals for over 70 years and were aware of the harmful effects of PFAS chemicals for over 50 years.”
“Despite this knowledge, Defendants continued to market PFAS products and chemicals in Texas and elsewhere as safe for consumer use, misrepresent their environmental and biological risks, and conceal risks of harm from the public,” the lawsuit states.
Paxton slammed the companies for knowing about PFAs dangers, yet continuing to advertise the products “as safe for household use around families and children.”
“Texas is taking action to penalize these companies and hold them accountable for deceiving Texans into buying consumer products without vital information,” Paxton stated.
The Texas attorney general’s war on forever chemicals comes as President-elect Donald Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has previously called out the EPA for failing to revise its standards on PFAs and could take on the issue during the next Trump term.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/government-funded-canadian-outlet-claims-men-have-to-advantage-in-sports-over-women,Government-Funded Canadian Outlet Claims Men Have No Advantage in Sports Over Women,By Clare Marie Merkowsky | Lifesite,2 months ago,"CALGARY, Alberta (LifeSiteNews) — A government-funded Canadian media outlet has claimed that males having an advantage when competing against women in sports is a “myth.”
In a December 2 article, The Conversation, a pro-LGBT media outlet that receivesfederal funding from the Trudeau government, denounced Alberta’s Fairness and Safety in Sport Act (FASISA) which seeks to keep gender-confused men out of women’s sports, alleging that males do not have a physical advantage over females.
“Legislation like Bill 29 is based on a widespread myth that transgender women have an inherent biological advantage that threatens the integrity and fairness of women’s athletic competitions,” the article claimed. “This myth is not based on fulsome scientific and sociocultural evidence.”
The outlet argued that scientific studies which prove that biological men have an advantage are “often methodologically flawed and use limited biological data.”
“For example, studies rarely adjust for height and lean body mass and make a false equivalency between testosterone levels and athletic performance despite there being no consistent evidence testosterone levels predict performance,” the article continued.
Additionally, the outlet determined that “Anti-trans sport policies are bound to fail because the idea of two sexes, like two genders, is a social construction and not a biological fact.”
While common sense is usually enough for people to understand that there are inherent differences between men and women when it comes to strength and sport performance, studies have shown that males have a considerable advantage over women in athletics.
Indeed, a study published in Sports Medicine found that even a year of “transgender” hormone drugs results in “very modest changes” in the inherent strength advantages of men.
Even members of the left-wing United Nations have acknowledged biological reality. Last month, the international body released a report by Special Rapporteur Reem Alsalem exploring “forms of violence experienced by women and girls in sport.” Among them was the allowance of “males who identify as women to compete in female sports categories,” which the report said led to more than 600 female athletes around the world losing more than 890 medals in 29 sports as of March 2024.
“[P]harmaceutical testosterone suppression for genetically male athletes – irrespective of how they identify – will not eliminate the set of comparative performance advantages they have already acquired,” the report acknowledged. “To avoid the loss of a fair opportunity, males must not compete in the female categories of sport.”
Just a day after the article was published, Alberta’s governing United Conservative Party (UCP) government made history by passing the FASISA, the first legislation to protect women’s sports in Canada.
The proposed law, known as Bill 29, or the Fairness and Safety in Sport Act, will apply to all school boards, universities, as well as provincial sports organizations. It was introduced into the Alberta legislature last month.
Alberta’s Minister of Tourism and Sport Joseph Schow said about the passing of the bill that it will create fairness and safety in sports in Alberta for “young women and girls, and it is to them that I dedicate this speech and this bill because, Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent upon us as a government to create an environment that is fair and safe for all young girls and women who want to compete.”
“Sports teach you how to overcome challenges, how to strive for your personal best, how to respect your opponents, and that is something that even comes in handy in this house,” he added.",0

The new study titled, Menstrual Abnormalities Strongly Associated with Proximity to COVID-19 Vaccinated Individuals, recently published in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice, and Research found that “indirect exposure to COVID-19 vaccinated persons was significantly associated with the likelihood of the onset of menstrual irregularities.”
The study revealed women who were around vaccinated people daily (within 6 feet) had a 34% higher risk of heavy menstrual bleeding, a 28% higher chance of their period starting over a week early, and a 26% higher chance of menstrual bleeding lasting more than a week, compared to those with little close contact.
“One possible explanation for this result is that daily exposure to a larger public group of vaccinated individuals could increase the concentration and duration of exposure to vaccine components being transmitted in the environment,” the researchers wrote, citing the prolonged presence of spike proteins in the bloodstream of vaccinated people as a possible transmissible component.
“This study provides additional data to complement a growing body of evidence raising concerns regarding the safety of mRNA vaccines.”
One of the authors of the study claimed medical journals were refusing to publish the study’s troubling findings for over a year, and called for the “toxic injections” to be pulled from the market.
After more than a year of censorship from the medical journals, our landmark study and manuscript has been published demonstrating significant circumstantial evidence that something is being shed from the COVID-19 vaccinated population to the unvaccinated population. It is far beyond time for these toxic injections to be withdrawn from the market.
It has been a very long battle to get this article published. Our experience in this process has verified that medical censorship has been in full force during the “pandemic.” The journal editors and publishers fear the potential consequences of publishing anything that contradicts the “safe and effective” propaganda with which the public health authorities have bombarded us.
Florida pulmonary and critical care specialist Dr. Pierre Kory, co-founder of the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), reacted to the study in a recent interview with The Epoch Times, saying he initially thought allegations of vaccine shedding were wild “conspiracy theories,” but subsequent research revealed the claims to be true.
“I know when the vaccines rolled out, that’s the first thing that happened. Social media started to make noise, and it was really driven by women…who were reporting sudden menstrual abnormalities after years or decades of really regular cycles,” Kory said.
“And they were noticing that it started to happen. They were talking amongst their friends and these women started to notice that their cycles were off, heavy bleeding, missed periods, things like that. Painful periods. And they hadn’t been vaccinated. But everyone was getting vaccinated.”
Kory went on to say he began to realize the truth of the issue when the “fact-checkers” began to go after the vaccine shedding claims.
“But you know when there’s truth when the ‘fact-checkers’ come after you. So those Facebook groups were disbanded. They were deplatformed. There were articles saying how ludicrous this was,” he noted.
Notably, the FLCCC uncovered a 2015 FDA document earlier this year called “Design and Analysis of Shedding Studies for Virus or Bacteria-Based Gene Therapy and Oncolytic Products,” which describes how vaccine shedding occurs with gene therapy products — such as the COVID-19 mRNA injection.

On Sunday, the World Health Organization provided an update on Disease X, indicating the illness has been reported in the Kwango Province, in the southwest part of the Central African country.
“Panzi health zone in Kwango Province of Democratic Republic of the Congo recorded 406 cases of an undiagnosed disease with symptoms of fever, headache, cough, runny nose and body ache,” the WHO wrote in the disease outbreak report.
The report continued:
“Rapid response teams have been deployed to identify the cause of the outbreak and strengthen the response. The teams are collecting samples for laboratory testing, providing a more detailed clinical characterization of the detected cases, investigating the transmission dynamics, and actively searching for additional cases, both within health facilities and at the community level.”
Here’s the outbreak map (courtesy of Bloomberg):
WHO noted:
“Malaria is a common disease in this area, and it may be causing or contributing to the cases. Laboratory tests are underway to determine the exact cause. At this stage, it is also possible that more than one disease is contributing to the cases and deaths.”
According to Bloomberg data, the total number of headlines in corporate media featuring “Disease X” last week topped 69, the highest since February, when it was about 127. Notice over the years, including early 2020, when Disease X headlines spiked.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/eating-ultraprocessed-foods-raises-mortality-risks-especially-for-women,"Eating Ultraprocessed Foods Raises Mortality Risks, Especially for Women",By Dr. Joseph Mercola | The Defender,2 months ago,"Story at a glance:
Ultraprocessed foods have now become a major part of the modern diet, not just in the U.S., but worldwide.
According to recent studies, these foods now constitute 50% to 60% of the daily energy intake among high-income countries, and low- and middle-income countries will soon follow suit.
But if you look past their attractive packaging and “enjoyable” flavors — qualities that are intentionally given to these foods to make them more marketable and appealing to consumers — you’ll see that these convenient, mass-produced foods are putting your health in jeopardy.
Over the past few years, there’s been a growing number of studies about ultraprocessed foods and how they are responsible for the increase in chronic health concerns today.
A recent Swedish study joins this list, providing compelling evidence that ultraprocessed foods increase all-cause mortality, especially among women.
Ultraprocessed foods increase risk of all-cause mortality, study finds
The October 2024 study, published in the Clinical Nutrition journal, aimed to understand the molecular impact of consuming ultraprocessed food and how it affects mortality.
The researchers used data from the Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort study, which began in 1991, and involved 27,670 participants.
The participants were asked to keep a food diary, recording their daily meals for a week, and were interviewed as well about their diet. Their blood samples were also collected and analyzed.
According to an article in News Medical:
“Dietary item analyses identified that UPFs comprised 13.4% of the cohort’s total food intake. Participants with higher UPF intake were more likely to be female, older, never smokers, and low alcohol consumers.”
After analyzing their blood results, the researchers found that higher intake of ultraprocessed foods was associated with “unfavorable lipid profiles,” including reduced HDL, or “good cholesterol” and increased VLDL or “bad cholesterol.”
These findings demonstrate the nonlinear positive associations between ultraprocessed food consumption and all-cause, premature and cause-specific mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer and respiratory disease. A stronger link was seen in female and older participants, compared to male participants.
The study authors report:
“UPFs are often high in sodium, fat, added sugar and energy, but low in fiber, vitamins and micronutrients, which explains our findings. In addition, some commonly used food additives (e.g., emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners) in UPF, newly generated compounds during UPF manufacturing (e.g., acrylamide), and contaminants migrated from food packaging (e.g., bisphenol A) may also contribute to the adverse health effects of UPFs.”
Understanding ultraprocessed foods
In the featured study, the primary subgroups that make up the participants’ processed food intake include starchy foods and breakfast cereals (26%), beverages (23.3%), sugary products (18.4%), sauces and fats (15.5%) and meat and fish (13.6%). These are all classified as “NOVA 4 foods.”
What are NOVA 4 foods? To put it simply, most foods, even meats, undergo plenty of processing. Because there’s a significant number of processed foods out there, experts need a set of criteria that will help distinguish which foods are classified as ultraprocessed and which ones are simply processed.
To provide more insight into this, a team of Brazilian researchers came up with the NOVA classification system (derived from the Portuguese “Nova classificação,” meaning “new classification”) which groups processed foods based on their extent of processing.
Here’s a summary of the NOVA categories:
NOVA 4 foods, or ultraprocessed foods, are designed to have a long shelf life, even without refrigeration, and cannot be reproduced at home. If you check their label, you’ll see they usually have more than five artificial ingredients — most of which you are unable to pronounce.
The featured study isn’t the first one to highlight the damaging effects of ultraprocessed foods.
As the researchers noted, “Since 2019, emerging cohort studies … have shown positive associations between UPF intake and all-cause mortality.”
Below, we’ll discuss two more papers, also recently published, detailing the adverse effects of these foods.
Ultraprocessed foods increase your risk of cardiovascular disease
The featured study above mentions cardiovascular disease mortality as one of the risk factors associated with ultraprocessed foods; an earlier study corroborates this effect.
Published in The Lancet, the research looked at three prospective cohort studies to determine the association between ultraprocessed foods and heart conditions, namely cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke.
The cohort studies involved 75,735 participants who were health workers. Two studies were composed of female nurses, while the other was composed of male health professionals.
The researchers assessed the food intake of the participants every two to four years, along with their health outcomes. They found that the people who ate the most ultraprocessed foods had an 11% higher risk of CVD, a 16% higher risk of CHD and a 4% higher risk of stroke.
What’s more, the researchers corroborated their findings by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of publications and cohort studies from other countries. They found that participants who consumed high amounts of ultraprocessed foods had 17% higher CVD risk, 23% higher CHD risk and 9% higher stroke risk.
According to the authors:
“Typical UPF (e.g., sugar-sweetened beverages, processed meats, fast foods) are energy-dense and high in added sugars, saturated fats and sodium, established CVD risk factors.
“Albeit not focused on food processing, a large body of literature has consistently associated sugar-sweetened beverages and processed meats with CVD, similarly for artificially sweetened beverages. Compounds introduced into UPF during production and packaging may also elevate CVD risk.”
The study authors also pointed out that the type of ultraprocessed food affects how great the risk is — artificially sweetened beverages and processed meats were particularly harmful, while savory snacks and yogurt or desserts made with dairy had lower risks.
25 adverse health outcomes associated with ultraprocessed foods
Taking it up another notch, the authors of a June study reviewed existing meta-analyses and publications involving ultraprocessed food consumption, covering a wide time period — from the inception of these foods up until 2023.
The results were startling, as they showed that ultraprocessed foods were associated with 25 different negative health outcomes among adults, children and adolescents.
Some of these, like heart disease and diabetes, are similar to the results seen in the two studies mentioned above. However, they also noted other unique conditions linked to these foods.
These include respiratory diseases, kidney, liver or gastrointestinal diseases, mental health problems and more.
The researchers also explained some of the mechanisms of action as to why these adverse effects occur, which are mostly related to the processing methods and added artificial ingredients used.
For instance:
The authors concluded:
“Our umbrella review and updated meta-analyses identified 25 adverse health outcomes associated with higher UPF consumption. Of these, renal function decline, and wheezing in children and adolescents were convincingly associated with higher UPF consumption.
“These findings suggest that dietary patterns with low consumption of UPFs, which include higher consumption of minimally processed foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, milk, etc. may render broad public health benefits.”
The most toxic ingredient in ultraprocessed foods, more destructive than synthetic additives
Many of the studies above highlight the detrimental effects brought on by the additives and artificial ingredients used in manufacturing ultraprocessed foods.
Every time you ingest these foods, you are exposing yourself to synthetic flavorings, genetically engineered compounds, contaminants like pesticides and endocrine-disrupting chemicals like bisphenol A, or BPA.
However, there is one particular ingredient that is prevalent in these foods and causes the greatest harm. It’s none other than the omega-6 fat linoleic acid.
LA is abundant in seed oils, which are used in copious amounts when making these ultraprocessed foods. Around 50% or more of the overall calories in processed foods come from seed oils.
LA is a polyunsaturated fat, characterized by multiple double bonds that make it chemically unstable and susceptible to oxidation, especially in the presence of reactive oxygen species, or ROS, produced during cellular energy production.
This oxidative stress can lead to the formation of advanced lipoxidation end-products, or ALEs, which contribute to cellular damage by generating free radicals. These free radicals harm cell membranes, mitochondria, proteins and DNA, impairing overall cellular function.
Inside your body, LA also breaks down into oxidized LA metabolites, or OXLAMs, harmful metabolites with a profoundly negative impact on your health. Together, ALEs and OXLAMs end up causing mitochondrial dysfunction — a hallmark of most chronic diseases.
LA also has a very long half-life inside your body, which is why it’s more pernicious to your health than sugar. Its half-life is around 600 to 680 days, or nearly two years. This means it will take you about six years to replace 95% of the LA in your body with healthy fats.
This is why I recommend keeping your LA intake as low as possible.
To do this, you need to purge all ultraprocessed foods, seed oils and nuts from your diet. Ideally, you should only get 5 grams of LA per day, but if you can lower it to 2 grams, that would be even better, and much closer to the LA intake of our ancestors.
Restricting your intake of monounsaturated fatty acids, or MUFAs, like olive oil and macadamia nuts, is also recommended due to their oleic acid content, which is nearly as bad for your health as LA.
Clean up your diet by choosing whole, unprocessed foods
The sooner you eliminate ultraprocessed foods from your life, the better your chances of avoiding the health problems mentioned above. If you’re like most people, these foods now make up a significant portion of your diet, which is why eliminating them from your life can be quite overwhelming.
Starting slow is a good idea — for example, swap out processed chips and cookies for healthier snacks, like fruit slices or vegetable sticks. Get rid of all the sugary beverages like soda in your home and choose pure water or fruit juice instead.
The trick is to think of it as an opportunity for you to profit from every mealtime. Not only will choosing whole foods help you avoid the dangers of ultraprocessed foods, but doing so will also nourish and sustain your health.

A peer-reviewed study published in The Lancet forecasted life expectancy for Americans between 2022 and 2050, taking into account the impact of over 350 different kinds of disease and health condition,
Although US life expectancy is predicted to increase from 78.3 years in 2022 to 79.9 years in 2035 and 80.4 years in 2050, the increase expected to be “modest compared with that in other countries around the world.”
America’s global ranking in life expectancy will drop from 49th in the world in 2022 to 66th in 2050, out of a total of 204 nations and territories.
What’s more, the health-adjusted life expectancy—a measure of how many years a person can expect to live in good health, rather than just living—is expected to fall significantly.
Women’s are expected to be affected disproportionately, as the US falls from 54th in the world to 71st for female life expectancy.
“These lower rankings put the U.S. below nearly all high-income and some middle-income countries,” the researchers behind the study said.
Rising obesity rates are a “serious risk factor to many chronic diseases and forecasted to leap to levels never before seen,” Professor Christopher Murray said.
“The rise in obesity and overweight rates in the U.S., with IHME forecasting over 260 million people affected by 2050, signals a public health crisis of unimaginable scale.”
The researchers estimated that if authorities succeeded in eliminating risk factors like obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar by 2050, the United States would be able to prevent the deaths of 12.4 million individuals.

“This new guidance from USDA, which was developed with significant input from state, veterinary and public health stakeholders, will facilitate comprehensive H5N1 surveillance of the nation’s milk supply and dairy herds,” the department said in a press release.
Entities responsible for dairy farms, bulk-milk transporters, and bulk-milk transfer stations or dairy processing facilities that send or hold milk for pasteurization will be required to share samples upon request.
Herd owners with cattle that test positive will also be required to provide epidemiological information for contact tracing and disease surveillance.
Private labs and state veterinarians must report positive results to USDA from tests done on raw milk samples. Earlier this month, the California Department of Food and Agriculture suspended raw-milk products from Raw Farm after the virus was detected in some of its products.

“With Red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization board, and we’re hopeful that in the next few weeks we’ll be acting on that petition,” Jones said.
Red 3 is a colouring derived from petroleum that is widely used in foods and drinks, although it has been banned in cosmetics since 1990 after studies suggested it caused cancer in lab animals.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/ultraprocessed-foods-linked-to-higher-risk-of-depression,Ultraprocessed Foods Linked to Higher Risk of Depression,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"Higher consumption of ultraprocessed foods is linked to a significantly increased risk of depression, according to a new study in the journal Clinical Nutrition.
The studied showed that those with the highest consumption of ultraprocessed foods had a 42% higher risk of developing depressive symptoms compared with those with the lowest.
The study was conducted in Brazil, where nearly 6% of the population has been diagnosed with depression and over 10% of the population is believed to suffer symptoms.
Brazil has been a major focus for researchers, because rates of consumption of ultraprocessed foods have increased dramatically in recent decades. There have been headline-grabbing stories about food giant Nestlé taking boats deep into the Amazon to bring ultraprocessed foods to isolated indigenous communities, with terrible health effects.
The authors of the new study took data from the NutriNet Brasil study, which included around 16,000 adult participants with an average age of 46 years. Of the participants, just under were 80% women. None had a prior diagnosis of depression or clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms at the beginning of the study.
Results showed that over 2,300 participants developed depressive symptoms during the study period.
On average, ultraprocessed foods accounted for about 22% of participants’ total energy intake. Among the quarter of participants with the lowest consumption of ultraprocessed foods, they got 7% of their total energy intake from ultraprocessed foods; whereas for the quarter with the highest consumption, ultraprocessed foods accounted for just under 40% of their total energy intake.
Participants with the highest consumption of ultraprocessed foods had a 42% greater risk of developing depressive symptoms compared to those with the least.
The authors also conducted a meta-analysis of six other published studies looking at the relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and depression. This analysis revealed that individuals with high ultraprocessed food consumption had a 32% greater risk of developing depression compared to those with the least.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/federal-judge-forces-fda-to-release-a-million-pages-of-secret-covid-vaxx-documents,Federal Judge Forces FDA To Release a Million Pages of Secret COVID Vaxx Documents,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"A federal judge has ruled against the FDA and said the agency must release a massive tranche of documents related to the emergency-use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
The case, in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, was brought by advocacy group Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency (PHMPT), who requested comprehensive data related to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
The FDA sought to quash the case by claiming it would need up to 75 years to process all the data.
This argument was rejected by Judge Mark Pittman, who has said the FDA has until 30 June 2025 to release the information requested.
Concluding, Pittman said, “The Covid-19 pandemic is long passed and so has any legitimate reason for concealing from the American people the information relied upon by the government in approving the Pfizer Vaccine.”
In 2021, the FDA proposed releasing information about the approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine over a period of decades, following a freedom of information request from PHMPT.
The FDA suggested it would release 500 pages a month, which will delay full disclosure until 2097. The agency said the sheer volume of the documents and its lack of staffing would make any other approach impossible.
In response to this proposal, Judge Pittman ruled in 2022 that the FDA should release 55,000 pages a month, which would ensure all the requested documents were released by the fall of 2022.
Although the FDA has now released a huge quantity of documents, lawyers for PHMPT say the agency is still withholding critical documents.
Aaron Siri, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, said, “The FDA clearly lacks confidence in the review that it conducted to license Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine because it is doing everything possible to prevent independent scientists from conducting an independent review.”
He continued, “The FDA was hiding from the court and the plaintiff one million pages of clinical trial documents from the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-shots-a-dangerous-genetic-mechanism-of-action-study,Covid Shots a ‘Dangerous Genetic Mechanism of Action’ — Study,By Sean Miller,2 months ago,"A recent peer-reviewed study coauthored by Dr. Peter McCullough detailed the genetic-modification mechanisms of the Covid injection and concluded that a moratorium on its administration must be enacted. The research was conducted via analysis of data and reports reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that were used to license the Pfizer Covid shots. The data was attained via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. What was discovered was grossly-incomplete testing in the course of the vaccine’s development.
“For any other medicinal product, the regulatory submission would have been considered incomplete and most probably rejected. Therefore, a moratorium on the use of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines and boosters should be enacted at minimum, but ideally, they should be removed from the market and their use in humans should be stopped,” the study said in the ‘Conclusion’ section. “It should be the responsibility of the pharmaceutical industry, not independent scientists, to determine whether a medical intervention is safe. Based upon Pfizer/BioNTech’s data, safety of their COVID-19 modRNA vaccine has not been proven.”
The researchers began by describing the pathologies of the mRNA vaccine (more accurately modified messenger RNA or modRNA), as well as the adenovirus vector vaccines. They effectively describe them as genetic manipulation technology. While the study focused on the Pfizer mRNA vaccine (as it analyzed the Pfizer documents), the genetic modification mechanisms would assumably apply to the Moderna mRNA vaccines as well as the Astra Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson adenovirus vector vaccines.
“Traditional vaccines contain a target antigen at known concentrations from the pathogen (which can be live attenuated, inactivated, or a subunit of the pathogen) in conjunction with an adjuvant. Together the antigen and adjuvant produce an immune response. This is not the case with the COVID-19 modRNA (e.g. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna), and the adenovirus vector (e.g. Astra Zeneca) vaccines. These newer ‘vaccines’ are similar to a ‘prodrug’ as they use the body’s own cells to produce the viral spike protein in vivo at levels that vary greatly,” the study said in the ‘Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine’ section. “Prodrugs have no intrinsic activity to elicit a pharmacological response (in this case formation of antibodies) on their own, but give instructions to the ribosomes on how to produce the ‘active drug’ (i.e., spike protein). Pfizer/BioNTech’s modRNA vaccines have a pronounced pharmacological phase that is then followed by an immunological phase to produce the immune response.”
The researchers also pointed out that due to regulators classifying this exotic technology as a vaccine and not a gene therapy, the shots skirted the regulatory guidelines for what they actually are.
“…the COVID-19 modRNA vaccines are not classified as gene therapy products, whereas an mRNA vaccine against a non-infectious disease such as cancer is not classified as a mRNA vaccine, but as a gene therapy product,” the study said in the ‘Regulatory Guidelines for RNA Therapeutics’ section. “Therefore, nucleic acid vaccines against infectious diseases were specifically excluded from regulatory guidelines for gene therapy products. This has caused the WHO 2005 guidelines to be used for the nonclinical assessment of the COVID-19 modRNA vaccines. It is a regulatory requirement for manufacturers of a gene therapy product to determine the structure, concentration, and biodistribution of the protein that has been coded for produced in-vivo. However, that was not the case for Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2, as it was misclassified as a traditional vaccine.”
Due to effectively making the bodies of the injected ‘vaccine factories’, the ‘efficiency’ of the various bodies in producing the desired material (in this case the Covid spike protein) is variable.
“Injected individuals may produce variable amounts of spike protein for variable durations of time based on their genetics, age, hormonal and nutritional state, athletic condition, and batch of vaccine they receive,” the study said in the ‘Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine’ section.
Research into this fact has not been conducted, perhaps understandably, since research would likely need to be conducted on each and every person who received the gene therapy ‘vaccine’, as the effects are tailored to the individual’s own biological profile.
“Studies to investigate these factors were never performed in the preclinical and clinical phases of development. Therefore, BNT162b2 is not like any other vaccine that has ever been used successfully. The innate immune response is initially targeted against the spike protein, which is bound to the vaccinee’s own cells rather than to the invading pathogen,” the study said in the ‘Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine’ section.
Safety studies on the spike proteins produced by the vaccinated individual’s bodies were not conducted.
“By not performing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of the encoded spike protein produced from the modRNA, which was already known to be toxic via natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, the regulatory submission is incomplete,” the study said in the ‘A Review of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 modRNA Vaccine Submission Data’ section. “Thus, the nonclinical safety studies were designed to provide data that was insufficient for such a new type of ‘vaccine’.”
Not only were the spike proteins (produced by the body following injection) not studied by Pfizer during the shot’s development, neither were where these spike proteins ended up (their biodistribution).
“Pfizer/BioNTech had no idea how much of the spike protein is generated in vivo, or where it subsequently distributes within the human body. Moreover, Pfizer/BioNTech assumed that the modRNA vaccine resides at the injection site, concluding there is no need to measure the spike protein in the blood. This conclusion is incorrect based upon Pfizer/BioNTech’s own biodistribution study data that appeared following the FDA emergency use authorization, in which it was demonstrated that LNPs were distributed to a variety of tissues likely mediated via LNPs entering the blood stream,” the study said in the ‘Toxicology Studies Extracted from Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2 Module 2.4. Nonclinical Overview’ section.
While Pfizer did not study the biodistribution of the spike protein, they did however study the biodistribution of a marker protein, luciferase, which the shots also encoded for. This was apparently not conclusive to determine spike protein biodistribution however.
“Although no traditional pharmacokinetic or biodistribution studies were performed with BNT162b2 specifically, or the final modRNA/LNP formulation used clinically, Pfizer/BioNTech did conduct a nonclinical study in which biodistribution was assessed using luciferase as a surrogate marker protein, since it was assumed that changing the coding sequence of the mRNA was unlikely to affect its biodistribution or physicochemical properties. However, differences between the luciferase reporter RNA and BNT162b2 nucleosides (i.e., modRNA) could potentially affect stability or persistence of the measured signal since spike protein has a longer half-life than luciferase,” the study said in the ‘Toxicology Studies Extracted from Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2 Module 2.4. Nonclinical Overview’ section.
Like a regular vaccine, genotoxic (damage to genetics) and carcinogenic (cancer causing potential) testing were not conducted on the Covid gene therapy either.
“Although BNT162b2 might not expected to have genotoxic or carcinogenic potential, the encoded spike protein that is produced does. Therefore, these studies should have been performed. They were not,” the study said in the ‘Toxicology Studies Extracted from Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2 Module 2.4. Nonclinical Overview’ section.
Interestingly, the researchers also found several holes in Pfizers testing as it regards to toxicological studies on the novel Covid shots.
“Also, Section 2.4.4.6. Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity shows that these studies were performed using Wistar Han™ rats, a rodent species that is totally inappropriate for toxicology studies. A more relevant species should have been chosen for the toxicity studies on the developing pups. In addition, the distribution of the spike protein in the tissues of both the mother and pups would have provided much needed information as to whether BNT162b2 is suitable to administer to pregnant women and mothers who are breast feeding. Furthermore, male rats were not studied, and data on male fertility is unknown. Moreover, it has recently been documented that the modRNA may predispose otherwise healthy individuals to cancer,” the study said in the ‘Toxicology Studies Extracted from Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2 Module 2.4. Nonclinical Overview’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/watch-professor-tears-up-discussing-rising-cancer-rates-related-to-covid-jab,Watch: Professor Tears Up Over Rising Cancer Rates Related to Covid Jab,By Infowars.com,2 months ago,"A top Australian medical professor grew emotional at a recent conference, accusing Australian health authorities of ignoring a surge in cancers since Covid jabs were rolled out.
Speaking at “The Great Debate” conference in Perth last week, Prof. Ian Brighthope said the critical oversight on the part of Australia’s health department exacerbates a “potential long-term health crisis.”
“Australia’s governmental health authorities have chosen not to monitor new or emerging cancer trends following the widespread use of these vaccines,” Prof. Brighthope stated.
“It is troubling that the Department of Health has not made data on cancer trends post-vaccination publicly available. It is their responsibility to do so. This is a critical gap in public health oversight.”
The professor went on to say the health department should be concerned as Australians could suffer long-term health consequences associated with the mRNA jabs, such as cancers and genetic disorders, before appearing to take a moment to collect himself.
“Given the massive contamination levels of rogue residual DNA in the Australian vials, we must expect an ongoing rising cancers and other genetic disorders in Australia. This issue is a potential long-term health crisis waiting to happen. This matter must be taken seriously by every Australian,” the retired professor stated before pausing for a long period.
“We must advocate for immediate public health responses we need our health authorities to begin monitoring these trends. Without immediate action we risk leaving Australians vulnerable to a wave of preventive diseases that may devastate families and strain our health care system.”
He went on to strongly condemn the jabs, saying, “These gene-based vaccines should never have been considered. The technology had never been proven to be effective in preventing coronavirus infections. The technology had been shown to be unsafe, long before it was used in 2021.”
Elsewhere in his remarks, Prof. Brighthope discussed how he and colleagues had witnessed a rise in “turbo-cancers” and sudden relapsing in patients who’d been cancer-free.
Here’s a transcript of his remarks from TheGateWayPundit.com:
Professor Brighthope:Throughout the world, my colleagues and I are witness to a very disturbing trend that must be addressed. Patients who have been cancer-free for many years are suddenly relapsing with aggressive explosive cancers shortly after receiving booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. These cases show very rapid tumor growth following the booster administration.
Very rapid tumor growth. The nature of these cancers is extremely unsettling. They are not just slow-growing, progressive types we are accustomed to managing. They are aggressive, often presenting in advanced stages and affecting multiple organs by the time they are diagnosed.
[…]
These turbo cancers are emerging faster and more virulence than what we would expect in patients, including in patients who had otherwise been stable for many years… The public health authorities are reluctant to acknowledge the correlation. This is happening across the globe where the mRNA vaccines have been administered.
Australia has administered more than 60 million doses of these vaccines to over 20 million people. Australia’s governmental health authorities have chosen not to monitor new or emerging cancer trends following the widespread use of these vaccines.
Prof. Brighthope’s concerns came alongside other top Australian figures in the medical industry who spoke at the conference to respond to Western Australia Premier Roger Cook’s recent remarks, where he criticized the Port Hedland council for passing a motion concerning contamination of COVID vaccines.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/mexico-makes-record-fentanyl-haul,Mexico Makes Record Fentanyl Haul,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 months ago,"Mexican security forces made the largest fentanyl haul in the nation’s history.
Around 1.2 tons of fentanyl were impounded in the state of Sinaloa on Wednesday, where a bloody factional war among the local cartel is taking place.
“This is an investigation that has been going on for a long time, and yesterday, it gave these results,” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said at a press conference on Thursday, after the seizure.
Security forces discovered the fentanyl at two properties in the municipality of Ahome as part of an intelligence-led operation.
In the first property, 800 kilograms of fentanyl, along with precursor chemicals, were discovered. At the second property, a smaller haul of fentanyl, about 300kg, was found, as well as precursor chemicals, scales, and industrial mixers.
President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose 25% tariffs on all goods from Mexico entering the US if the Mexican government can’t get a handle on illegal immigration and the cross-border drug trade, which includes fentanyl, and a 25% tariff on Canadian goods as well.
The announcement led to frantic diplomatic efforts, as both Mexican President Sheinbaum and Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau contacted Trump directly in an attempt to negotiate an alternative to tariffs.
After a phone call with Trump, Sheinbaum conceded that caravans of migrants would be prevented from reaching the Mexican border.
Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump after a phone call and agreed to strengthen border security with the US to prevent illegal immigration from the north.
Trump has also threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods if the country doesn’t halt the production of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-supreme-court-hears-case-on-puberty-blockers-for-kids,US Supreme Court Hears Case on Puberty Blockers for Kids,By Michael Curzon | The European Conservative,3 months ago,"The first transgender lawyer to argue before the Supreme Court—or, as the Feminist newsletter put it, the first to do so “openly”—will today say that doctors should be able to prescribe hormone therapy and puberty blockers to children.
Chase Strangio, who identifies as a transgender man, said, “It is not lost on me that I will be standing there at the lectern at the Supreme Court in part because I was able to have access to the medical care that is the very subject of the case that we’re litigating.”
Justices who will hear oral arguments in “the most high-profile dispute on the docket this session,” over Tennessee’s ban on so-called “gender-affirming care” for minors, have refused to consider a question on whether parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions on behalf of their children.
Conservatives have, therefore, been looking further afield to defend their case—including, perhaps unexpectedly, to Europe.
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in defence of the state’s ban on some ‘medical treatments’ for children questioning their identity that
Systematic reviews by national health authorities in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Finland and Norway have all concluded that the harms associated with these interventions are significant, and the long-term benefits are unproven.
Official proceedings also note that “some of the same European countries that pioneered these treatments now express caution about them and have pulled back on their use.” In the UK, for example, puberty blocker prescriptions were banned for children earlier this year after a review found “there is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness.”
A whistleblower from an American youth gender clinic is among those cited in an amicus brief presented to the Supreme Court in favour of Tennessee’s ban today. Whistleblowers have also, of course, been central to the UK’s about-turn, which is itself at risk of being flipped yet again.
Describing it as the “marquee case of the term,” The New York Times highlights this week that the Supreme Court’s decision will not just impact Tennessee but “more than 20 other states,” too. A ruling upholding the ban could also prompt other Western countries to follow suit.
The ruling is expected by June.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/uk-seniors-would-have-huge-tax-incentive-to-choose-assisted-suicide-if-it-became-legal,UK Seniors Would Have Huge Tax Incentive to Choose Assisted Suicide if it Became Legal,By Jonathon Van Maren | Lifesite,3 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Well, that didn’t take long.
Less than a week after the U.K.’s assisted suicide law passed its second reading, people are already musing about the many reasons the elderly and ill might opt for a lethal injection. This was inevitable – once assisted suicide is legal, that reality factors into every major end of life decision. The only way to prevent this is to prevent assisted suicide from being legalized (which is still possible in the UK, by the way) in the first place.
A December 4 headline in the Telegraph sums it up: “The six-figure tax problem looming over Labour’s assisted dying law.” The lead gets to the heart of the matter: “Terminally ill pensioners could end their lives earlier to spare loved ones six-figure tax bills under assisted dying legislation, experts have warned.” Under the current rules, pensions “are passed on free of income tax if the person dies before 75 years old.”
Rob White wrote: “If assisted dying becomes legal, however, it could leave someone close to that age with an agonizing choice between prolonging their life or saving their family hundreds of thousands of pounds. Pensions specialist, Andrew Tully, said that the potential law change presented an additional consideration in what was already a ‘cliff-edge situation.’”
READ: UK Parliament votes in favor of bill allowing doctors to kill their patients
That is, someone who is 65 and ill could decide – or be pressured to decide – that opting for a lethal injection might be better for those who would thus inherit quite a bit more money, considering that if someone dies after age 75, “their beneficiaries have to pay income tax on what they receive, which could be up to 45pc.”
The Telegraph helpfully broke down the math:
For example, if someone died aged 75 with £500,000 in their pension pot, the person inheriting it could pay £225,000 in income tax if they took it as a lump sum. However, if the deceased had passed away any time before their 75th birthday, this tax bill would be reduced to zero. Andrew Tully, of Nucleus Financial, said it was “yet another consideration” for people at the end of their lives.
He said: “With pensions, there’s a cut-off age where death before age 75 is treated more generously tax-wise compared to deaths on or after age 75. This is a cliff-edge situation and a few days either way could have a significant financial impact. In some cases, it can be hundreds of thousands of pounds. When someone is terminally ill, consideration of tax and what money is passed on already adds extra stress, especially where complex family dynamics are involved. They’re at the end of their life, but at the same time are worried about providing for those they’ll leave behind.”
“We are yet to fully understand how the assisted dying legislation will work in practise, however, it is clearly vital that we create a system whereby wider financial considerations should not influence an individual’s decision,” Mike Ambery of Standard Life told the Telegraph. “In future, assisted dying will need to be a factor in the legal consideration of a multitude of financial circumstances, including lump sum death payments and estate planning.”
Again, this exposes the farcical nature of the “choice” and “autonomy” offered by assisted suicide regimes. The truth is that people will now be forced to make many, many choices that previously they were not faced with; that they will come under pressures, both internal and external, that they had previously not felt; that the option of assisted suicide will loom over every decision that they make. Only by keeping assisted suicide and euthanasia illegal can this be prevented. MP Kim Leadbetter – who has already noted that someone feeling like they are a burden is a perfectly “legitimate reason” to desire assisted suicide – is forcing people into this set of “choices.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/lawyers-slam-dojs-insane-online-gag-order-against-texas-doctor-who-exposed-controversial-practices-on-children,Lawyers Slam DOJ’s ‘Insane’ Online Gag Order Against Texas Doctor Who Exposed Controversial Practices on Children,By Didi Rankovic | Reclaim The Net,3 months ago,"The Biden-Harris administration seems determined to do a little more damage to free speech while on the way out and one example is the Department of Justice (DOJ) trying to impose a gag order on Dr. Eithan Haim.
Perhaps it’s the haste of it all but a filing to support the request for the gag order cites a number of X posts that Haim should be prevented from reposting, the inclusion of which has variously been described by their authors as “absolutely insane,” “unbelievable,” etc. move by the DOJ.
This new filing comes in the case United States v. Haim, where the doctor – a Texas Children’s Hospital whistleblower, who revealed some controversial transgender medical practices – is sued for alleged felony violation of HIPAA by exposing sensitive information.
We obtained a copy of the filing for you here.
However, those critical of the indictment consider it as yet another attempt to silence dissent and retaliate against Haim. The latest filing doesn’t do anything to dispel that impression: now the DOJ wants to stop him from reposting the many X posts from prominent figures critical of the department as corrupt, and of the prosecution as a way to silence this medical professional.
But the DOJ is asking a federal court in Texas to impose the gag order to prevent Haim, and his attorney, from making “inflammatory and unfairly prejudicial statements” that supposedly are “substantially likely” to prevent a fair trial.
What these posts contain is criticism and opinion freely expressed on X, including by Haim who has been trying to clear his name and expose what he believes is the DOJ’s attempt to intimidate and silence him as a whistleblower about transgender surgeries on minors.
Among the posts is that published half a year ago by Mike Benz, who urged “changing the guard of this corrupt Justice Department” that he mockingly referred to as “Merrick’s Mafia.”
One of the whistleblower’s own posts is also cited in the DOJ filing, designed to provide proof that it is necessary to silence him on the platform. Six months ago he posted that the DOJ “wanted to intimidate me into silence using every technique the federal leviathan had at their disposal.”
But, according to the DOJ, these examples of freely expressed opinion and criticism could fatally undermine the trial against Haim.
X itself tried to oppose the gag order, but that motion was denied.
“While the prosecution tries to make it sound like its gag order is reasonable, it would completely prevent Dr. Haim or his counsel from criticizing the prosecution, no matter how correct the criticism,” Haim’s legal team said.",0

J. Matthew Rice, Tennessee’s solicitor general who is defending the constitutionality of his state’s law banning children from receiving sex changes, cross-sex hormones and puberty stunters, asked the court: “How many minors have to have their bodies irreparably harmed [from these child sex change procedures] for unproven benefits?”
Sotomayor interjected, “I’m sorry counselor, every medical treatment has risk — even taking aspirin.”
Rice: ""How many minors have to have their bodies irreparably harmed for unproven benefits?""Sotomayor: ""Every medical treatment has risk. Even taking Aspirin."" pic.twitter.com/I4k8ujr5Hl
Sotomayor in 2022 similarly humiliated herself during arguments over the Biden administration’s vax mandates by claiming over 100,000 children were actively hospitalized with covid (the real number was 3,342), the Omicron variant was “as deadly” as Delta and covid deaths had never been higher (none of which was true).
Sotomayor, who describes herself as a “product of affirmative action,” also argued in 2022 that anyone who is familiar with FBI crime stats must be banned from Capital case juries for “racial bias.”
Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson — who President Biden selected after pledging in a corrupt backroom deal with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn to pick a black woman for the Supreme Court in exchange for his endorsement — compared bans on child sex changes to bans on interracial marriage.
Ketanji Brown Jackson just compared bans on sex changes for kids to bans on interracial marriage. pic.twitter.com/XOOZRLOI2N
Drawing parallels to the 1967 Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia that legalized interracial marriage in the United States, Brown said:
The question was whether it was discriminatory because it applied to both races and it wasn’t necessarily invidious or whatever. But, you know, as I read the statute here — excuse me, the case here — you know, the court starts off by saying that Virginia is now one of 16 states which prohibit and punish marriages on the basis of racial classifications. And when you look at the structure of that law, it looks in terms of — you know, you can’t do something that is inconsistent with your own characteristics. It’s sort of the same thing. So, it’s interesting to me that we now have this different argument and I wonder whether Virginia could have gotten away with what they did here by just making a classification argument the way that Tennessee is in this case.
As a reminder, Brown was incapable of defining what a woman is during her confirmation hearing.

“We have some big-picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st,” Hotez told MSNBC on Wednesday.
He then rattled off a list of viruses and pathogens that are on the radar of public health institutions, including Bird flu, “new coronaviruses,” SARS, “Mosquito-transmitted viruses” like Dengue, Zika, Oropouche virus, and Yellow fever, as well as Whooping cough, Measles, and Polio.
“All that is going to come crashing down on January 21 on the Trump administration,” Hotez claimed. “We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.”
Are Hotez’s remarks a warning — or a threat?
Hotez’s curious comments are reminiscent of former NIAID Director Anthony Fauci’s disturbing “prediction” in 2017 that a “surprise outbreak” would plague the Trump administration during his first term.

The case, brought by the Biden administration on behalf of families of trans youth, has brought the question of transgender youth and the role of state regulation of medical procedures into sharp focus.
At the heart of the case is Tennessee’s 2023 prohibition on prescribing hormone therapies – such as puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy – to transgender individuals under 18. While the law does not extend to surgical interventions, which are rarely performed on minors, it represents a significant restriction on gender-affirming care. While the Biden administration is leading the charge, the law is being challenged by three transgender teenagers, their families, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who argue that the legislation violates constitutional rights.
Listen:
As Truth in Media notes further; Chase Strangio, a notable figure as the first openly transgender lawyer to argue before the Supreme Court, articulated the case’s essence. “The government of Tennessee is displacing the decision-making of loving parents,” Strangio argued, emphasizing that such care is supported by numerous medical associations, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, for its benefits in alleviating gender dysphoria.

The state, however, defends its position, with Sen. Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, asserting that the legislation is akin to other age-based restrictions like tattoos or alcohol consumption, aimed at protecting minors from irreversible decisions. Tennessee’s argument hinges on the notion that the law regulates medical practices rather than discriminates based on sex or gender identity.
This case arrives at the Supreme Court amid a broader wave of legislation across the U.S., where more than two dozen states have similar restrictions. The outcome could set a precedent not only for transgender youth but potentially for all minors seeking medical care that involves hormone treatments or puberty blockers for any condition.
The courtroom was packed on Wednesday, with observers from various advocacy groups and parents of transgender children present, highlighting the personal stakes involved. For families like that of LW, a transgender teen from Tennessee, the law has forced them to undertake long journeys out of state to continue her medical treatment, illustrating the practical implications of such bans.
The Supreme Court’s decision, expected by summer, could either affirm the rights of transgender youth to access gender-affirming care or uphold state authority to regulate medical treatments for minors. This ruling might also influence future cases regarding transgender rights, especially in states with pending or active litigation against similar bans.",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/pandemic-brought-significant-increase-in-number-of-self-poisonings-among-young-girls,Pandemic Brought Significant Increase in Number of Self-Poisonings among Young Girls,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"There was a 37% increase in the number of deliberate self-poisonings by young girls, with a strong correlation with the pandemic’s social restrictions, according to a new Australian study.
Self-poisoning is the most common form of hospitalized self-harm among children and adolescents and increased in the decade before the pandemic.
The study, which was published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, compared the period between March 2020 and December 2023 with the period 2018-2019 and
found rates of deliberate self-poisoning were 84% higher among those aged 5–14 years, and 36% higher among those aged 15–19 years. There were only very small changes among males and older Australians.
Within the cohort of 5 to 14 year olds, self-poisonings rose particularly among girls aged 11 to 14.
The researchers say the rise in self-poisoning by adolescent females appeared to be driven by lockdowns rather than COVID-19 infections.
This marked increase occurred between March 2020 and December 2021 and coincided with widespread lockdowns. After the relaxing of restrictions in early 2022, there was a sudden drop and then slow decline; however, rates still remain well above pre-pandemic rates.
Another recent study provided further evidence of a disproportionate negative effect of the lockdowns and social restrictions on young girls’ health.
The study shows that the stress of the pandemic social-restrictions caused the brains of adolescents, and particularly young girls, to age at an accelerated rate, putting them at higher risk of various neuropsychiatric and behavioural disorders.
Using advanced imaging techniques, like MRI, the scientists measured key indices of brain health including gray-matter volume, cortical thickness and white-matter integrity, which are used to estimate an individual’s brain age.
Cortical thinning, for example, takes place normally over the course of adolescence, as parts of the outer layer are “pruned” to help the brain function more efficiently. It’s well established, however, that if an individual is subject to chronic stress in any form—whether that’s social stress, sleep deprivation or an illness—thinning can take place at an accelerated rate. When an individual’s brain age exceeds their actual age, there’s a greater risk of everything from cognitive decline to anxiety and mood disorders, especially among children and teenagers.
Researchers found a significant increase in cortical thinning during the pandemic for adolescents, indicating severe stress.
For boys, the thinning was localised, and mainly affected visual-spatial regions of the brain, but for girls, the thinning was widespread, affecting many regions across both hemispheres and lobes. These included areas responsible for social and emotional processing, such as the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal cortex. The researchers think this difference has something to do with the fact that girls rely more heavily on their social networks for support, and these networks were totally disrupted by the pandemic.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/208-million-americans-are-now-overweight-or-obese,208 Million Americans Are Now Overweight or Obese,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"More than 200 million Americans are now overweight or obese, according to new research.
Since 1990, rates have doubled. Around half of all adolescents in the US are overweight or obese, and three-quarters of adults.
The researchers behind the new study forecast that by 2050 more than 80% of adults and 60% of adolescents will be overweight or obese if current trends continue.
Body-mass data were taken from over 130 different sources and used to examine the historical and trends for obesity from 1990 to 2021.
With 208 million overweight or obese people, the US has one of the highest rates of overweight and obesity worldwide.
Research has shown that obesity accounted for 335,000 deaths in 2021 in the US alone. Obesity is one of the most important and fastest-growing risk factors for chronic disease and early death.
Obesity also has enormous economic implications. A Congressional report published this year predicted that obesity-related health costs will rise to $9.1 trillion over the next decade.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/liberal-women-sterilizing-themselves-after-trump-win,Liberal Women Sterilizing Themselves after Trump Win,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"Liberal women are undergoing sterilization procedures in response to Donald Trump’s election victory, according to Newsweek.
Newsweek spoke to five women who said they are so concerned about women’s rights under another Trump admin that they’ve chosen to have themselves sterilized.
“If I am to be denied any rights in the next four (or more) years, I will not give them up without a fight,” one woman from Texas told the outlet.
Another woman said, “I am not happy that I felt forced into a surgery I did not want to alter my body, I feel like the election tied my hands and forced me to be sterilized—that is horrible.”
The husband of one of the women interview had already had a vasectomy.
As Newsweek notes, abortion and reproductive rights were a major issue during the recent election. Trump took credit for the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, which removed the Constitutional right to abortion; however, the president-elect has made it clear that he does not support a federal ban on abortion.
It’s unclear at present exactly how many women have chosen to undergo sterilization procedures as a result of Trump’s victory.
In the immediate aftermath of the Dobbs decision, which repealed Roe v. Wade, there was a significant uptick in sterilizations among both sexes. Although the increase in the number of female procedures was almost double the increase in male procedures, the increase among men was still huge, and can only be explained as a response to the Supreme Court’s decision.
According to The Guardian, daily web searches for “Where can I get a vasectomy?” increased by 850% when the draft Dobbs decision was released in May 2022.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-land-of-future-milk-and-honey,The Land of Future Milk and Honey,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"This week, European dairy giant Arla announced it would be trialing a special food additive on its dairy cows in the UK to reduce their methane emissions. You may not have heard of Arla, but you definitely know at least one of its brands: Lurpak butter, Castello cheeses, Cravendale milk.
The proprietary food additive, called Bovaer, is said to reduce enteric greenhouse gas emissions—read: cow farts and burps—by as much as 27%. Bovaer is being added to forage for cows on 30 Arla farms across the UK, in partnership with big supermarket players Morrisons, Tesco and Aldi.
Arla wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% per kilo of milk, by 2030—a key date in the globalist calendar, owing to the emissions targets in the Paris Climate Accords and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The World Economic Forum’s famous thinkpiece was called “Welcome to 2030” for a reason. 2030 is a key “inflection point,” even a “tipping point.”
The aim, clearly, is for the Arla trial to lead to a rollout of Bovaer on a massive scale, across the corporation’s entire Europe-wide network of cooperative farms. There are 2,500 Arla farmers in the UK alone, and many thousands in other European nations. Arla is the sixth largest dairy corporation in the world, with an annual net revenue of nearly 14 billion euros.
Arla haven’t actually said anything about what Bovaer is, but you can look it up. Wikipedia will tell you. Bovaer is a mixture of silicon dioxide, propylene glycol and 3-nitrooxypropanol. It’s that last ingredient that’s key, because it impairs the enzyme methyl coenzyme M reductase, which is involved in the production of methane in the cow’s rumen. Bovaer isn’t GMO, but it is proprietary nonetheless, being manufactured by a Belgian-Swiss perfume company called DSM Firmenich.
Announcement of the initiative was greeted with widespread anger on social media, as consumers realized they would have to forego some of their favorite dairy brands if they want to be certain to avoid participating in Arla’s little experiment. Thousands of users tweeted their displeasure, and other dairy players, large and small, tweeted out messages of reassurance to their customers that they would not be adding Bovaer, or anything else like it, to their animal feed this winter or indeed ever.
Arla’s response was predictable. They and their supporters reached for familiar labels: “misinformation,” “baseless conspiracy theories” and so on. Reporting—like this piece from The Grocer—focused on “unsubstantiated claims the additive could be unsafe” and “wider conspiracy theories centring on Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum and climate change denial.”
It’s true: DSM Firmenich isn’t owned by Bill Gates and has nothing to do with the lilac-sweater-wearing, poop-water-sniffing misanthrope who still hasn’t explained to anybody’s satisfaction his friendship with the late Jeffrey Epstein. But Gates money is being used to develop a methane-reducing feed additive that’s very like Bovaer.
Don’t get me wrong: Bovaer has been approved as safe in multiple countries and territories around the world. In 2021, it was approved for use in Brazil, and then Chile. The next year it was approved in the EU, and now this year the FDA and Canada’s regulators have given it the green light, too; although it’s unclear when or on what scale it will start being used in the US. In 2022, DSM Firmenich and US company Elanco Animal Health Inc. entered into an exclusive licensing agreement for Bovaer in the US, so we can be sure, at least, that it’s coming to US dairy farms at some point in the near future.
Of course, approval doesn’t mean a product—a food additive, a medicine, an industrial chemical—is safe. Just ask the children born with seal flippers instead of limbs because their mothers were given thalidomide. That went on for the better part of a decade before anything was done about it. After decades, the addition of fluoride to public water supplies across the US is about to be reversed, because of what we now know about fluoride’s effects on IQ and cognitive development.
I’m not saying Bovaer is thalidomide. What I am saying is that consumers have a right to know what’s going in their food products, why it’s being added and—most of all—whether it’s truly safe. What’s more, consumers should have a clear choice about whether they consume particular chemicals and substances. Products should be properly and clearly labelled.
Unfortunately, it looks like that last piece of basic decency isn’t going to be honored by corporate food producers. Events from elsewhere in Europe give a clear suggestion of where we’re going with Bovaer and with other “climate-saving” additions to the food supply.
Norwegian dairy corporation Tine started adding methane-inhibitors to its branded “Future Milk” a little while ago, and told consumers the product was more climate-friendly. They thought their Norwegian customers, complaisant beings that those once-Vikings now are, would rush to do their bit for the planet by drinking the special milk.
Instead, Tine got the same frosty reception as Arla just did. Nobody wanted to drink the special milk.
So what did Tine do? They stopped selling Future Milk and just mixed the special milk in with their normal milk and didn’t tell anyone. Now consumers of Tine’s milk have no choice but to drink “Future Milk.” Very clever.
In the Norwegian case, it doesn’t really matter anyway, because the government has already decided that by 2027 all dairy cows must be fed methane-inhibitors. Come to Norway, they’ll say, the land of Future Milk and honey.
Corporate control of the food supply, and secrecy about what substances corporations add to their products, has been a disaster for our health, especially in the US. The FDA’s Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) system stands as a beacon of insanity in this regard, allowing corporations to create new food additives, say they’re safe on the basis of “internal data” and then add them to their products for sale without any oversight whatsoever. Whereas there are around 2,000 food additives licensed for use in the EU, nobody has a bloody clue how many are being used in the US. It may be 10,000. It may be more.
External testing of many of these additives reveals them to be harmful. That’s why Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made reform of the FDA and food-additive licensing a central plank of his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. The food supply needs transparency. Secrecy is making us fat, sick and depressed like never before. The secrecy is killing us.
Unfortunately, the climate-change agenda provides a compelling reason for more, not less, secrecy in the food supply. For more, not less, choice.
After all, it’s for the greater good—the benevolent tyrant’s refrain. Be a good child and drink your milk and don’t ask questions.",0

Kennedy’s nomination as head of Health and Human Services.
Analysis by The Federalist revealed individual payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars to Committee members.
“Republicans overall brought in nearly $5 million from the pharmaceutical industry across 13 members while Democrats raised more than $1.7 million across 9,” according to The Federalist.
The Committee, which will have a Republican majority under the new Trump administration, will vote to confirm Kennedy in January.
Between 2019 and 2024, Big Pharma contributed over $6.7 million to members of the Senate Finance Committee.
Among Republican members of the Committee, the most money was given to Sen. Thom Tillis, who received over $679,000. Next was Sen. Bill Cassidy, with more than $667,000, followed by Sen. Tim Scott, who received almost $564,000.
On the Democrat side, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto received nearly $460,000. Sen. Maggie Hassan received more than $360,000, and Sen. Ron Wyden was given $352,000.
As The Federalist notes, the payments don’t necessarily mean the senators will vote against the appointment.
Republican Senator Ron Johnson, for example, has received over $120,000 in Big Pharma contributions in the last five years, but has been a strong critical voice in the Senate. In September, he hosted a roundtable on the US chronic-disease epidemic at which RFK Jr. and other important critics of the medical industry spoke. Johnson has also demanded public-health agencies provide unredacted development and safety data about COVID vaccines.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/federal-covid-inquiry-finds-public-trust-plummeted,Federal Covid Inquiry Finds Public Trust Plummeted,By Rebekah Barnett | Brownstone Institute,3 months ago,"In a report handed down on Tuesday, Australia’s federal Covid Inquiry found that extreme public health restrictions, coupled with a lack of transparency about the evidence informing these decisions, has led to a major slide in public trust.
Apparently we need experts and a federal inquiry to tell us the bleeding obvious.
This, by the way, is not a Covid inquiry “like a royal commission,” as was promised by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese prior to his election, but is the toothless ‘royal commission lite’ alternative put forward by Albanese after he got into power.
From the Australian,
“The long-awaited report into Australia’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has lashed state premiers for fuelling distrust and confusion, and for adopting draconian border closures that lacked consistency and compassion…
“In the report, the panel argued the need for transparency in future pandemic responses after “economic, social and mental health and human rights impacts were not always understood or considered” in 2020.”
That’s putting it lightly.
Economic, social and mental health, and human rights impacts weren’t considered at all.
That’s why the Queensland Supreme Court ruled that Covid vaccine mandates enforced by the Police Commissioner were unlawful. Justice Glenn Martin held that the Police Commissioner “did not consider the human rights ramifications” before issuing the Covid workplace vaccination directive within the Queensland Police Service (QPS).
When asked about potential human rights abuses caused by his government’s heavy-handed Covid response, former Victorian Premier Dan Andrews retorted, “Seriously? One more comment about human rights – honestly.”
In one egregious case, the Ombudsman determined that the Andrews Government had “breached human rights” by confining over 3,000 Melburnians to nine tower blocks, under police guard, for up to two weeks.
Back to the Australian,
“[The report] lashed “control measures” instituted by state and federal authorities without sufficient explanation.
“This fed the perception that the government did not trust the public to understand or interpret the information correctly and contributed to the decrease in trust,” the summary reads.
“It was the mandating of public health restrictions, especially vaccination, that had the biggest negative impact on trust. The combination of mandatory measures and the perception people had that they were unable to criticise or question government decisions and policies has contributed to non‑mandated vaccination rates falling to dangerously low levels.”
This is absolutely the case. The hashtag I used the most on social media during Australia’s Covid response was, ‘make it make sense.’
There is nothing like aggressively wresting human and civil rights away from a population to forcibly impose rules that fly in the face of available evidence, whilst censoring those who try to point this out, and refusing to reveal information on which your rules are based, to bottom out trust in the population at large.
The biggest failure by far was the silver bullet vaccines that authorities mandated in order to prevent infection and transmission, when they were not tested for such endpoints, and observational data showed they waned in effectiveness after a month or two at best.
Safety surveillance databases exploded with adverse event reporting rates never seen before, yet authorities still insist these are definitely the best, most safe and effective products ever deployed on the population.
It’s small wonder then that fewer than 4% of Australians under the age of 65 have bothered to get a booster in the past six months.
But the nonsensical Covid response wasn’t just limited to the failure of the vaccines to deliver as promised. A few other rules that made no sense:
You need to be protected by a mask standing up, but if sitting at a table you are safe.
Mandatory vaccines are voluntary.
Rapid antigen tests are illegal – wait, now they’re mandatory.
Footballers can cross the border safely but children wishing to visit a dying parent cannot.
And so on, and so on, and so on.
To this day, federal, state, and territory governments have blocked all attempts to access the health advice on which their extremist policies were based.
In an address on Tuesday, Health Minister Mark Butler admitted that “heavy-handed” policies implemented during the pandemic eroded trust, and that “many of the measures taken during Covid-19 are unlikely to be accepted by the population again.”
But don’t think for one second that means they won’t try it again.
Just as the Queensland Government took its Supreme Court loss as a signal that it needs to add a ‘considering human rights’ box-ticking exercise next time it breaches human rights to bring in a mandate, the federal Covid Inquiry report recommends ways to do the whole shebang next time, but better.
That includes more spending, fast-tracking the new Australian Centre for Disease Control (CDC, which the government has invested $251.7 million to establish), and better global coordination, particularly with the World Health Organisation’s One Health policy.
The report recommends transparent, evidence-based decision-making next time around, but in light of my recent interactions with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), forgive me for considering this a pipe dream under the political status quo.
Butler said that the report was not about laying blame for individual decisions, but was rather about learning lessons. In other words, there will be no accountability.
Instead, Covid premiers and leaders have been awarded medals and cushy jobs. Most recently, Andrews was appointed to the lucrative role of chairman of Orygen, a youth mental health not-for-profit, to collective outrage.
A good thing that has come out of the report is that government overreach on vaccination mandates has been squarely blamed for a drop in vaccination rates in Australia more generally (not just for Covid vaccines).
“The erosion of trust is not only constraining our ability to respond to a pandemic when it next occurs, but it’s already, we know, bled into the performance of our vaccination programs, including our childhood vaccination programs,” said Butler.
“Since the beginning of Covid…we’ve seen a reduction of seven or eight percentage points in participation in the whooping cough vaccination program for under fives and measles vaccination program for under fives, which means we are well below herd immunity levels for those two really important diseases.”
Nice to see a politician finally admit the role of government in driving this trend, which is too often blamed on the boogeyman of ‘misinformation.’

https://www.infowars.com/posts/climate-anxiety-a-regime-created-illness,Climate Anxiety: A Regime-Created “Illness”,By Jane L. Johnson | Mises Institute,3 months ago,"A quick internet search for “climate anxiety,” which is also often referred to as “eco-anxiety,” “eco-grief,” or “climate doom,” produces numerous links to the psychological and psychiatric literature on the topic. The Program on Climate Change Communication within the Yale School of the Environment appears to be a major contributor to this research. Mental health professionals and mass trauma researchers report seeing more patients with symptoms of this anxiety, but they’re not always sure how to treat it.
Reputable medical establishments such as the Cleveland Clinic clarify that, although this psychological condition isn’t a medical diagnosis, it is a commonly-accepted popular term used to describe a collection of symptoms triggered by long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns, and can be exacerbated by other existing anxiety disorders. Experts find that the age 16-34 demographic—those known as Generation Z and Millennials—is particularly vulnerable to climate anxiety.
Some even believe that the condition may increase the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition that is caused by either being part of an extremely traumatic event, or witnessing it. Some also believe that indigenous people are some of the most vulnerable populations to experience negative impacts as a result of direct exposure to climate change. The list of climate-anxiety symptoms is extensive:
An example of this last symptom might be, for example, decisions about having children because of the belief that they would damage the planet (or because the planet could damage children). This is increasingly a fear that many young adults—the demographic most vulnerable to climate anxiety—have expressed and that could have serious repercussions for the entire world.
Investigators at the Yale climate change program have found that 64 percent of Americans said they were “at least somewhat worried” about global warming. These mental health experts believe that this 64 percent finding in itself is healthy because worrying somewhat about something motivates a person to figure out what he can do about it. Thus, they advocate that more people should be worried about climate change.
But they also caution that worry can be a problem if it becomes overwhelming and debilitating, keeping a person from living one’s life, at which point it becomes a serious diagnosis. Climate anxiety, moreover, is highly correlated with generalized anxiety, so it tends to affect people who are already anxious about other aspects of their lives.
Further findings include that among Americans:
For those witnessing painful stress and tension caused by the climate crisis, the Vermont Collaborative for Practice Improvement and Innovation (VCPI) offers a 12-week course for individuals in the helping professions to build their own climate resilience and grow “ecological emotional intelligence.” The course, entitled “From Climate Anxiety to Climate Resilience,” is normally offered at $1,200 tuition, but discounted to $899. It is designed to assist coaches, educators, health or mental health providers, social workers, healers, and other helping professionals to maintain their own composure when sharing the same overwhelming feelings as those they are trying to help.
Topics covered in the course include creating safe spaces, one-on-one or small groups to foster genuine conversation for patients who are alarmed or obsessing about abnormal weather patterns, devastating floods, tsunamis, erupting volcanoes, and melting glaciers. Thus, everyone can rest assured that the helping professions are studying the rising tide (no pun intended) of climate anxiety and ways to ameliorate it. And standing behind their helping efforts are Ivy League universities and state government agencies with their expertise.
While some may question that a small New England state is sponsoring a class to assist the “helping professions” build their own climate resilience and grow “ecological emotional intelligence,” it is also sobering to consider that such instruction is necessary at all. What kind of society must offer instruction for these professionals so they do not lose their composure when treating others who exhibit symptoms of this psychological condition?
Is this newfound variant of anxiety so prevalent among the populace that the helping professionals themselves need extra assistance to buttress themselves as they help others who are assisting the general population? In any case, identification and treatment of climate anxiety could be considered a means to keep the helping professions employed.
And if climate anxiety is so prevalent, what might be the basis of this affliction? On this etiological level, one might question whether this newfound psychological condition may in fact be another example of using fear as a means to control the populace and manipulate people to behave in particular ways.
Some commentators contend that the recent pandemic lockdowns, mandates, and social restrictions, implemented by public health experts to avert virus contagion, represented a “dress rehearsal” for something similar with respect to climate change. Thus, climate anxiety may portend climate experts’ imposition of similar measures on the populace as a means to mitigate the effects of climate change.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/reckonings,Reckonings,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"A new study shows that the stress of the pandemic social-restrictions caused the brains of adolescents, and particularly young girls, to age at an accelerated rate, putting them at higher risk of various neuropsychiatric and behavioural disorders.
Scientists carried out a long-term study on girls and boys aged 9-17, covering the period from 2018-2021. On average, the brains of girls aged an additional 4.2 years over this period, while the brains of boys aged an extra 1.4 years.
Using advanced imaging techniques, like MRI, the scientists measured key indices of brain health including gray-matter volume, cortical thickness and white-matter integrity, which are used to estimate an individual’s brain age.
Cortical thinning, for example, takes place normally over the course of adolescence, as parts of the outer layer are “pruned” to help the brain function more efficiently. It’s well established, however, that if an individual is subject to chronic stress in any form—whether that’s social stress, sleep deprivation or an illness—thinning can take place at an accelerated rate. When an individual’s brain age exceeds their actual age, there’s a greater risk of everything from cognitive decline to anxiety and mood disorders, especially among children and teenagers.
And that’s exactly what the researchers behind the new study found: a significant increase in cortical thinning over a very short period of time, indicating severe stress.
For boys, the thinning was localised, and mainly affected visual-spatial regions of the brain, but for girls, the thinning was widespread, affecting many regions across both hemispheres and lobes. These included areas responsible for social and emotional processing, such as the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal cortex. The researchers think this difference has something to do with the fact that girls rely more heavily on their social networks for support, and these networks were totally disrupted by the pandemic.
The pandemic was hell for young people. There’s no other way to describe it. Anybody who was actually paying attention and not cowering in their home, spraying their mail and DoorDash orders with disinfectant, should know that, without the need for scientific studies. And yet, studies like this new one are useful, because they help us to quantify, and further understand, exactly how and why it was hell, and what the likely effects are going to be in years to come.
Last summer, I wrote a long piece on how governments and the willing public inverted the normal meaning of generational sacrifice during the pandemic, offering up the young, and especially the very young, to sustain older generations and the elderly, who were really the only ones at any risk from COVID-19.
I compared the pandemic response to the ancient Chinese practice of gegu, or filial cannibalism. In the utterly ass-backward Confucian worldview that governed China for thousands of years, where xiao or filial piety was the highest value, it was considered good form for young people to feed themselves, quite literally, to their parents and grandparents, as the ultimate display of respect and honour for the older generations.
Young men and women would cut off fingers or portions of the upper arm or thigh and feed them, often cooked in special soups and hotpots, to their elders. The practice might also be accompanied by coprophagia, as the young ate their parents’ or grandparents’ feces, in another revolting display of submission of the young to the old.
Gegu continued over hundreds if not thousands of years—cases were still documented in the mid-twentieth century—and frankly I can’t think of a better analogy for what went on during those crazy four years that many people, not to mention governments, the medical establishment and corporations, now seem content to pretend never happened.
The truth is, we abandoned the young. Worse than that, we tortured them, isolating them and depriving them of love, comfort and the friendship of their peers and their own families. All in the name of saving their elders from the disease, something it’s not even clear we actually achieved.
I think this bespeaks a broader, deepening hostility in our culture to the interests of the young, most of all the basic desire of the young to reproduce.
As I wrote in that long essay,
“The promise of rising prosperity that was once handed down from generation to generation is gone, and instead the young now look at the old and see things they are never likely to have: houses, spouses, and kids of their own. ‘Fur babies,’ vasectomies, and ‘van life’ are the new symbols of the barren and the dispossessed.”
But that’s another matter.
There needs to be a reckoning—not just of all the different harms that were caused to those it should have been our sacred duty and mission to protect, but also against those who are most responsible for that terrible dereliction. Two reckonings, then.
At the very least, we must ensure, if we can, that the pandemic response is never repeated. The general public must never be subject to lockdowns, social distancing, mask mandates, vaccine mandates and an endless barrage of propaganda designed to terrify us into conformity. It must be impossible for babies, children and teenagers to be treated the way they were treated.
Mother and baby should never again be deprived of their first vital skin-to-skin contact after labour, which floods their bodies with oxytocin and puts the seal on an unbreakable bond for life.
Six year olds shouldn’t be forced to stand in the playground in the middle of a little chalk ring, six feet away from their friends, or be sent home for months on end and forced to “learn” from their televisions and IPads in miserable solitude.
Thankfully, it looks like a reckoning over the pandemic is coming, now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be the man to lead Health and Human Services. Kennedy, as we well know, was one of the most outspoken critics of the pandemic response and the pandemic coverup. He was censored, ridiculed, smeared—and yet here he is now, four years later, about to lead the nation on a long-awaited drive to Make America Healthy Again.
RFK Jr. has made it clear that vaccines in general, and the COVID vaccines in particular, will be one of his principal focuses. He’ll no doubt be aided by people like Senator Ron Johnson, who has vowed to subpoena critical data on adverse health effects linked to the COVID vaccines, which health agencies have so far withheld from the public.
But something more fundamental needs to happen. The role of the medical establishment, science and Big Pharma in society needs to change. RFK Jr. knows this, and every time he says that the regulatory system for food additives needs to be overhauled and the revolving door between regulators and industry needs to be shut and locked for good, that’s essentially what he’s saying must happen: science, medicine and corporations need to serve our needs, the needs of the people, and not the other way round.
Scientists and drug manufacturers should never again be able to tell us how we should live—or worse yet, with the support of government, force us to live in a particular way.
Science and medicine have nothing to tell us about how we should live: about what to cherish, what to sacrifice and what to pursue. Medicine provides technical interventions that reduce pain. But pain is something it’s possible to relate to in many different ways. Pain isn’t simply something that must, in all times and places, be removed from society at any cost. That’s the modern liberal-bureaucratic view of pain, sure, and the one that informed the madness of the pandemic response, but it’s not the only way.
We need only look back in time, through the history of our own civilisation, to see that. For Christians, the presence of pain can be and has been meaningful in many ways: as a test of faith, as it was for Job, or as a reminder of Jesus’s suffering on the Cross. Christians knew that the total elimination of pain was in God’s hands alone, a goal for the next life, not this one.
And further back, for the ancient Greeks, pain and struggle were sanctified in the agon, in striving and contest that were thought to dignify life and bring forth beauty, even in the face of death and destruction. Life was painful and ended in death for us all, but a valiant, beautiful defiance of inevitability could raise a person’s life to the level of art.
This might sound a bit high-flown, I know, and far from what I’ve been talking about, which is the shameful neglect of our children during the pandemic. But the essential point is this: our subordination to pain, to the imperative to avoid it at all cost, has subordinated us to those institutions and individuals—Big Pharma, bureaucrats, health experts like Dr Fauci—that claim to be able to provide us with that relief.
They can’t, and even if they could, the sacrifice wouldn’t be worth it. Reckon on that.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/bird-flu-found-in-california-raw-milk,Bird Flu Found in California Raw Milk,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"Bird flu has been detected in a batch of raw milk sold by a California farm, prompting an urgent recall.
The California Department of Public Health detected bird flu in a batch of raw milk from Raw Farm LLC, in Fresno County.
The company has now issued a recall for all milk from batch 20241109, with a best by date of 11/27/2024. Purchasers have been advised to return the milk to the point of sale, and vendors have been told to remove milk from the affected batch from the shelves.
As yet, no cases of bird flu have been attributed to the milk.
According to a press release, the California Department of Food and Agriculture has conducted follow-up testing at both of Raw Farm’s locations in the state, with no further evidence of contamination.
Yesterday, Infowars reported that the CDC had confirmed the first case of bird flu in a child in the US, also in California.
The confirmation, released on Friday, follows an initial report from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) about the child. An initial test was carried out and returned a positive result, but had to be confirmed by the CDC.
The CDC says the child showed mild symptoms and was given antiviral treatment.
Investigators are now looking into how the child caught the virus. The child had no known contact with an infected animal, but could have come into contact with wild birds.
The rest of the child’s family tested negative for the virus.
There have now been 55 confirmed cases of bird flu in the US in 2024, 29 of which have been in California. The majority were exposed to infected dairy cattle and experienced mild symptoms.
In September, a Missouri man also tested positive for the virus after no know contact with infected animals.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/uk-plan-gives-gender-confused-women-lesbians-priority-for-ivf-over-heterosexual-couples,"UK Plan Gives Gender-Confused Women, Lesbians Priority for IVF Over Heterosexual Couples",By Jonathon Van Maren | Lifesite,3 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — If, 25 years ago, social conservatives had sat down, brainstormed, and attempted to come up with a headline that encapsulated the moral and social chaos brought about by the sexual revolution, I doubt they could have done better than this one, published by the Daily Mail on November 16: “Trans men and lesbians would get IVF priority two years ahead of heterosexual couples under NHS plan.”
According to the report, the UK’s National Health Service has put forward plans that will “give trans men and lesbians access to NHS-funded IVF two years ahead of heterosexual couples.” “Trans men,” of course, are women who identify as men, and thus can theoretically become pregnant (assuming that cross-sex hormones or other drugs haven’t rendered them infertile). To add insult to injury, the NHS plan also prioritizes single women over married couples, although it is not explained why single motherhood should be a social aspiration of the state.
To be clear: In vitro fertilization, in which children are created in petri dishes to be manually implanted into patients, is intrinsically immoral. From a pro-life perspective, the sheer cost in human lives alone is mind-boggling, and the separation of procreation from human intimacy is also a violation of the natural order. For those interested, I recently had a longform discussion with Stephanie Gray-Connors on this question in which we examined the morality of IVF in depth.
But the new NHS proposal adds layers of moral confusion on top of this. According to the report, lesbians, trans-identifying women, and singles “will be immediately eligible for IVF on the NHS — costing an estimated £5,000 a cycle – if they meet the other criteria such as a body mass index between 19 and 30, not smoking, being under age 43 and not having a partner with a child from a previous relationship” while “heterosexual couples … will still have to prove they can’t have a baby naturally within two years.”
In short, the state is facilitating and funding the procuring of children for those who cannot “have a baby naturally.” According to the Mail:
The proposed changes will cover a vast swathe of England including Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire. The plans, explained in a document called ‘The Case for Change’, are out for an eight-week public consultation ending in January, meaning the new policy could come into force next year. Heterosexual couples where one partner already has a biological child or children have also been dismayed to see that no changes are planned to the current rules barring them from NHS-funded fertility treatment.
Unfortunately, rather than questioning the policy of state-funded IVF entirely, family campaigners are instead fixating on “discrimination.” Lucy Marsh of the Family Education Trust, for example, stated, “At the very least these proposals seem grossly discriminatory towards traditional families.” Which is true, but the more fundamental issue is that these policies are discriminatory toward pre-born children, who are commodified, created artificially, and frequently abandoned in freezers. Any critique of IVF that ignores the intrinsic evils of the process is insufficient and instead affirms the morality of IVF.
Pro-life and pro-family groups in the United Kingdom should speak up firmly in opposition to this proposal — not just because the government is prioritizing the LGBT community over “traditional families” once again but because the proposal includes the mass destruction of embryonic human beings. As the culture continues to deteriorate, it can be tempting to respond to the latest outrage or the latest woke insanity while neglecting to stake out more fundamental territory. If pro-lifers do not speak out against the commodification of pre-born children, who will?",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/florida-surgeon-general-recommends-removing-fluoride-from-public-water,Florida Surgeon General Recommends Removing Fluoride from Public Water,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"Florida’s Surgeon General has issued a recommendation that fluoride be removed from public water.
Joseph Ladapo said fluoride should be removed from public water by 1 January next year or “as soon as possible thereafter.”
Ladapo said the measure was necessary because of the “neuropsychiatric risk associated with fluoride exposure.”
“Historically, community water fluoridation was considered to be a method to systemically, through ingestion, deliver fluoride to all community members. However, currently many municipalities across the U.S. and several European countries, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Sweden, have eliminated water fluoridation,” the guidance states.
The guidance goes on to list a wide variety of detrimental health effects of fluoride exposure beyond certain levels, which include “adverse effects in children reducing IQ, cognitive impairment, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, “increased neurobehavioral problems in children whose mothers ingested fluoride during pregnancy,” and “accumulation of fluoride in the pineal gland, causing sleep cycle disturbance.”
Ladapo added that “the previously considered benefit of community water fluoridation does not outweigh the current known risks, especially for special populations like pregnant women and children.”
The recommendation comes after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made clear that removing fluoride from public water will be one of the new Trump administration’s top health priorities.
“On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy Tweeted.
“Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President ​@realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.”
In September, Judge Edward Chen, in the Northern District of California, ruled that fluoride in drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children.
“In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote.
“EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.”
American towns have already started removing fluoride from their water supplies after Judge Chen’s ruling.
Yorktown and Somers, both in New York State, have both announced an end to municipal fluoridation.
Somers Supervisor Robert Scorrano said that the town’s decision to stop fluoridating the municipal water supply would “give residents the freedom to choose their own sources of fluoride, ensuring personal control over their health decisions. Additionally, concerns about potential long-term health risks from fluoride exposure support reevaluating its use in public water systems.”",0

The confirmation, released on Friday, follows an initial report from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) about the child. An initial test was carried out and returned a positive result, but had to be confirmed by the CDC.
The CDC says the child showed mild symptoms and was given antiviral treatment.
Investigators are now looking into how the child caught the virus. The child had no known contact with an infected animal, but could have come into contact with wild birds.
The rest of the child’s family tested negative for the virus.
There have now been 55 confirmed cases of bird flu in the US in 2024, 29 of which have been in California. The majority were exposed to infected dairy cattle and experienced mild symptoms.
In September, a Missouri man also tested positive for the virus after no know contact with infected animals.
The case was the first in the US to be detected by means of routine surveillance and testing, rather than monitoring of groups, especially farm workers, deemed to be at high risk of infection.

Trump on Friday announced Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor and medical director at CityMD, would be his pick for Surgeon General.
But many online pointed out that Nesheiwat pushed for repeated COVID vaccinations and boosters, masks, lockdowns, school closures, social distancing, and other harmful COVID policies heavily promoted by the likes of Dr. Anthony Fauci and other public health apparatchiks.
“Be safe & protect yourself this thanksgiving holiday. Flu shot, booster shot, first shot etc. If you’re not yet vaccinated, get tested before gatherings to minimize spread,” she wrote on Twitter in Nov. 2021.

She even praised Facebook for censoring “anti-vaccine misinformation” and urged other social media companies to do the same.
Attorney Tom Renz suggested Nesheiwat receive the benefit of the doubt given many public health experts were “duped” into supporting the nonsense COVID measures in the early phase of the plandemic, but questioned “where she stands now” on those policies.
“The legit science and evidence are conclusive and it is unforgivable at this point for ANY doctor still defending the mRNA death shots,” he wrote on X. “I think the Doctor should speak on this. We the people WILL NOT STAND for more big pharma shills running our nations healthcare systems.”
Nesheiwat should clarify her positions on the COVID mRNA injection and other measures before she’s grilled before the Senate during her confirmation process, where some GOP senators will surely take issue with some of her past remarks.
Her current position should reflect that of Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Lapado, whose health department in September rebuked the need for Covid shots and listed several serious health consequences of the exotic technology in a public health bulletin.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-picks-dr-marty-makary-as-fda-commissioner,Trump Picks Dr. Marty Makary as FDA Commissioner,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"President-elect Donald Trump has picked Dr Marty Makary, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of medicine, to lead the Food and Drug Administration.
“I am very pleased to nominate Marty Makary MD, MPH, FACS, for FDA Commissioner,” Trump said in a statement, on Friday.
“FDA has lost the trust of Americans, and has lost sight of its primary goal as a regulator. The Agency needs Dr. Marty Makary, a Highly Respected Johns Hopkins Surgical Oncologist and Health Policy Expert, to course-correct and refocus the Agency.”
Trump’s statement continues that Makary “work under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to, among other things, properly evaluate harmful chemicals poisoning our Nation’s food supply and drugs and biologics being given to our Nation’s youth, so that we can finally address the Childhood Chronic Disease Epidemic.”
Trump went on to describe Makary as a “pioneer in the fields of Public Health, Cancer Care, and Surgery” and lauded him for his work at Johns Hopkins, as well as his authorship of “more than 300 scientific articles and three New York Times bestselling books on Healthcare.”
Although Trump did not mention it, Makary is also widely known as a critic of the pandemic social-restrictions enacted by governments. After initially recommending lockdowns in the spring of 2020, in May 2020 Makary reversed course and called for society to be opened up to avoid disastrous knock-on effects that would be worse than the virus itself.
Makary was also critical of the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, of vaccine mandates and of what he described as the “complete dismissal of natural immunity.”
Earlier this year, Makary appeared at a Congressional roundtable with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where he said “the greatest perpetrator of misinformation has been the United States government with the food pyramid.”
“We have the most overmedicated, sickest population in the world and no one is talking about root causes,” he continued.
“We have poisoned our food supply.”
On Friday, Trump also picked Rep. Dave Weldon, a Republican from Florida, to head the Centers for Disease Control, and Dr Janette Nesheiwat, a Fox News contributor, to serve as the next surgeon general.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/what-kennedy-must-do-to-defeat-regulatory-capture,What Kennedy Must Do to Defeat Regulatory Capture,By Bretigne Shaffer | Brownstone Institute,3 months ago,"President-Elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services is cause for celebration for anyone who cares about the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over regulatory agencies, and the deleterious effect it has had on the health of Americans.
It is nearly impossible to express just how remarkable and potentially world-changing this is. Only a few years ago, it would have been beyond the imagination of any serious political commentator. Those of us who believe in the freedom of medical choice – and especially those who have been personally harmed by the industry – have every reason to be ecstatic.
But even if Kennedy is confirmed, and even if he manages to implement his ideas, will they be enough to bring about real, lasting, change?
One of Kennedy’s primary targets will be the regulatory capture that practically defines the pharmaceutical industry and the agencies tasked with overseeing it. He has spent decades tirelessly battling this particular beast, and has recently articulated a number of specific policy ideas aimed at rooting out the “corruption” that characterizes the regulatory agencies as well as the world of medical research. But is that even possible?
In order to answer this question, we need to examine the nature of the regulatory state itself.
There is nothing new about private commercial interests seeking to use government force to subvert the free market to their advantage – and to the disadvantage of everyone else. The medical and pharmaceutical industries are hardly unique in this regard. Generally, interest groups, or individual corporations, do this by convincing politicians to erect barriers – in the form of laws and regulations – to those who would compete with them.
Much has been written about the extent to which the regulation of business sprang, not from a desire to protect consumers, but rather from the desire on the part of a few businesses to secure for themselves an environment in which they are insulated from competition. In their 1993 paper, “The Protectionist Roots of Antitrust,” for example, Don Boudreaux and Tom DiLorenzo look at some specific examples of business interests lobbying government to enact antitrust legislation that would stifle their competition.
They write:
“(F)or over a century the antitrust laws have routinely been used to thwart competition by providing a vehicle for uncompetitive businesses to sue their competitors for cutting prices, innovating new products and processes, and expanding output. This paper has argued that, moreover, antitrust was a protectionist institution from the very beginning; there never was a ‘golden age of antitrust’ besieged by rampant cartelization, as the standard account of the origins of antitrust attests.“
The world of health care as we know it today in America is the result of similar efforts by some practitioners and professional associations to defeat their competitors, not by outperforming them in the marketplace, but by enacting laws to limit their ability to practice.
Most notorious among these efforts was the 1910 Flexner Report. Commissioned by the Carnegie Foundation, the Report recommended closing down the vast majority of medical schools; streamlining medical education to exclude non-allopathic modalities (and mostly eliminating medical schools for women and African Americans); giving state governments the power to approve medical schools; and dramatically tightening medical licensing restrictions.
In fact, the Flexner Report was, for the most part, an unpublished 1906 report written by the American Medical Association (AMA). At the time, the AMA made no secret about its motives in seeking the reforms to which Abraham Flexner lent his name. It sought to reduce the supply of physicians in order to further enrich its own members. In 1847, the Association’s committee on educational standards reported that:
“The very large number of physicians in the United States…has frequently been the subject of remark. To relieve the diseases of something more than twenty millions of people, we have an army of Doctors amounting by a recent computation to forty thousand, which allows one to about every five hundred inhabitants…No wonder, then, that the profession of medicine has measurably ceased to occupy the elevated position which once it did; no wonder that the merest pittance in the way of remuneration is scantily doled out even to the most industrious in our ranks…”
The very history of the regulatory state informs us that it was not implemented for the purpose of protecting consumers from powerful corporate interests, but to protect the interests of certain powerful corporations and groups of professionals. It is important to remember this when we hear critics bemoan the “corruption” in the regulatory agencies, and insist that this can be remedied if we just put the right people in charge of them.
No. “Corruption” is the primordial swamp from which these agencies emerged. It is in their DNA. It is, in fact, their very reason for being. There is no “reforming” that which is operating precisely as it was designed to operate.
Moreover, even if these agencies had been designed with the interests of the public in mind (and never mind that “the public” is not a single entity with uniform interests to begin with), the reality remains that there is no mechanism by which they can be made accountable to us.
Accountability between two parties can only come when each party has choice regarding whether or not they interact with the other. This is not the case with regulatory agencies. These are imposed upon us. We are forced to use their “services” whether we are happy with them or not; whether they do a good job or not; whether they make our lives more dangerous than they otherwise would be or not. No matter how badly regulatory agencies perform, we are not free to take our business elsewhere.
What this means is that – just as with all other political actors – the leaders of these agencies are removed from the consequences that their actions have on others. In the case of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this has led to decades of malfeasance and error that have cost many, many, lives.
Perhaps the most infamous example in recent times is the FDA’s complete failure to protect the public from the painkiller Vioxx. The agency approved the drug in 1999, following which it is believed to have killed as many as 55,000 Americans before being withdrawn in 2004. Significantly, the FDA did not withdraw Vioxx from the market, Merck did that itself. In fact, it appears that the regulatory agency worked to suppress information about the known risks of the drug:
“A Merck memo uncovered in November showed that Merck scientists were aware in 1996 that the drug might contribute to heart problems. Then in 2000, a Merck study found that patients taking Vioxx were twice as likely to suffer heart attacks as patients taking older painkillers. Meanwhile, mid-level FDA officials who warned of these dangers were shunned by the agency. In FDA parlance, those with a “point of view” on Vioxx were unwelcome in certain meetings concerning the drug.’”
To believe that the Vioxx scandal was an isolated event would be a mistake.
Indeed, the history of the agency is littered with similar stories. Worse, it also uses its power to prevent people from having access to treatments that may help them, but that would not be very profitable, or which might otherwise go against the interests of the agency’s industry benefactors. We witnessed this in the extreme during the past few years, when the FDA and the rest of the regulatory establishment waged a war on Covid-19 treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, and even Vitamins C and D.
The FDA does not fail to protect the public because it happens to have bad people in its leadership, or because they are “incompetent.” It fails to protect us because it has no incentive to do so. We are captive “customers.” We cannot take our money elsewhere. The leadership at the FDA has no tangible reason to care about our interests. And there is no amount of “draining the swamp” that can change this.
The only hope, within this kind of system, is to defy the odds – and not insignificantly, to defy the vast sums of industry lobbying money – and get someone into a position of power over the regulatory agencies who has the will to force them to act contrary to their own incentives within the system. That person right now is undoubtedly Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and, should he be confirmed as Secretary of HHS, he will undoubtedly do some good things.
But what happens after he is gone? The system itself will not have been changed. The incentives that are in place now will still be in place then. What happens when there is no longer a good person, with good intentions, in a position of some power over these agencies? Should our right to informed consent, for example, rely on our being fortunate enough to have “good people” in charge of fundamentally unaccountable agencies? Agencies that have the power to withhold potentially life-saving products from the marketplace, while at the same time providing a false sense of security about the dangerous ones they allow?
One of the proposals Kennedy has put forward is to reform the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. He writes:
“Pharmaceutical companies pay a fee every time they apply for a new drug approval, and this money makes up about 75% of the budget of the Food and Drug Administration’s drug division. That creates a barrier to entry to smaller firms and puts bureaucrats’ purse strings in the hands of the pharmaceutical industry.”
Reforming, or better yet, eliminating, this fee would be a step in the right direction. But it would not change the fundamental nature of the FDA. It would not magically make that agency accountable to the public, nor would it remove the ability of those in the pharmaceutical industry to make other forms of payments to the agency.
Even now, the industry has other ways of exerting its influence, including the infamous “revolving door,” whereby agency officials who do well by a particular drug company while working for the FDA are later rewarded with lucrative positions in that company. And according to an investigative report by Science, post-approval payments in varying forms are also common.
Science examined payment records between 2013-2016, and found that:
“Of the more than $24 million in personal payments or research support from industry to the 16 top-earning advisers—who received more than $300,000 each—93% came from the makers of drugs those advisers previously reviewed or from competitors.”
Critics of this kind of industry capture have long called for “getting money out” of the regulatory structure. But it remains unclear how this might be achieved. Certainly, specific payment channels, such as the Prescription Drug User Fees, can be eliminated or banned. But to imagine that those in the industry would not contrive of other ways to buy influence is not realistic.
Just as critically though, even if pharmaceutical companies were somehow prevented from being able to pay off the agencies that regulate them, this would still not render those agencies accountable to the public, or to anyone other than themselves.
The only way to “get money out” of the regulatory state is to stop giving that state favors to sell. It is to eliminate the state’s power to restrict market entry and market participation. These are the political favors that powerful industry interests bid for. If we want to stop that from happening, we need to eliminate those favors.
Astonishingly, even after the past four years, there are still a great many people who believe that the regulatory state exists to keep us safe. That it withheld potentially life-saving therapeutics from us, not out of malice or the interests of its corporate cronies, but for our protection. That it worked hard to censor information about these therapeutics, and about the dangers of the experimental product it was promoting, for the same reason. That maybe some mistakes were made during this time, but that really, truly, these agencies are designed to protect us and if we just get the right people in charge, and maybe do a little tinkering with the machinery, they will work as they are supposed to.
Again, no. They are working precisely as they are supposed to.
But for those who remain unconvinced, for anyone who still believes that existing laws against fraud, malpractice, and other torts are not enough, that we need some sort of government oversight over the medical industry, let’s look a little closer.
Economist Milton Friedman famously recommended abolishing both medical licensing and the FDA. He wrote:
“The FDA has done enormous harm to the health of the American public by greatly increasing the costs of pharmaceutical research, thereby reducing the supply of new and effective drugs, and by delaying the approval of such drugs as survive the tortuous FDA process.”
Others who have examined the agency’s track record concur that the agency does more harm than good.
Nobel laureate George Hitchings, for instance, estimated that the FDA’s five-year delay in introducing the antibiotic Septra to the market resulted in 80,000 deaths in the US.
Drug regulation expert Dale Gieringer says that the death toll resulting from the FDA forcibly keeping new medications from the market far outweighs any benefits it may have produced. He writes:
“The benefits of FDA regulation relative to that in foreign countries could reasonably be put at some 5,000 casualties per decade or 10,000 per decade for worst-case scenarios. In comparison…the cost of FDA delay can be estimated at anywhere from 21,000 to 120,000 lives per decade.”
Economist Daniel Klein notes that, prior to the FDA’s powers being expanded in 1962, existing tort law did a good job of protecting consumers:
“The FDA was much less powerful before 1962. The historical record—decades of a relatively free market up to 1962—shows that free-market institutions and the tort system succeeded in keeping unsafe drugs to a minimum. The Elixir Sulfanilamide tragedy (107 killed) was the worst in those decades. (Thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States.) The economists Sam Peltzman and Dale Gieringer have made the grisly comparison: the victims of Sulfanilamide and other small tragedies prior to 1962 are insignificant compared to the death toll of the post-1962 FDA.”
He goes on to compare medical regulation to safety regulation in other industries:
“How is safety assured in other industries? In electronics, manufacturers submit products to Underwriters’ Laboratories, a private organization that grants its safety mark to products that pass its inspection. The process is voluntary: manufacturers may sell without the UL mark. But retailers and distributors usually prefer the products with it.
“Suppose someone proposed a new government agency that forbade manufacturers from making any electronic product until approved by the agency. We would think the proposal to be totalitarian and crazy. But that is the system we have in drugs…”
As long as regulatory powers exist that allow state entities to restrict entry into markets, and to dictate how producers may participate in those markets, there will always be those who are incentivized to gain access to the levers of that power and use it to further their own ends. Those who have the means to pay for this power will always find ways to do so.
What many call “corruption” is rather the predictable and inevitable outcome of institutions that are, by their very nature, unaccountable to those they purport to serve. The solution is not to get “better people” in charge of these institutions, nor is it to engage in a never-ending battle to stop participants from following the incentives the system has created for them. The solution is to remove those incentives. The solution is to remove the powers of the regulatory state itself.
If Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is confirmed as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, he will undoubtedly strike some blows against regulatory capture. Whatever he does in this position can only be an improvement over what we have now, and it is possible that some of his reforms may even endure beyond his own tenure. But he has the chance to do much more.
The regulatory state is a Gordian knot, and it is not enough to work at untangling its various components. It needs to be sliced through once and for all. The way to do this is simple: Abolish the FDA, abolish the NIH, abolish the CDC. End all medical licensing and accreditation. Get the government out of health care everywhere.
Perhaps this sounds like a political impossibility. And perhaps it is. But until very recently, RFK, Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services was a political impossibility. I submit that we do not know what is possible and what is not.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/weight-loss-drug-prescriptions-for-kids-and-teens-soar-despite-no-safety-data,Weight-loss Drug Prescriptions for Kids and Teens Soar Despite No Safety Data,"By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. | The Defender",3 months ago,"The number of weight-loss drug prescriptions provided by pediatric and adolescent medical specialists for children and teens increased sevenfold between October 2022 and September 2024, according to a MedPage Today analysis of Symphony, a prescription drug database.
Prescriptions for Novo Nordisk’s drugs liraglutide, the generic name for Saxenda, and semaglutide, the generic name for Wegovy and Ozempic, rose from 3,448 to 24,435 in the U.S. during that time.
Total prescriptions for all GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs — the broader class of drugs they are part of — prescribed by pediatric and adolescent medicine specialists, more than doubled during the same period, from 59,868 to 125,538.
However, those numbers do not even include GLP-1 drugs prescribed to children by primary care physicians or family medicine practitioners, or at compounding pharmacies, MedPage Today said.
Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Wegovy in 2021, the drug — and the entire class of drugs — has become a sensation, promoted by influencers and celebrities, helping to fuel a massive new drug market estimated to be worth $100 billion a year for drugmakers.
About 20% of U.S. children and adolescents are chronically obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The FDA approved Saxenda to treat obesity in kids 12 and up in December 2020 and Wegovy in December 2022.
Weeks later, in January 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued new guidelines on childhood obesity — at the time, it was the first update to the guidelines in 15 years — recommending early diagnosis and aggressive treatment.
The AAP recommendations included weight-loss drugs for obese children as young as 8 and consultation for bariatric surgery for children with severe obesity as young as age 13.
The blockbuster drugs work by making people feel full so they eat less. They have shown to be stunningly effective at helping people to lose weight. However, the self-administered weekly injections work only as long as the patient keeps taking them — otherwise, the weight comes back.
Patients who take the drugs long-term risk exposing themselves to a host of side effects, ranging from vomiting, diarrhea and nausea, and fainting to serious issues like pancreatitis, stomach paralysis and kidney disease.
According to one study, Ozempic increases the risk of thyroid cancer by 50-75%. In clinical trials, 9 in 10 people experienced side effects.
There are no long-term studies on the effects of the drugs in adults or children — a problem, experts say, because children will have to take the drugs for a very long time. One study indicated the drugs, which may seriously affect children’s growth and development, including bone density and muscle mass, have the potential for abuse and are likely to be overprescribed.
The drugs are also expensive — about $1,300 per month without insurance. Medicaid covers all obesity drugs for children on its plans.
Novo Nordisk is also running clinical trials for another GLP-1 drug, liraglutide, in children ages 6 to 11. In September, the drugmaker reported positive late-stage clinical trial results from its SCALE Kids trial in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Eli Lilly also has ongoing trials of tirzepatide (Zepbound) in children ages 6 to 11.
Pharma creating market for drugs kids will have to take their entire lives
Media coverage in outlets such as MedPage and The Associated Press on the rising rates of GLP-1 drugs for children has been positive, typically including anecdotes about children and teens who successfully lost weight and are living fuller lives as a result.
MedPage interviewed several doctors who praised the drugs, although they said they use them carefully. Some highlighted the difficulty in getting pediatricians, families and communities to implement serious lifestyle changes as justification for the drug use.
Pediatrician Dr. Michelle Perro, co-author of “What’s Making Our Children Sick?” expressed frustration that the skyrocketing use of GLP-1 drugs for kids is a boon for Big Pharma that places kids and teens at serious risk.
“Once again, children are under assault as a targeted market for taking lifelong pharmaceuticals via the use of GLP-1 drugs for obesity,” Perro, who is also CEO of GMOScience, told The Defender.
She said there’s no doubt “we have a significant metabolic health issue amongst our youth — with approximately 1 in 5 children being reported as obese. However, the exponential growth in prescribing and the lowering of the allowable age at which these drugs can be prescribed is stunning.“
In her practice, Perro focuses on addressing the underlying causes of childhood chronic diseases. “GLP-1 pharmaceuticals are toxic bandaids,” she said. “The real culprits of the obesity epidemic are the unbridled exposure of obesogens — endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the daily lives of our children.”
Those include everything from pesticides to flame retardants to ultra-processed food additives, plastic toys and cookware and cleaning supplies.
Perro was critical of mainstream experts who see the two possible treatments as “diet and nutrition” — which typically means encouraging kids to eat less and exercise more — or these drugs.
This approach is “outdated and myopic,” because it doesn’t account for the fact that children are not only exposed to a “chemical barrage of a toxic chemical soup, they are overfed and undernourished — nutritionally bereft. This lack of nutrients creates increased appetites as children seek more nutrition,” Perro said.
“They don’t need drugs: They need real nutrient-dense organic, regenerative food.”
Pediatrician Dr. Lawrence Palevsky also emphasized the failure of U.S. medicine to address the root causes of childhood chronic illness, instead focusing on symptom improvement.
There are multiple causes behind the childhood obesity epidemic, Palevsky told The Defender, including the societal embrace of processed foods.
“These food products are addictive and they barely have any nutritional value,” he said, adding:
“Children who eat these foods are starving. Starving for the proper nutrients to support the healthy growth and development of their bodies and, too often, starving for much-needed emotional support, feeling heard and seen, and desperate for the love they deserve. Eating comfort food products, in their minds, helps them ‘feel better,’ and makes the pain, grief, sorrow, anger, temporarily go away.”
Other factors like poor access to healthy food, poverty, parents who work long hours, peer pressure, school contracts for unhealthy food and addictive chemicals also play a role, he said.
Providing “an untested, magic pill that brings them some improvement but doesn’t really change the habits that brought them to be obese in the first place” robs people of the incentive to understand and address the broader problem, Palevsky said.
“We have created the ‘solution’ to treat the problem,” he said, “without really being disciplined and empathetic enough to stop the creation of obese children in the first place.”
Given the lack of long-term studies of the effects of these drugs, “whatever side effects we are seeing, should be a concern enough for us to be more cautious about using them,” Palevsky said.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/uk-regulators-decide-pregnant-women-dont-need-covid-vaccines,UK Regulators Decide Pregnant Women Don’t Need Covid Vaccines,"By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. | The Defender",3 months ago,"The United Kingdom’s (U.K.) vaccine advisory committee won’t recommend that pregnant women take the COVID-19 vaccine in 2025-2026, according to a rapid response letter published today in The BMJ.
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) made the decision during its Oct. 2 meeting, citing the low risk of serious COVID-19 illness in pregnant women and infants and the vaccine’s cost. The committee did not address safety concerns about the vaccines for pregnant women and their infants.
The committee’s new recommendation — which must be ratified at the next meeting — followed presentations by researchers on COVID-19 epidemiology and cost-effectiveness.
The researchers presented evidence showing that COVID-19 posed a very low risk to pregnant women and their infants and that the vaccines provided minimal benefit.
They concluded that COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women becomes cost-effective only if the cost of procuring and administering the vaccines could be kept between 10.07 and 13.19 pounds ($12.74-$16.69) per shot. They considered it “very unlikely” that this would be feasible.
The only way to increase the price at which vaccines were considered cost-effective would be if they could show the vaccine averted neonatal deaths from COVID-19 or posed a greater threat to infants. There is no existing data to support this, they said.
Doctors in the U.K. told The Defender they don’t understand why the JCVI hasn’t told them or pregnant women why the committee is waiting until next year to stop recommending the COVID-19 shots to all pregnant women.
Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to strongly recommend the vaccines for pregnant women.
On its COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy page, the CDC warns that pregnant women are “more likely to get very sick from COVID-19” than other people. It also says they are more likely to need hospitalization, intensive care, the use of a ventilator and experience complications such as preterm birth or stillbirth.
The CDC also reminds pregnant women that “severe COVID-19 illness can lead to death.”
Major physician professional organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine all continue to tell pregnant women the vaccine is “safe and effective” for pregnant and breastfeeding women.
The recommendations were made despite the lack of safety and efficacy from randomized controlled clinical trials among pregnant women and limited data on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy.
Pregnant women were excluded from the original safety and efficacy studies.
300,000 pregnant women need to be vaccinated to prevent one serious hospitalization
The UK Health Security Agency presented epidemiological data to the committee, showing there were no COVID-19-related ICU (intensive care unit) admissions or deaths among pregnant women in any trimester or their infants in the U.K. between October 2022 and December 2023.
In their evaluation of the “number needed to vaccinate,” a commonly used measure of vaccine effectiveness, the researchers estimated that 300,000 pregnant women would need to be vaccinated to prevent one serious hospitalization for COVID-19 during pregnancy, as such cases are rare. Similar results were observed for infants’ hospitalization.
The researchers estimated that just over 13,000 pregnant women would need to be vaccinated to prevent one serious hospital admission for an infant under age 3 months. To prevent one infant death, between 380,000 and 1.5 million pregnant women would need to be vaccinated.
They said the latter number was difficult to calculate with certainty, given the difficulty in attributing any infant deaths at all to COVID-19. They also said it was difficult to attribute any infant hospitalizations to COVID-19 — and that current data likely overestimated COVID-19 hospitalization among infants — because hospitalized infants typically had other coexisting infections.
Researchers from the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, and the Department of Health and Social Care presented modeled data on cost-effectiveness.
The U.K. will continue to use a “bespoke, non-standard cost-effectiveness assessment” through the spring 2025 COVID-19 vaccination campaign because they still have stockpiled vaccines available.
However, from fall 2025 on health officials will use JCVI’s standard cost-effectiveness model, which factors in costs for vaccine procurement, along with outcomes such as maternal or infant hospitalizations, ICU admissions and preterm birth or infant death.
Within that framework, the vaccines are not cost-effective for pregnant women and their babies, the committee concluded.
The committee agreed that starting in fall 2025 and spring 2026, only adults 75 and older, care home residents and immunosuppressed people over 6 months will be eligible for the vaccine.
They noted that COVID-19 showed no seasonality and estimated that overall the vaccine was 50% effective against hospitalization in the first four weeks following vaccination, with protection waning to zero by 28 weeks.
Cost-benefit analysis doesn’t include adverse reactions to the vaccine
The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t account for possible adverse events from the COVID-19 vaccine for pregnant mothers or their infants, despite many reports of serious side effects.
Pfizer sent the pregnancy and lactation report detailing the vaccine’s effects on women and babies from post-marketing data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on April 20, 2021, according to the DailyClout. The report indicated high rates of adverse events, ranging from mild to severe, including miscarriages and preterm births the company attributed to the vaccine.
Effects on lactating babies included fever, vomiting and edema, or swollen tissue, among many other issues.
Two days after Pfizer submitted its report to the FDA, then-CDC Director Rochelle Walensky gave aWhite House press conference, during which she told women there was no bad time to get a COVID-19 shot — before, during or after pregnancy.
Mainstream press ignores Pfizer pregnancy data
Pfizer recently published the results of its own very small randomized control trial results on pregnant women, which included only 391 mothers and 335 preterm and newborn babies globally.
The results, posted in the EU Clinical Trials Register, weren’t published in any peer-reviewed journal or discussed in the media.
Pfizer launched the study in February 2021, originally planning to enroll 4,000 women. However, the drugmaker ended enrollment early, citing the fact that so many pregnant women had already received the shot and that governments had endorsed it, according to an email sent to reporter Maryanne Demasi.
The vaccinated group received two doses of the Pfizer shot, while the other group received a placebo. The study was unblinded shortly after the babies were delivered and all women were offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
In the trial results, 2 of 86 mothers who got the vaccine contracted COVID-19 compared with 2 of 89 in the placebo group. The mothers in the vaccine group had higher rates of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, side effects that also occurred in the mRNA RSV vaccine maternal clinical trials.
Infants exposed to the vaccine in utero had a markedly lower Apgar score — a quick test performed by doctors at one and five minutes after birth to determine infant health. There were also indicators that some babies of vaccinated mothers exhibited decreased fetal movement.
Children’s Health Defense Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski told The Defender that a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of 391 people, only half of whom receive the mRNA vaccine, “is way too small to produce anything clinically meaningful.”
If the product causes a severe adverse reaction in just 1 in 500 recipients, it would not be observed, he said.
He added:
“It does not make sense to perform such a small, punctuated study to ensure safety. It does make sense if the company is just looking to check a box for friendly regulators.
“It also does not make sense to vaccinate the control arm one month after birth and still evaluate the infants as if they are unexposed, as shedding through breastmilk and other routes is a known phenomenon.”",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/studies-show-these-three-herbal-medicines-can-reverse-dementia,Studies Show These Three Herbal Medicines Can Reverse Dementia,By Lance D Johnson | Natural News,3 months ago,"More than 55 million people worldwide are living with dementia, and the problem is only getting worse. According to Alzheimer’s Disease International, dementia cases are expected to double every 20 years, reaching 78 million by 2030 and 139 million by 2050.
Dementia is a condition that’s often equated with old age, something that is “genetic” and inevitable for millions of people worldwide. However, new research shows that herbal medicines can reverse dementia and prevent memory decline, suggesting that there are more factors at play with dementia that are in our control.
Three little-known herbal medicines show promise for preventing dementia. These include: mamaki tea and fruit from Hawaii, Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa (jujube fruit) from East Asia, and Acorus gramineus (Japanese sweet flag) from China.
A study investigating the potential of the Hawaiian native herb Mamaki has revealed promising results in the fight against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. These disorders are primarily caused by the accumulation of toxic proteins such as amyloid-beta (A?), tau, ?-synuclein, and TDP-43 in the brain. This protein buildup begins decades before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that early intervention could significantly slow or prevent the progression of dementia.
A hot water extract of Mamaki leaves helped to reduce pathologies of dementia, restoring synaptophysin levels (a protein essential for synaptic function), suppressing microglial activation (a marker of inflammation in the brain), and improving memory in the treated mice. In addition to reducing brain inflammation, the fruit powder boosted the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) — a protein crucial for neuron survival and growth. It also promoted neurogenesis, or the creation of new neurons, suggesting that the fruit powder may have the ability to repair brain cells damaged by toxic oligomers associated with neurodegeneration.
A new study published in eLife Sciences highlights the potential of Zizyphi spinosi semen (ZSS), a medicinal herb used in traditional Chinese medicine, in combating neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers found that ZSS, in both its hot water extract and crushed powder form, demonstrated significant benefits in treating Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson’s disease in aging mice.
The hot water extract of ZSS was shown to reduce amyloid-beta (A?) and tau protein accumulation while also improving cognitive function. In Parkinson’s disease models, the simple crushed powder of ZSS proved even more effective, showing stronger results in alleviating ?-synuclein pathology — a key feature of the disease — as well as improving both motor and cognitive functions.
Acorus gramineus Aiton, a plant traditionally used in Chinese medicine for over a century, may hold promise as a therapeutic agent for cognitive decline, according to a recent preclinical systematic review. The study, which analyzed data from 34 animal studies involving 1,431 subjects, assessed the efficacy of extracts or active components from the plant (EAAGA) in improving cognitive function.
The review, which included studies published through June 2019, found that EAAGA significantly enhanced cognitive performance in a variety of behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze, electrical Y-maze, radial eight-arm maze, and step-through test. These tests are commonly used to assess learning and memory abilities in animal models. Specifically, the analysis revealed that EAAGA reduced escape latency and error times, while increasing the amount of time spent in the target area and the number of platform crossings, suggesting improvements in memory and learning.
The extracts provided anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties that suppressed excessive activation of astrocytes, which are linked to neuroinflammation. The study showed the herb can protect against neurotoxicity, regulate synaptic plasticity, and stimulate the cholinergic system. The authors of the review concluded that EAAGA could be a promising candidate for further research and clinical trials aimed at treating cognitive impairment, particularly in conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/disaster-waiting-to-happen-fda-approves-phase-1-trial-of-gates-funded-self-amplifying-bird-flu-vaccine,‘Disaster Waiting to Happen’: FDA Approves Phase 1 Trial of Gates-Funded Self-Amplifying Bird Flu Vaccine,"By Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. | The Defender",3 months ago,"Clinical trials — funded by the U.S. government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — are set to begin for a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine targeting the H5N1 bird flu virus.
Arcturus Therapeutics announced earlier this week that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a “Study Can Proceed” notification for its investigational ARCT-2304 vaccine candidate.
Epidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher told The Defender the FDA’s notification “means Arcturus Therapeutics can begin its “experiment of injecting humans with H5N1 bird flu replicon mRNA.”
Self-amplifying mRNA injections contain an enzyme that instructs the body on how to make more mRNA. Arcturus says the vaccine is “formulated within a lipid nanoparticle” and “is designed to make many copies of mRNA within the host cell.” This enables “lower doses than conventional mRNA vaccines.”
Hulscher said the replication machinery of self-amplifying vaccines behaves “like a synthetic virus” and “allows for an unknown period of toxic antigen production.”
Writing on Substack, immunologist and biochemist Jessica Rose, Ph.D., said the new vaccine has “major red flags.” She told The Defender, “Self-amplifying mRNA products should not be used. This is an absolute disaster waiting to happen.”
According to Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., senior research scientist at Children’s Health Defense, “Arcturus’ self-replication platform has all the hazards of the other synthetic modified mRNA wrapped in a lipid nanoparticle, just much worse. With self-replication it can become immortal, forever antagonizing your — or your fetus’ — immune system with antigens.”
Christof Plothe, D.O., a member of the World Council for Health steering committee, questioned the introduction of self-amplifying mRNA vaccines amid ongoing safety concerns about conventional mRNA shots. He told The Defender:
“The self-replicating technology takes the mRNA vaccines to a new level. The vaccine contains the gene for the spike protein and the gene for a protein called replicase, which allows the RNA to replicate.
“After the rollout of the first global genetic experiment with mRNA technology … it seems unbelievable that an even more aggressive attack on our body and genetics should be tried out.”
On Substack, Rose wrote that self-amplifying vaccines are genetically modified, as “the coding template is a modified Alphavirus [a type of RNA virus] genome with the virus sub-genomic bits spiked out and the spike gene ‘spiked in.’”
“Use of GMOs [genetically modified organisms] require specific licensing application and procedures,” Rose wrote, questioning whether this is the case for self-amplifying vaccines.
Small dose of replicon mRNA likely ‘more hazardous’ than larger dose of conventional mRNA shot
Arcturus’ Phase 1 clinical trial will enroll approximately 200 healthy adults in the U.S.
Rose questioned the clinical trial’s enrollment criteria. She said the criteria include a warning to “childbearers” to wear condoms when engaging in intercourse during the trial period. People who experienced “significant adverse reactions” to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are excluded from enrollment.
Despite Japan’s recent inclusion of a self-amplifying COVID-19 vaccine among the routine vaccines it offers to older adults during this year’s cold and flu season, Hulscher said trials for that vaccine revealed significant safety signals.
In clinical trials for the self-amplifying COVID-19 vaccine offered in Japan, “five deaths occurred among the injected in study phase 3b. Injected participants experienced a 90% adverse event rate (74.5% systemic, 15.2% required medical attention) after the first dose in study phases 1, 2, and 3a combined,” Hulscher said.
Hulscher said Arcturus’ claims that vaccines using self-amplifying mRNA technology create the impression that those vaccines will be safer. He argued that this would not be the case.
“Because they self-replicate for an unknown period of time, a small dose of a replicon mRNA is expected to be more hazardous than a larger dose of conventional mRNA,” Hulscher said.
According to Jablonowski:
“The difference between medicine and poison is dose — and you cannot dose the mRNA vaccines. Arcturus promotes ‘smaller doses’ as a feature, but the reality is that we have never been able to measure the antigen exposure from an mRNA vaccine.
“Even if we had a theory of how many protein antigens were produced per mRNA strand, we would never know how many times the mRNA self-replicated.”
Jablonowski said other risks of self-amplifying vaccines include shedding and possible hybridization with other viruses.
“It’s possible for exosomes to escape the human ‘host’ and transmit — or ‘infect’ — other humans or even animals,” Jablonowski said. “A scary scenario involves hybridization where the self-replicating mRNA could be incorporated into an existing infectious virus. … If the self-replicating mRNA teams up with a successful existing virus, it will alter Earth’s virome.”
Hulscher called for the withdrawal of all self-amplifying mRNA shots. He said:
“These experimental injections must not receive further regulatory approval for humans or animals if we are to prevent another public health disaster. All self-amplifying mRNA injections currently available for humans and animals should be immediately withdrawn until comprehensive, long-term safety studies are conducted.”
However, Hulscher said, Big Pharma is pushing for their continued development. “With at least 33 self-amplifying mRNA injection candidates in development, they have invested far too much time and money to back off,” Hulscher said.
Gates, Biden administration funding research into self-amplifying vaccines
The FDA’s “Study Can Proceed” notification comes amid recent warnings that bird flu might cause the next pandemic.
Arcturus noted that the clinical study is funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) — a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for developing medical countermeasures.
“Arcturus is actively engaged with the U.S. government to prepare for the next pandemic,” Joseph Payne, president and CEO of Arcturus Therapeutics, said in the company’s statement. “Self-amplifying mRNA technology is a key step in this important process.”
Not mentioned in Arcturus’ press release is a 13-month, $928,563 grant the company received last month from the Gates Foundation for “vaccine development.”
The Gates Foundation has supported mRNA bird flu vaccine research, including funding severalstudies and journal papers in the field in recent years.
In May, the foundation granted Imperial College London $227,360 “to investigate the translational relevance of self-amplifying RNA platform for rotavirus vaccine candidates.”
The Biden administration has funded several initiatives to develop mRNA bird flu vaccines, including self-amplifying vaccines.
In July, BARDA awarded Moderna $176 million for late-stage development and testing of an mRNA bird flu vaccine. Last year, three companies received funding under Project NextGen, an HHS initiative, for the “rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments.”
One of these companies, Gritstone Bio, received $433 million “to conduct a mid-stage study of its self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate.”
Experts who spoke with The Defender expressed concern about the involvement of government agencies like BARDA and private organizations like the Gates Foundation in developing these vaccines.
“Are we seeing the next lab creation to create global fear and suppression?” asked Plothe.
Rose addressed Arcturus’ statement that it is developing “a mRNA-based platform for pandemic influenza vaccine development” — that “may make vaccines available much sooner than egg- and cell-based technologies.”
“Why is the word ‘Pandemic’ in the title?” Rose asked on Substack. “It is more likely than not that this is the priming of/grooming of the public for the next ‘planned pandemic.’”
In 2022, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations — funded by the Gates Foundation — launched its “100 Day Mission,” to build the infrastructure for the development of a new vaccine within 100 days of the onset of a future pandemic.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/watch-lib-chugs-seed-oil-to-own-rfk-jr,Watch: Lib Chugs Seed Oil to Own RFK Jr.,By Jamie White,3 months ago,"Disgusting footage circulating on social media shows a deranged drug addict chugging canola oil in a bid to discredit Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s crusade against seed oils.
Kennedy has proposed replacing seed oils with beef tallow and removing artificial ingredients from food processing, banning fluoride from drinking water, and promoting a healthy lifestyle as part of his Make America Healthy Again initiative he aims to implement under the Trump administration.
“I don’t give a f*ck that they’re saying seed oils cause inflammation, and they seem to be the subject of every single post,” the man says, adding it used to cost him $200 to buy a drug cocktail known as a “smile.”
He then pours up a large cup of canola and chugs it down like water.
“Delicious! Don’t be a pussy!” he says.
Liberals have been melting down over President-elect Donald Trump nominating Kennedy as his Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).
They’ve not only been panicking over the prospect of losing fluoride in their water, but now they’re apparently drinking seed oils, which were first used as lantern fuel and industrial lubricants, to show Kennedy who’s boss.
This comes after The New York Times humiliated itself by unintentionally confirming Kennedy’s assertions about artificial ingredients in breakfast cereal while trying to “fact-check” him.
The left has not been in a good headspace since Trump won the election on Nov. 5.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/nyt-fact-check-of-rfk-jr-s-claim-about-froot-loops-backfires-spectacularly,NYT ‘Fact-Check’ of RFK Jr.’s Claim About Froot Loops Backfires Spectacularly,By Jamie White,3 months ago,"The New York Times was ridiculed mercilessly online over its attempt to “fact-check” Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s claims about artificial ingredients in breakfast cereal like Froot Loops.
Kennedy has been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to head the Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Following that announcement, The Times went to work to discredit Kennedy but unintentionally made his case about the need to purge artificial ingredients from Froot Loops and other highly-processed foods.
In the NYT’s Sunday article titled, “Kennedy’s Vow to Take On Big Food Could Alienate His New G.O.P. Allies,” writers Christina Jewett and Julie Creswell made total fools of themselves with the following paragraph:
Spitting out my coffee after reading this NYT ""fact check"" of RFK Jr. pic.twitter.com/sqL9jaeUR1
“Mr. Kennedy has singled out Froot Loops as an example of a product with too many artificial ingredients, questioning why the Canadian version has fewer than the U.S. version,” they wrote.
“But he was wrong,” the article continued authoritatively — except instead of debunking his argument, it went on to accidentally confirm exactly what Kennedy was warning about.
“The ingredient list is roughly the same, although Canada’s has natural colorings made from blueberries and carrots while the U.S. product contains red dye 40, yellow 5 and blue 1 as well as Butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT, a lab-made chemical that is used ‘for freshness,’ according to the ingredient label,” the report said.
How embarrassing.
The humiliating admission received a “correction” by the New York Times on Monday, calling it an “editing error.”
Listen to Kennedy’s relevant comment about Froot Loops and its artificial ingredients. You’ll notice the number of ingredients is irrelevant, contrary to the New York Times’ “correction” claim. Kennedy is actually talking about the nature of the artificial ingredients in Froot Loops:

On Friday morning, just hours after Trump picked Kennedy, Pfizer’s stock fell 4.3%. Moderna’s stock dropped by 3.1% and Novavax’s by 2.8%.
In the lead-up to the announcement, which was widely expected, Pfizer’s stock fell by 2%, and Moderna and Novavax stock fell by 6%.
Other vaccine makers including GSK and Germany’s BioNTech also experienced sharp declines.
Donald Trump has refused to rule out banning certain vaccines during his second term.
Trump, who has linked vaccines to autism in the past, said banning vaccines would remain an option.
“Well, I’m going to talk to [RFK Jr.] and talk to other people, and I’ll make a decision, but he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said.
Kennedy has spent decades campaigning to highlight the harmful, even deadly, side effects of vaccines and the double tragedy of families having a child injured by a vaccine only to hit a wall of denials and smears in their quest for justice.
“The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country,” Trump said in a post on X, announcing Kennedy’s appointment.
Vaccine makers like Moderna and Pfizer have experience sharp declines in their fortunes since the end of the pandemic. Over the last year, Pfizer’s stock has dropped by 11%, and Moderna’s has fallen by almost 50%, largely because its COVID-19 mRNA vaccine remains its only commercial offering. Uptake for COVID-19 vaccines has fallen dramatically.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/never-forget-cdc-planned-quarantine-camps-nationwide-sought-to-separate-families-control-community-buildings,"Never Forget: CDC Planned Quarantine Camps Nationwide, Sought to Separate Families & Control Community Buildings",By Lance D. Johnson | Natural News,3 months ago,"The rise of global medical tyranny in 2020 led to some of the most psychologically insane and abusive circumstances that people have ever had to navigate.
If the brave and the bold had not steadfastly resisted the propaganda and the totalitarianism, then the world would be in a much different place today – oppressed by vaccine passports, endless booster requirements, slavery and death. Without the growing health freedom movement, populations would be subject to the constant threat of societal segregation, loss of parental rights, censorship, intimidation and discrimination in the workplace, and intellectual suicide. In fact, America could very easily be dealing with quarantine camps if it weren’t for widespread awareness and resistance to the medical tyranny.
As medical tyranny was placated in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rolled out a series of totalitarian policies that fundamentally altered daily life, ranging from insidious mask mandates, social distancing insanity to discriminatory business closures, travel restrictions, plexiglass barriers and societal segregation for those who did not submit to deadly medical experiments.
However, these measures, which were already draconian in their impact, were only a fraction of what was originally planned. An ignored CDC document reveals that a far more extreme and authoritarian approach was in the works — one that would have involved widespread isolation of individuals who were deemed “high-risk” in government-controlled quarantine camps. These quarantine camps were to be erected out of existing communities. People’s homes and property rights were to be seized, as families were set to be separated and cordoned off in different homes in the community.
In July 2020, the CDC quietly released the plan titled, “Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings.” This document, which remained on the CDC’s public website until March 2023, outlined a disturbing proposal to create nationwide isolation camps for individuals deemed “vulnerable.” This plan would have seen people forcibly separated from their families, their communities and even their religious practices, all in the name of “public health and safety.”
The plan — never fully implemented but disturbingly detailed — called for the forced relocation of “high-risk” individuals to what were effectively quarantine zones, under the CDC’s concept of “shielding.” These “green zones,” as the document described them, would isolate older adults and people with serious underlying health conditions, physically separating them from the general population to prevent them from coming into contact with individuals who were deemed “low-risk.”
The CDC’s proposal was not limited to households but extended to entire neighborhoods and even camps or sectors, which would have been scattered across the country. These camps were to house up to 50 high-risk individuals per zone, with strict controls over movement and a single-entry point for food and supplies. The plan even discussed the need for dedicated staff to monitor these zones and ensure that individuals adhered to strict isolation protocols.
While the CDC stressed that the “shielding approach” was not meant to be coercive, it quickly acknowledged the inherent psychological dangers of such isolation. The document warned that being cut off from family, faith and community could lead to emotional distress, depression and even suicide among those confined in the zones. In fact, the CDC outlined procedures for preventing suicides and ensuring that the mentally ill in isolation were assigned caregivers to avoid neglect and abuse.
Perhaps most shockingly, the document included no provisions for legal appeals or any form of due process for those who were deemed “high-risk.” There was no mention of legal counsel or any recourse for individuals who disagreed with being forcibly removed from their homes or communities. The plan essentially outlined how individuals could be imprisoned without trial or representation under the guise of protecting them from a virus.
The document’s language is chilling, with deranged government officials assuming absolute control over individuals’ movements, families and rights. It suggests a system where the government could decide who lives and who is isolated based on public health determinations. This raises profound ethical questions about the role of government in dictating personal lives, as well as the capacity for abuse when such powers are unchecked.",0

Kennedy, Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), claiming his advocacy for vaccine safety was “concerning.”
During an appearance on CNN Thursday, Besser, the former acting CDC Director under the Obama administration, said he found Kennedy’s nomination “chilling” and suggested he doesn’t “believe in science.”
“One of the things you see with many people who spread misinformation is there are little bits and pieces that are really a good idea,” Besser said. “Because of that, it can be really confusing when you’re listening to someone…but those little bits and pieces of really good things are also mixed in with a lot of pseudoscience and information that’s quite damaging.”

“The Source” host Kaitlin Collins went on to criticize Kennedy for spreading the “debunked” claim that vaccines are linked to autism.
Besser agreed, saying, “The idea that receiving [childhood] vaccines would be parental choice scares me.”
“One of the things we have in America is a contract between each other. And an important part of that in public health is vaccination. I vaccinate my children to protect them, but also to protect other people’s children,” he said.
“We vaccinate our kids because we care about our children, our families, and our community,” Besser added.
Sounds like the same logic that was deployed to coerce millions of people to receive the unsafe and ineffective experimental COVID-19 mRNA injections.
Kennedy has repeatedly clarified that he’s not “anti-vaxx,” but that he advocates for more stringent safety protocols and rigorous testing when it comes to vaccines.
But Kennedy’s knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry’s vaccines over the last several decades has sent the top pharma companies into a complete panic upon the news Trump tapped him as HHS Secretary.
THIS IS WHY they’re AFRAID of RFK. The CDC held Secret Meetings about the Rise of Autism DUE TO Vaccinations…“So they looked at one vaccine, which is the hepatitis B vaccine. They looked at kids who had gotten it in the first 30 days…and there was a 10,000% increase…” pic.twitter.com/KJTRRsmS4G
In fact, stocks of major vaccine manufacturers tumbled by about 4% this week shortly after Trump announced Kennedy as his HHS pick.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-usual-suspect,The Usual Suspect,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"He’s at it again.
You know the guy—the one with the brilliant white hair and the face that barely moves. Old boomer. Looks like the uncle from that cartoon Johnny Quest. Usual suspect.
Mike Pence!
Yes, Mike Pence is doing what Mike Pence does best and getting in the way of MAGA and being a general pain in the ass.
Not content with helping to kill an immediate investigation into the 2020 election­—which we now know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, was rigged (unless you believe fifteen million voters simply disappeared…)—this time Pence is trying to block RFK Jr.’s appointment to Health and Human Services. Trump hasn’t even been inaugurated yet.
Pence called on Senate Republicans to refuse to install Kennedy, on the grounds of his attitude towards abortion and reproductive rights.
In a long statement posted by the Advancing America Foundation on Twitter, Pence said, “I believe the nomination of RFK Jr. to serve as Secretary of HHS is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration and should be deeply concerning to millions of Pro-Life Americans who have supported the Republican Party and our nominees for decades.”
Pence said the appointment is unsuitable because “there are hundreds of decisions made at HHS every day that either lead our nation toward a respect for life or away from it, and HHS under our administration always stood for life.”
Pence claimed RFK Jr. has been a staunch advocate of “abortion on demand during all nine months of pregnancy” and wants to overturn the Dobbs decision and introduce legislation to “codify Roe v. Wade.”
“If confirmed, RFK, Jr. would be the most pro-abortion Republican appointed secretary of HHS in modern history.”
“The pro-life movement has always looked to the Republican party to stand for life, to affirm an unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed,” Pence continued, before ending the statement with a plea to resist the appointment directly in the legislature.
“On behalf of tens of millions of pro-life Americans, I respectfully urge Senate Republicans to reject this nomination and give the American people a leader who will respect the sanctity of life as secretary of Health and Human Services.”
I’m sure Pence’s opposition to RFK Jr. being head of Health and Human Services is motivated entirely by his moral concern for the lives of unborn children, and has absolutely nothing to do with any kind of associations Pence has with Big Pharma and the corrupt medical and agricultural industries Kennedy has firmly in his sights.
According to data from Open Secrets, although health wasn’t among the top sectors donating to Mike Pence in 2024, agribusiness was. Pence has received $590,000 in agribiz donations this year. Last year, Eli Lilly—the pharma company that makes Ozempic competitor Mounjaro—made a large donation to Committed to America, a PAC set up to support Pence’s failed presidential bid. And during Trump’s first term, another Pence PAC, Great America Committee, received money from PACs tied to huge pharma players like Novo Nordisk, Merck, Eli Lilly again, Sunovion and Johnson and Johnson.
The Advancing Freedom Foundation, which posted Pence’s anti-RFK statement, received $100,000 from the Searle Foundation, which represents the G.D. Searle pharmaceutical empire built on Ambien and Dramamine and the aspartame in Donald Trump’s Diet Coke.
And remember that minor scandal during the pandemic, when it was revealed that Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, owned millions of dollars of stocks in pharma companies that were working to formulate vaccines and manufacture protective equipment etc.? That included big shares in Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer and Merck—all vaccine manufacturers—and Gilead Sciences, which came up with the utterly useless death sentence of an drug called Remdesivir.
But all of this is probably inconsequential, meaningless.
Let’s just assume Pence only cares about the unborn and not the plummeting stock prices of Pfizer, Modern, Lily et al. since RFK Jr.’s nomination. What then?
It’s quite possible to deplore RFK Jr.’s stance on abortion and reproductive rights, while recognising that this is a generational opportunity—maybe even the first real opportunity ever—to fix America’s appalling, deepening health crisis.
For seventy years, chronic health conditions have advanced to an unheralded degree, and government and the medical and food industries have been powerless to stop it. If anything, they’ve exacerbated the problem, with rigged science, hairbrained policies, regulatory corruption and weaponised food.
Today nearly 210 million Americans are either overweight or obese. That figure is projected to reach 260 million within 25 years. Humans have never lived in a society like this before.
The whole rotten edifice needs to burn.
There are plenty of Kennedy positions I disagree with—his support for reparations, for example—but nothing Kennedy says or does that I disagree with could prevent me from seeing that this is a unique opportunity. Kennedy is the right man, in the right place, at the right time. Nobody else can do this but him.
Should we really—and please forgive the expression—throw the baby out with the bathwater here?
After all, what does “pro-life” really mean?
Do we extend the term, and our moral absolutism, to the child who lives and is born, only to be set up to fail by his parents, the medical establishment and government?
The child that has already been exposed to harmful endocrine disruptors from the moment of conception; the child fed estrogenic, high-fructose-corn-syrup-laden formula instead of nourishing breastmilk; the child pumped, from its first months, with vaccines loaded with toxic adiuvants; the child that graduates to a kind of food many scientists don’t even consider food at all, but a “food-like substance,” and drinks fluoridated water that shrinks its brain and impairs its development; the child whose circadian rhythms and metabolism are disrupted by constant blue-light exposure and 5G and the mind-killing inanity of the Skibidi Toilet…
Do the lives of these children not matter too? Or is it only the unborn?
I’m not trying to be glib here. I’m deadly serious. The current regime of ill health ruins lives and it kills just as surely as the demonic abortionist. It stunts growth and development, robbing children, then teenagers, then adults of the beauty of a real existence, of a real place in God’s wondrous creation.
A late-term abortion is evil. But so is making a child fat and retarded and sexually inadequate and expecting it to live a life that’s hardly better than the lives of the rats that poke little switches in laboratories and get sugar-water and maybe a bit of cocaine in response to their efforts.
If you call yourself “pro-life,” then surely you must be anti-that? Come on.
I’m not saying that Republicans should give up their opposition to abortion or support the repealing of the Dobbs decision or anything like that. Maintain your opposition, and if it comes to it and Kennedy proposes something you don’t like, say so and vote accordingly. Maintain a clean conscience.
The great German sociologist Max Weber, in his famous lecture “Politics as a Vocation,” made it clear that politics is, as they say, the art of compromise. And there is a compromise to be made here for many Republicans. They might have to work with a man who holds views they don’t like, even find reprehensible. Yet pro-life Republicans shouldn’t kid themselves. Refusing to compromise will surely have a grave, if not a graver cost. Kids will still die.
What compromise requires is courage, flexibility and foresight—attributes Mike Pence has demonstrated himself to lack more than once.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/pandemic-associated-with-increased-heart-defects-in-newborns,Pandemic Associated with Increased Heart Defects in Newborns,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"The number of babies born with a congenital heart abnormality increased by 16% during the first year of the pandemic, according to new analysis by researchers at the University of London.
Congenital heart defects affect about 1 in 110 births globally, and include defects with the heart’s valves, the major blood vessels of the heart and the presence of holes in the heart.
The researchers behind the new study used data for 18 million births in the US between December 2016 and November 2022 in order to investigate the effects of the pandemic on babies born with congenital heart defects.
The data were compared to the number of babies born with Down Syndrome, a genetic condition that is not affected by the COVID-19 virus, in order to ascertain whether the COVID-19 virus is likely to have been responsible, or whether other factors, such as limited access to antenatal services during the pandemic, were at work.
A total of 11,010,764 births before and 7,060,626 births during the pandemic were analyzed. Data were adjusted to account for various confounding factors, including the mother’s BMI, diabetes and blood pressure before pregnancy, age, number of times the mother had given birth and the season in which prenatal care started.
The number of births with a congenital heart condition increased by 16% after the first year of the pandemic, from 56.5 per 100,000 births in the period studied before the pandemic to 65.4 cases per 100,000 live births during the pandemic.
By contrast, the number of babies born with Down Syndrome did not change, which suggests the change in the rate of heart defects was not due to the disruption of health services.
“Studying this large U.S. dataset has revealed an unexpected picture for how the pandemic has affected the hearts of unborn babies, but we need to untangle the reasons for this link,” said lead author Professor Asma Khalil.
“We need to determine if the SARS-CoV-2 virus directly causes the development of fetal heart problems during pregnancy, and if so, how the virus makes these changes in the heart.”
The study did not take into account vaccination status of the mothers (i.e. for COVID-19), or compare the relative rates of heart defects between vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/another-us-city-votes-to-end-fluoridation,Another US City Votes To End Fluoridation,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"A Florida city has become the latest community to vote to bring an end to municipal fluoridation, in the wake of a landmark ruling by a California judge and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s promise that a second Trump administration will issue health guidance against fluoridation.
The city commission of Winter Haven, Florida voted last week to discontinue the fluoridation of the water supply.
Winter Haven Commissioner Brad Dantzler said that Judge Edward Chen’s ruling and Kennedy’s probable nomination were reasons for fluoride to be removed from the city’s drinking water. The vote came two days before president-elect Donald Trump named Kennedy as his choice to lead Health and Human Services.
In September, US District Judge Edward Chen ruled that some studies suggest fluoride levels could pose an unreasonable risk to the public’s health and that the EPA must address that risk.
“In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote in his judgment.
“EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.”
Following the ruling, two municipalities in Westchester County, New York voted to stop fluoridation of the water supply, and so did the Texas city of Abilene.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made clear that water fluoridation will be one of the targets of his Make America Healthy Again agenda. He recently Tweeted that the Trump administration would advise against adding fluoride to the public water supply.
“On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy Tweeted.
“Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President ​@realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.”
In a second Tweet, Kennedy drew attention to a recent federal court ruling, in which an Obama-appointed judge, after reviewing a huge number of scientific studies and hours of expert testimony, ruled that the EPA had “improperly approved this dangerous neurotoxin.”
Trump is reported to have said the idea “sounds good to me.”",0

“If @Mike_Pence is against it, I gotta be for it. Taking poisons and toxins out of our food supply is one of the most pro-life moves in our govt’s history. Being pro-life isnt just about abortion,” posted one user.
Others were more blunt.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/wi-fi-can-be-used-to-influence-brainwaves-has-potential-for-hypnotic-effects-and-social-engineering,"Wi-Fi Can be Used to Influence Brainwaves, Has Potential for Hypnotic Effects and Social Engineering",By Lance D Johnson | Natural News,3 months ago,"In today’s interconnected world, wireless internet access has become ubiquitous, found in nearly every coffee shop, office and home. But Wi-Fi signals are not benign. Radio-frequency (RF) radiation is constantly bombarding the cells and influencing brain waves. Of particular concern is extremely low frequency (ELF) waves, which have the potential to interfere with brain waves and make a person unknowingly enter a suggestive state of mind. Wi-Fi is a vector for social engineering, causing individuals to surrender their critical thinking to conform to official narratives and group think.
Keith Cutter, a well-known critic of modern wireless technology, has spent years exploring the darker side of Wi-Fi radiation. According to Cutter, Wi-Fi’s impact is not limited to direct radiation exposure but also extends to more subtle and disturbing effects, including brainwave entrainment, cognitive disruption, and what he refers to as the “Wi-Fi memory effect” on body tissues.
Wi-Fi operates using radio-frequency electromagnetic fields, transmitting data via pulse-modulated RF radiation. While the technology itself may seem harmless — after all, most devices only emit relatively low levels of RF radiation — Cutter believes that the cumulative impact of this exposure over time is far from benign.
One of the primary concerns Cutter highlights is the effect of extremely low frequency (ELF) waves, which Wi-Fi broadcasts in addition to its higher frequency RF signals. ELF waves range from approximately 3 to 30 Hz, a frequency range that just so happens to overlap with the natural oscillation frequencies of the human brain. The brain’s electrical activity is divided into different frequency bands, each associated with different states of consciousness and mental function:
Cutter is most concerned with 10Hz ELF pulses, emitted by Wi-Fi beacons. These beacons, which constantly pulse at this frequency, are essentially broadcasting a persistent signal to ensure devices remain connected. Cutter believes that the 10Hz pulse can have a profound effect on brain activity, particularly by inducing a phenomenon known as brainwave entrainment.
Brainwave entrainment refers to the synchronization of brainwaves to an external frequency. When the brain is exposed to a consistent external stimulus at a particular frequency, such as the 10Hz signal emitted by Wi-Fi, it can shift its own natural brainwave patterns to match. At 10Hz, the brain enters a more relaxed state, akin to alpha waves, which corresponds to reduced cortical activity.
Cutter is particularly alarmed by this, warning that prolonged exposure to the 10Hz ELF signal can create a “suggestible state,” where the brain is more susceptible to external influences. These external influences could include media, marketing, or even subconscious programming, all of which are being introduced to people while they are under the influence of Wi-Fi emitting devices.
“We’re talking about the possibility of mind control,” Cutter warns, suggesting that this kind of brainwave manipulation may make individuals more vulnerable to external suggestions (like hypnosis). The manipulation could be used to coerce populations into believing or thinking a certain way, against their intuition, knowledge, rational thought, or instincts.
Another concern raised by Cutter is the potential for Wi-Fi to have a “memory effect” on body tissues. This refers to the way certain electromagnetic frequencies can be absorbed and retained by the body, potentially leading to long-term physical changes or health conditions.
Cutter compares this phenomenon to trauma stored within the body — similar to the psychological concept of “trauma memory,” where past emotional or physical trauma manifests in the body even after the event has passed. In the case of Wi-Fi, he suggests that the body could absorb the radiation and store it in tissues, leading to ongoing health issues like fatigue, headaches, and even more severe conditions associated with electrical sensitivity.
Wi-Fi is far from a benign technological convenience. It’s proliferation into daily life presents a “hidden epidemic,” one that is silently negating the health and well-being of individuals, and making their minds more vulnerable to suggestion.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/autism-isnt-just-neurological-its-a-whole-system-disorder-driven-by-environmental-toxins,"Autism Isn’t Just Neurological — It’s a Whole-System Disorder, Driven by Environmental Toxins","By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",3 months ago,"Scientific evidence shows autism isn’t just a neurological condition, according to the authors of a scientific review published Tuesday on Preprints.org.
Brian Hooker, Ph.D., Children’s Health Defense (CHD) chief scientific officer; Jeet Varia, Ph.D., CHD science fellow; and Martha Herbert, M.D., Ph.D., a pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist, co-authored the report, which is undergoing peer review with Development and Psychopathology, a Cambridge University Press journal.
The authors examined the findings of 519 studies to illustrate how autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects multiple body systems, including the immune, digestive and central nervous systems.
Herbert, an autism researcher since 1995, told The Defender the science of autism has become “enormously richer” and ASD “can no longer be considered just a ‘psychological’ problem — it’s a whole-system problem … involving many systems that influence each other.”
She and her co-authors also contend that the latest scientific evidence suggests ASD is largely driven by environmental factors. These include exposure to toxins in food, the environment, medicine or personal care products.
The authors point out that although over $1 billion has been spent on genetic autism research over the past 10 years, researchers have found no unequivocal evidence of a purely genetic cause of autism.
“Although genomic differences may make certain individuals more vulnerable to developing ASD,” Herbert explained, “there are clearly environmental factors that play a huge role in leading to ASD.”
Varia told The Defender that the scientific community needs to acknowledge and explore these environmental factors. “Something is happening in our environment for us to see such an increase in autism,” he said. “We need to ‘get over’ the scientific consensus of genetic causes and accept environmental ones.”
The authors wrote in their report:
“Only once we understand that ASD is not genetically inevitable or a genetic tragedy but an environmental and physiological catastrophe, will we truly be able to grasp and address the root causes of the dramatic rise in its prevalence.”
They said the scientific evidence they reviewed suggests that people with ASD are the “canaries in the coal mine” — meaning that they are responding to toxins in their environment that may “eventually reach us all.”
“The point henceforward,” they wrote, “becomes not just to support and seek full recovery for those diagnosed with ASD, but also how we as individuals, families, communities, and society in the contemporary era can most effectively protect future generations.”
Multiple body systems play a role in ASD
In their report, the authors reviewed new research showing that the brain and the immune system communicate with each other.
In previous decades, scientists didn’t think ASD was linked to lower or altered immune system function because the brain was “viewed as an immune-privileged site,” they wrote. “However, over the last decade, mounting evidence has uncovered the role of the immune system in CNS [central nervous system] health and functioning and disease.”
“Now that we know definitively that the brain is not an ‘immune-privileged’ organ, it is high time to approach autism from a neuroimmune standpoint,” Hooker told The Defender.
Varia agreed. “Philosophically speaking, the immune system and nervous system are essentially two sides of the same coin.”
Varia pointed out that there’s a lot of research showing how the immune system and the gut microbiome communicate with each other. That means that at least three major body systems affect ASD: immune, neurological and digestive.
“I call the immune-neuro-microbiota-axis the ‘magic triangle,’” Varia said. “I feel it’s the ‘gatekeeper’ not only to the pathophysiology of ASD but also everyday ‘normal’ physiological and psychological health and well-being.”
Hooker said the paper helps drive forward the scientific conversation on ASD because the paper “lays out the neuroimmune components of autism in a scientifically robust fashion.”
For example, he and his co-authors explain in the report the concept of a “toxic ‘tipping point’” due to exposure to environmental toxins, Hooker said.
The report states:
“Chronic or acute xenobiotic activation of the immune system would trigger self-reinforcing disease processes through failed shut-off of stress-responsiveness.
“ASD therefore is an example of a situation that emerges as things ‘go beyond the tipping point’ at various vulnerable states of neurological and immunological development.”
ASD treatments need to reflect its complexity
In their review, the authors argue that future treatments for ASD need to “go beyond the current reductionist and ‘magic-bullet’ medical paradigm.”
Pharmaceutical drugs have their place in the emergency room, Varia said, but they generally do more harm than good for treating diseases like ASD. “There is no ‘magic bullet,’” he emphasized.
Nonetheless, many modern clinicians often use pharmaceutical medication as if it were a magic bullet that can eliminate a disease’s cause or symptom.
The authors wrote:
“This single-target perspective tends to neglect consideration of how these medications unintentionally impact the overall regulatory ability of the human organism … Medications should be designed to mimic, modulate, or promote the body’s natural resolution mechanisms instead of interfering with them.”
The authors said more holistic treatments, including “non-pharmacological, nutritional and botanical therapeutic modalities,” for addressing ASD symptoms have shown promise.
For instance, parents of children with ASD and clinicians have reported success in treating — and sometimes, reversing — ASD symptoms through food and diet. There’s also clinical evidence that mind-body modalities, such as breathwork training, can boost social communication and cognitive functions while mitigating anxiety.
The authors called for more research to assess whether breathwork is effective at treating ASD.",0

Kennedy, Jr. a major health role in his administration, pharmaceutical companies are panicking about how potential new regulations that protect Americans could hurt their bottom line.
Executives from five major pharmaceutical companies reportedly organized an emergency meeting following Trump’s election win to talk about how it will affect their business. They are particularly worried about any regulatory shakeups that could come at the behest of Kennedy, who has long been calling out federal health agencies for their failures and corruption.
Kennedy advisor and New Jersey assemblyman Jamel Holley said: “The top CEOs are in a state of panic,” adding that their teleconference focused on a new “threat environment” stemming from potential major policy shifts.
Kennedy has gone on the record as stating that he believes there are some entire departments in the FDA that need to go. In an interview with MSNBC, he stated: “In some categories … there are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA … that have to go, that are not doing their job, they’re not protecting our kids.”
For example, he has pointed out that there are many discrepancies in the food safety standards seen in the U.S. and those of other countries. He used the example of all the additives used in American cereal that regulators in other countries don’t allow.
“Why do we have Froot Loops with nearly 20 ingredients here when it’s only a few in Canada?” he asked.
Kennedy has also announced his intention to target corruption in federal agencies, which is a widespread problem that is impacting public health. He has devoted a big part of his career to litigating against major agencies and understands this issue very well.
“I can get the corruption out of the agencies. Once Americans are getting good science and allowed to make their own choices, they’re going to get a lot healthier,” he said.
Another aspect of health that Kennedy is passionate about is vaccines. Through Children’s Health Defense, he has been working to expose the dangers of vaccines to ensure that Americans can make more informed choices and understand the potential consequences. However, he said that he is not “anti-vaccine” and that he would not take vaccines away from Americans.
Instead, he advocated for informed consent, telling NBC News: “People ought to have choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information. So I’m going to make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them.”
Kennedy said last week that Trump has assured him he will have a role in the White House but that they had not gotten into specifics. Although there has been some speculation that he may be asked to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, this would require confirmation by the Senate, which may pose a challenge. The co-chair of Trump’s transition team, Howard Lutnick, has ruled out the possibility of Kennedy taking the HHS leadership role. However, there are plenty of other roles he could take on that do not require this step.
Pharmaceutical companies are clearly bracing themselves for what is to come, and their stocks dipped in early trading Wednesday as observers wondered what Trump’s victory would mean for health regulations. Will Big Pharma and the FDA finally be held accountable for compromising Americans’ health?",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/nova-scotia-policy-forces-doctors-to-offer-abortion-euthanasia-trans-genital-chop-chop-surgery-referrals,"Nova Scotia Policy Forces Doctors to Offer Abortion, Euthanasia, ‘Trans-Genital’ Chop Chop Surgery Referrals",By Clare Marie Merkowsky | Lifesite,3 months ago,"HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (LifeSiteNews) — A new policy in Nova Scotia has trampled on freedom of conscience rights by mandating that doctors refer their patients for abortions.
According to a November 6 press release from Christian political advocacy group Association for Reformed Political Action (ARPA), the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia is forcing doctors to refer their patients for abortions, euthanasia, and “gender-transitioning” surgeries.
“Doctors must not be coerced to participate in something they believe is wrong,” the press release declared. “Such coercion inflicts real harm on the doctor’s moral and professional integrity.”
“A patient goes to their doctor for professional advice,” it continued. “That advice is based on the physician’s education, experience, and best judgment, all of which are grounded in their moral and professional convictions. Not only is protecting conscience good for doctors, but it is also good for patients. In fact, many patients want a doctor who they know will never offer or provide them with certain procedures.”
Under the new policy passed in May 2024, doctors must refer patients for medical interventions if they conscientiously object to providing the procedure themselves.
According to the College, the doctor is obligated to provide “a referral made in good faith to a non-objecting, available, and accessible physician, healthcare professional, or agency or service that oversees the delivery of the care being sought.”
The policy further compels doctors to discuss all available options to patients. For example, if a woman is undergoing a complicated pregnancy, the doctor must list abortion as an available option. Likewise, if a patient is eligible for Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD), the doctor must mention this to them.
This means that Nova Scotia residents seeking medical care will be offered death by lethal injection instead of treatment.
This was the case with a Nova Scotia grandmother who was repeatedly offeredeuthanasia while undergoing cancer treatment. According to the 51-year-old woman, medical staff kept suggesting MAiD, making her feel that they believed she would be “better off dead.”
At the time, the registrar of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia labeled the suggestion of MAiD as “clearly inappropriate and insensitive,” but still defended doctors proposing MAiD for eligible patients.
The policy has been roundly condemned by pro-life Canadians, including 41 doctors who signed a letter stating that they cannot in good conscience follow the directive.
Campaign Life Coalition’s Pete Baklinski blasted the policy and called on Premier Tim Houston to protect provincial doctors.
“This policy compels doctors to go against their consciences or face disciplinary action if they refuse to go along with making such a referral,” he wrote on X.
“Freedom of conscience is a Charter right,” Baklinski declared. “Premier @TimHoustonNS must protect the province’s doctors before it’s too late and all the good ones leave. No one wants to be left in the care of doctors without a conscience.”
ARPA has provided a sample letter that can be found here to encourage local MLA and provincial leaders to defend doctors.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/comedian-rob-schneider-lays-out-how-covid-19-was-a-scamdemic,Comedian Rob Schneider Lays Out How COVID-19 Was A Scamdemic,By Kelen McBreen,3 months ago,"Popular comedian and actor Rob Schneider joined the Triggernometry podcast on Sunday for a wide-ranging discussion on COVID-19, Donald Trump’s election victory and the future of America.
The show’s hosts, comedians Konstantin Kisin and Francis Foster, asked Schneider why he calls the COVID-19 pandemic a “scamdemic,” and the “Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo” actor went on an epic rant.
Schneider first pointed out the Covid death rate was around the same level as a typical flu virus before noting, “They said nobody died of the flu that year. Why? Because people wore masks. Then they said, ‘Well how come they died of Covid?’ Well, because masks don’t work.”
“At a certain point, we have to look at the evidence,” he said. “We have to make decisions that are evidence-based. So, when I say it was a scam, it was a scam because Trump was lied to by the CDC, he was lied to by Fauci, he was lied to by Redmond [Redfield], he was lied to by Birx. These are the people in the health agencies.”
The comedian claimed the individuals he listed scared Trump into believing the pandemic would kill millions of Americans and that he’d be to blame if he didn’t follow their advice.
Asked to elaborate on what part of the pandemic was a “scam,” Schneider explained the six-foot social distancing policy was based on fake science, locking down schools was more detrimental to children than the virus, and the “vaccines” were not safe and effective as advertised.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/obesity-related-heart-disease-deaths-tripled-since-1999,Obesity-related Heart Disease Deaths Tripled since 1999,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"Heart-disease deaths related to obesity have tripled since 1999.
According to new findings presented at the American Heart Association’s annual conference in Chicago, deaths from heart disease as a result of obesity increased 2.8 times between 1999 and 2020.
The increase was especially prominent among middle-aged men, black adults, Midwesterners and rural residents.
The researchers behind the study used public-health data to review heart-disease deaths in recent decades.
Close to 230,000 heart-disease deaths were recorded over the 21 years of the study.
The study revealed a 5% annual increase in the overall rate of obesity-related heart disease deaths.
For men, the obesity-related heart disease death rate rose 243%, from 2.1 deaths per 100,000 people in 1999 to 7.2 per 100,000 in 2020. Middle-aged men aged 55 to 64 saw a 165% increase, from 5.5 deaths per 100,000 in 1999 to 14.6 deaths per 100,000 in 2020.
Among women, the death rate rose significantly, but significantly less than men, by 131%, from 1.6 deaths per 100,000 in 1999 to 3.7 per 100,000 in 2020.
Among America’s various ethnic and racial groups, the death rate was highest among Black adults at 3.9 deaths per 100,000.
The study also showed that rural residents had an obesity-related heart disease death rate of 4 deaths per 100,000 in 2020, compared with 2.9 deaths per 100,000 among urban dwellers.
The highest rates were seen in the Midwestern states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin, with an age-adjusted death rate of 3.3 deaths per 100,000 people.
The Northeast states had the lowest rate at 2.8 deaths per 100,000.
Another interesting, and alarming, finding was that the increase in the heart-disease death rate outpaced the increase in the national obesity rate.
“The relative change in ischemic heart disease deaths related to obesity that was observed in this study between 1999 and 2020 was greater than the overall increase in obesity prevalence that we’ve seen in the United States, from about 30% to about 40% over this same time frame,” Khan, a professor of cardiovascular epidemiology and an associate professor of cardiology, medical social sciences and preventive medicine at Northwestern School of Medicine in Chicago.
This could be because obesity is now included more as a contributing factor on death certificates, or it could be for other reasons that are unclear at present.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/new-study-microplastics-affecting-weather,New Study: Microplastics Affecting Weather,By Raw Egg Nationalist,3 months ago,"Microplastics affect cloud-formation and could be altering weather patterns, according to new research.
Scientists showed that microplastics can have the same effects on cloud-formation as dust particles, which help water droplets form ice crystals in the atmosphere at warmer temperatures. Microplastics can allow ice crystals to form at temperatures between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius warmer than warmer droplets without them.
The scientists tested a variety of different types of microplastic particle, suspending them in water and then cooling the droplets to observe when they froze. They also looked at the molecular structure of the microplastics to observe how it affected ice formation.
As one of the study authors explains, “For most of the plastics we studied, 50 percent of the droplets were frozen by the time they cooled to minus 8° F (minus 22° C). These results parallel those from another recent study by Canadian scientists, who also found that some types of microplastics nucleate ice at warmer temperatures than droplets without microplastics.”
At this stage, the consequences of the discovery aren’t clear, since the experiments took place in a lab, but it’s possible that growing microplastic pollution, if it does affect cloud-formation on a large scale, could have significant effects on weather patterns.
Clouds affect the weather and climate in a variety of ways. Clouds reflect incoming sunlight from the earth’s surface, which has a cooling effect, and they also absorb radiation from the earth’s surface, which has a warming effect.
The amount of sunlight a cloud reflects depends on the concentration of ice within it. If there are more microplastics present in clouds, and therefore more ice, more sunlight could be reflected, altering the earth’s energy balance.
The presence of microplastics could also increase rain and snowfall.
More than nine billion tons of plastic are estimated to have been produced between 1950 and 2017, with over half of that total having been produced since 2004. The vast majority of plastic ends up in the environment in one form or another, where it breaks down, through weathering, exposure to UV light and organisms of all kinds, into smaller and smaller pieces—microplastics and then nanoplastics.
Microplastics produced in this way are called “secondary” microplastics, because they start off big and end up small, but there’s a whole class of “primary” microplastics which are small by design, like so-called “microbeads” used in cosmetics.
Within our homes, microplastics are mainly produced when synthetic fibres from clothes, furnishings and carpets are shed. They accumulate in large quantities in dust and float around in the air, which we then inhale.
Microplastics are being linked to a wide variety of environmental and health problems, including serious reproductive issues in animals and humans.
Microplastics were recently discovered in brain tissue, in a study that suggested concentrations in the brain may have increased by as much as 50% in the last eight years.
The researchers behind the new study now want to focus on measuring concentrations of microplastics at the altitude where clouds form, and concentrations of other substances that affect cloud-formation, so they can start to model the effects of microplastics on clouds and weather in detail.

Kennedy, Jr. artfully refuted a TV anchor who criticized him for refusing to go along with Big Pharma’s talking points.
In a resurfaced clip from a News Nation town hall last year that’s gone viral, Kennedy was attacked as a conspiracy theorist for questioning the wisdom of pharmaceutical companies over vaccines and health advisories.
“You’re a lawyer and an activist. You’re not a doctor or a scientist,” town hall host Elizabeth Vargas told him.
Kennedy responded, “We live in a democracy. We don’t have a priesthood here. We are in charge of our own lives. And Americans need to do their own research.”
“People say, ‘trust the experts.’ That became a mantra during COVID. I brought over 500 cases, and almost all of them involved a scientific controversy. My job is to read science, learn it and be able to read it critically. And every case I ever brought, there’s an expert on that side and an expert on this side.”
“Saying trust the experts to me makes no sense at all. Trusting the experts is a function of religion and totalitarianism. It is not a function of democracy. In democracy, we question everything,” he added.
The anchor, appearing deflated, quickly tried to move on but first directed the network’s viewers to go to the network’s website to “go deeper on the science of vaccines.”
After dropping out of the presidential race as a Democrat, Kennedy was tapped by then GOP candidate Donald Trump to overhaul the public health agencies and spearhead the Make America Healthy Again initiative.
Independent research and critical thinking is not something the powers that be want becoming mainstream.
Meanwhile, top CEOs of pharmaceutical corporations recently held an emergency teleconference to respond to Trump’s decisive election victory and Kennedy’s pledge to gut the Food and Drug Administration in a second Trump administration.",0

“There’s this societal norm that if somebody is your family, they are entitled to your time. And I think the answer is absolutely not,” Calhoun replied.

“You know, to say, ‘I have a problem with the way that you voted because it went against my very livelihood, and I’m not going to be around you this holiday. I need to take some space for me,'” she added.

Chiefly, the study compared incidences of cerebral thrombotic syndromes (blood clots in the brain) following Covid, Flu and regular vaccines.
“There are 5137 cerebral thromboembolism AEs reported in the 3 years (36 months) after COVID-19 vaccines compared to 52 AEs [adverse events] for the influenza vaccines over the past 34 years (408 months) and 282 AEs for all other vaccines (excluding COVID-19) over the past 34 years (408 months),” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/how-merck-pushed-gardasil-vaccine-to-pay-for-vioxx-lawsuits-and-why-the-hpv-shot-is-so-dangerous,How Merck Pushed Gardasil Vaccine to Pay for Vioxx Lawsuits — and Why the HPV Shot is So Dangerous,By Dr. Joseph Mercola | The Defender,3 months ago,"Story at a glance:
Prior to COVID-19, I considered Gardasil (for HPV) to be the most dangerous and unjustifiable vaccine on the market.
It’s truly remarkable how many parallels can be found between it and the COVID-19 vaccines, so I feel it’s critically important for this already-forgotten story to be told.
Help pay for Vioxx (HPV)
The default strategy in medicine for any type of pain or injury is to throw NSAIDs at it — making the drugs immensely profitable.
Unfortunately, they typically don’t help that much (which actually increases their sales since patients then need more of them), and they are fairly dangerous (e.g., NSAIDs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and seriously injure far more — which is unfortunate since DMSO safely and effectively treats all the conditions NSAIDs are used for).
To create a new market, NSAIDs like Vioxx were created that were supposed to be safer … but actually had a huge stroke and heart attack risk (that Dr. Mercola warned the public about in 1999).
However, despite evidence of harm continuing to mount, Merck and the FDA kept on covering it up, and when the drug was finally pulled, Vioxx was estimated to have killed 120,000 people.
Sadly, as the FDA scientist who fought to get it off the market testified, this is business as usual, and another Vioxx disaster was inevitable.
Merck eventually had to pay a $4.85 billion Vioxx settlement (while the CEO received a $37.8 million “performance-based” bonus), leading Merck short of funds.
This was solved by the decades of research finally yielding an HPV vaccine, which Merck (and the FDA) immediately went to work marketing through an “award-winning” advertising blitz that convinced every American they needed to be scared to death of cervical cancer (a fairly rare cancer).
It worked, with 25.1% of adolescent girls getting Gardasil in 2007, 53.8% by 2011, and by 2023, 79.3%.
It was one of the most expensive vaccines on the market and quickly became a leading source of revenue for Merck (e.g., $1.87 billion in 2023).
However, due to its cost (like the COVID-19 vaccine), it required hefty government subsidies which included cash prizes to get the vaccine and grants worth $40 million by the U.S. Department for Human and Health Services for developing the most effective sales script doctors could use to push the vaccine on “hesitant” patients.
Note: Because of its high cost, it frequently requires state or federal financial support for doctors to offer it (just like COVID-19).
Is Gardasil effective?
The reason Merck had to aggressively market the fear of cervical cancer was that it was much less of a danger than it had been in the past, as it had largely been eliminated by pap smears.
Furthermore, its benefit for cervical cancer was entirely theoretical (Merck even convinced the FDA “studying cancer itself isn’t feasible, because it takes too long and it disadvantages too many women”) and despite 80% of women getting it, it still has not reduced cervical cancer:
Gardasil’s marketing also overshadowed the other two major risk factors for cervical cancer — smoking and birth control pills — which have largely been overshadowed by the focus on HPV. Remarkably, the decline in smoking perfectly mirrors the decline in cervical cancer deaths.
Disease provocation
Vaccines place the body under stress and divert the immune response to address the vaccine’s stimulus.
If the immune system is already attempting to contain another infection, this can be quite problematic and allow the existing infection to spiral out of control. This phenomenon has been known since 1893 and repeatedly demonstrated with many different infections (e.g., polio and typhus).
In turn, I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve seen people around me get the flu after receiving a flu shot, and during COVID-19, severe cases of COVID-19 often followed receiving the vaccine.
The HPV vaccine also does this, with many reports of individuals developing or worsening HPV-related infections, including genital warts, and Gardasil’s trial data showing it made existing infections more likely to become cancerous:
Note: An identical effect was also found with GlaxoSmithKline’s competing HPV vaccine.
Despite these concerns, prescreening for HPV before vaccination isn’t recommended. Instead, the “solution” has been to lower the age of vaccination.
DNA contamination
Thus far, I’ve argued that the reasons vaccines can make you “become sick” is because they weaken the immune system and make you more susceptible to catching the actual infection or having an already existing infection spiral out of control.
While I believe that is the primary issue, there is also another problem — manufacturing vaccines is an inherently dirty process.
Because of this contaminated “hot” lots will inevitably get released that sicken or kill many (a recurring problem that was ultimately “solved” by the government giving legal immunity to the manufacturers).
Producing genetically modified vaccines (e.g., Gardasil) requires synthetic DNA (plasmids) that frequently aren’t filtered out of the final product (e.g., this is a recurring issue with hot vaccine lots).
Worse still, those plasmids tend to be mixed with adjuvants that bring them into the cells and contain a dangerous part of the SV40 virus which draws them into the nucleus, allowing them to integrate into the human genome (e.g., this has been demonstrated with the COVID-19 vaccines).
Note: The early polio vaccines were contaminated with the cancer-causing SV40 virus, but despite warnings not to, the government still released it, ultimately resulting in millions of cancers. Sadly, the current COVID-19 vaccine cancer wave dwarfs even that:
Likewise, with Gardasil, there have been numerous cases where young vaccinated girls (e.g., one who died suddenly) were discovered to have HPV plasmid DNA in their bodies and those plasmids have been found in every HPV vaccine where it was tested for (leading to the government to switch from denying their presence to insisting they were “safe”).
Note: It is quite unfortunate a carcinogenic vaccine was able to be marketed to prevent a (fairly rare) cancer — especially since Gardasil (like the mRNA vaccines) was never tested for its cancer risk and trial data showed elevated leukemia rates.
Safety vs efficacy
Since all vaccines are viewed as “safe and effective,” regulators prioritize how strong an antibody response they elicit, leading to manufacturers excessively stimulating the immune system at the expense of safety (e.g., this was why the COVID-19 vaccines gave so many people autoimmune disorders).
In Gardasil’s case, it used a very powerful (but untested) adjuvant that gave 49.6% of participants in Merck’s trial a “New Medical Condition,” including Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and other severe autoimmune disorders.
For reference, this is what is stated in Merck’s package insert for the vaccine, which discussed all the (reported) autoimmune disorders that developed throughout its clinical trials.
Note: One of the key mechanisms of injury behind most vaccines is their collapsing the physiologic zeta potential of the body — causing blood cells to clump together and triggering microstrokesthroughout the body. And the most harmful vaccines that ever hit the market were uniquely toxic to zeta potential (which in Gardasil’s case came from its aluminum adjuvant, and COVID-19 vaccine due to the [mass-produced] spike protein’s positive charge density).
As a result, treating those injuries often requires restoring the physiologic zeta potential. Additionally, those with hypermobility (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) are particularly vulnerable to pharmaceutical injuries and often also require targeted nutritional supplementation to restore their ligaments and health.
This extraordinarily high rate of autoimmunity has caused large numbers of Gardasil recipients to become seriously and sometimes permanently disabled from the vaccine.
In turn, there are thousands of pages of heart-wrenching stories (not that different from the COVID-19 vaccine injuries) about how Gardasil ruined many people at the prime of their lives.
Note: One of the most common side effects of Gardasil (and COVID-19 vaccination) was POTS (a debilitating disorder where severe lightheadedness occurs when standing up which can sometimes trigger fatal car accidents — and which coincidentally was a common cause of death in the Gardasil trials).
Many have since concluded this disease was in part an autoimmune disorder as Gardasil victims have been found to have antibodies to the autonomic receptors which are supposed to bring blood to the head.
POTS appears to be due to an impaired zeta potential (something Gardasil was also notorious for doing), as restoring physiologic zeta potential often significantly improves POTS.
If you take a step back, it’s completely unconscionable that a vaccine that provides almost no benefit could be approved while simultaneously giving at least 2.3% of the recipients a serious lifelong autoimmune illness. To get around this, Merck doctored the trials by having the “placebo” be the vaccine’s damaging adjuvant.
As such, while a massive rate of harm was observed in those who took the vaccine, it wasn’t that much higher than what occurred in the “placebo” group (and thus “by chance”) and hence deemed to be “unrelated” to the vaccine.
Infertility
Sadly, autoimmunity wasn’t the only issue. For example, since this vaccine was meant to be given to every woman in the world shortly before they became able to have children, the number one reason not to bring it to market would be if it had a fertility risk.
Yet, consider what Merck’s original clinical data showed:
For Gardasil 9 (a newer HPV vaccine with more strains), 17 of the 62 clinical trial pregnancies (27.4%) resulted in a miscarriage.
Note: For Gardasil, the miscarriage rate was even greater if vaccination occurred within 30 days of conception. Likewise, this issue was also seen with Gardasil’s birth defects.
Deaths
Much attention has been brought to the explosion of “unexplained” (and often sudden) deaths that occurred after the COVID vaccines hit the market in the youngest and the healthiest members of society:
However, significantly less attention has been given to the fact that in the initial Gardasil trials, out of 21,458, 10 vaccine recipients and seven “placebo” recipients died including seven from car accidents (which can be triggered by POTS causing drivers to pass out).
However, despite the Gardasil death rate (8.5 per 10,000) being almost twice the background death rate in girls and young women (4.37), the FDA was not concerned.
Note: The actual expected death rate was likely lower since young and healthy girls were selected for the trials.
Risk vs benefit
When you step back and look at the data, you will see that Gardasil’s risk-benefit ratio is shocking. In the best-case scenario, Gardasil saved 0.6 lives per 10,000 in England and 0.2 per 10,000 in the U.S.
However, it killed at least 4.13 per 10,000 recipients — young people, just starting their lives. On top of that, it caused serious autoimmune disorders in at least 230 per 10,000, impacted fertility, and caused a myriad of more subtle long-term complications.
That’s an awful risk-to-benefit ratio. I’ve thus come to believe much of modern medicine is akin to a sales funnel, pushing patients into costly, lifelong treatments at the expense of their health.
Fortunately, this is now a much greater awareness of these predatory tactics. For example, Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson recently discussed the birth control funnel, the dangers of antidepressants and the link between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and mass shootings (or other forms of psychotic violence):
Gardasil is a perfect example. Its neurological side effects can lead to psychiatric issues, pushing young women further down the medical sales pipeline — something I’ve seen firsthand.
Many patients also develop costly lifelong autoimmune disorders after the vaccine, but most don’t connect the dots until I point it out.
This highlights two crucial points: vaccines often carry risks that far outweigh their benefits, and even when injuries are evident in trials (as they were with Gardasil), regulators still approve them. Sadly, this mirrors what we saw with the COVID-19 vaccines.
Note: I put together a summary of the risks and benefits of each childhood vaccine for parents (e.g., Gardasil is one of the worst ones).
Gardasil’s clinical trials
Previously, I argued Gardasil’s clinical trials, had many parallels to an abusive relationship in both:
Sadly, this type of abuse in research has become so normalized that by the time COVID-19 came around, as trial whistleblowers showed, not only did it happen again, but the government actually sided with the abuser.
Due to how toxic Gardasil was, once it hit the market, the FDA and CDC were deluged with a wave of reports of adverse reactions to it. However, rather than acknowledge them, they doubled down on the vaccine and concocted an increasingly elaborate series of steps to shield it.
Note: This was why I knew they’d do the exact same thing with the COVID-19 vaccines. Even now that their harm has become so widespread, the majority of America believes they are killing people and there is no possible justification to keep on pushing the vaccine (e.g., the original strain it “protects you against” is extinct, the endless boosters make you more likely to get COVID-19 and now very few Americans are even getting them).
For example, in 2009, in response to widespread publicity detailing severe adverse events attributed to HPV vaccines, the FDA and CDC initiated a study to examine Gardasil’s safety profile by analyzing all VAERS reports filed since Gardasil’s mid-2006 approval through the end of 2008.
The study found that “the VAERS reporting rate for [Gardasil] is triple the rate for all other vaccines combined.”
Additionally, the study found that 68% of the reports were submitted by representatives of Merck, Gardasil’s manufacturer, most of which needed to be completed or more accurate, and 90% of which required more information essential for conducting medical assessments. Finally, the authors also noted that VAERS suffered from underreporting.
Despite these red flags, the authors instead declared that the high rate of adverse events “reflects greater public attention to HPV,” which was purportedly “stimulated” by “widespread media coverage” and that Gardasil’s “post-licensure safety profile” as calculated from VAERS data is “broadly consistent” with safety data collected in its clinical trials, while simultaneously failing to support these assertions.
Not surprisingly, following the study’s publication, news organizations and health authorities such as the CDC and WHO repeatedly referenced this “study” as proof that Gardasil was safe. Sound familiar?
Conclusion
Typically, when a predatory industry wishes to do something unconscionable, it will begin by testing it on a group that doesn’t quite have the ability to fight back, and then once this gets normalized, enact it on a much broader scale.
For example, all the horrific playbook Dr. Anthony Fauci enacted upon America during COVID-19 was almost identical to what he got away with doing to the gay community during AIDS and once Gardasil was approved, American organizations immediately began conducting unscrupulous clinical trials overseas that tricked young girls into joining and then discarded them once they were injured (eventually leading to a scathing rebuke by India’s government).
Sadly, the Gardasil debacle was not the only test run. For instance, the widely opposed childhood vaccine mandates pushed across America after the California measles outbreak from 2015 to 2016, mirrored the COVID-19 mandates.
Likewise, the disastrous military anthrax vaccine campaign (which ended up being so devastating laws were passed to make mandating experimental vaccines on our soldiers illegal) ultimately was a beta test for the horrific acts committed upon our soldiers with the COVID-19 vaccines.
This troubling trend isn’t new; it can even be traced back to the smallpox vaccines, which were poorly tested and often caused outbreaks, prompting stricter mandates. Yet, when public pushback led to the reversal of these mandates, it resulted in an innovative approach that ultimately eliminated smallpox.
Today, we’re at a pivotal crossroads. The pharmaceutical industry’s greed has spiraled out of control, but public sentiment is shifting against these insane practices. There’s a growing movement — Making America Healthy Again — that shows people are ready to reclaim their health.
Consider this recent exchange where the co-chair of Trump’s transition told a hostile CNN host Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had sold him on the dangers of vaccines and that they intend to have Kennedy fix this and make our children healthy again:
After years of watching the pharmaceutical industry’s abuses, I once thought change was impossible and never once imagined an exchange like this could occur on national television.
Now, I see a unique opportunity tomorrow to challenge the status quo. That hope fuels my dedication to this cause, and I’m incredibly grateful for what everyone’s doing to at last fix this dysfunctional paradigm.

The conditions include life-threatening side effects at rates “significantly higher” than other Hib vaccines.
The study, by Children’s Health Defense (CHD) researcher Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., and Brian Hooker, Ph.D., CHD chief scientific officer, compared adverse events among children who received HibTITER to those among children who received other Hib vaccines.
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a bacterium that can cause illnesses ranging from ear infections to pneumonia to meningitis. Vaccines for Hib in young children were first licensed in 1987. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends Hib vaccines for infants at age 2 months.
Wyeth, now Pfizer, sold HibTITER from the time it was licensed in 1990 until 2007. In 2003, the company reformulated the vaccine to remove thimerosal, a type of mercury, after public outcry over the dangers of mercury in vaccines.
In 2007, Pfizer “quietly” pulled the reformulated HibTITER vaccine off the market, Hooker told The Defender — a move he said was concerning, in light of the vaccine’s “relationship to many adverse events in children.”
To assess those adverse events, Jablonowski and Hooker analyzed data from 277,484 children between 2003-2007 — when the thimerosal-free HibTiTER was available — using the publicly available Florida Medicaid database.
They corroborated their findings by analyzing data for the vaccine from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a passive public reporting system jointly administered by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The researchers identified medical conditions for infants vaccinated with any Hib vaccine within 30 days of the shot. The Medicaid data revealed 19 different diagnoses associated with HibTITER at frequencies significantly higher than those associated with other Hib vaccines. They also verified 14 of those diagnoses in VAERS.
The adverse events, ranging from mild to life-threatening, included respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic and generalized infections; ear, nose and throat medical contitions; and other conditions.
None of the serious or even life-threatening conditions identified were listed as possible adverse events on the package insert for HibTITER.
The authors’ findings “have profound medical implications for the estimated 35 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 33 who received the vaccine,” they wrote.
VAERS ‘screaming’ problem with HibTITER for decades
The first Hib conjugate vaccine, which combines a weak antigen with a stronger one to elicit a more robust immune response to the weak antigen, was licensed in 1987 for children 18 months and older, and in 1990 for infants 2 months and older.
Following the approval of the first Hib conjugates, rates of Hib disease in young children dropped dramatically — 92%, from 37 per 100,000 in 1989 to 3 per 100,000 by 2008.
While numerous safety studies found the vaccine to be safe and the side effects to be transient, Jablonowski and Hooker wrote that those studies were “underpowered” — meaning the sample sizes were too small to detect potential safety issues.
The clinical trial used to declare the vaccine’s safety consisted of investigators calling families 72 hours after vaccination to see how the infants were doing. On that basis, they concluded the vaccine was “safe and effective,” the authors wrote.
“Since VAERS first went live in July of 1990 the data started screaming that something was wrong with HibTITER,” Jablonowski told The Defender. “In VAERS’ first six months of existence, 30% of mortalities reported in children 6 months old or younger were HibTITER recipients.”
HibTITER dominated the Hib vaccine market between 1991 and 1994 when it began to share the market with other FDA-approved vaccines.
Wyeth allowed the license for the thimerosal-containing HibTITER to expire in 2002, following the CDC’s Simpsonwood retreat. At the meeting of public health officials, vaccine manufacturers and professional medical associations reviewed data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink and privately raised concerns about thimerosal in vaccines.
The license expired just after the Institute of Medicine’s Immunization Safety Review Committee published its 2001 safety review of thimerosal-containing vaccines and their link to neurodevelopmental disorders.
In that report, the Institute of Medicine found insufficient data to confirm or deny the link, yet the CDC recommended removing thimerosal from vaccines “as soon as possible.”
However, even when Wyeth began selling a reformulated non-thimerosal version of HibTITER in 2003, adverse events continued to occur at high rates.
“In the subsequent years, HibTITER accounted for a disproportionately larger number of emergency room visits, serious reports and reports of death,” Jablonowski said. “The FDA and CDC took no known action, and instead allowed the manufacturer, Wyeth, to choose to end production.”
The researchers estimated that approximately 35 million Americans received the HibTITER vaccine during its time on the market.
In 2011, vaccine maker Nuron Biotech Inc. acquired the HibTITER rights from Wyeth/Pfizer and announced it was preparing to rerelease the vaccine in the U.S. and some Asian markets.
However, the shot was never reintroduced to the U.S. market and the company no longer exists.
‘We were stunned at what the data revealed’
The investigators compared the frequencies of new diseases identified within 30 days of vaccination among 152,269 infants who received the thimerosal-free HibTITER to 125,215 infants who received any other Hib vaccine.
They employed the Fisher’s Exact Test statistical model to compare disease frequency in each cohort and used Bonferroni correction, a powerful statistical tool, to eliminate random results. They also set a high bar for statistical significance.
They identified 19 adverse outcomes with the “most prolific, significant signals” for infectious diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, where 99.03% of diagnoses were among HibTITER recipients.
Other respiratory illnesses occurring within 30 days of HibTITER vaccination included asthma, acute upper respiratory infections, influenza and acute bronchiolitis. Additional diseases included laryngopharyngitis, common cold, colitis, enteritis and gastroenteritis.
Of the 19 adverse effects they identified, the most recent package insert for HibTITER named only two: fever and rash. Infectious diseases accounted for nine of the 19 adverse effects.
Jablonowski explained that the HibTITER doesn’t directly cause infections but can create conditions that facilitate them. The presence of so many infections “implicates significant and rapid immunological defense impairment,” he said.
Jablonowski added:
“While we had heard anecdotally of many adverse reactions to the HibTITER vaccine, we were stunned at what the data revealed.
“This vaccine should have been studied much more intensively before being allowed on the market. In fact, it shouldn’t have ever been allowed to be injected into infants in the absence of rigorous studies to support its safety.”
He said analyzing the adverse outcomes was “simple — high-school level math and basic database/programming skills kind-of-simple. There are literally millions of people in this country who could have performed the data science portion of this study, and none of them apparently work for the FDA or CDC.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-cdc-planned-quarantine-camps-nationwide,The CDC Planned Quarantine Camps Nationwide,By Jeffrey A. Tucker | Brownstone Institute,3 months ago,"No matter how bad you think Covid policies were, they were intended to be worse.
Consider the vaccine passports alone. Six cities were locked down to include only the vaccinated in public indoor places. They were New York City, Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and Seattle. The plan was to enforce this with a vaccine passport. It broke. Once the news leaked that the shot didn’t stop infection or transmission, the planners lost public support and the scheme collapsed.
It was undoubtedly planned to be permanent and nationwide if not worldwide. Instead, the scheme had to be dialed back.
Features of the CDC’s edicts did incredible damage. It imposed the rent moratorium. It decreed the ridiculous “six feet of distance” and mask mandates. It forced Plexiglas as the interface for commercial transactions. It implied that mail-in balloting must be the norm, which probably flipped the election. It delayed the reopening as long as possible. It was sadistic.
Even with all that, worse was planned. On July 26, 2020, with the George Floyd riots having finally settled down, the CDC issued a plan for establishing nationwide quarantine camps. People were to be isolated, given only food and some cleaning supplies. They would be banned from participating in any religious services. The plan included contingencies for preventing suicide. There were no provisions made for any legal appeals or even the right to legal counsel.
The plan’s authors were unnamed but included 26 footnotes. It was completely official. The document was only removed on about March 26, 2023. During the entire intervening time, the plan survived on the CDC’s public site with little to no public notice or controversy.
It was called “Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings.”
By absence of empirical data, the meaning is: nothing like this has ever been tried. The point of the document was to map out how it could be possible and alert authorities to possible pitfalls to be avoided.
“This document presents considerations from the perspective of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) for implementing the shielding approach in humanitarian settings as outlined in guidance documents focused on camps, displaced populations and low-resource settings. This approach has never been documented and has raised questions and concerns among humanitarian partners who support response activities in these settings. The purpose of this document is to highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from CDC’s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data. Considerations are based on current evidence known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may need to be revised as more information becomes available.”
The meaning of “shielding” is “to reduce the number of severe Covid-19 cases by limiting contact between individuals at higher risk of developing severe disease (‘high-risk’) and the general population (‘low-risk’). High-risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to safe or ‘green zones’ established at the household, neighborhood, camp/sector, or community level depending on the context and setting. They would have minimal contact with family members and other low-risk residents.”
In other words, this is what used to be concentration camps.
Who are these people who would be rounded up? They are “older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions.” Who determines this? Public health authorities. The purpose? The CDC explains: “physically separating high-risk individuals from the general population” allows authorities “to prioritize the use of the limited available resources.”
This sounds a lot like condemning people to death in the name of protecting them.
The model establishes three levels. First is the household level. Here high-risk people are“physically isolated from other household members.” That alone is objectionable. Elders need people to take care of them. They need love and to be surrounded by family. The CDC should never imagine that it would intervene in households to force old people into separate places.
The model jumps from households to the “neighborhood level.” Here we have the same approach: forced separation of those deemed vulnerable.
From there, the model jumps again to the “camp/sector level.” Here it is different. “A group of shelters such as schools, community buildings within a camp/sector (max 50 high-risk individuals per single green zone) where high-risk individuals are physically isolated together. One entry point is used for exchange of food, supplies, etc. A meeting area is used for residents and visitors to interact while practicing physical distancing (2 meters). No movement into or outside the green zone.”
Yes, you read that correctly. The CDC is here proposing concentration camps for the sick or anyone they deem to be in danger of medically significant consequences of infection.
Further: “to minimize external contact, each green zone should include able-bodied high-risk individuals capable of caring for residents who have disabilities or are less mobile. Otherwise, designate low-risk individuals for these tasks, preferably who have recovered from confirmed COVID-19 and are assumed to be immune.”
The plan says in passing, contradicting thousands of years of experience, “Currently, we do not know if prior infection confers immunity.” Therefore the only solution is to minimize all exposure throughout the whole population. Getting sick is criminalized.
These camps require a “dedicated staff” to “monitor each green zone. Monitoring includes both adherence to protocols and potential adverse effects or outcomes due to isolation and stigma. It may be necessary to assign someone within the green zone, if feasible, to minimize movement in/out of green zones.”
The people housed in these camps need to have good explanations of why they are denied even basic religious freedom. The report explains:
“Proactive planning ahead of time, including strong community engagement and risk communication is needed to better understand the issues and concerns of restricting individuals from participating in communal practices because they are being shielded. Failure to do so could lead to both interpersonal and communal violence.”
Further, there must be some mechanisms to prohibit suicide:
Additional stress and worry are common during any epidemic and may be more pronounced with COVID-19 due to the novelty of the disease and increased fear of infection, increased childcare responsibilities due to school closures, and loss of livelihoods. Thus, in addition to the risk of stigmatization and feeling of isolation, this shielding approach may have an important psychological impact and may lead to significant emotional distress, exacerbate existing mental illness or contribute to anxiety, depression, helplessness, grief, substance abuse, or thoughts of suicide among those who are separated or have been left behind. Shielded individuals with concurrent severe mental health conditions should not be left alone. There must be a caregiver allocated to them to prevent further protection risks such as neglect and abuse.
The biggest risk, the document explains, is as follows: “While the shielding approach is not meant to be coercive, it may appear forced or be misunderstood in humanitarian settings.”
(It should go without saying but this “shielding” approach suggested here has nothing to do with focused protection of the Great Barrington Declaration. Focused protection specifically says: “schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.”)
In four years of research, and encountering truly shocking documents and evidence of what happened in the Covid years, this one certainly ranks up at the top of the list of totalitarian schemes for pathogenic control prior to vaccination. It is quite simply mind-blowing that such a scheme could ever be contemplated.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/how-the-government-created-exorbitant-insulin-prices,How the Government Created Exorbitant Insulin Prices,By Isaac Deak | Mises Institute,3 months ago,"The high price of insulin is increasingly present in American political discourse as presidential candidates boast of interventions; whereas, the Federal Trade Commission, states, and even counties and school boards have brought forth lawsuits, alleging price gouging and collusion between pharmaceutical giants and pharmacies. However, as is par for the course in American politics, policymakers ignore the reality that they—not the market—created these problems, and their proposed solutions will only exacerbate them.
Indeed, insulin prices have skyrocketed. One variety—Humalog—though initially priced at $21 a bottle, now sells for more than ten times that, and obviously, such prices are hurting consumers, some of whom are forced to pay upwards of 40 percent of their post-subsistence income for the life-sustaining drug. Individuals using expired insulin and rationing it at a cost to their own health are not uncommon occurrences. Predictably, desperation has driven some to the underground economy—bartering and donating or buying it for a fraction of the price in Mexico and then smuggling it back across the border.
Applying basic price theory, we know prices are not arbitrary, but are in fact manifestations of underlying realities. The diabetic population is growing, and their demand is largely inelastic, so we should, on one side of the coin, expect this demand to be reflected in the price. However, on the other side of the coin, we have supply, which—under normal market conditions—should rise to meet the growing demand, as producers, motivated by prospective profits, endeavor to satisfy consumer needs.
Why is the supply not rising to meet the demand? The costs of production have not increased, in fact, they have decreased by 20 percent between 2007 and 2021. Whereas this problem is particularly prevalent in the United States, as a report to Congress notes, “prices for insulin analogs cost 10 times more in the United States than any other developed country.”
Under free market capitalism, competitive producers should be perpetually pushing market prices downward. However, that evidently is not happening, and as the same report explains, the market is dominated by three firms—Ely Lily, Novo-Nordisk, and Sanofi—which are the exclusive producers for US consumption, and together, they capture approximately 90 percent of the worldwide market.
The obvious conclusion? This is not a free market at all, but one where supply is forcibly restricted by state-granted monopoly privileges. There are several contributing factors to the monopolization. Those suing would do well to remember no collusion would be possible if individuals were free to purchase insulin themselves rather than through a licensed pharmacy and with a prescription from a licensed medical practitioner. A world in which individuals may bypass licensed professionals may offend some sensibilities, but that licensure creates monopoly and restricts supply is beyond dispute.
While a free market incentivizes producers to innovate, the regulatory state discourages innovation at home and prevents outside innovations from reaching consumers. Insulin alternatives do, in fact, exist. “Biosimilars,” for instance, are an alternative to the “biologic” insulins dominating the American market. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, has been slow to act. A 2018 study found, “at least 11 insulin biosimilars are marketed (under less stringent regulatory frameworks) at considerably lower price points in China, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, and Thailand.” However, the FDA refused to approve a biosimilar insulin product until 2021.
Worse yet, the patent system restricts supply by granting monopoly privilege to a sole producer. Empirical research affirms, the patent system’s monopoly grants, extensions thereof, and patents for complementary goods (e.g., insulin-delivery devices), combined with the FDA’s refusal to approve competing products have directly contributed to higher prices.
Of course, critics retort that there would be no innovation without patent protection, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. The data, however, suggests the opposite. In their 2008 book, Against Intellectual Monopoly, Michele Boldrin and David Levine found pharmaceutical innovations fell in countries once a patent system was adopted. In Italy, they found pharmaceutical innovations dropped from 9.28 percent of the global total to 7.5 percent once patents were introduced. They found, “India has taken over as the primary center of pharmaceutical production without patent protection. The growth and vitality of the Indian industry is similar to that of the pre-1978 industry in Italy.” Coincidentally, insulin is one of the many drugs they found was discovered with little to no influence of the patent system.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-vaccine-linked-to-higher-risk-of-acute-heart-disease-study,Covid Vaccine Linked to Higher Risk of Acute Heart Disease — Study,By Sean Miller,3 months ago,"A study published October 24 has detailed how the Covid injections are linked to a higher risk of acute heart disease. It analyzed the effects of the first dose of various types of Covid shots on acute heart disease in the Korean population.
“The results revealed higher heart disease risk in individuals receiving mRNA vaccines than other types,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The findings that mRNA shots are more likely to damage the heart than viral vector shots are concurrent with another study that Infowars previously reported on.
Interestingly, the study analyzing Koreans for heart damage post-injection also found that the injected individuals who got infected with the Covid virus had an even greater risk of heart damage.
“Individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 also exhibited significantly higher heart disease risk than those uninfected,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Younger individuals faced a greater risk of heart disease than older individuals.
“…younger individuals who received mRNA vaccines had a higher heart disease risk compared to older individuals,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The study was conducted by analyzing data recorded between October 2018 to March 2022 from the National Health Insurance Service Covid database.
“We sought to provide insights for public health policies and clinical decisions pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination strategies,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “We analysed heart disease risk, including acute cardiac injury, acute myocarditis, acute pericarditis, cardiac arrest, and cardiac arrhythmia, in relation to vaccine type and COVID-19 within 21 days after the first vaccination date, employing Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates.”
The Covid shots are known to:

https://www.infowars.com/posts/doctors-in-canada-euthanize-man-with-disabling-covid-vaccine-injury-and-mental-illness,Doctors in Canada Euthanize Man with Disabling Covid Vaccine Injury and Mental Illness,"By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"An Ontario, Canada, man in his late 40s whose health declined after receiving three COVID-19 shots and who also had a mental health condition was euthanized in Canada as part of its Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) program, Dr. Aaron Kheriaty reported.
The program assessors concluded that his clinical presentation was a post-COVID-19 “vaccination syndrome” known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue syndrome.
The case is one of several highlighted in an expert review of MAiD deaths in Ontario that caused concerns. The report, which did not reveal the man’s name, is intended to identify and prompt improvements that need to be made to Canada’s legalized euthanasia program.
“This case report shows how the Canadian healthcare system abandoned a suicidal patient in need of real medical and psychiatric care,” Kheriaty wrote. “If it had not come from a government report I would have had difficulty believing this horrifying case history.”
According to the brief case report, the patient went through extensive specialist consultations and clinical testing but “without determinate diagnostic results.” He also suffered from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
While he was “navigating his physical symptoms,” the man was admitted to the hospital with suicidal ideation. Psychiatrists raised concerns about mental illness, the report said. During a second incidence of suicidal ideation, he was involuntarily hospitalized and received in-patient psychiatric treatment.
“The MAiD assessors opined that the most reasonable diagnosis for Mr. A’s clinical presentation (severe functional decline) was a post-vaccine syndrome,” the report said.
His cause of death was listed as “post-COVID-19 vaccination somatic symptom disorder with post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorder.” MAiD is not listed as the cause of death on death certificates in Ontario.
In their report, experts raised concerns about whether the man’s mental illnesses should have rendered him ineligible for MAiD and whether the duration of the psychiatric treatment he underwent was adequate to evaluate if more treatment might help him.
Other members of the panel questioned whether a condition “previously unrecognized in medicine” — his “post-vaccine somatic syndrome” — could be considered incurable, given limited available clinical knowledge and research.
Dr. Joel Wallskog, a Wisconsin orthopedic surgeon who stopped practicing medicine after being injured by Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, told The Defender, “I am truly shocked by the trend of offering active euthanasia to those injured by the COVID-19 vaccines.”
Wallskog, co-chair of the vaccine-injured patient advocacy group React19 added:
“This program ignores the basic principle in medicine of ‘first do no harm.’
“Second … this program highlights the gaslighting and the sheer abandonment of the COVID-19 vaccine-injured community. We need research, providers that acknowledge these injuries, and effective diagnostics and treatments. We don’t need to be sent off to slaughter.
“Third, this program is a sad reflection on the course of humanity in general. The COVID-19-injured community needs hope and support. They don’t need active euthanasia.”
MAiD expert Alexander Raikin, visiting fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, who has been documenting and analyzing the program for years, told The Defender the case captures the worst of the problems with MAiD and MAiD oversight.
“It shows that certain people with depression, with disabilities and other illnesses are not equally protected under Canadian law as healthy Canadians,” he added. “If this man did not also have an illness caused by taking a vaccine, then he would still be alive today.”
MAiD: the world’s fastest-growing assisted-dying program
Canada established the MAiD program in 2016 when it legalized euthanasia. The program includes assisted suicide (providers give patients the means to take their own lives) and euthanasia (the provider administers a patient’s lethal injection).
According to Raikin, over 99% of the deaths in the program happen through euthanasia.
Originally, people eligible for the program included only those with “a “reasonably foreseeable” death. In March 2021, the law was changed to make people with chronic conditions who no longer wanted to live eligible for the program. The two groups are called “track one” and “track two” respectively.
Supporters argue that MAiD provides an important solution for those who want to end their suffering from terminal or chronic illness. They believe the program has key safeguards in place to ensure vulnerable people aren’t pushed into assisted death.
Safeguards include things like an informed consent requirement to participate in the program and a 90-day assessment, or waiting, period for people with chronic conditions who decide to undergo euthanasia. Those who have a “foreseeable death” don’t have an assessment period.
Often, the median wait time between requesting MAiD and death is 11 days, according to Health Canada.
Detractors, like Raikin, argue that even the minimal safeguards often aren’t followed, problematic cases aren’t criminally investigated, and the program amounts to “essentially legally sanctioned murder.”
When the Supreme Court of Canada decriminalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, it directed parliament to create “a stringently limited, carefully monitored system of exceptions,” Raikin has written. Instead, it has become the world’s largest and fastest-growing euthanasia program.
Raikin said that since the program began, the number of deaths from MAiD increased thirteenfold, from 1,018 in 2016 to over 13,200 in 2022, the last year for which full reporting is available.
A coalition of organizations advocating for Canadians with disabilities in September filed a legal challenge against the “track two” MAID provision, arguing that it discriminates against people with disabilities and has resulted in premature deaths, The BMJ reported.
“We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty, and lack of essential supports,” said Krista Carr, executive vice president of Inclusion Canada in a statement.
“This law also sends a devastating message that life with a disability is a fate worse than death, undermining decades of work toward equity and inclusion. It’s time to put an end to helping people with disabilities commit suicide and start supporting them to live.”
Raikin said the rule is blatantly discriminatory. “If you’re a healthy Canadian, and you say, ‘I want kill myself,’ the government, the police, the suicide hotlines, the medical system, they would all say ‘don’t.’ But if you have a disability or an illness …?”
A Health Canada annual report found that more than a third of Canadians who participate in the program do so because they feel like they are a burden to their family and friends. Others say they feel socially isolated.
Raikin said there is extensive evidence showing that a major part of the problem is a lack of adequate support for the ill and disabled in Canada. For example, he said, in 2023, the median wait time to get a CD scan in Canada was over 60 days — but in the first seven months of 2024, the wait time to see a MAiD practitioner was only 2.2 business days.
“I don’t know any other procedure under Canada’s public healthcare system that you can get as quickly as MAiD,” he said. It’s not just Canada, the problem exists in many countries, he said.
Case likely representative of other cases
Raikin said the cases discussed in the recent expert review were flagged by the coroner’s office and sent to the board. He said the actual number of cases sent for review are unknown. However, the cases sent to the board for discussion typically are representative of more than one case.
“The fact that there is a case study on an individual case of vaccine damage implies that there were other similar cases, but we don’t know how many,” he said.
From his reading of the report, Raikin said it’s clear the man did not receive adequate medical support and care. He said it was also important to understand that the physicians who diagnosed the patient and offered to end his life are euthanasia advocates.
The case raises serious questions, particularly about people in the “track two” category of the MAiD program and the types of care and support they receive before being considered for MAiD, he said.
Wallskog said that some vaccine-injured people also died through euthanasia at the Pegasos Clinic in Switzerland.
React19 represents 36,000 vaccine-injured people, he said. Having spoken with thousands of vaccine-injured people Wallskog said he has found that if a person is marginalized before their injury, it is exponentially more disabling to them.
“In this situation, these people need more help, not less,” which his organization’s advocacy program seeks to provide. “Mental health issues should never be a reason that active euthanasia is considered.”
“The COVID-19 vaccine-injured community is traumatized at least twice,” Wallskog said. “Once by their injury. Second, by how they are gaslit and abandoned. Active euthanasia programs are just pure evil and should be exposed as such.”
Molecular biologist Christina Parks, Ph.D., told The Defender that from a scientific standpoint, there was not a lot of medical information in the report for external reviewers to analyze.
However, she thought it raised a broader point. “When you mandate an experimental medical intervention that destroys health, and then you offer euthanasia as a solution, that looks a lot like population control.”
It begs the question, she said “Are we human beings? Or are we just seen as some sort of animal that can be herded and culled ‘for the greater good?’”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-shape-of-things-to-come-2,The Shape of Things To Come,By Raw Egg Nationalist,4 months ago,"We’re finally getting an idea of what Make America Healthy Again might actually look like.
On Saturday, Donald Trump’s health czar Robert F. Kennedy revealed that a first-day priority of the new Trump administration would be to end municipal water fluoridation.
“On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy Tweeted.
“Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President ​@realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.”
In a second Tweet, Kennedy drew attention to a recent federal court ruling, in which an Obama-appointed judge, after reviewing a huge number of scientific studies and hours of expert testimony, ruled that the EPA had “improperly approved this dangerous neurotoxin.”
If you’ve been following the news, or my writing for Infowars, you’ll know the exact ruling Kennedy is referring to. Back in September, Judge Edward Chen, in the Northern District of California, found that fluoride in drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children.
“In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote in his judgment.
“EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.”
American towns have already started removing fluoride from their water supplies after Judge Chen’s ruling. Yorktown and Somers, both in New York State, have announced an end to municipal fluoridation, on the sensible basis that residents can choose to supplement their diets with fluoride if they wish through toothpaste and other products, but nobody should have to consume fluoride if they don’t want to.
So that’s one MAHA initiative: an end to fluoridation.
Yesterday Trump said, in an interview with NBC, that idea “sounds okay to me.” Let’s assume he really is on board.
What else?
In the same interview, Trump was asked directly if he would consider banning certain vaccines.
“Well, I’m going to talk to [RFK Jr.] and talk to other people, and I’ll make a decision, but he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump replied.
That’s definitely not a refusal.
It would make sense, of course. Trump has Tweeted in the past about vaccines causing autism—”Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn’t feel good and changes – AUTISM. Many such cases!”—and vaccines are an RFK Jr. special subject. Kennedy has spent decades campaigning to highlight the harmful, even deadly, side effects of vaccines and the double tragedy of families having a child injured by a vaccine only to hit a wall of denials and smears in their quest for justice.
Oh yes—and there was that leaked phone call between Trump and RFK Jr. in which the former president expressed, in the words of CNN, “vaccine scepticism.”
Which vaccines might be targeted, isn’t clear yet. Since 2020, one of Kennedy’s main targets has been the COVID-19 vaccines, and especially the new experimental mRNA vaccines (or gene therapy, if you prefer), but that may be a touchy subject with Trump. Trump was responsible, after all, for Operation Warp Speed and probably doesn’t want to admit that it was a mistake—even if it was an honest mistake, and I think it was. So far Trump has avoided any suggestion that he regrets Warp Speed and the mass rollout of the vaccines, but he has apologised to military personnel and government employees who were forced out of their jobs for refusing to take the shot. In August, he said at a town hall that he would rehire servicemen and -women and give them backdated pay as compensation for their hardships.
Then there’s JD Vance’s recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, in which Vance freely spoke about the unpleasant side effects he experienced when he took a COVID vaccine.
So maybe the COVID shots might be on the table.
It’s more likely that other vaccines, and the absurd childhood vaccination schedule, will be on the chopping block. In Trump’s leaked phone call with Kennedy, he spoke about the dangers of giving children too many vaccines all at once.
“When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is, like, 38 different vaccines and it looks like it’s been for a horse, Not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby… And then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I’ve seen it too many times.”
Okay. So now we have two specific targets: the water supply and the vaccines.
Kennedy has already spoken at length during the campaign about endocrine disruptors—ubiquitous toxic chemicals that disrupt our body’s hormonal balance, with devastating effects for health across the board—and ultra-processed food, which Americans like the rest of the Developed World are consuming in unholy quantities, again with devastating effects. Kennedy believes that these are two of the principal causes of the chronic-disease nightmare America faces today, from obesity to neurological diseases and everything in between. He’s right.
That’s two more targets.
Institutional capture has been another topic of focus for RFK Jr. across the decades, and he’s spoken recently, as we’d expect, about the need for root and branch reform of the FDA and the USDA and the EPA and so on. All of these institutions are supposed to protect Americans and ensure corporate interests are held to account, but instead they’ve been hopelessly captured by the very corporations they’re supposed to police.
So we’ve got at least five clear targets now: the water supply; the vaccines; the pollution; the food; and the regulators.
If that doesn’t sound like an agenda for a full four-year term—and probably beyond—I don’t know what does.
Trump still hasn’t announced a specific role for Kennedy, but Kennedy himself has told his supporters that he could be given powers over a number of different public health agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture.
A floating position could very well be a strength for Kennedy—as a kind of “minister without portfolio” who can move around with relative ease from department to department and from organization to organization, navigating the intricate tangle of interests that determine the health and well-being of Americans, without getting caught up in them.
Yeah, I like that idea a lot.
But this is all to come.
In the meantime, get out there and vote if you haven’t already. We can’t Make America Healthy Again if Trump isn’t elected.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/deadly-fungus-outbreaks-on-the-rise-bloomberg-warns-covid-and-global-warming-to-blame,"Deadly Fungus Outbreaks on the Rise, Bloomberg Warns: COVID and Global Warming To Blame",By Raw Egg Nationalist,4 months ago,"There has been a surge in cases of deadly fungal outbreaks since the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are warning.
According to Bloomberg, the pandemic helped drive the spread of these deadly fungal diseases, and a warming planet may help them adapt and spread.
One particular species, Candida auris, “clings to the surface of medical equipment in hospitals and thrives in chronically ill people with weak immune systems,” and although it isn’t the most common form of fungal infection, kills as many as half who are infected with it.
New analysis shows that C. auris outbreaks are on the rise since the pandemic, appearing on “every continent except Antarctica.”
“Severe illness-causing fungal outbreaks have also start occurring among young, healthy people, signaling the pathogens’ growing strength,” Bloomberg says.
Incidences of C. auris infection have tripled between 2018 and 2021, and increased more than sixfold in China in the same period.
Fungal infections are part of a “plethora of lesser-known pathogens that are driving a surge in severe disease in the post-Covid world.” Other diseases include flesh-eating bacteria in Japan that can kill within 48 hours, as seen in Japan, and ulcerating sores transmitted by sand flies in the US.
The growing heat resistance of fungi is a particular concern to researchers, because it means they can tolerate the human body’s 37 degrees C, which is usually enough to kill fungi. The global increase in mean temperatures is being blamed for this adaptation.
The pandemic has also played a role, by disrupting human interaction and altering people’s exposure to pathogens globally for a period of years.
“Covid-19 changed the disease ecosystem of this planet by shutting down the world and limiting our interaction with each other for years. Some diseases were wiped out for a period of time, but as we came back together, the pathogens diseases took advantage,” said the WHO’s Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director at WHO’s Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention.
“While the world has largely returned to pre-Covid interactions, the virus still circulates, and the pandemic’s public health, economic and mental health impacts are still ricocheting through societies.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-may-ban-certain-vaccines-on-advice-of-rfk-jr,Trump May Ban Certain Vaccines on Advice of RFK Jr.,By Raw Egg Nationalist,4 months ago,"Donald Trump has refused to rule out banning certain vaccines during his second term, he told NBC on Sunday.
Trump, who has linked vaccines to autism in the past, said banning vaccines would remain an option.
“Well, I’m going to talk to [RFK Jr.] and talk to other people, and I’ll make a decision, but he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said.
Trump has yet to specify exactly what role RFK Jr. will play in his administration, but Trump has made clear it will be an important one.
“He can do anything he wants,” the former president said at a campaign event last week.
Trump has said Kennedy will “work on health and women’s health,” and sources have also claimed he will focus on “chronic childhood disease.”
On Saturday, Kennedy said a Trump administration would issue general advice to bring water fluoridation to an end.
“On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy Tweeted.
“Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President ​@realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.”
In a second Tweet, Kennedy drew attention to a recent federal court ruling, in which an Obama-appointed judge, after reviewing a huge number of scientific studies and hours of expert testimony, ruled that the EPA had “improperly approved this dangerous neurotoxin.”
Trump has since confirmed that the plan is “possible.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/kennedy-trump-white-house-will-remove-fluoride-from-drinking-water,Kennedy: Trump White House Will Remove Fluoride from Drinking Water,By Raw Egg Nationalist,4 months ago,"A new Trump administration will make removing fluoride from US public water one of its priorities, according to RFK Jr.
On Saturday, Trump’s health czar told Twitter that, on the day of the inauguration, the White House will issue general advice to stop adding fluoride to water.
“On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy Tweeted.
“Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President ​@realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.”
In a second Tweet, Kennedy drew attention to a recent federal court ruling, in which an Obama-appointed judge, after reviewing a huge number of scientific studies and hours of expert testimony, ruled that the EPA had “improperly approved this dangerous neurotoxin.”
Judge Edward Chen, in the Northern District of California, ruled that fluoride in drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children.
“In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote.
“EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.”
American towns have already started removing fluoride from their water supplies after Judge Chen’s ruling.
Yorktown and Somers, both in New York State, have both announced an end to municipal fluoridation.
Somers Supervisor Robert Scorrano said that the town’s decision to stop fluoridating the municipal water supply would “give residents the freedom to choose their own sources of fluoride, ensuring personal control over their health decisions. Additionally, concerns about potential long-term health risks from fluoride exposure support reevaluating its use in public water systems.”
In addition to the potential risks to health and IQ, a new report has also shown that the dental benefits of fluoridation are limited.
The new report, published by the Cochrane Review, says that any benefits for tooth decay are now minimal, because people have a much higher baseline level of dental health than they did 50 years ago.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/house-floats-law-to-make-colleges-that-mandated-covid-shots-pay-for-vaccine-injuries,House Floats Law to Make Colleges That Mandated Covid Shots Pay for Vaccine Injuries,"By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"Colleges that mandated the COVID-19 vaccine would be liable for medical expenses for students who experienced adverse events from the shot, under a bill introduced Tuesday in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The University Forced Vaccination Student Injury Mitigation Act of 2024 would require higher education institutions to cover medical costs for students who were — or still are — required to get a COVID-19 shot for class attendance and who experienced an injury.
The bill — introduced by Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) — stipulates colleges must cover the medical costs or risk losing all federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education.
“If you are not prepared to face the consequences, you should have never committed the act,” said Rosendale in a press release. “Colleges and universities forced students to inject themselves with an experimental vaccine knowing it was not going to prevent COVID-19 while potentially simultaneously causing life-threatening health defects like Guillain-Barré Syndrome and myocarditis.”
“It is now time,” Rosendale added, “for schools to be held accountable for their brazen disregard for students’ health and pay for the issues they are responsible for causing.”
Reps. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) and Bill Posey (R-Fla.) co-sponsored the bill.
Dr. Joseph Marine, professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explained in the press release why he supports the bill:
“COVID-19 vaccine mandates for college students were flawed policies that did not alter the course of the pandemic and were not needed to keep college campuses ‘safe.’ I had to make efforts to prevent my own high school and college-age children from receiving COVID-19 booster shots that they did not want or need.
“It seems reasonable to me that institutions that implemented such policies without a sound medical or scientific rationale should take responsibility for any proven medical harm that they caused.”
If passed, the bill would allow students to submit a formal request for reimbursement, the Washington Examiner reported.
The request would have to include a record of COVID-19 vaccination, certification from a medical provider that the vaccine caused some kind of disease and a detailed account of related medical expenses.
Diseases covered by the legislation include myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome and any other diseases that the U.S. Secretary of Education determines to be linked to COVID-19 vaccination.
After the student’s request is vetted to ensure it’s valid and contains sufficient evidence, the college would have to pay the medical costs within 30 days.
It is unclear when a vote on the bill will take place.
CHD took college mandate challenge to U.S. Supreme Court
Rutgers University was the first college or university in the U.S. to mandate the vaccines, threatening to disenroll noncompliant students in the fall 2021 semester. In August 2021, Children’s Health Defense (CHD) sued the university in an attempt to block the mandate.
The case was dismissed in January 2023. After losing on appeal in February, CHD in May asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, but the court declined. Meanwhile, a month earlier, Rutgers abruptly ended the mandate.
Meanwhile, a federal appeals court this summer ruled that employees in the Los Angeles Unified School District can sue the district over its COVID-19 vaccine mandate because the shots don’t prevent transmission.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that myocarditis and pericarditismay occur after COVID-19 vaccination. And research shows that adolescents and young adults are particularly at risk of vaccine-induced myocarditis.
As of Sept. 27, there were 1,604,710 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports of injury or death following a COVID-19 vaccination.
VAERS is the primary mechanism for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before confirming the reported adverse event was caused by the vaccine. VAERS has historically been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.
Meanwhile, citing concerns about the shots’ efficacy and safety, Idaho’s Southwest District Health last week voted to no longer offer COVID-19 vaccines at all 30 locations where it provides healthcare services.
17 colleges still have COVID vaccine mandates
By late May 2021, more than 400 U.S. colleges and universities required students to be vaccinated against COVID-19, The New York Times reported.
As of Oct. 19, 17 of those institutions still have a COVID-19 vaccination requirement for students to be able to enroll or live on campus, according to No College Mandates, a “group of concerned parents, doctors, nurses, professors, students and other college stakeholders working towards the common goal of ending COVID-19 vaccine mandates.”
Lucia Sinatra, co-founder of No College Mandates, said in the press release:
“College students were never at risk of severe injury or death from any variant of the COVID-19 virus and institutions of higher education had this data well in advance of mandating COVID-19 vaccines.”
According to the CDC, age is the “strongest risk factor” for severe outcomes from COVID-19 — meaning that the older a person is, the greater their risk for severe symptoms and death.
The CDC said its National Center for Health Statistics shows that “compared with ages 18–29 years, the risk of death is 25 times higher in those ages 50–64 years, 60 times higher in those ages 65–74 years, 140 times higher in those ages 75–84 years, and 340 times higher in those ages 85+ years.”
In other words, the typical college student — ages 18-22 — isn’t usually at risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19 when compared with older age groups.
Nonetheless, Sinatra said, many colleges imposed “some of the most coercive and restrictive vaccination policies” on college students, stripping them of their “fundamental right to bodily autonomy and informed consent.”",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-was-just-the-beginning-a-total-war-against-civilization,Covid Was Just the Beginning a Total War Against Civilization,By Frank Wright | Lifesite,4 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — According to the British academic Dr. David A. Hughes, the so-called “polycrisis” described by the World Economic Forum is not only no accident, but is a deliberate act of total war on our entire civilization. Driven by the ruling elites, he says its aim is to establish a worldwide totalitarianism.
In this new interview, LifeSiteNews speaks to Dr. Hughes about what he calls the “omniwar.”
Described in detail in his April 2024 book, “Covid-19,” Psychological Operations, and the War for Technocracy, Hughes makes a convincing case for a total picture of our fracturing reality as an act of revolutionary violence by the rulers against the ruled.
From his point of view, the many crises of the world amount to the controlled demolition of our entire way of life.
This book appears to have cost Hughes not only “three years of my life,” but also his academic career.
With degrees from Oxford and 11 years of academic teaching behind him, Hughes explains in the interview how the repressive regime of censorship which typifies this omniwar presented him with a stark choice between compliance and unemployment. Hughes chose to speak the truth, and his well-researched book is the fruit of this principled labor.
Hughes claims that this war cannot be won by the general population unless they first understand that it is taking place. Secondly, he says, they must understand how it is being fought. This is the reason, he says, that his conscience compelled him to risk his career to bring out his account of the war on our civilization.
Hughes argues that the omniwar began with the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, and explains we are not in the grip of vast coincidences. The launch of a “psychological warfare operation” under lockdown has combined with financial, social, and international crises to traumatize the population, and condition them into accepting a technocratic control system.
RELATED: New documentary ‘Omniwar’ exposes the shocking covert assault on freedom and wealth
With his extensive research into methods of propaganda, he shows how the manipulation of the public mind creates social division – including hatred and chaos – which neutralizes opposition to the ruling elite.
Citing the case of the generation – by state propaganda – of worldwide “hatred against the unvaccinated,” Hughes also charges that all our civil institutions have been corrupted, resulting in lawfare instead of law, indoctrination in place of education, and a permanent state of war at home and abroad in place of peace.
Saying only the willfully blind can deny the obvious harm of mRNA “vaccines,” Hughes relates how it was the COVID-19 measures which changed his mind about the system which governs us. What is more, it opened his eyes to the fact that the war is not only temporal, but spiritual.
Having lost faith in secular commentators and colleagues who “went along with” the COVID measures, he said, “I found new friends. One day, I asked myself what all these people had in common.”
He discovered to his surprise that “they were all Christians.”
Dr. Hughes is frank about the spiritual dimension to the practice of crisis as war. He is clear-sighted that the methods of destruction towards death are the devices of Satan and argues calmly for the evidence – not against it.
What is more, he says the situation is far from hopeless. Describing the goal of the ruling elite’s omniwar as “audacious – but desperate,” he is careful to remind his audience that “the odds are on the side of the resistance.”
It is this resistance he wishes to build, through his careful – and readable – research. He calls for a restoration of compassion – not vengeance, saying there are many practical means by which we can resist this war.
Today you can find out how this war began, why and how it is being fought, and most importantly of all – how we can win.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-biden-harris-administration-wasted-nearly-one-billion-on-misinformation,The Biden-Harris Administration Wasted Nearly One Billion on Misinformation,By Ian Miller | Brownstone Institute,4 months ago,"The party of “Science” apparently misled hundreds of millions of people on the actual science surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. Stop the presses.
Starting in early 2020, the combined efforts of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services, and their partners in the media caused an untold amount of damage to society and public health and might have even created conditions for increased Covid spread. How? By repeatedly, profoundly, and often purposefully communicating inaccurate information while spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get their preferred messages across.
Now, a new, massive 113-page report from the US House of Representatives Energy & Commerce Committee has detailed the remarkable abuses from the Biden-Harris administration and the manner in which they communicated during Covid.
The report details a number of unbelievable inaccuracies in 2021 coming from the Biden administration’s communications team and the CDC’s messaging apparatus. Fauci and Francis Collins’ National Institutes of Health were also responsible, creating guidance using taxpayer money, nearly $1 billion per the report, that misled millions of people and caused unimaginable harm in the process.
While the Biden-Harris administration’s public health guidance led to prolonged closures of schools and businesses, the NIH was spending nearly a billion dollars of taxpayer money trying to manipulate Americans with advertisements—sometimes containing erroneous or unproven information. By overpromising what the Covid-19 vaccines could do—in direct contradiction of the FDA’s authorizations—and over emphasizing the virus’s risk to children and young adults, the Biden-Harris administration caused Americans to lose trust in the public health system,” Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said after the report’s release. “Our investigation also uncovered the extent to which public funding went to Big Tech companies to track and monitor Americans, underscoring the need for stronger online data privacy protections.”
One of the most damaging, and woefully incorrect messaging campaigns centered on vaccine efficacy against infection. As the report details, Biden’s “Stop the Spread” campaign was a pervasive marketing effort in conjunction with the CDC that claimed vaccines would end the pandemic by reducing infections. That had enormous knock-on effects, including decreasing trust in all vaccinations and ultimately harming public health.
“The entire premise of the Biden-Harris ‘Stop the Spread’ campaign was that if you got vaccinated for COVID-19, you could resume daily activities because they said vaccinated people would not spread the disease,” said Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chair Morgan Griffith (R-VA). “Despite lacking scientific basis, the administration bought into this CDC claim and misled the American public. As a result, vaccination coverage with other vaccines appears to have declined, I believe because of a growing distrust of information coming from our public health institutions.”
This campaign was even more disingenuous and purposefully misleading than previously realized. The “Stop the Spread” publicity blitz hid in plain sight a message from the CDC that even they didn’t know whether the vaccines actually stopped infection or transmission. The report shared a screenshot of a page from the Biden administration’s marketing that specifically said “science” wasn’t sure how well the vaccines worked against infection.
Yet the Biden administration made life-altering policy decisions such as vaccine mandates, discriminatory entry processes, and military vaccination requirements regardless. And that was in addition to the less quantifiable impacts like nudging millions of people to follow their preferred course of action.
The report also explains how the Biden administration relied heavily on guidance from the CDC, an organization that thoroughly disgraced itself during the pandemic. There were several examples highlighted, chief among them that CDC “experts” went far beyond what even the FDA claimed Covid vaccines could do.
Without evidence, the report says Biden’s marketing claimed that “COVID vaccines were highly effective against transmission.” Within just a few months, it was clear that all the available evidence pointed towards the exact opposite direction. Per the report, this had a “negative impact on vaccine confidence and the CDC’s credibility when proven untrue.”
The CDC also had “inconsistent and flawed messaging about the effectiveness of masks,” which created seemingly endless mandates and, again, overconfidence in an ineffective policy. Some of those mandates even continue to this day.
That’s just the tip of their misinformation. A wealth of data and public embarrassments for the CDC confirmed that the organization “consistently overstated the risk of COVID-19 to children,” the report states. That fear-mongering had disastrous consequences, from unnecessarily terrifying parents to prolonged school closures and lack of socialization—setting an entire generation of children back in the process.
Still, after being repeatedly and profoundly proven wrong, the CDC has demonstrated they’ve yet to learn their lesson. In late 2024, the CDC continues to recommend Covid-19 vaccines for babies starting at six months old. That makes the US a global outlier compared to European nations that have maintained at least some level of intellectual honesty.
The report detailed several recommendations to fix these organizations after their disastrous work during the pandemic. Even implementing just a select few, listed below, would do wonders for fixing the institutional rot that influenced these mistakes.
Also highlighted in the report is how the CDC and NIH used their weight in their attempts to censor scientists who dissented from their preferred narratives. Beyond their mistakes, profound inaccuracies, and nearly unlimited spending, their censorship efforts are equally concerning.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/are-vaccine-passports-just-around-the-corner-u-s-canada-mexico-launch-pandemic-preparedness-initiative,"Are Vaccine Passports Just Around the Corner? U.S., Canada, Mexico Launch Pandemic Preparedness Initiative","By Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"The U.S., Canada and Mexico launched a joint pandemic preparedness initiative they said will unite the countries’ public health agencies around a “One Health” approach to addressing future pandemics.
A critic of the new initiative warned the plan may empower the World Health Organization (WHO) — the architect of the original One Health Initiative — to impose global control measures like vaccine passports and new policies targeting the “infodemic.”
“Because this is an initiative from the WHO, I am deeply concerned,” said Nicholas Hulscher, an epidemiologist and fellow at the McCullough Foundation. “They appear to be seeking domain over plants, animals, and humans — globalized, central control over public health policies in all participating countries.”
The WHO defines One Health as “an integrated, unifying approach to balance and optimize the health of people, animals and the environment.”
Public Health Canada says One Health “considers the relationships between the health of humans, animals, and the environment” — suggesting future pandemics or public health threats may cross from animals to humans.
Hulscher suggested bird flu could become the source of the next pandemic — and the basis for imposing global control. He said:
“The biopharmaceutical complex wishes for H5N1 bird flu to become a human pandemic, as it will give them another opportunity to implement draconian control measures and mandate mRNA injections.
“Their obsession with zoonotic diseases may be due to their potential for high mortality rates, which increases the probability of high vaccine uptake and adherence to strict countermeasures like lockdowns.”
Are partner agencies too corrupt to be trusted?
In announcing the Oct. 23 launch of the North American Preparedness for Animal and Human Pandemics Initiative, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) cited the COVID-19pandemic as the impetus for the new initiative.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that there are myriad political, legal, regulatory, policy, preparedness, and response challenges that can be best addressed through a stronger, coordinated regional approach across multiple sectors when facing large-scale events,” the HHS said in a statement.
The HHS identified several “priority issues” for the new initiative, including animal diseases with zoonotic potential, infectious diseases with pandemic potential, epidemiological surveillance, medical and public health countermeasures, border health measures, risk communications and joint exercises and training.
The U.S. agencies involved in the initiative include the HHS, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of State.
The initiative’s One Health approach may also involve “non-government actors,” according to an HHS report outlining the initiative.
Hulscher accused the public health agencies behind the North American initiative of being captured by Big Pharma. He said:
“Pandemic preparedness is only a good thing when the agencies involved lack a nefarious agenda. Investigation into safe and effective treatments is critical in combating pandemics.
“Unfortunately, our public health agencies are compromised by the biopharmaceutical complex and thus seek to prioritize experimental injections over other medical countermeasures, regardless of their safety and efficacy.”
COVID response paved way for vaccine passports
The HHS report also suggests that “border health measures” — including vaccine passports — could be implemented during a future pandemic or public health emergency. The report states:
“The implementation of border health measures at airports, seaports, and land borders such as screening of passengers, vaccination requirements, quarantine, and entry restrictions, etc., should be evidence-based and aimed to slow the introduction or spread of a pathogen in the region.”
Hulscher claimed the initiative would officially enshrine public health measures first introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the necessary constructs have been created to facilitate vaccine passports. They will be able to quickly enact these measures for the ‘next pandemic’ using the same systems,” Hulscher said.
The HHS report also suggests the new initiative should adopt “a more systematic approach” to tackle the “infodemic” — referring to purported “misinformation” and “disinformation” on health-related topics.
The WHO defines the “infodemic” as “too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak.”
According to the WHO, the infodemic “causes confusion and risk-taking behaviours that can harm health” and foster “mistrust in health authorities.”
“This means they will try to ‘prebunk misinformation,’” Hulscher said. “It appears they wish to abolish free speech to ‘protect public health.’”
Hulscher also suggested the North American initiative might become a surrogate for the pandemic treaty if ongoing negotiations fail.
“The WHO is struggling to get member states to agree on their pandemic treaty,” he said. “The North American Preparedness for Animal and Human Pandemics Initiative seems to closely resemble the ‘goals’ of the WHO treaty, thus providing a ‘failsafe’ for North America if negotiations continue to fail.”",0

The study, published Oct. 19 in the journal Scientific Reports, part of the Springer Nature family of journals, examined global cases of GBS between 1967 and 2023. The authors found that of the 19 vaccines examined, 17 vaccines — including COVID-19 and influenza vaccines — were potentially associated with GBS.
The findings also showed that reports of vaccine-related GBS surged following the introduction of the swine flu vaccine in 2009 and the COVID-19 vaccine in 2020.
These results prompted the study’s authors to suggest that healthcare professionals “should consider the possibility that vaccines may be a contributing factor in cases of GBS, particularly in older patients, when there is a history of vaccination within the preceding two weeks in a clinical setting.”
GBS is a rare condition that attacks the peripheral nervous system. It can cause sudden numbness and muscle weakness in much of the body. Roughly 1-2 GBS cases per 100,000 people are reported annually.
GBS can be deadly. According to the Cleveland Clinic, “less than 2% of people die from GBS in the acute phase” of the disease, when symptoms are at their peak. But according to the study, the mortality rate for GBS can reach 17% in countries with “limited resources,” according to research published in The Lancet in 2021.
According to the study’s dataset, 117 deaths were reported among the 15,377 cases of vaccine-associated GBS, with 87 deaths (74.6%) occurring in people 65 and over, and two deaths (1.69%) occurring in children 11 or younger.
The researchers cited the “scarcity of data” connecting GBS to vaccination as one of the rationales for performing the study, alongside efforts to “address vaccine hesitancy.”
Based on data from a World Health Organization (WHO) database, the study found a notable surge in vaccine-associated GBS since the COVID vaccines were rolled out in 2020.
The study’s authors — a team of 14 researchers affiliated with institutions in South Korea, the U.S., Australia, France, Iran and the United Kingdom — identified 15,377 cases of vaccine-associated GBS between 1978 and 2023, among the 22,616 reports of all drug-related reports of GBS during that period.
However, the researchers said studies have “consistently shown a higher risk of GBS” from COVID-19 and flu infections compared to vaccination. They said research indicates a four- to seven-times increase in GBS following influenza infection.
Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., senior research scientist at Children’s Health Defense (CHD), praised the study’s authors for their “scope and ambition” in examining GBS incidence by vaccine and over time. However, he questioned key aspects of the researchers’ methodology.
“I am surprised that Nature published this article,” Jablonowski said. “The errors in writing, in data presentation and the extremely biased nature of the underlying data, do not make this a great paper, though the ambitious scope of the paper is admirable,” Jablonowski said.
Brian Hooker, Ph.D., chief scientific officer for CHD, questioned the researchers’ conclusion that infection poses a greater risk of GBS compared to vaccination.
“The references in this paper regarding the incidence of GBS following influenza being four to seven times higher than that of vaccines all lead to one review paper by Greg Poland written in 2012.”
Hooker added:
“I have been unsuccessful at getting a copy of the review paper or even an abstract for that paper. But I’m doubtful that a review paper would have original data to support this claim. I’m also very doubtful that Dr. Poland — with myriad conflicts of interest — would be the best person to report on such a difference.”
The study’s authors did not respond to The Defender’s request for comment.
GBS reports surged after COVID, swine flu vaccines were introduced
The study used data from VigiBase, the WHO’s global database of adverse event reports. The data were used to “assess the association” between GBS and the 19 vaccines examined.
Addressing the post-2020 surge in GBS cases following widespread COVID-19 vaccination, the researchers said COVID-19 vaccines “exhibited the lowest association compared to other vaccines.”
Three types of COVID-19 vaccines — mRNA, adenovirus-vectored type 5 (Ad5) and inactivated whole-virus — “showed significant associations with GBS,” as did the varicella-zoster vaccine, according to the study. Influenza vaccines “showed the highest association.”
The researchers concluded that Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccines are “associated with a higher incidence of GBS,” especially when compared to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
None of the COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. were Ad5-vectored. However, the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine, which used a different type of adenovirus vector (Ad26), was linked to an increased incidence of GBS.
The researchers also addressed a similar spike in GBS cases beginning around 2010. They suggested increased surveillance and “enhanced awareness and reporting efforts” following the 2009 influenza pandemic may have contributed to the spike.
Incidence of vaccine-related GBS likely higher than reported
The study’s findings did not indicate sex-specific risks of GBS, but found an increased association observed with advancing age, which the researchers said aligns with “natural epidemiological patterns, a tendency observed across various individual vaccines such as influenza, varicella zoster, COVID-19 mRNA, and ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccines.”
The average time of GBS onset was 5.5 days — with a standard deviation of 41.72 days. According to Jablonowski, the “really high standard deviation” means there are “many data points far away from the average number.”
“When such extreme values occur frequently enough to result in such a large standard deviation, the interesting information is not going to be captured by these summary statistics,” Jablonowski said. “It does beg the question, why is there such a great variability in the time to onset? You would expect high variability when you have few data points, and lower variability when you have more data points.”
Hooker said the study’s “assertion regarding ‘better surveillance’ of GBS starting in 2010 doesn’t really make much sense. Increases in flu shot uptake would primarily cause this, he said, especially given the strong association between flu shots and GBS.
“Also, that was about the same time as the distribution of H1N1 vaccines globally,” Hooker said.
Internist Dr. Meryl Nass told The Defender the “hastily concocted … 2009-10 ‘swine flu’ vaccine had high uptake” and that it was released despite “minimal testing” and that European regulators “covered up the massively increased side effects” from this vaccine.
Jablonowski said, “It is impossible to tell from the data in this publication if the increase in GBS reporting is a change in reporting behavior or a change in disease presentation.”
He said vaccine safety signal surveillance systems also are unlikely to capture the full extent of the incidence of adverse events.
“VigiBase is the end product of passive surveillance and is going to embody the reporting biases of such a system,” Jablonowski said.
Albert Benavides, founder of VAERSAware.com, which tracks adverse event reports filed with VAERS, the U.S. government-run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, told The Defender that passive surveillance systems like VigiBase and VAERS — which rely on voluntary reporting — likely undercount GBS cases.
“GBS is one of those clinical diagnoses I believe get underrepresented simply because reports are filed before a clinical diagnosis is made,” Benavides said. “GBS is similar, where there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of victims that have weakness, numbness and some form of paralysis.”
He added, “Clinical diagnosis of GBS often takes six weeks or longer, which is another reason vaccine reports are less likely to be reported in general.”
Jablonowski said that over the past three decades, 47% of the African population received a yellow fever vaccination, yet only 32 GBS reports — or 0.21% of the VigiBase reports — are registered for the entire continent for the 56 years of surveillance.
“There is clear reporting bias both temporally and geographically,” Jablonowski said.
Jablonowski also questioned the GBS researchers’ methodological approach.
“The calculation that COVID vaccines have a small association with GBS uses a reported odds ratio (ROR). That means the association is relative to the other reports filed for the COVID vaccines,” Jablonowski said.
“If a vaccine’s adverse events were mostly GBS, then the association would be really high,” he added. “If a vaccine’s adverse events included the same rate of GBS but along with a dozen other conditions, the association would be low, even though the incidence rate between the two vaccines is the same.”
As a result, “an mRNA COVID vaccine with a myriad of well-known adverse outcomes — such as myocarditis, pericarditis, dyspnoea, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and hypoxia — is going to have a low ROR for GBS,” even if the actual incidence rate of GBS is high.
According to the researchers, more research is needed “to elucidate the underlying mechanisms linking vaccines and GBS.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/doj-indicts-8-chinese-companies-for-role-in-fentanyl-trade,DoJ Indicts 8 Chinese Companies for Role in Fentanyl Trade,By Raw Egg Nationalist,4 months ago,"Eight Chinese companies have been indicted by the Department of Justice for their role in manufacturing and distributing fentanyl.
“The global fentanyl supply chain, which ends with the deaths of Americans, often starts with chemical companies based in China,” Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a press release.
The defendants “openly advertised their ability to thwart border officials,” used tactics such as mislabeling the contents of shipments, and shipped “a stable supply of precursor chemicals” to clients in the United States and Mexico for years.
One of the companies charged is Wuhan Mingyue Information Technology, based in northern China’s Hubei Province. In January, the company was charged with attempted importation of fentanyl precursors and money laundering, along with a Chinese national named Huanhuang Song, who is alleged to have held a Bitcoin wallet and a Western Union account for payments for the company’s precursor chemicals.
The indictment against Wuhan Mingyue included encrypted conversations between the company and an undercover DEA special agent posing as a broker.
In one conversation, the company said it had “no problems [with] Mexico customs” when it shipped drugs by air to Mexico City.
Mexican cartels buy precursor chemicals from China and then combine them to make fentanyl for distribution in the US.
“In order to break this critical link in the fentanyl supply chain, the Justice Department has aggressively investigated and prosecuted these companies. We will continue to target every organization and individual that fuels the deadly drug trade,” Merrick Garland said.
Derek Maltz, former head of special operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told The Epoch Times that the Chinese Communist Party is using drugs as part of its “unrestricted warfare game” against the US.
Fentanyl kills tens of thousands of people every year in the US. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of fentanyl deaths in 2023 was 74,702, a small decrease from 76,226 in 2022.",0

“[The] FDA’s war on public health is about to end,” he Tweeted.
“This includes its aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can’t be patented by Pharma.

MAGA Daughter Sends Message To Democrat Father Emphasizing Importance Of Making America Healthy Again,By Infowars.com,4 months ago,"Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s running mate Nicole Shanahan posted an epic video to X on Thursday, narrated by her sister-in-law and dedicated to her Kamala Harris-supporting father-in-law.
The touching message from daughter to father explains why a health-conscious person would support a candidate like Donald Trump in the 2024 election.
Shanahan’s sister-in-law, Lily, described growing up in a household where her mother emphasized the importance of a healthy diet.
She went on to point out that three of the grandparents’ four grandchildren now suffer from chronic illness.
One grandkid has dyslexia and ADHD at six-years-old, the middle grandchild is autistic after receiving her childhood vaccinations, and the youngest came within inches of dying at the age of one-and-a-half after he was given the MMR vaccine.
“I think about how before he received the vaccine, he had just started walking. He was wrestling with his sisters, climbing on the couch. He was talking, energetic. His eyes sparkled as he smiled at us. He was our sweet, wild baby boy,” the mother testified.
“And, then he got his MMR vaccine. And then, he started coming home from daycare and he would lay on the floor in the kitchen while we cooked dinner. Then, his daycare teachers told us he stopped interacting. And then he stopped playing with his sisters. He stopped playing on the couch, he stopped walking, he stopped talking, he stopped eating, he stopped making eye contact. He stopped just about everything.”
She went on, “I remember as if I could touch the moment in time his lifeless body resting on my chest as we took him to the pediatrician and then back to the emergency room. I remember how scared he looked. I remember it felt like I was holding my newborn baby, not my rambunctious toddler.”
The mother witnessed her son hooked up to an oxygen tank with IVs in his small hands as he was given a spinal tap and wondered if he’d survive through the night.
“I distinctly remember him looking at me and I could feel him thinking, ‘Mom. What’s happening to my body?'” she described.
Speaking again to her father, the narrator said, “I know you remember it too, dad. I think back on how you raised us, our values and how you taught us to treat our bodies,” before explaining how the same foods Americans ate decades ago are now “filled with chemicals.”
“Dad, I am not a Trumper, but I am a mother. The person you raised me to be. Someone who seeks the truth and endeavors to provide a healthy life for our children,” she added.
Concluding the heartfelt note, the woman told her father, “The truth is, there is only one candidate that has aligned themselves” with stopping the medical and dietary attacks on America’s youth.
“There is only one candidate who is going to give our kids a chance at a healthy existence. Trump is working with Bobby and Nicole to do just that. Make America Healthy Again,” she said.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/evil-taxpayer-funded-dr-withheld-10-million-nih-study-showing-puberty-blockers-had-no-positive-impact-on-trans-kids,‘Evil’ Taxpayer-Funded Dr. Withheld $10 Million NIH Study Showing Puberty Blockers Had No Positive Impact On Trans Kids,By Kelen McBreen,4 months ago,"Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, director of the gender clinic at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, deliberately prevented the release of an NIH study costing taxpayers $10 million because it didn’t fit the narrative her industry needs to continue mutilating America’s children.
Olson-Kennedy recently admitted to The New York Times that she deliberately blocked the publication of  the taxpayer-funded study on the effect puberty blockers have on kids after it showed no evidence the medications improved their mental health.
The Times piece, published on Wednesday, explained “politics” was the reason for the doctor’s decision to hide the study, with the MD saying it would be “weaponized” by critics of blockers.
The multimillion-dollar National Institutes of Health federal study on transgender youth began in 2015 where Olson-Kennedy and her co-workers recruited 95 children to participate over the following two years.
The results of the study contradicted previous assertions by Dr. Olson-Kennedy and other doctors that puberty blockers help the 25% of “trans kids” who were depressed or suicidal before receiving the treatments.
Olson-Kennedy’s team has sat on the study for the past nine years, while claiming they’ll eventually publish it one day.
Earlier this week, a 20-year-old woman named Clementine talked with popular activist Billboard Chris on the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) campus about how Olson-Kennedy put her on puberty blockers at the age of 12 following a 30-minute appointment.
Clementine was put on puberty blockers at age 12, testosterone at 13 and was given a double mastectomy at 14.
The young lady, who is now 20, is detransitioning after realizing she was taken advantage of by doctors as a child.
Sharing an article about the news on X, Billboard Chris wrote, “Johanna Olson-Kennedy buried her own study that shows puberty blockers DON’T help kids.”
He added:
“She’s the doctor who gave puberty blockers to 12-year-old Clementine after one 30-minute appointment, while ignoring the sexual abuse which was the cause of her distress in the first place. She told Clementine’s parents they could have a dead daughter or a live son? She went on to give Clementine testosterone at 13, which caused psychosis, and sent her for a double mastectomy at 14. Johanna Olson-Kennedy is a child abuser. A liar. A criminal. Straight to prison.”
X owner Elon Musk, whose own son was put on puberty blockers, commented, “Olson-Kennedy is evil.”
Musk revealed in July that he was previously “tricked into signing documents” for his son Xavier’s transition after doctors claimed the child might commit suicide if he didn’t sign.
“That was a lie right from the outset,” Musk said of the doctors’ scaring him into consenting to the sterilization of his son. “Incredibly evil… People that have been promoting this should go to prison.”
He added, “And so, I lost my son, essentially. You know, they call it ‘deadnaming’ for a reason. The reason it’s called ‘deadnaming’ is because your son is dead. So my son Xavier is dead. Killed by the woke mind virus.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/washington-post-shines-light-on-what-modern-life-is-like-for-people-with-electromagnetic-sensitivity,Washington Post Shines Light on What Modern Life is Like for People with Electromagnetic Sensitivity,"By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"The Washington Post last week reported on dozens of “electrosensitive” people who moved to a remote West Virginia town with no cell service, drawing mainstream media attention to how wireless radiation can cause some people to experience life-altering health symptoms.
Electrosensitivity — sometimes referred to as electromagnetic sensitivity (EMS), electromagnetic hypersensitivity or microwave syndrome — is a federally recognized condition in which people experience adverse health effects due to electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure.
The Post interviewed residents of Green Bank, West Virginia, some of whom said EMF exposure previously had caused them to experience heart arrhythmia, headaches, eye problems, burning skin, brain fog, memory issues, fatigue and/or other symptoms.
So they moved to Green Bank, an EMF-free town situated in a roughly 13,000-square-mile area spanning Virginia and West Virginia. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1958 created the protected area — dubbed the National Radio Quiet Zone — because the area is home to the Green Bank Telescope.
The telescope, considered “the most accurate, versatile, large dish radio telescope in the world,” is powerful enough to pick up “the super-faint clouds of hydrogen that hang out between the stars and galaxies.” Because cell tower or Wi-Fi signals would drown out the subtle signals picked up by the telescope, the FCC protected the area from radiofrequency (RF) radiation-EMF interference.
Towns like Green Bank aren’t the only remote places where people with electrosensitivity are moving, a woman with electrosensitivity who asked to remain anonymous told The Defender.
She and others with electrosensitivity moved to Snowflake, Arizona, where 20- or 40-acre plots are relatively affordable and large enough to be far from any neighbor’s Wi-Fi signal or city cell tower.
Making the move was “completely devasting,” the woman said. “None of us wanted to leave our jobs, families, churches, synagogues — but we had to.”
She is far from alone in her experience, said Andrew Molnar, who told The Defender that now is the time to encourage mainstream media to report more on electrosensitivity.
Molnar, a lead organizer of an initiative to select just one name for electrosensitivity, wrote to Travis M. Andrews, author of the Post article. Molnar encouraged others with electrosensitivity to do the same.
“Even just a few sentences…would make an impression, and perhaps inspire him [Andrews] to go deeper on the topic,” Molnar said.
‘It is still a cage, even if it has an open sky’
Electrosensitivity isn’t something new, according to Physicians for Safe Technology.
In the 1970s and even earlier, the U.S. military published reports on how military personnel — especially radar workers — experienced negative health effects from exposure to wireless radiation.
Current estimates vary on how many people are electrosensitive.
A 2020 peer-reviewed study reported a “high prevalence of perceived EMF sensitivity in the general population, reaching 1.6% in Finland and 2.7% in Sweden, 3.5% in Austria, 4.6% in Taiwan, 5% in Switzerland and 10.3% in Germany.”
A 2019 analysis of U.K. data concluded that 5%-30% of the general population had mild electrosensitivity.
Those numbers are high enough to warrant calling electrosensitivity a “humanitarian crisis that requires an urgent response,” according to the International Commission on the Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields (ICBE-EMF).
The ICBE-EMF is a “consortium of scientists, doctors and related professionals” who study RF-EMF and make recommendations for RF-EMF exposure guidelines “based on the best peer-reviewed scientific research publications.”
In a July statement on the electrosensitivity crisis, ICBE-EMF emphasized the symptoms can vary from person to person but typically affect multiple body systems — such as cardiovascular and neurological — in a way that limits the person’s ability to live a normal life.
ICBE-EMF said, “The unmitigated, neglected widespread disruption of lives … is inhumane and deeply troubling.”
It isn’t fair that members of society with electrosensitivity are forced to leave their homes to take refuge in remote rural places, W. Scott McCollough — Children’s Health Defense’s (CHD) chief litigator for the organization’s Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) & Wireless cases, told The Defender.
“It is still a cage, even if it has an open sky,” he said.
And sometimes the open sky may get threatened. The woman who moved to Snowflake said she and other residents are now fighting a proposed cell tower. Telecom infrastructure company SBA wants to build the tower and lease it to Verizon.
The woman said she doesn’t expect technological progress to stop but the U.S. government should do a better job of protecting people’s health.
“There really needs to be validation of the research [on electrosensitivity] and a general understanding that this is a public health hazard that needs to be looked at,” she said. The government’s job is to protect people more than caring for corporations “who want to make more money,” she added.
Groups urge FCC to accommodate the electrosensitive
Many people and organizations are mobilizing for change so electrosensitive people needn’t relocate to function physically.
Since 2022, CHD and a coalition of more than 80 nonprofits have repeatedly responded to the FCC’s request for comments on how to “prevent and eliminate digital discrimination.”
For instance, the “Reply Comments of Advocates for the EMS Disabled” submitted in June 2022 summarized more than 330 comments calling for acceptance and inclusion of people for whom EMS is a disability.
The comments also said:
Fariha Husain, manager of CHD’s EMR & Wireless program, told The Defender that CHD continues to create action alerts and educational flyers focused on raising awareness of electrosensitivity and advocating for systemic change.
“We want to be sure the FCC and policymakers understand the importance of safe, inclusive access to broadband for everyone, especially those vulnerable to RF radiation,” Husain added.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/tracking-health-or-tracking-you-the-uks-expanding-health-surveillance,Tracking Health or Tracking You? The UK’s Expanding Health Surveillance,By Didi Rankovic | Reclaim The Net,4 months ago,"The authorities – and legacy media – in the UK are trying to deploy, and are promoting a number of initiatives that have an even more expansive forms of mass surveillance as one of their common denominators.
Health Secretary Wes Streeting has declared that the National Health Service (NHS) will have to be “turned on its head” in order to be “saved” – and the Labour government has prepared a 10-year-plan to get this done.
Developing a digital health ID, referred to as a “single patient record” on the NHS app containing “all information” is one of the changes that will be proposed during the upcoming “national conversation.”
Another the current authorities aim for is not to build more hospitals, equip them better, train and employ more staff – as one might expect – but to get as many people to monitor their own health at home, by giving them devices tracking some health parameters, like blood pressure and glucose.
The plan is to make even recovering cancer patients track that recovery themselves. And to achieve it, millions of people will get smart watches and other wearable tech.
“Moving more care from hospitals to the community,” is how those behind the plan describe it.
Other than announcing that the NHS is “broken,” “in a critical condition,” etc., and therefore in need of being “saved,” Streeting distinguished himself recently by pushing for things like giving obese unemployed persons weight loss drugs “to help them get back to work.”
But Streeting’s not the only one apparently alarmed by the state of the NHS – or the only one trying to use the service’s infrastructure and reach to achieve other goals.
The Observer Economics Editor Phillip Inman has penned a piece calling for mass government surveillance, where the NHS is a potential “testbed for a national ID card.”
Other ideas Inman supports concerning highly invasive monitoring methods include taxing zero-emission vehicles via “satellite surveillance.”
Inman advises Streeting to make sure “everyone” has the NHS app on their phone.
“If UK households offer their information to the NHS in the way they do to Google et al, health service provision could be cheaper and more effective,” writes the Observer editor.
The cynical implication that people “offer” their data to Big Tech – while in reality most are genuinely unaware of the extent of Big Tech’s data harvesting – aside, but Inman has more thoughts about the usefulness of the NHS.
“The health service could be a testbed for a national ID card that allows for the digitization of more areas of government, reducing costs and tackling fraud,” he writes.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/new-report-adds-to-evidence-that-cellphone-radiation-may-cause-brain-cancer,New Report Adds to Evidence That Cellphone Radiation May Cause Brain Cancer,"By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"Peer-reviewed studies showing a link between brain cancer and cellphone radiation are piling up — contradicting a recent World Health Organization (WHO)-led study that claimed there’s no evidence of a link.
South Korean researchers — who analyzed 24 studies and published their report on Oct. 10 in Environmental Health — found significantly higher risks for malignant brain tumors, meningiomaand glioma on the side of the head where cellphones were held.
They also found heavy, long-term cellphone use was linked to an increased risk of glioma.
The South Korean study brings the number of meta-analyses published since 2016 linking cellphone radiation to an increased risk of brain cancer to seven, wrote Joel Moskowitz, Ph.D., on his website.
Moskowitz — who directs the Center for Family and Community Health at the University of California, Berkeley — has conducted and disseminated research on wireless technology and public health since 2009.
“These seven peer-reviewed meta-analytic studies contradict the conclusion of the recent WHO systematic review,” he said.
“Seven studies is a lot and we anticipate more in the future,” Miriam Eckenfels-Garcia, director of Children’s Health Defense’s (CHD) Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) & Wireless program, told The Defender.
Eckenfels-Garcia said:
“We encourage the WHO to revise its stance, unlikely as this may be. It’s more likely that the WHOand other captured agencies will label non-industry friendly science as misinformation, even if this puts the public further in danger.”
Moskowitz said there’s evidence that the WHO picked industry-biased researchers to conduct its review.
Lennart Hardell, M.D., Ph.D., a leading scientist who found a link between cellphone use and gliomas, agreed. He told The Defender it was “striking” that the South Korean researchers reached a conclusion that directly contradicted the findings by the authors of the WHO study.
Hardell — an oncologist and epidemiologist with the Environment and Cancer Research Foundationwho has authored more than 350 papers, almost 60 of which address wireless radiation — said:
“The WHO study authors should be responsible for their fraudulent behavior violating human health and the environment. Their lack of ethical principles in science gives a ‘green card’ to roll out this technology — and the misinformed layman is the victim.”
Brain tumor rates on the rise in Denmark
The South Korean study was published on the heels of new health data from Denmark showing that central nervous system tumors — including brain tumors — are on the rise.
Denmark is known for its high-quality tracking of cancer cases. So it’s concerning when their data show a clear increase, Mona Nilsson, co-founder and director of the Swedish Radiation Protection Foundation, told The Defender.
The Danish Cancer Registry on Sept. 30 published a report on the number of new cancer cases in Denmark, Nilsson said. It shows that central nervous system tumors have been increasing among both men and women.
Nilsson compared Danish central nervous system cancer diagnosis rates since 1995. “The data show that tumors of the central nervous system, including brain tumors, are increasing and are among the cancers that have increased most rapidly over the past 10 years, between 2014 and 2023.”
The Danish statistics contradict the notion that the rate of brain tumors isn’t on the rise, Nilsson said. “That argument has been used to claim that cellphone use is not linked to an increased risk of brain tumors or cancers in general.”
A 2023 study on brain cancer rates worldwide from 1990-2019 found a significant rise in brain cancer among both men and women in nearly all parts of the world. The study authors noted that this increase was largely seen in Western countries.
In the U.S., overall brain and other nervous system cancer rates haven’t increased, according to the National Cancer Institute. However, there are many reasons tumors may go unreported in the U.S. and other countries, according to Moskowitz.
For instance, Hardell in a 2017 peer-reviewed study found indications of underreporting in the Swedish Cancer Register.
Although the incidence of reported glioma diagnoses in U.S. adults has remained steady, Moskowitz noted in a Sept. 25 webinar, there’s been an increase in glioblastoma — “the most common and most serious malignant brain tumor.”
“We have seen increases in brain tumor incidents among children and young adults,” he added. “Clearly, more research is needed to understand these increases in tumor incidents.”
Ellie Marks told The Defender she and her son founded the California Brain Tumor Association after discovering that her husband’s brain tumor was likely caused by long-term heavy cellphone use.
After the tumor diagnosis in 2008, Marks sent her husband’s medical and phone records to wireless radiation experts, including Hardell. “They got back to me and said, ‘Yes, he is the poster boy for the cellphone brain tumor correlation,’” she recalled.
Her husband survived, but it’s not easy living with a brain tumor — and her husband is far from alone, she said. “I know many others who have experienced brain cancer attributed to their cellphone use.”
FDA turned blind eye to research linking wireless radiation and cancer
The uptick in brain cancer cases isn’t surprising, Eckenfels-Garcia said, and U.S. health agencies saw it coming.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claims there’s not enough scientific evidence to link cellphone use to health problems, including brain cancer — but it rejected the findings of a $30 million study it commissioned on the topic.
At the FDA’s request, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) did a multi-year study, concluding there was “clear evidence” that male rats exposed to high levels of wireless radiation like that used in 2G and 3G cellphones developed cancerous heart tumors, and “some evidence” of tumors in the brain and adrenal gland of exposed male rats.
When the NTP in 2018 released its findings, the FDA rejected the study and in February 2020, released an unsigned literature review that criticized the study.
Commenting on the increased incidence of brain tumors, Eckenfels-Garcia said, “So essentially this is an ‘I told you so’ moment. This is exactly what happens when our captured government agencies ignore science, as the FDA did with the NTP study.”
Moskowitz said the FDA should have followed up on the NTP study by conducting a formal risk assessment of wireless radiation, but that never happened. Instead, the U.S. government shut down NTP’s follow-up work on its 2018 study.
In April, CHD filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for documents and communications related to why the U.S. government stopped the work. The NIH has not responded to the request.",0

Speaking in terms of “teams,” Ackman pointed out Trump has a more intelligent running mate than Kamala Harris’ VP pick Tim Walz, as well as X owner Elon Musk and former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on his side.
He noted Musk is working with Trump on increasing government efficiency, and that RFK Jr. is going to help the administration go after the “food-industrial complex” poisoning the American food supply.
Ackman also said he’s excited about Kennedy’s crusade to re-examine the current overload of vaccinations forced onto the country’s children.
“You know, the food-industrial complex, what’s happened to the health of Americans over the last couple of decades, he’s going to focus on that. I think it’s a critically important issue,” he explained. “I think examining the 73-shot regime that we give our kids, it’s worth doing.”",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/bill-gates-to-stand-trial-in-netherlands-in-covid-vaccine-injury-lawsuit,Bill Gates to Stand Trial in Netherlands in Covid Vaccine Injury Lawsuit,"By Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"A Netherlands court last week ruled that Bill Gates can stand trial in the Netherlands, in a case involving seven people injured by COVID-19 vaccines.
According to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, the seven “corona skeptics” sued Gates last year, along with former Dutch prime minister and newly appointed NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and “several members” of the Dutch government’s COVID-19 “Outbreak Management Team.”
Other defendants include Albert Bourla, Ph.D., CEO of Pfizer, and the Dutch state.
“Because Bill Gates’ foundation was involved in combating the corona pandemic, he has also been summoned,” De Telegraaf reported.
According to Dutch independent news outlet Zebra Inspiratie, the plaintiffs allege that Gates, through his representatives, deliberately misled them about the safety of the COVID-19 shots, despite knowing “that these injections were not safe and effective.”
Dutch independent journalist Erica Krikke told The Defender that the seven plaintiffs — whose names are redacted in the lawsuit’s publicly available documents — “are ordinary Dutch people, and they have been jabbed and after the jabs they got sick.”
Krikke said that of the seven original plaintiffs, one has since died, leaving the other six plaintiffs to continue the lawsuit.
The lawsuit was filed in the District Court of Leeuwarden. According to De Telegraaf, “Gates had objected because, according to him, the judges did not have jurisdiction.” Accordingly, the court first “had to rule in the so-called incident procedure,” De Andere Krant reported.
Zebra Inspiratie reported that the hearing in this “incident procedure” took place on Sept. 18 and that Gates’ representatives disputed jurisdiction, but not the claim.
According to De Andere Krant, Gates was represented by the Pels Rijcken law firm, based in The Hague, described as “the largest and the premier litigation law firm in the Netherlands.” Gates did not appear at the Sept. 18 hearing, but attorneys for Gates argued that the court “had no jurisdiction over him because he lives in the United States.”
However, in its Oct. 16 ruling, the Leeuwarden court ruled it does have jurisdiction over Gates. De Andere Krant reported that the court found “sufficient evidence” that the claims against Gates and the other defendants are “connected” and based on the same “complex of facts.”
Other defendants who reside outside of the Netherlands, including Bourla, did not challenge the court’s jurisdiction.
The court ruled Gates must pay attorneys’ fees and additional legal costs totaling 1,406 euros (approximately $1,520). A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 27.
‘Even if … your name is Bill Gates, you still have to go to court’
In remarks shared with De Andere Krant, Arno van Kessel, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, welcomed the ruling. “In its verdict, the court has clearly recorded the basis of our conclusions of claim,” van Kessel said.
Dutch attorney Meike Terhorst told The Defender it is “quite interesting” that the plaintiffs filed the lawsuit in Leeuwarden instead of The Hague, where normally, all cases against the government related to COVID-19 are filed.
“In general, COVID-19 court cases have been very unsuccessful in the Netherlands,” Terhorst said. “There is a slim chance it will be successful.”
She added:
“I think most judges support the COVID-19 vaccination agenda and will find it hard to believe the vaccinations have caused injuries. So, we have a long way to go, regardless of the case.”
Krikke shared a more optimistic outlook, saying that the court sent a message that “even if you are rich and your name is Bill Gates, you still have to go to court.”
New Zealand-based independent journalist Penny Marie, who has closely followed the proceedings in this case, told The Defender she hopes the Oct. 16 ruling “will hopefully set a precedent and help plaintiffs in similar cases around the world regarding jurisdiction,” in cases “where the defendant does not reside in the country of the plaintiff.”
“For parties who make claims against those involved in the implementation of the Great Reset and other international actions, such as the COVID-19 emergency response initiated by the WEF [World Economic Forum] and imposed on all U.N. member nations, I hope that this ruling provides an opportunity for others to follow suit,” Marie added.
Father of vaccine-injured plaintiff made ‘emotional plea’ to the court
At the Sept. 18 hearing, plaintiffs also delivered statements. According to Zebra Inspiratie, “One of the victims, who is very ill, was also given the opportunity to make a plea. She was no longer able to speak and was represented by her father. It was an emotional plea.”
Krikke said the plaintiff’s father told the court that his daughter, who was previously healthy, fell ill after getting the COVID-19 vaccine and could no longer speak, telling the judge that he “would really like to speak to Bill Gates directly” to ask him what happened to his daughter.
“After that, the judge was really quiet,” Krikke said.
The Oct. 18 ruling also addressed the plaintiffs’ claims about Gates’ role in the WEF’s “Great Reset” project.
“The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is also affiliated with the World Economic Forum … an international organization whose statutory objective is to unite ‘leaders from business, governments, academia and society at large into a global community committed to improving the state of the world,’” the ruling states, adding:
“This is a project aimed at the total reorganization of societies in all countries that are members of the United Nations … as described by [WEF founder and executive chairman Klaus Schwab] in his book Covid-19: The Great Reset. …
“Characteristic of this political ideology is that this forced and planned change is presented as justified by pretending that the world is suffering from major crises that can only be solved by centralized, hard global intervention. One of these pretended major crises concerns the Covid-19 pandemic.”
The ruling also states, “The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is affiliated with ‘Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance‘ … an international partnership in the field of vaccinations between various public and private entities.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/new-report-shows-people-are-seeking-euthanasia-because-theyre-isolated-afraid-of-being-homeless,"New Report Shows People are Seeking Euthanasia Because They’re ‘Isolated,’ Afraid of Being Homeless",By Susan Ciancio | Lifesite,4 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Those of us who value the life of all human beings understand the dangers of assisted suicide, or “medical assistance in dying,” as it is euphemistically called in Canada. But now, others have begun to see the horrors of Canada’s laws. A recent article in the Frederick News-Post begins, “An expert committee reviewing euthanasia deaths in Canada’s most populous province has identified several cases where patients asked to be killed in part for social reasons such as isolation and fears of homelessness.”
The article examines reports issued by Ontario’s chief coroner, who reviewed the euthanasia deaths of those who did not have an allegedly terminal illness. It explains that “Canada’s legal criteria require a [purported] medical reason for euthanasia—a fatal diagnosis or unmanageable pain—but the committee’s reports show cases where people were euthanized based on other factors including an ‘unmet social need.’”
A doctor on this expert committee said she feels vindicated that people are seeing the horrors of what Canada’s laws are doing to people. She stated, “We’ve been gaslit for so many years when we raised fears about people getting MAiD because they were poor, disabled or socially isolated.”
Two such cases were discussed in the article. One was a man in his 40s who suffered with a bowel disease and who had a history of both mental illness and substance abuse. The report described him as “socially vulnerable and isolated.”
The second was a woman in her 50s who was “suffering from multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome” and who had a history of PTSD and mental illness. The report states that “she was socially isolated and asked to die largely because she could not get proper housing.”
This report emphasizes what those of us in the pro-life field have been saying for years. Euthanasia is a slippery slope. For example, when a country or a state allows a sick or dying person to end his life prematurely, we open the door for ambiguity of the word “sick.”
Indeed, what is most disturbing about the findings of this report is that the Ontario coroner found that the “people asking to be killed were more likely to require disability support and be socially isolated.”
What does that say about us as a society when people would rather die because they feel they have no one to help take care of them?
Our society puts more emphasis on what a person can do than on who a person is. Human beings have become like commodities that we discard when they are no longer useful.
Caring for others should not be something we are forced to do. It should be something we lovingly do. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. In fact, it can be incredibly difficult to care for someone who is sick or dying. That’s why it should never be something done alone. It takes a team of caregivers – from family, to friends, to sometimes paid staff in facilities or those who make house calls.
For years, I have seen this loving care firsthand with my uncle, whose wife passed away last week after battling dementia. He cared for her at home until he was physically unable to do so. The disease made her combative, and for his health and her safety, he moved her into a care facility.
But unlike some facilities that have staff who leave residents alone in their rooms or in chairs in large common rooms, those at this facility cared for her. My uncle visited her daily, and he always had glowing remarks about how kindly the staff treated her.
My uncle is a model of self-giving love that is increasingly uncommon in today’s world. He didn’t stop loving his wife when she became ill. He didn’t think she was better off dead. He didn’t find her to be a burden. On the contrary, he continued to love her because of who she was. The disease stole her memory, but it did not steal his love for her.
This is the epitome of loving care. This is what it means to be Christ’s hands on earth and to see people with His eyes.
Suffering is never easy, but walking with someone in their suffering is what we are called to do. My uncle did that beautifully, and he is a model to other struggling caregivers.
If everyone who was sick or suffering had people to lovingly care for and protect them, I daresay that the desire for assisted suicide would greatly diminish. After all, who would want to hasten death when they feel loved and cherished?",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-mcdonalds-stunt-sparks-calls-for-fast-food-giant-to-bring-back-beef-tallow-frying-oil,Update: Trump McDonald’s Stunt Sparks Calls for Fast Food Giant to Bring Back Beef Tallow Frying Oil,By Adan Salazar,4 months ago,"Update (Oct. 21, 5:27PM): Former presidential candidate-turned-Trump backer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (mentioned below) released an X post Monday evening expressing his support for eliminating seed oils from McDonald’s fryers.
See a transcript of his post below:
Fast Food is a part of American culture. But that doesn’t mean it has to be unhealthy, and that we can’t make better choices. Did you know that McDonald’s used to use beef tallow to make their fries from 1940 until phasing it out in favor of seed oils in 1990? This switch was made because saturated animal fats were thought to be unhealthy, but we have since discovered that seed oils are one of the driving causes of the obesity epidemic. Interestingly enough, began to drastically rise around the same time fast food restaurants switched from beef tallow to seed oils in their fryers.
People who enjoy a burger with fries on a night out aren’t to blame, and Americans should have every right to eat out at a restaurant without being unknowingly poisoned by heavily subsidized seed oils. It’s time to Make Frying Oil Tallow Again
Original article appears below…
Former POTUS Donald Trump’s brief stint working at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania inspired calls for him to help make the Golden Arches great again by pushing the fast food giant to bring back beef tallow for frying.
After Trump worked the fryer and drive-thru at a McDonald’s in Bucks County on Sunday, many health-conscious, anti-seed oil advocates wondered if his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda would push the restaurant to ditch its canola-blend oil and return to beef tallow, which it once used.
Some social media users used images of Trump’s McDonald’s visit to create fake quotes claiming he’d bring back beef fat frying oil.
“I was talking to RFK Jr, you know he endorsed me, he’s a big Trump guy now. MAHA they call it, Make America Healthy Again. He was telling me these seed oils in the fryers are toxic. We want them OUT! They used to be made in beautiful tallow. We’re going to bring the tallow back folks,” wrote X user @Seedoildsrspctr.
Others, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee (R), supported calls for McD’s to change their oil.
Several memes also depicted Trump-supporting health advocate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., trying to stop Trump from frying in seed oils.
“Seed oils are one of the most unhealthy ingredients that we have in foods,” RFK said during a recent appearance on Fox & Friends. “And seed oils, the reason they’re in the foods is because they’re heavily subsidized. They’re very, very cheap, but they are associated with all kinds of very, very serious illnesses, including body-wide inflammation, which affects all of our health.”
Nutrition enthusiast Vani Hari, AKA The Food Babe, also made a request for Trump to have McDonald’s “just serve the same fries to us in America as they do in the UK and other countries”.
According to Atlas Obscura, McDonald’s originally used a 93% beef tallow blend to fry their french fries, before switching to 100% vegetable oil in 1990.
“After the announcement, McDonald’s stock fell 8.3 percent,” reports Atlas, however the fry evidently lost its signature flavor, and a new oil formulation with “natural beef flavor” was used.
Via Atlas Obscura:
Even worse, the fries lost much of the contrasting soft and crunchy texture that [McDonald’s owner Ray] Kroc loved, and the new fries weren’t exactly healthier. As the public later learned, the trans fats in hydrogenated vegetable oil posed serious health threats, forcing McDonald’s to change the recipe again.
McDonald’s introduced french fry version 3.0, which is cooked in vegetable oil with less trans fat, around 2007.
As of writing, McDonald’s has not addressed calls to return to beef tallow.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/5-year-old-develops-autism-after-being-forced-to-get-18-vaccines-in-1-day,5-Year-Old Develops Autism After Being Forced to Get 18 Vaccines in 1 Day,"By Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"In 2016, David Ihben moved his wife and three children from Chicago to Jamestown, in rural Tennessee, with high hopes for a new and calmer life.
But the dream turned into a nightmare for David and his children in December 2019, when divorce proceedings and a subsequent custody battle resulted in the forced vaccination of the children — and changed the family’s fortunes forever.
Ihben said his ex-wife decided “this wasn’t the life she wanted.” So they were attempting to develop a parenting plan in family court — when Tennessee judge Todd Burnett “pulled up the vaccine issue” after discovering the couple’s children were unvaccinated — and forced the parents to vaccinate their children.
Ihben’s two oldest children — daughter Hannah and son Joseph — were spared significant adverse events following their vaccination.
But his youngest son, Isaac, wasn’t so fortunate. After receiving 18 vaccines in one day, Isaac developed severe regressive autism. Today, he requires around-the-clock care.
The children’s mother soon abandoned the children, leaving Ihben to raise them as a single parent — even though he is still obliged to pay child support.
Ihben shared his story with Children’s Health Defense’s (CHD) Vax-Unvax bus. In a subsequent interview with The Defender, he detailed the challenges he faces in caring for Isaac and the harassment he endured from officials in his community. Ihben shared documentation with The Defender verifying his story.
‘How can a judge force medical care without a doctor’s input?’
Ihben told The Defender his entire family was unvaccinated. “I’ve never had any. My dad was drafted by the Army in 1961, and he didn’t get any either. We’ve never vaccinated,” he said. “Our children had to sign religious exemptions for school.”
During divorce proceedings though, his wife’s attorney used the vaccination issue to drive a wedge between the parents.
“When we went to court, I guess her attorney knew that [Burnett] was a pro-vaccine judge and that’s something that they could get me on,” Ihben said.
According to Ihben, Burnett told the couple that it was his “personal opinion that not vaccinating your children is child abuse.” He then told the couple that whichever parent would be willing to vaccinate the children that same day would leave the courthouse with custody.
“I said, ‘Your Honor, we have rights. It’s between the mom and their father,’” Ihben recalled. “Her attorney whispered to her, and she goes, ‘I’ll take them down and vaccinate them today.’”
“I was so surprised, because me and my ex-wife didn’t agree on much, but we did agree on that,” Ihben said, referring to their views on vaccination.
After the hearing, Ihben and his wife were granted joint custody of the children, with their mother as their primary guardian. Later that day, the children received their childhood vaccines — and Isaac immediately became sick.
“My daughter had previous allergies … so the doctor refused to give her all in one day. They split those … She didn’t have any side effects from what I can see,” Ihben said. “[Joseph] was in the ICU for a couple of days but seems to be okay. But [Isaac] spent 12 days in the ICU, eight days with a 106-degree fever.”
Isaac, who was 5 years old at the time, was “just a normal happy kid,” Ihben said.
Today, Isaac has severe regressive autism. Ihben told The Defender:
“He doesn’t talk. He wears a diaper. He eats out of a baby bottle 20-30 times a day, he has speech therapy and will require 24-hour care and supervision for the rest of his life.
“I haven’t had a full night’s sleep in four years. He has to be changed every two hours, or he will have an accident. If you have a child with regressive autism or know someone, you will understand what our days are like.”
Ihben didn’t learn about Isaac’s injuries right away, because the court initially slapped him with a six-month restraining order. When the six months were up, he finally made plans to pick up his children for “two-hour supervised visitation” at a local McDonald’s.
“My youngest comes walking out and I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’” He said his oldest children then told him about what happened to Isaac. “My children told me everything that’s going on. Basically, nobody’s given me information. I had to go off what 10- and 11-year-olds were telling me,” Ihben said.
Ihben tried to find out what happened to Isaac — but encountered more obstacles at Cookeville Regional Medical Center, his local hospital. “The judge had sealed the hospital records. I still cannot get them,” he said.
It wasn’t until he enrolled his daughter in high school that, while obtaining her records from the local health department, he had a chance to view Isaac’s records. That’s when he saw that Isaac had received 18 vaccines in one day.
“How can a judge force medical care without a doctor’s input?” Ihben asked. “I don’t think judges should be dictating medical treatment from the bench.”
According to Ihben, doctors at Vanderbilt University in Nashville said Isaac’s injuries “are a direct result from forced vaccination,” with one doctor telling Ihben that “she’s seen only one other kid that acts like Isaac does.”
Required to continue paying child support, despite mother’s disappearance
Soon after seeing his children for the first time after the custody battle, another surprise was in store for Ihben and his family: Ihben’s ex-wife called to say she and the children had been evicted.
After he kept the children for a week, their mother “got a free house, everything furnished and paid,” and the children were returned to her.
“Then she got evicted from there” in May 2020, Ihben said. He again picked up the children — but that was the last they saw of their mother. According to Ihben, after her second eviction, she left town without a trace.
“We haven’t heard from her or seen her,” Ihben said. “It’ll be five years in May.”
Ihben still pays child support to the state, even though he alone takes care of the children. He said the child support money, which remains uncollected, goes to a state fund — and, if it remains unclaimed, will be confiscated by the state when the children reach adulthood.
Ihben said that though he has gone to court to request full custody of his children or a reduction of his child support payments, he has faced a catch-22 situation.
“The judge said, I can’t do anything unless you get her here in front of me,” Ihben said. “I was like, ‘I’ve served her. Nobody knows where she is.’”
Ihben said he believes the children’s mother didn’t realize Isaac was going to be hurt so badly, and “she just can’t face it.” He added, “I just don’t understand, if she’s been gone almost five years, why she still has full custody, why I still have to pay child support.”
Tennessee laws, local officials pose challenges for raising Isaac
Ihben described the day-to-day realities of caring for Isaac, who will turn 11 next month and just started the fifth grade in a special education program. He said:
“Our lives have changed forever. I can’t have a regular job. I pick up stuff here and there … I have an alarm that goes off every two hours to change Isaac. He eats in the middle of the night … We live out in the country. There’s no bus, so I take him to school back and forth.
“He doesn’t talk, so you don’t know if he’s sick, if he’s upset, if he’s hungry, if he’s cold, if he has a stomach ache … I’ve got a mental list, and I just check it off and hopefully I hit the one that calms him and provides what he needs.”
State rules also pose obstacles. “You’re not allowed to have home healthcare for a disabled child unless you have no other children in the home under 18,” Ihben said.
Ihben noted that Tennessee ranks among the states with the lowest level of funding for autistic children, adding that autistic children are frequently mistreated.
“Our local school district has restraint chairs for autistic children. They are allowed to put Isaac in a chair, to pepper spray him, to tase him. Police departments have no training for dealing with autistic children,” Ihben said.
Ihben said state, county and town officials have attempted to intimidate him and his family.
According to Ihben, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) showed up at his home on Dec. 5, 2023. “Somebody starts beating on the door … there’s a truck at the end of the road, a truck at the end of the other road and two trucks in the driveway. They had assault weapons.”
Ihben said the officers claimed that a social worker wanted to speak with him, but that he refused to open his door for them. He submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the state to find out why his home was raided, but was told there are “no records of anything.”
The TBI raid took a toll on him. “I had a heart attack that night,” he said. “I couldn’t breathe.” He said the incident still affects him today. “I’m sure I have PTSD from it. I’m still under treatment,” Ihben said.
In June 2023, Ihben said he went to his county commission meeting to tell them about what happened to his family. The county commissioner, Jimmy Johnson, left him a voicemail warning him not to hold any rally or protest.
“The commissioner called the sheriff,” Ihben said, but ultimately “they backed off.”
In another incident, Ihben said he was banned from his local Walmart store after a store manager called the police because Isaac “was causing a disturbance.” This obliged Ihben to shop at another Walmart, an hour away from his home.
Ihben said it’s also difficult to find a lawyer to represent him and his family. “No attorney is willing to take on the judge.”
Local officials ‘tried to scare us’ into not doing Vax-Unvax bus interview
Ihben credited CHD and its Tennessee Chapter for helping him and his family. “We wouldn’t be here without CHD helping us out,” Ihben said. “The Tennessee Chapter has helped us out a lot.”
Ihben said he recently saw “Vaxxed 3” with members of the state’s CHD chapter. “What we have to live through every day is horrible, but it could be worse,” Ihben said, citing stories in the film of children who died post-vaccination.
According to Ihben, his efforts to promote CHD initiatives in his community, such as the visit of the Vax-Unvax bus earlier this year, have also been met with intimidation.
“We put a little flyer together [for the Vax-Unvax bus] and we started passing it out,” Ihben said. But on Feb. 5, the day of his bus interview, Ihben said his wife’s attorney, also her husband — who is the attorney for the local school board — and Burnett, who mobilized the TBI, “tried to scare us into not doing the bus interview.”
Getting the word out, spreading the message is ‘the only weapon we have’
Isaac has recently shown some improvement, according to Ihben. “He’s doing better slowly … He’s in a lot of therapy. He’s starting to write some numbers and letters on his own. Teachers think he’s reading, but he’s still never said a word.”
Ihben said this has been a learning experience for his oldest children, who will “have to take care of Isaac every day” after his death. “That’s a lifetime commitment.”
Another silver lining, according to Ihben, is that Isaac’s story has become a learning experience for his family and many members of his local community.
“This hasn’t just got me learning. My kids are learning. Hannah and Joseph are learning about their government and their food and their environment. They’re teaching their friends about this.”

Specifically, the Switzerland-based ICRC seems to have gotten involved in a scheme developed to such an end by Germany’s CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, and also Switzerland-based Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL).
The scheme is called the Janus system.
While formally and generally working in any region affected by natural or human-created disasters – helping refugees, casualties, the issue of missing or displaced persons – the ICRC is mandated first and foremost by the 1949 Geneva Convention.
But the times have in the meantime clearly changed quite considerably – and now there’s the initiative to “hoover up” ICRC’s many decades of experience, and repute, into a “new reality.”
Such as creating new tools “aimed at verifying the identities of humanitarian aid recipients.”
And once again, the focus is on developing nations. This time – not entirely unlike the stated rationale behind recent UK’s recent mass surveillance effort under the guise of fighting tax money fraud – the focus is supposedly to make sure that those caught up in humanitarian crises areas do not submit “multiple registrations.”
It’s either to make sure humanitarian aid gets to as many people as possible – or, a handy opportunity to present this problem as one without a solution, other than drastic things like biometric data getting introduced into the mix.
There has now been a disturbingly high number of instances of Western-based and/or majority-funded organizations, formal (like the UN), or informal but powerful ones, “testing abroad” the tech that they know would face serious and strong opposition at home.
And that’s in countries and societies where the dangers to privacy and security are either not well-advocated or are simply voided by the everyday bare necessity to survive.
Biometric data harvesting, retention, usage, and (ab)use fall in this category, and as much as civil rights organizations in developed countries are to be praised for the work they do or attempt to do at home, it should be said that the “backdoor experiments” taking place in poorer countries not getting enough spotlight is something these groups definitely need to work on.",0

When the drugmaker later lowered expectations for the vaccine’s efficacy the stock price dropped precipitously.
A class-action lawsuit accuses Moderna of making “materially false and misleading statements” about the efficacy of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot, leading to significant damages for investors.
The lawsuit, filed Aug. 9 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, covers investors who owned or purchased Moderna stock between Jan. 18, 2023 — the day that Moderna announced that mRNA-1345, its candidate RSV vaccine, met primary efficacy endpoints in Phase 3 clinical trials — and June 25, 2024.
According to the lawsuit, Moderna misled investors by failing to disclose that “mRNA-1345 was less effective than Defendants had led investors to believe” and that “mRNA-1345’s clinical and/or commercial prospects were overstated.”
“As a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times,” the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit names Moderna and its key executives, including its CEO Stéphane Bancel, Chief Financial Officer James M. Mock and President Stephen Hoge, as defendants.
“Defendants acted with reckless disregard for the truth in that they failed or refused to ascertain and disclose such facts as would reveal the materially false and misleading nature of the statements made, although such facts were readily available to Defendants,” the lawsuit states.
Brian Hooker, Ph.D., chief scientific officer for Children’s Health Defense (CHD), told The Defender he is not surprised by allegations of fraud concerning Moderna.
“It is unfortunate that Moderna lied about the efficacy of the vaccine and misled investors,” Hooker said. But Hooker said the “bigger tragedy here is the lack of safety testing for modified mRNA products such as their RSV shot.”
Could similar strategy work for COVID vaccines?
Ray Flores, senior outside counsel for CHD, welcomed the lawsuit. He said that, unlike COVID-19vaccines, RSV vaccines aren’t shielded from liability under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act.
However, this type of shareholder lawsuit may open up new legal avenues to challenge the PREP Act in the future. He told The Defender:
“I believe that alleging securities fraud is a great way to hold COVID-19 vaccine makers accountable, as the PREP Act has so far shielded their intentionally false and misleading statements. Once the fat cats are hit in the pocketbook, things start to happen.
“I am also happy to see that the complaint seeks damages from controlling corporate officers … That will get their attention.”
However, Flores said the Moderna investors’ lawsuit faces significant legal hurdles. He noted that similar lawsuits against Big Pharma manufacturers have failed.
In lawsuits alleging securities fraud, plaintiffs are held to a higher standard of proof, he said. “General allegations never suffice. This has been the problem with these suits in the past.”
Hooker agreed. “These companies lie all the time … there is probably enough wiggle room in the data for Moderna to ‘wiggle’ out of this lawsuit.”
Daniel O’Connor, founder and publisher of TrialSite News, has extensively covered Moderna’s legal and regulatory difficulties. In February, he warned that investors should be wary of the promise surrounding the company’s mRNA products.
O’Connor told The Defender that Moderna is no stranger to legal disputes.
“TrialSite has been chronicling Moderna, and the confluence of scientific, financial, business and legal problems substantially impacting their stock price,” he said. “Lawsuits against the company have ranged from patent infringement allegations, a government patent dispute, consumer transparency and side effects, and stockholder litigation.”
Earlier this week, Moderna’s RSV and COVID-19 vaccines came under additional fire in a pair of lawsuits filed by competing drugmaker GSK. The lawsuits, filed Oct. 15, allege Moderna violated multiple GSK patents related to lipid mRNA vaccine formulation technology, Fierce Pharma reported.
According to a GSK spokesperson, the company “believes these patents provided the foundational technology” used in Moderna’s COVID-19 and RSV vaccines.
A lawsuit Moderna filed in 2022 against Pfizer and BioNTech, making similar patent infringement claims relating to the mRNA technology used in the companies’ COVID-19 shots, is currently paused.
Flores noted that pharmaceutical companies’ trade secrets are unlikely to be revealed as a result of any of these lawsuits.
“Don’t expect any trade secrets to be disclosed since these drug companies invariably move to have the more damning pleadings — particularly discovery — sealed,” Flores said.
‘Market analysts took notice’ of Moderna’s misleading efficacy claims
In its Jan. 17, 2023, announcement, Moderna said the Phase 3 clinical trial of mRNA-1345 in older adults was successful, demonstrating an efficacy rate of 83.7% “against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease … as defined by two or more symptoms.”
According to the lawsuit, Moderna then repeated its claim of 83.7% efficacy for its mRNA-1345 vaccine several times throughout 2023 and through March 2024 — including during quarterly earnings calls with investors, in press releases and other corporate documents.
Based on this claimed efficacy, Moderna submitted a Biologics License Application for mRNA-1345 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2023.
In May 2024, the FDA approved mRNA-1345 for adults 60 and over. However, the lawsuit notes that Moderna’s press release announcing the vaccine’s approval “indicated a vaccine efficacy of only 78.7%, significantly lower than the 83.7% vaccine efficacy that Moderna had previously identified.”
“On this news, Moderna’s stock price fell $8.94 per share, or 5.9%, to close at $142.55 per share on May 31, 2024,” the lawsuit states. “Market analysts took notice of mRNA-1345’s lower-than-expected vaccine efficacy rate.”
The market reaction was contrary to Moderna’s expectations for its new mRNA product. The company hoped its mRNA RSV vaccine would provide it with a second revenue stream, after its first-quarter sales fell 91% compared with same-quarter sales in 2023, due to declining demand for its mRNA COVID-19 shot — the company’s only other FDA-approved drug.
At the time of mRNA-1345’s approval, the company said it hoped to capture part of what it predicted would be a $10 billion market for RSV vaccines.
But a month later, more problems with the RSV shot came to light. According to the lawsuit, on June 26, 2024, in a presentation before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, “Moderna disclosed that after 18 months, mRNA-1345 proved only 49.9% to 50.3% effective against multiple symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease.”
This was “a significantly lower efficacy rate than vaccines produced by Moderna’s competitors,” the lawsuit noted. In 2023, the FDA approved GSK’s Arexvy and Pfizer’s Abrysvo RSV vaccines for adults 60 and over.
“Market analysts once again took notice of mRNA-1345’s reduced efficacy rate,” the lawsuit stated — as did investors. “On this news, Moderna’s stock price fell $15.15 per share, or 11.01%, to close at $122.45 per share on June 26, 2024.”
Albert Benavides, founder of VAERSAware.com, which tracks adverse event reports filed with VAERS— the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System — told The Defender that even the originally claimed efficacy rate for Moderna’s RSV vaccine was problematic.
“Even on Moderna’s best day, with 83.7% supposed efficacy and 100% accuracy — no administration errors — this was going to be a bad bet,” Benavides said.
Although the class action period set by the investors’ lawsuit ends June 25, troubles concerning mRNA-1345 have continued.
Following the June presentation, the CDC narrowed the recommended age group for RSV vaccines to adults 75 and older — a development that reduced the U.S. market size for RSV shots in 2024-25 from $93 million to about $55 million.
And in August, Moderna cut its projected product sales outlook for 2024 from $4 billion to an expected $3-$3.5 billion. BioPharmaDive cited “more conservative expectations” for revenue from Moderna’s RSV shot, lowered demand for Moderna’s COVID-19 shots and “tough competition from other vaccine developers” as factors.
In a more positive development for Moderna and rival Pfizer, research published Oct. 15 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that a third dose of the companies’ COVID-19 boosters provides “significant protection” to seniors 65 and over.
The study notes though that the boosters’ effectiveness wanes after approximately four months.",0

The paper mainly focused on the difference of Covid-related outcomes between genders, however, within its data lie notable revelations. The authors reported preliminary findings on endocrine systems based on a worldwide survey of roughly 8,000-10,000 participants collected between February 2022 and October 2023.
“Nearly 1.49% of respondents reported hospitalization after COVID-19, whereas 5.69% of the respondents reported hospitalization after vaccination in our cohort. SARS-CoV-2-related severe symptoms were reported by ∼9.3% of COVID-19 vaccinated versus 6.7% of unvaccinated individuals (p<0.001),” the journal article said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “Women reported more vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) than men; 30% of men and 19% of women reported no AEs after any vaccination dose. After the first dose, 60% women and 48% of men reported some AEs, whereas after the second dose, 46% of women and 40% of men reported experiencing several AEs.”

“…reproductive AEs in vaccinated individuals without COVID-19 illness were more frequent than in unvaccinated individuals with COVID-19 illness,” the journal article said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Also of interest, women were more heavily affected by the shot’s side effects.
“Sex differences were present in endocrine and autoimmune pre-existing health conditions, including thyroid disease (13%F vs 3%M), osteoporosis (6%F vs 1%M), elevated cholesterol (M>F), and hypertension (M>F). Nearly 5% of women reported pre-existing irregular menstrual cycle irregularities and hormonal changes, whereas only 2% of men reported hormonal irregularities. In unvaccinated individuals, after COVID-19 illness, nearly 6% of women reported experiencing hot flashes, whereas 7.5% reported irregular menstrual cycles,” the journal article said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “In COVID-19 vaccinated individuals without SARS-CoV-2 infection, 94.6% of men and 62.5% of women respondents reported no reproductive changes. Of those reporting reproductive AEs included hormonal changes in 5% of women and 3.5% men, hot flashes in 8.5% women and 1.9% men, heavy periods and/or dysmenorrhea in 16.7% of women, and irregular periods in 17.1% of women.”
Separately, was also recently revealed in a survey that one-in-six Germans were hospitalized for Covid vaccine-related side effects.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/national-poll-shows-59-of-voters-support-federal-ban-of-trans-genital-surgeries-on-children,National Poll Shows 59% of Voters Support Federal Ban of ‘Trans-Genital’ Surgeries on Children,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,4 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Fifty-nine percent of registered voters would support banning the surgical or chemical “transitioning” of minors at the federal level, according to a new national poll conducted by Noble Predictive Insights.
The New York Post reported that the poll, commissioned by The Center Square, found that such a ban would also have the support of 36 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of independents. Younger voters (age 18-34) were the age group with the lowest level of support for a ban, but it still reached a majority at 52 percent.
“(O)n many issues surrounding trans rights and students or youth, the GOP has public opinion on their side,” Noble Predictive Insights’ David Byler said. “There’s a reason that, when you look at GOP ads, they are constantly hammering this and other related issues. And some prominent Democrats are pushing out moderate, rather than left, messages.”
“Republicans know that trans issues are a strong social issue for them – and after getting hit hard on abortion so many times since Dobbs, they want to make sure they’re pushing back and finding social issues that work for them,” Byler continued.
A significant body of evidence shows that “affirming” gender confusion carries serious harms, especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity, and life experience to consider the long-term ramifications of the decisions being pushed on them, or full knowledge about the long-term effects of life-altering, physically transformative, and often-irreversible surgical and chemical procedures.
Studies find that more than 80 percent of children experiencing gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence, and that even full “reassignment” surgery often fails to resolve gender-confused individuals’ heightened tendency to engage in self-harm and suicide – and may even exacerbate it, including by reinforcing their confusion and neglecting the actual root causes of their mental strife.
Many oft-ignored “detransitioners,” individuals who attempted to live under a different “gender identity” before embracing their sex, attest to the physical and mental harm of reinforcing gender confusion, as well as to the bias and negligence of the medical establishment on the subject, many of whom take an activist approach to their profession and begin cases with a predetermined conclusion that “transitioning” is the best solution.
“Gender-affirming” physicians have also been caught on video admitting to more old-fashioned motives for such procedures, as with a 2022 exposé about Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Clinic for Transgender Health, where Dr. Shayne Sebold Taylor said outright that “these surgeries make a lot of money.”
The Democrat presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, is campaigning on continuing the Biden administration’s radical pro-LGBT policies, specifically endorsing the so-called “Equality Act” that would grant “transgender” males access to women’s private spaces, such as bathrooms, changing rooms, and shelters, require employers and schools to use “preferred pronouns,” allow gender-confused males to compete in female sports, and force health care professionals to facilitate “sex changes,” including for children, conservatives have warned.
Her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has pledged to “make it a felony for any medical professional to perform surgery on a minor without parental consent,” along with opposing taxpayer funding for the procedures, though after repeating the promise this week has yet to clarify if he meant that underage transitions would be allowed as long as parents approve, or if he was merely attempting to emphasize Democrats’ support for leaving parents in the dark.",0

Dr. McCullough Calls Vaccinology a ‘Religious Ideology’ Following Vatican Vaccination Coin,By Sean Miller,4 months ago,"On Tuesday Dr. Peter McCullough and author John Leake spoke on the show The Hot Zone about a commemorative silver coin issued by the Vatican depicting a masked boy receiving a vaccination in a manner similar to how one receives the Eucharist.
“Vaccinology is a religious ideology – practice based on faith not on science,” McCullough said in a social media post on Tuesday.
“The Vatican issued a 20 Euro silver coin commemorating the vaccine,” Leake said. “And it has on one side the coat of arms of Pope Francis, on the other there’s a clear Trinity figure, doctor, nurse and young boy receiving the vaccine.”
“And in the numismatic catalog, the description of the commemorative coin is the exact same grammatical structure of the description ‘a young boy prepares to take the vaccine’, you could put that in the same ‘a young boy prepares to receive the Eucharist’, it’s the exact same language and then the clear Trinity iconochaonography,” Leake said. “So it’s like the Church itself is promoting this religious perception of the vaccine.”
Indeed, it appears the vaccine is the holy water of the religion of Scientism, Fauci is the Pontiff (as he is the science), and the mask is the religious garb.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/slovak-government-report-calls-for-ban-of-dangerous-mrna-vaccines,Slovak Government Report Calls for Ban of ‘Dangerous’ mRNA Vaccines,"By Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"An official report by a Slovak government commission investigating the COVID-19 pandemic recommended mRNA vaccines be banned after determining they are “dangerous.”
The commission also called on Slovakia to oppose the World Health Organization’s (WHO) pandemic treaty and recent amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR).
“Unless the vaccination with mRNA products is stopped or at least their efficiency and safety is proven, which today I already know it won’t, and unless we save the Slovak Republic from the centralisation of power under the WHO, my task is senseless,” Kotlár said.
According to Slovak news agency TASR, Kotlár said the report will be released to the public once the country’s government convenes. The report was included on the agenda of today’s cabinet meeting.
Kotlár, an orthopedic surgeon, was named to his position in January. Since then, the commission has been accused of questioning the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines and of being “tainted by anti-vaxxer leadership.”
Mary Holland, CEO of Children’s Health Defense, welcomed the outcome of the Slovak government’s report and the efforts of the country’s government to investigate the pandemic. She told The Defender:
“I commend Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico for doing what every government leader worldwide should do today: call for a serious investigation of everything COVID — the inadequate clinical trials, the medical coercion of experimental products, the lockdowns and the severe injuries and deaths.
“Asking these questions should not be political or politicized — these are questions about how governments fulfilled or failed to fulfill their core obligations to protect citizens’ lives, health and freedom.”
Swiss attorney Philipp Kruse, who has been active in opposing the WHO’s pandemic treaty and IHR amendments, called the report and the commission’s recommendation “good news and an exceptional situation.”
“To my knowledge, Slovakia is the first country in Europe where a government — not the opposition — has dared to investigate the true effects of the ‘countermeasures’ taken during the corona crisis. I am very happy to hear this news and hope it inspires other countries to push forward into the same direction.”
Immunologist and biochemist Jessica Rose, Ph.D., told The Defender she supports a full ban of mRNA products worldwide and called the Slovak government’s report “a good precedent.”
Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi said such a ban on mRNA vaccines “is overdue.”
Just days after the Slovakian commission made its recommendation, the town council of Port Hedland, the second largest city in Western Australia, voted to support a ban on mRNA products and called on the Australian government to implement a ban.
“It seems an overdue process considering all the data in over 3,000 studies that demonstrate the harm caused by these experimental gene therapy injections,” said Christof Plothe, D.O., a member of the World Council for Health’s steering committee, who welcomed the developments in Slovakia and Australia.
“Mod-RNA technology, what it should be called, has exposed three-quarters of humanity to an unacceptable risk,” Plothe said. “Unfortunately, this risk has now materialized into around 20 million deaths and uncounted numbers of cardiological, immunological, neurological and oncogenic ‘side effects.’”
Report calls COVID pandemic ‘an act of bioterrorism’
During his Oct. 2 press conference, Kotlár questioned the COVID-19 pandemic itself, calling it “an act of bioterrorism” with the intent to “jeopardise human health” and “test the naivete of the global population to follow orders subliminally,” TASR reported.
“The most serious consequence of the whole fabricated operation called the COVID-19 pandemic is the endangerment of human health and the confirmation of the naivety of the world population to be subconsciously obedient,” Kotlár said.
“Let us at least make the right gesture together by stopping the administration of mRNA preparations until their effectiveness and safety have been proven,” he said.
Kotlár said there are “simply no relevant data” from Slovakia, suggesting the previous government, in power until 2023, concealed the data, leaving the commission to “illegitimately” obtain it.
According to Deutsche Welle, Kotlár has long been an outspoken opponent of the COVID-19 vaccines and countermeasures, posting videos on social media that “earned him considerable popularity that helped him get into parliament.”
Kotlár’s findings appear to enjoy the full support of Fico. In an address to the nation published Oct. 5 on his Facebook account, Fico said, “You all know that I personally have always been against vaccination with experimental vaccines against COVID.”
Fico, who said he had “many acquaintances” who sustained adverse reactions after getting the COVID-19 shots, also called on Kotlár to find out which Slovaks had benefitted from the “unnecessary purchase of medical supplies and vaccines.”
Fico — the target of an assassination attempt in May, when an assailant shot him in the stomach — is known for his opposition to COVID-19 vaccines and countermeasures.
In an address in January, he said, “The Slovak public simply needs an answer about the vaccination … why people were vaccinated with various experimental vaccines without any tests, why all sorts of drugs were pushed into people … and what actually happened during COVID.”
In a November 2023 speech soon after his government was elected, Fico said Slovakia “will not support strengthening the powers of the WHO at the expense of sovereign states in managing the fight against pandemics.”
In December 2023, Slovakia rejected a set of IHR amendments proposed in 2022.
Kotlár’s report recommends Slovakia refuse to sign the 2023 IHR amendments and the pandemic treaty. According to Deutsche Welle, following the release of the report, Slovakia announced the government would stop cooperating with the WHO on COVID-19.
No other EU member state has launched a COVID inquiry
Some members of Fico’s government, opposition politicians, and some scientists and doctors sharply criticized the commission’s report, which also risks drawing the ire of the European Union (EU), of which Slovakia is a member state.
TVP World reported that Zuzana Dolinková, Slovakia’s health minister, resigned on Oct. 4 — two days after Kotlár’s report was released.
Dolinková officially cited an “insufficient prioritization of health care” as a reason for resigning, but he was also critical of the report, highlighting its “unscientific facts” and questioning why the health ministry “must deal with questions about whether or not there is a pandemic, whether vaccines alter our DNA, or if we are being microchipped.”
Prior to her resignation, Dolinková also questioned the government’s support of Kotlár, claiming his ideas “find no scientific support,” Politico reported.
According to Deutsche Welle, Kotlár’s report generated “outrage among scientists” while doctors are “horrified.” Slovak national broadcaster RTVS cited demands from opposition political parties for Kotlár’s ouster.
“Of course, mainstream narratives in the press and international public health are attempting to spin this proposed inquiry into a political diatribe against the so-called Right,” Holland said. “People are getting sick of this nonsensical brush-off.”
Holland added:
“People want to know why death rates, especially in healthy young people, have risen astronomically. They want to know why children are having heart attacks. They want to know where the turbo cancers came from. A serious COVID inquiry will illuminate these questions. The Slovak people and everyone else deserve these answers.”
Slovakia may nevertheless encounter obstacles from the EU itself if it decides to ban mRNA injections.
According to The Slovak Spectator, “banning mRNA vaccines outright is not feasible, as they are registered with the European Medicines Agency.” The government may, however, choose not to cover the costs of the vaccines.
Dutch attorney Meike Terhorst, who has been active in opposing the pandemic treaty and IHR amendments, told The Defender that, at this time, it’s “hard to tell if the EU could start legal action against Slovakia.” However, Kruse said, “They will certainly try.”
“Those behind the implementation of mRNA on a global scale are extremely powerful and perfectly organized,” Kruse said. “Of course, they will use all means to stop anybody who wants to spoil their big mRNA business.”
According to Plothe, “Slovakia has been criticized for this move from all sides in Europe,” noting that no other EU member state has launched a COVID inquiry.
“Τhe likelihood of governments in the EU following Slovakia is not yet very plausible. But it will depend on the public’s reactions when learning more and more about what has been done to them,” Plothe said.
Australian council calls for ban on Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines
While the Slovakian government is mulling whether to proceed with banning mRNA products, the Port Hedland Council in Western Australia on Oct. 11 passed a motion in a 5-2 vote, calling for the immediate suspension of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines and for the Australian government to ban the products.
The Daily Mail reported that the council of Port Hedland, a mining town approximately 1,000 miles north of Perth, will now “send letters demanding the Covid vaccines be withdrawn to the Prime Minister, federal and state health ministers.”
Councillor Adrian McRae introduced the motion. He told The Daily Mail he hoped writing to all of Australia’s 537 councils would have a domino effect.
The council heard testimony from a range of scientific experts, including molecular virologist and epidemiologist David Speicher, Ph.D., a senior research associate at the University of Guelph in Canada, who presented a report outlining evidence of DNA contamination in the mRNA COVID-19 shots.
The council also heard testimony from Australian Member of Parliament Russell Broadbent, who last month wrote a letter to Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, signed by 26 lawyers, health professionals and academics, calling for the immediate suspension of the mRNA shots due to DNA contamination, and for a full investigation.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/british-government-proposes-mass-weight-loss-jabs-for-the-unemployed,British Government Proposes Mass ‘Weight-Loss Jabs’ for the Unemployed,By Graham Barnfield | The European Conservative,4 months ago,"Prime minister Sir Keir Starmer and his health secretary Wes Streeting argue that medication could play a key role in UK economic growth, by helping obese people return to work.
Announcing a £279 million investment from pharmaceutical giant Lilly, the leading Labour figures looked forward to improving healthcare, including with a five-year mass study—i.e., one much larger than a clinical trial applied in daily life—to see if an effective obesity treatment can be applied across the Greater Manchester region, possibly prior to a national roll-out.
The ‘weight-loss jab’, according to Starmer, is
very important for our NHS, because, yes we need more money for the NHS, but we’ve also got to think differently.
The wonder drug in question is semaglutide, better known under such brand names as Rybelsus, Ozempic (initially used to treat diabetes), and the higher-dose version Wegovy, marketed to encourage weight loss.
Even given the potential of such pharmaceutical breakthroughs, Streeting and Starmer have jumped the gun—if not the shark—in their enthusiasm. Part of a government that complains it inherited a £22m ‘black hole’ from its Tory predecessor, Streeting estimates that obesity-related illnesses cost the state-funded National Health Service £11bn (€13.2bn) a year. Not only would medicating the obese cut the deficit, he seems to think, but it would also boost productivity by readmitting those receiving the treatment to the workforce.
On productivity, Starmer assumes that well-paying jobs are there waiting to open up to the newly medicated and slimmed down. On public health, his sidekick Streeting errs in seeing populations as treatable in the same way that a careful doctor-patient relationship can help the sick, including the obese.
Semaglutide works by suppressing the appetite, thus encouraging cutting calorie consumption. It has already attracted puritanical-sounding criticism because the promise of convenient weight loss without an intensive dietary or exercise regime seemed too ‘easy’ and ‘unnatural’ for some observers. Despite a recent shift to ‘body positive’ ideology, British public opinion remains divided over whether obesity is a health problem or a question of behaviour and (bad) choices.
Since the Blair years, Labour has shown a commitment to ‘reforming’ individual lifestyles—’helping people to make the right choices,’ in the jargon—and importing/incorporating the strategy of behavioural ‘nudge’ into government policy. Objectors who saw this as evidence of the ‘nanny state’ in action are now routinely treated as a problem. For instance, former ‘Conservative’ health minister, Lord Bethell welcomed the policy, declaring
People want help from government—the ‘nanny state’ thing was a distraction.
Insofar as excess weight is inconvenient and potentially damaging to health, Bethell has a point. Yet the vague terms on which this policy is being floated reveal its underlying weakness. The British adults falling within its scope can be characterised as overweight, obese and morbidly obese (now renamed Class III obesity, with a body mass index of 40 or higher, or a BMI of 35-39 coupled with obesity-related health conditions). Setting aside the problems of using BMI as a measurement, it is being in the last of these three categories that is likely to prevent normal employment.
A key weakness with turning the current medical advances into policy is that after two years, the advice is to stop taking semaglutide. Without that pharma-induced feeling of being ‘full,’ an appetite will return—and with it, almost inevitably, weight gain.
Does this mean that employees who regain weight are destined once again for the dole queue? Maybe; more certain is that Labour’s now-traditional emphasis on policing lifestyle and behaviour will find ways to scapegoat them for a policy that is set up to fail.",0

The doctor revealed in an episode titled ‘What is in Our Blood‘ microscopy video of the Covid vaccination’s nanotechnology exhibiting a strange phenomenon – blinking lights.
Clips of Mihalcea’s appearance on the show and the bizarre phenomenon exhibited by the exotic gene therapy injections have now garnered over 100,000 views on X (formerly Twitter) as of the writing of this article. Notably, the clips were only posted to social media on Monday, making the view-count all the more impressive.
“This is what’s called nano and micro-robots communicating with each other via light signal and they are collaborating to self assemble,” the doctor said about the microscopy footage. “And so this is in the realm of self-assembling nanotechnology.”
Mihalcea appeared on the show about 20 minutes into the 53 minute episode.
She used a 4000x microscope equipped with a recording feature to capture the strange things.
Mihalcea said she has also observed the same phenomenon within the blood of humans.
The Covid shots are known to:

https://www.infowars.com/posts/this-isnt-normal,This Isn’t Normal,By Raw Egg Nationalist,4 months ago,"One in 20 American high-school students either is transgender or questions their gender, according to a new survey. This isn’t normal.
Exactly how abnormal isn’t quite clear—cast-iron statistics from the present and the recent past are hard to come by, especially since definitions of transgenderism and gender-dysphoria have changed over time and are still changing—but, even so, I think we can safely say we’re in the ballpark of “seriously bloody abnormal” when one in 20 US teenagers think they were born in the wrong body.
A full 3% actively identify as transgender, and 2% more question their gender, which means they have gender dysphoria, the gateway to transgenderism.
The explosion of transgenderism is precisely that—an explosion. The rate of transgenderism among US adults was estimated to be around 1 in 250 just seven years ago.
In a Dutch study, researchers estimated, using records of individuals seeking gender-reassignment therapy, that the background rate of transgenderism in the Netherlands in the mid 1970s was 5.6 per 100,000 for male to female, and 1.9 per 100,000 for female to male.
Of course, those were individuals actively seeking gender-reassignment, whereas the majority of American kids surveyed by the 2023 Youth Risk Behaviour Survey won’t do that.
A significant proportion of them will, though, and they’ll be encouraged to do so, pretty much every step of the way: by their peers, by their teachers, by their parents if they’re liberal or cuckservative, by TikTok and social media and the White House and the culture at large. Everything will push them towards expression of “who they really are” by means of exogeneous hormones and, ultimately and irreversibly, the surgeon’s scalpel.
In a state like Montana, children may even be removed from their parents’ custody if their parents don’t support their decision to change gender—for not “affirming” their child’s decision, to use language that helps disguise the brutal, unconstitutional use of state power to undermine parental authority and break up families.
The 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey is the first time the annual survey asked teens whether they identify as transgender or are gender-questioning. The survey included 20,103 public and private school students in grades 9 through 12 from all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
The survey also revealed that transgender and teens with gender dysphoria experience significantly elevated levels of mental illness.
Transgender students, in particular, were more likely to report persistent sadness or hopelessness (about 72% compared with 50% normal girls and 26% of normal boys); poor mental health, (65% compared to 38% of normal girls and 18% of normal boys); thoughts of suicide (53% compared with 24% of normal girls and 12% of normal boys); and suicide attempts (26% compared with 11% of normal girls and 5% of normal boys).
Supporters and “sympathetic” voices will say this is an indictment of the way that transgender people are treated by society: that they’re still marginalised and treated harshly, instead of being embraced with loving arms and made to feel welcome. In short, they’ll treat the mental anguish and illness as a symptom of an uncaring society, rather than, potentially, the cause of the phenomenon itself.
But what if the mental illness and anguish are the cause? What if there are other causes too?
There have also been attempts to explain the rise of transgenderism in relation to the growth of mental illness more generally, like this 2014 study, which found that nearly 63 percent of sampled patients requesting gender reassignment had “at least one psychiatric comorbidity.” A third of patients suffered depression, 20.5 percent suffered a specific phobia, and 15.7 percent suffered from adjustment disorder.
There are clearly elements of “social contagion” to the phenomenon as well. A study in the prestigious journal PLoS ONE in 2018 suggested social media and belonging to friendship groups that already had transgender-identifying people in them drastically increased the risk of gender dysphoria in teenagers. A significant number of the teens included within the study had also been diagnosed with at least one mental-health disorder or neurodevelopmental issue, such as autism.
Then there are endocrine disruptors, hormone-disrupting chemicals that are inescapable in the modern world: They’re in the food, the water, the soil, the air, the electronic goods we use and the personal-care products we put on our skin and hair. They’re everywhere. This is the so-called “gay frogs” theory of transgenderism that Alex Jones was so roundly mocked for way back in 2015.
If you know about how endocrine disruptors work, and you know how the human body works, then the claim that endocrine disruptors might be responsible for the massive rise of transgenderism in recent decades, makes perfect sense. It always has done. And that’s before you even start to factor in the many studies of the harmful effects of these chemicals on all manner of creatures, including Tyrone Hayes’s studies of African clawed frogs, which show that the herbicide atrazine causes males to become female at levels commonly found in US waterways.
In the pages of National Geographic and Science magazine, “gay frogs” were a legitimate source of concern for the scientific community and the public at large, but from the mouth of Alex Jones—simply because he’s Alex Jones—it became a dreaded “right-wing conspiracy theory,” and that killed discussion of the problem stone dead for years.
Thankfully, with the arrival of RFK JR. in the 2024 presidential race, endocrine disruptors and their appalling effects on our heath have become a national issue. The effects of these chemicals on our bodies, which range from encouraging obesity and diabetes, to links with heart disease, cancer, autism and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as fertility issues and transgenderism, now cannot be ignored.
We also have new compelling evidence to substantiate the link between transgenderism and harmful chemicals. A study this year was the first to report a direct human link between exposure to a specific chemical and transgenderism. The study, published in the Journal of Xenobiotics, considers the effects of exposure to the chemical diethylstilbestrol (DES) on the rate of transgenderism among French boys. The study’s authors discovered that boys exposed to DES in utero were perhaps as much as 100 times more likely to become male-to-female transgender than the highest reported background rate across Europe. Reliable figures for the number of transgender people as a percentage of the population vary wildly, so the actual increase in risk due to exposure to DES could be even higher.
We should be alarmed by the figures reported in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, and we should take the misery seriously too. The suffering is real, and deserves sympathy. But sympathy for those experiencing profound confusion about their gender should not prevent us from investigating the true causes of why more and more young Americans feel that way. We owe it to our children and to all children to find out what the hell is really going on. And then we need to do something about it.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/new-report-water-fluoridation-has-limited-dental-benefits-in-addition-to-iq-risks,"New Report: Water Fluoridation Has Limited Dental Benefits, In Addition to IQ Risks",By Raw Egg Nationalist,4 months ago,"Fluoridation of drinking water provides limited public health benefits, including for dental health, according to a new wide-ranging report.
The new report, published by the Cochrane Review, says that any benefits for tooth decay are now minimal, because people have a much higher baseline level of dental health than they did 50 years ago.
The reports comes in the aftermath of an historic court ruling in the Northern District of California by Judge Edward Chen, who ruled that fluoride in drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” or reduced IQ in children.
“In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote.
“EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.”
To determine if water fluoridation leads to reduced rates of tooth decay, the researchers behind the new report reviewed over 150 studies comparing communities that do and don’t fluoridate their water.
They found that contemporary evidence shows water fluoridation may lead to only a very small reduction in cavities in children’s baby teeth over time. Fluoride in water reduced tooth decay only by about a quarter of one tooth, but even this conclusion could be reached “low certainty.”
“Adding fluoride to water may slightly increase the number of children who have no tooth decay in either their baby teeth or permanent teeth,” the study authors wrote.
“However, these results also included the possibility of little or no difference in tooth decay.”
The researchers added that studies conducted in 1975 or before showed a larger benefit of water fluoridation on tooth decay: a reduction of roughly one cavity in baby teeth. Those findings no longer apply to populations today, because they have better baseline dental health and are also exposed to other sources of fluoride, such as toothpaste.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/jeffrey-younger-says-he-has-last-shot-to-stop-ex-wife-from-turning-son-into-a-eunuch-in-november,Jeffrey Younger says He Has ‘Last Shot’ to Stop Ex-Wife from Turning Son into a Eunuch in November,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,4 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — A Texas father who has been fighting for years to prevent his ex-wife from “transitioning” their young son sat down for an interview on Thursday, in which he revealed that the end of the month will likely see his last chance to save his child from being surgically castrated.
Since 2018, Jeffrey Younger and Anne Georgulas have been locked in a legal battle over the mother’s attempts to raise their boy James as a “girl” named “Luna,” including surgically and chemically transforming his body to match this imposed “gender identity.” Younger has consistently stressed that his son’s gender confusion has been inflicted on him by Georgulas despite his true wishes. Younger, who has incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees in his effort to protect his son, is raising money for legal, expert witness, and other expenses.
In October 2019, public outcry spurred by conservative media attention on the case helped lead to Judge Kim Cooks ruling that no “transition” could proceed without the consent of both parents; however, she also imposed a gag order on both of them publicly discussing the case. LifeSiteNews interviewed Younger at the time, shortly before the gag order took effect.
However, in August 2020, Judge Mary Brown ruled that Younger had to pay for counseling biased in favor of “transitioning” and that Georgulas would be allowed to send James to school as “Luna.” A year later, Brown gave the mother full (albeit temporary) custody over both James and his twin brother, which did not include the power to chemically or surgically “transition” but did empower her to withhold information from the father about his mental health.
Georgulas went on to move herself and James to radically pro-transgenderism California and, in January 2023, the Texas Supreme Court voted 8-1 to allow them to remain there despite Jeffrey’s objections, claiming not to see any reason the previous court order keeping her from unilaterally “transitioning” their son would not be followed – despite California having by that point enacted a law to make the denial of cross-sex hormones, puberty blockers, and “transition” surgeries a form of “child abuse and abandonment.”
On Thursday, Virginia Republican state Del. Nick Freitas published a lengthy video interview with Jeffrey Younger, who recounted the history of the case in depth and explained the various legal and political factors that brought it to this point.
Calling California a “transgender kidnapping state,” Younger said he will be back in California court on October 28, to take what he calls his “last shot” at protecting James, who is now 12. “If I lose this trial, my son will be castrated in November.”
Things are coming to a head, he explained, because Georgulas “has actually filed to remove the permanent injunction which prevents us from doing these procedures, and she has specifically said that my son is now in Tanner’s Stage 4 puberty, and it’s an emergency, that he must be chemically castrated as an emergency.” Tanner’s Stage 4 puberty is one of the final stages of puberty, after which most of the changes that “gender transitions” are meant to suppress will have taken root.
Younger went on to relay that, according to the medical records he has been able to review, James has since been convinced by his mother and the activist doctors on her side that he is a so-called “trans girl” after all who no longer wants to have male genitals, with doctors at the Kaiser Permanente hospital system having assured them he will still be able to have children because his gametes will be harvested and stored. “The doctors are telling him this, and he completely believes them,” Younger said.
The “Save James” Facebook page noted that Los Angeles Judge Mark Juhas has sealed Younger’s upcoming trial. “No one will be able to enter.”
The page added that “Georgulas has a team of lawyers, at least 5. She has at least 5 expert witnesses. She has not provided any discovery. She has unlimited funding.”
“Jeff has no lawyer. Jeff has no expert witnesses. Jeff provided all information asked of him. Jeff has no remaining funds, and cannot access court documents and filings, while Anne and her team have full access,” it continued. “Once again, Dr. Georgulas asks for prison for Jeff.”
Freitas and Younger also discussed some of the reasons why such things persist even in as Republican a state as Texas, including the dysfunction of the family court system (and conservative legal foundations’ corresponding reluctance to intervene in it, leaving leftist equivalents largely unchallenged) and the influence of socially liberal Republican donors responsible for the protection of like-minded officeholders and “loopholes” in ostensibly-protective laws, such as Texas banning underage “transitions” but allowing parents to take their kids out of state to have it done.
A significant body of evidence shows that “affirming” gender confusion carries serious harms, especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity, and life experience to consider the long-term ramifications of the decisions being pushed on them, or full knowledge about the long-term effects of life-altering, physically transformative, and often irreversible surgical and chemical procedures.
Studies find that more than 80 percent of children suffering gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence and that “transition” procedures, including “reassignment” surgery, fail to resolve gender-confused individuals’ heightened tendency to engage in self-harm and suicide – and even exacerbate it, including by reinforcing their confusion and neglecting the actual root causes of their mental strife.
Many oft-ignored “detransitioners,” individuals who attempted to live under a different “gender identity” before embracing their sex, attest to the physical and mental harm of reinforcing gender confusion, as well as to the bias and negligence of the medical establishment on the subject, many of whom take an activist approach to their profession and begin cases with a predetermined conclusion in favor of “transitioning.”
“Gender-affirming” physicians have also been caught on video admitting to more old-fashioned motives for such procedures, as with an 2022 exposé about Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Clinic for Transgender Health, where Dr. Shayne Sebold Taylor said outright that “these surgeries make a lot of money.”
On his Substack, Jeffrey Younger has taken to publishing letters to his estranged boys on various life subjects. “I cannot visit or call my sons,” he writes. “These letters are breadcrumbs for them. I still love you. I have not forgotten you. I did not abandon you. I am still here for you.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/japan-approves-self-amplifying-mrna-jabs-is-the-us-next,Japan Approves Self-Amplifying mRNA Jabs. Is the US Next?,By Raw Egg Nationalist,4 months ago,"Japan will offer new kind of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine this fall to people aged over 60.
The new vaccine uses self-amplifying mRNA technology, which means it teaches the body how to produce more mRNA. Existing mRNA vaccines cannot do this and contain only a specified dose of mRNA, whereas the new technology could, potentially, create more vaccine-specific mRNA within the body indefinitely.
Japanese regulators approved the ARCT-154 shot in November 2023.
The national vaccination program will offer the new shot to people aged 65 and over, and people aged 60 and over with severe underlying conditions.
Experts who spoke with The Defender said that this new technology is even riskier than existing mRNA technology, with no long-term safety data. A
Karina Acevedo Whitehouse, Ph.D., a professor of microbiology at the Autonomous University of Querétaro in Mexico, said, “There have been no studies on the potential of this technology to transform cells—that is, to render them cancerous or more prone to not repairing damage to DNA—or to lead to a self-inflammatory status, that can harbor all sorts of pathologies.
“There have also been no studies conducted on transgenerational effects—for instance, teratogenicity [birth defects]—of self-amplifying mRNA injections … We simply do not know what the consequences could be.”
“There is now a myriad of studies that show the molecular consequences of synthetic mRNA being in our cells,” Whitehouse added.
“Nothing of what was told to the public regarding the ‘safety’ of these products in terms of biodistribution, degradation, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity and immune exhaustion was backed by any type of study.”
Whitehouse also noted that the “persistence of the synthetic mRNA is much longer than originally thought” and that “published scientific studies that show that it is possible to detect the synthetic mRNA in the blood and other organs for months following vaccination.”
Self-amplifying mRNA shots are already under development for the American market.
In December 2023, the Biden administration announced agreements with three vaccine manufacturers to develop the first three vaccines under Project NextGen.
Project NextGen aims to “[accelerate] and [streamline] the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments through public-private collaborations.”
One of the three companies, Gritstone Bio, is already developing a self-amplifying mRNA platform.
In September 2023, Gritstone Bio received a $433 million contract from HHS “to conduct a mid-stage study of its self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate.”
Gritstone Bio is owned by major investment firms BlackRock, Vanguard and State Stree.
Self-amplifying mRNA technology is also being used to develop vaccines for other diseases, including bird flu and the Marburg virus.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/triathlete-suffering-injuries-from-covid-shot-my-life-as-i-once-knew-it-is-over,Triathlete Suffering Injuries from Covid Shot: ‘My Life as I Once Knew it is Over’,By Emily Mangiaracina | Lifesite,4 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — A triathlete and mother of two in Australia says she will never recover her old life, full of sports and activity, after suffering a severe heart injury following her second COVID shot.
Ingi Doyle, 56, told Daily Mail Australia she had “no health problems whatsoever” before her two COVID shots in 2021. She was even exceptionally fit, training 15 hours a week as a fitness instructor, participating in Ironwoman events, and winning triathlon medals.
“My life was all about sport, being full-on active,” Doyle said. “Fit as a fiddle, I was really strong.”
She says she took the COVID jabs in order to protect her old and sick parents when she visited them in Sweden.
“I wasn’t anti-vaccine, I had no reason to be, but I have never had a flu jab in my life,” she told the Daily Mail. “I was never sick, always healthy.”
While her first shot left her only with a sore arm, her second dose, on July 4, 2021, triggered a series of frightening reactions that led her to the hospital.
The day after her second shot, she woke up with “massive swelling” under her armpit that she says “looked like a small water balloon.” The next two weeks, she felt fatigued but did not know why.
“Then, very, very suddenly, I had a very severe sharp pain in my lower abdomen. This radiated through to my lower back,” Doyle said. When it worsened over the next few hours, her partner, Scott, took her to the hospital.
Tests revealed that Doyle had suffered an aortic dissection, a large tear of the lining inside the heart. She later had a hematoma (pool of clotted blood), a pulmonary embolism (clot that blocked her right lung), an infected skin graft that required major surgery. Doctors also found that she had an enlarged heart.
“I was in pain and I thought I might die here,” she recounted. “I was really scared, I was alonev…vafter five days I broke down, I was a mess.”
The medical complications became even more severe when she suffered organ failure after a 12-hour marathon of cardiac surgery and had to bed through a tube for two weeks.
“I was in and out of consciousness and given heavy drugs that made me hallucinate so bad,” she said. “’I was so scared. I was in pain and again I thought I was going to die.”
Only a few months ago, Doyle had to return to the hospital for a 17-hour surgery after her aortic graft became infected and had to be replaced with a synthetic one.
Doyle told the Daily Mail that she and her partner, Scott Elms, methodically searched for the cause of her injury and ended up concluding that the only plausible cause was the COVID shot.
“Scott wrote a massive list and at the very bottom was, ‘Could it be the vaccines?’ Doyle said. Doctors told them that the “vaccine” could not be the cause because it stays in the arm for three days and then disappears — but Elms was unconvinced.
He reached out to renowned Immunology professor Nikolai Petrovsky from South Australia’s Flinders University, who gave him a “really clear description” of how Doyle’s injury could have been triggered by COVID shot spike proteins in the bloodstream.
“He sent some links of other similar cases he had seen,” said Doyle, adding that no one has proposed an alternative explanation.
“They have looked for everything else, they have looked high and low for anything that could possibly be the cause and found nothing,” she said.
Doyle blames her injuries on the oversight failures of health officials and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).
“Their sole job is to make sure whatever they push onto people and give to us and recommend is ‘safe and effective’ — that’s their job and they failed,” she told the Daily Mail.
“Heart issues are not like a broken arm that can heal in six weeks. We have these things for life and it’s not just the person injured suffering alone.”
She told how she “wakes up every day with pressure in her chest,” and suffers “random” stabbing pains there that extend into her neck and arm. Any of these symptoms put her “on edge,” and she feels like a “walking time bomb,” never knowing when she’ll “blow up again.”
“You can never really get on with things, it’s like your life has been ripped away,” Doyle said. “I’m not who I was and I will never be who I was. My partner sometimes says, ‘You used to be so happy-go-lucky.’ I am still a happy person, a smiley person, but it’s like something has died inside me and I will never get that part back.”
“Sadly, for me, my life as I once knew it is over. I mourn my old self every day, as I know it will never be the same.”
Many studies have linked the mRNA COVID shots to serious heart events, including a recently published study of 949 heart attack patients in a hospital in Spain between March 2020 and March 2023.
An analysis of 99 million people across eight countries published February in Vaccine “observed significantly higher risks of myocarditis following the first, second and third doses” of mRNA-based COVID jabs, as well as signs of increased risk of “pericarditis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis” and other “potential safety signals that require further investigation.”
In the U.S. alone, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has reported37,966 deaths, 218,241 hospitalizations, 21,952 heart attacks, and 28,641 myocarditis and pericarditis cases after COVID shots as of October 4, among other ailments.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers have recognizeda “high verification rate of reports of myocarditis to VAERS after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination,” leading to the conclusion that “under-reporting is more likely” than over-reporting.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/3-of-us-high-school-students-now-identify-as-transgender,3% of US High-School Students Now Identify as Transgender,By Raw Egg Nationalist,4 months ago,"About 3% of US high-school students now identify as transgender, and a further 2% question their gender identity, according to a new survey.
The results of the 2023 Youth Risk Behaviour Survey show that 1 in 20 high-school students do not conform to traditional gender norms.
The survey found that trans and gender-questioning teens face much higher rates of bullying, persistent sadness and suicidal thoughts or behaviors than their peers.
The 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey is the first time the annual survey asked teens whether they identify as transgender or are gender-questioning. The survey included 20,103 public and private school students in grades 9 through 12 from all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

Various causes have been suggested for the stunning rise in rates of gender dysphoria and transgenderism, especially among America’s children and teenagers.
A study in the prestigious journal PLoS ONE in 2018 suggested that novel factors were to blame, especially social media and belonging to friendship groups that already had transgender-identifying people in them.

The study’s authors discovered that boys exposed to DES in utero were perhaps as much as 100 times more likely to become male-to-female transgender than the highest reported background rate across Europe. Reliable figures for the number of transgender people as a percentage of the population vary wildly, so the actual increase in risk due to exposure to DES could be even higher.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/globalists-are-taking-the-mask-off-and-thats-a-bad-sign,Globalists Are Taking The Mask Off And That’s A Bad Sign…,By Brandon Smith | Alt-Market.us,4 months ago,"Remember the last time the globalists took the mask off?  It wasn’t that long ago, but some people might have already forgotten how the western world almost lost all individual freedom under the guise of an over-hyped health emergency.  When globalists are honest about what they truly want, it usually coincides with an engineered calamity.
In the two years since the failure of the covid pandemic narrative I have argued that globalist organizations are trying to regroup under a new plan. The evidence suggests that these people suffered a shocking revelation after their attempt to implement perpetual medical tyranny. They’ve realized they don’t have as much control over the flow of information and public discourse as they originally assumed.
Even with full-spectrum censorship using algorithms to bury contrary data, even with the full force of the government partnering with social media to silence dissent, even with the threat of economic exile for anyone refusing to take a steady series of mRNA jabs, they still failed. The truth about covid’s minimal Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) still spread, along with data proving the uselessness of the mandates and lockdowns.  There was nothing they could do about it.
Their golden ticket to total control was pushing the vaccine passport concept; the alternative media crushed that agenda like a pestilent cockroach. If the passport had been successful we would not be having this conversation now. Everyone would be in fear of having their passport rescinded. Everyone would be afraid to lose their economic access for saying the wrong thing. Everyone would be afraid of being forced into covid camps (which were indeed a real agenda). Or, we would be in the middle of a bloody civil war.
The events of 2020 were meant to initiate the ultimate coup against humanity. The globalists admitted to their plans over and over again. Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum proudly declared covid the catalyst for the “Great Reset” and the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” They asserted that the lockdowns were just the beginning and that the sweeping restriction on our freedoms would be extended to climate change as well.
They thought they had won without firing a shot, but it’s not that easy. Far more people are awake and aware of their motives than they realized, and, at least in America, over 50 million of those people are armed.  The lockdowns are now gone, almost no one took the vax boosters, far fewer people took the vaccine than the CDC claims, and the vax passports were defeated. This victory was made possible due to the efforts of alternative media platforms circumventing Big Tech censorship. It’s that simple.
This is why the next event will probably be far worse in scale and consequence, and the globalists are already attempting to rectify their previous mistake of underestimating citizen journalism. They will try to silence us if they can and they are openly admitting to it in recent conferences and mainstream articles.  The mask is coming off once more and this suggests to me that something very bad is about to happen.
As I noted in 2023 in my article ‘From Covid To Climate Change: Vehicles For Global Authoritarianism’, the globalists seem to have shifted their more tyrannical efforts away from the pandemic and into the climate discourse. If you really want to know what they are up to these days, you have to watch the climate conferences.
At the end of September there was a host of climate change summits including one held by the WEF in New York called the Sustainable Development Impact Meeting.  It was held by the WEF in tandem with the United Nations General Assembly. Not surprisingly, discussion often veered away from climate into “threats to democracy” as well as bitter complaints about the “spread of disinformation.”
John Kerry, former Democratic presidential candidate, former Climate Czar under Joe Biden and a longtime participant in the WEF, said the quiet part out loud at the summit. He argued that the 1st Amendment was a “roadblock” to proper governance and was preventing the elites from controlling public consensus.
His statements are quite blatant.
First of all, consensus is highly overrated and often poisonous. The very basis of science is that it is always up for debate according to the evidence. Once you have forced a “consensus” you have abandoned all due diligence under the scientific method.
This was made obvious during covid, where the “consensus” was exposed as utterly fabricated and most of the claims made by governments and puppet “medical experts” have been proven false. Keep in mind, these were the same people that tried to ban YOU from going to parks and waterboarding at the beach in the name of “flattening the curve.”
I mean, how retarded do you have to be to believe that outdoor activities will lead to viral transmission? That’s not science, that’s hysteria promoted by people claiming to represent science. The same thing goes for the mask mandates, social distancing, the lockdowns, etc. Not one measure they enforced was legitimate.
If we are talking about the concept of man-made climate change, the claim of consensus in science is a lie. The data suggests there is simply no such thing as man-made climate change. There is no evidence of causation between carbon emissions and global warming. No evidence that global warming causes extreme whether. No evidence that our current warming cycle is significant or unique compared to any other warming cycle in history.
In fact, the Washington Post recently and accidentally proved the alternative media’s point on climate change when they tried to map the temperature history of the Earth over 450 million years, only to discover what I have been saying for the longest time – Today’s temps are far lower than they have been through most of the Earth’s history.
But the more important issue here is John Kerry’s assertion that governance requires public information control. Kerry’s fundamental disconnect is his notion that it’s the job of the elites and the government to moderate information for the greater good. No one gave them permission to do this. The government does not exist to create consensus.
The people are in charge, John. As a politician you are just a public servant, nothing more. Your opinions on free speech don’t matter.
Some of the most egregious disinformation is often released to the public by the government and their approved media sources in the name of “saving democracy.” They lie constantly. John Kerry is just angry because now the public has the means to expose him and his cohorts. If a “democracy” requires censorship in order to survive, then it’s not worth saving.
Finally and hypocritically, Kerry suggests that democracy is “too slow” in implementing the changes to society that he views as necessary to create consensus and “unity.” If the 1st Amendment is a “roadblack” to more effective information control and governance, then he and his slimy brethren must intend to remove it. In other words, he believes tyranny would work better because it’s much faster that trying to manipulate the public with propaganda.
He doesn’t explicitly say this, but that’s exactly what he’s inferring.
Besides some of the speeches made by Klaus Schwab at the height of the pandemic, Kerry’s statements might be the most open declaration of globalist authoritarian intent I have ever heard. He’s pulling the mask off and this has me concerned.
His arguments fall in line with a number of articles published in the past couple months from establishment media platforms. The New Yorker just posted an article asking ‘Is It Time To Torch The Constitution?’ The New York Times published a treatise titled ‘The Constitution Is Sacred. Is It Also Dangerous?’ They also wrote an article highlighting the potential positives of despotic governments in countries like Brazil threatening to shut down public access to Elon Musk’s X (Twitter) in order to force the site to censor citizen accounts. These people are on a war path to convince the public that free speech is a threat.
When political elitists and their lackey’s start attacking free speech it’s usually in preparation for a major crisis that they hope to use as a vehicle to eliminate public freedoms. Free speech is the most important liberty because it enables the populace to discern through debate what the truth is and what to do about it.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-vaccines-cause-diabetes-case-report,Covid Vaccines Cause Diabetes — Case Report,By Sean Miller,4 months ago,"A recent case report documented a case of new-onset diabetes mellitus following mRNA Covid vaccine administration. It is not the only time this phenomenon has occurred however.
“Multiple cases of postvaccination immune-related adverse events have been reported. We, hereby, present a patient who presented with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) after COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination,” the case report said in the ‘Background/Objective’ section.
The case report regards a 38-year-old healthy man who received his second Covid shot. He experienced sudden onset of polyuria (productions of large amounts of diluted urine), polydipsia (great thirst, often associated with diabetes) and blurry vision. He was later diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is the bodies inability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin.
Interestingly, this man is not the only one to develop diabetes post-Covid vaccination. 18 other documented cases of Covid-induced diabetes were cited in the case report.
Several pathological theories were given as to how the mRNA gene therapy technology within the Covid shot may have caused such a disorder.
“Hypothesized mechanisms for development of type 1 DM after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination include molecular mimicry, autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants, and possible interaction between the angiotensin-I converting enzyme-2 receptor on beta cells and viral mRNA,” the case report said in the ‘Discussion’ section.
Notably, prior to the Covid vaccine’s rollout other vaccines have been linked to diabetes onset.

The latest Pfizer mRNA Covid injection to be unleashed on the public is called ‘COMIRNATY JN.1 bretovameran’. Its side effects are now being documented in a European drug reaction database.

An anaphylactic reaction is a rapid onset medical emergency characterized by potentially fatal allergic reactions. Strokes (disruption of blood flow in the brain) are also being experienced from the new shot.

According to the European database, the newest Covid booster has resulted in 35 adverse event reports, seven of them serious adverse events, since September 22. This works out to about two adverse events a day.
Not only is the new booster not safe, it’s also not effective. Two reports already document ‘vaccine failure’ – people contracting Covid after being injected.

The report reanalyzed clinical trial data showing that nirsevimab — marketed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca as Beyfortus — reduced RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalizations in both high-risk and healthy infants.
However, babies treated with the drug had a higher mortality rate likely linked to adverse effects — including thrombosis (blood clotting) — from the drug itself, the study found.
“Due to the increased mortality, nirsevimab should not be used in any infants,” the study concluded. “Do not use nirsevimab for universal immunization.”
Shortly after its approval by the European Medicines Association in October 2022, and fast-track approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2023, the U.S., France, Spain and Luxembourg launched universal Beyfortus infant immunization campaigns for the 2023-24 RSV season.
Med Check published its appraisal of the clinical trials shortly after France’s National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) published its first pharmacovigilance data on the drug, compiled during the 2023-24 season.
The ANSM report tracked adverse events related to Beyfortus in France between Sept. 11, 2023, and April 30, 2024. Of 244,495 doses delivered, 198 adverse events were reported to the pharmacovigilance system, of which 153 were considered serious.
The report identified safety signals for stroke, respiratory conditions and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes — when an infant suddenly loses muscle strength and becomes “floppy.” Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes also are associated with the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, or Tdap, vaccine and other vaccines.
There were also three reports of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), although researchers said at least one of them was likely not linked to the drug.
The ANSM said each of the signals would be closely monitored in the future, but that a causal link between Beyfortus and those adverse events had not yet been established. The agency concluded the results confirm that the benefits of using the drug to treat bronchiolitis, an RSV infection, outweigh the risks.
The ANSM continues to recommend all newborn babies receive the Beyfortus shot this RSV season.
RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild cold-like symptoms. However, it can lead to hospitalization for bronchiolitis or pneumonia in about 1%-2% of infants, especially high-risk infants born preterm or who have chronic lung or congenital heart disease.
Approximately 100 infants reportedly die each year in the U.S. from the illness. By age 3 almost all babies have been infected with RSV, which confers partial immunity and makes subsequent episodes less severe.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends one dose of nirsevimab/Beyfortus for infants younger than 8 months entering their first RSV season if their mother didn’t receive the RSV maternal vaccine during pregnancy, or if the mother’s immunization status is unknown.
The CDC also recommends the shot for infants and children ages 8-19 months at higher risk of severe RSV disease. The agency lists nirsevimab on the 2024 Childhood Immunization Schedule.
After Beyfortus was approved, a Freedom of Information Act request by The Defender revealed that at least two infant deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS were linked to the drug.
Nirsevimab showed higher death risk in clinical trials
Nirsevimab and palivizumab, the other monoclonal antibody approved to treat RSV, are both designed to stop infection by binding to the F-protein in cells that the RSV virus would otherwise access to enter and infect a cell.
According to the Med Check study, palivizumab is short-acting — it must be administered monthly — but it has been used for 20 years in high-risk infants. Nirsevimab was designed to be longer-acting and is approved for healthy infants.
The study compared nirsevimab’s effectiveness to that of palivizumab and placebo by reanalyzing data from AstraZeneca and Sanofi’s clinical trials, including the MELODY and the MEDLEY trials.
The trials found reduced hospitalization rates in healthy infants. For example, in one trial with 1,453 infants, the hospitalization rate for RSV-related infection was 0.8% in the nirsevimab group and 4.1% in the placebo group.
There were 12 deaths across the trials in the nirsevimab group and four in the placebo groups, they reported.
In the MELODY trial, which included only healthy babies, no deaths occurred in the placebo group, but five deaths were reported in the nirsevimab group.
The Japanese researchers estimated the cumulative mortality rate in that study for nirsevimab to be 751 deaths per 100,000 person-years, which is “considerably higher than the infant mortality rate in the general population in each country that participated in the clinical trial.”
Additionally, because only healthy infants were included in the trial, the mortality rates should be lower than in the general population, making it highly probable that nirsevimab caused the increased mortality rate, the researchers concluded.
In the MEDLEY trial, which compared nirsevimab with palivizumab in high-risk infants, there was no significant difference in the number of RSV infections needing medical attention in the two groups.
However, four infants in the nirsevimab group died within 151 days of receiving the treatment, while no infants in the palivizumab group died.
In all of the clinical trials analyzed, deaths unrelated to RSV were significantly more common in the nirsevimab group. Three infants died from heart issues and one from an unexpected sudden death. Two infants died from ischemic gastroenteritis, which they said could also be linked to mesenteric thromboembolism, or blood clotting.
One infant died in a traffic accident and one from COVID-19. Two died from unknown causes.
The Japanese researchers concluded that despite nirsevimab’s benefits — longer acting and reducing hospitalizations — for healthy infants it comes with a higher death risk, particularly from thrombosis.
French health data reveal host of adverse events including 3 SIDS deaths
In September 2023, France became one of the first countries to launch a national Beyfortus immunization campaign, offering the shot at no cost and recommending it to all infants before their discharge from the maternity ward.
Uptake was significantly higher than expected, according to the ANSM report, approaching 80%, which led to shortages.
Given the novelty of the drug being administered to newborn infants and the lack of any real-world data on safety or efficacy, ANSM implemented a national pharmacovigilance survey to gather information on all safety concerns that arose during the campaign.
Health officials collected data from the National Pharmacovigilance Database, notable cases reported to the ANSM and any lab-identified cases. They identified nearly 200 adverse events.
The report groups and describes the adverse events by type and provides details about each adverse event case, including whether the event was serious enough or occurred frequently enough to justify a signal.
Three babies died from SIDS:
The French researchers concluded there was doubt about the link between the reported SIDS deaths and Beyfortus, but that the link couldn’t be ruled out. They didn’t identify a signal for SIDS but advised that it should be closely monitored.
Other serious adverse events reported included:
The agency flagged 21 cases as “notable,” including two of the SIDS deaths, the stroke that occurred in a three-day-old infant on the day it received its Beyfortus injection, and two cases of acute dyspnea, which is extreme shortness of breath often caused by cardiac or related issues.
Other notable cases included severe RSV infection, a case of repeated malaise with pallor following injection, a case of suspected staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, and cases of severe injection site pain.
The French researchers concluded that the respiratory conditions, including the episodes of shortness of breath or other oxygen issues and malaise, constitute a signal of moderate strength and severe risk. They interpreted the one case of stroke as a weak signal and severe risk. They also concluded that systemic effects like hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, flu-like illness and digestive issues constituted a signal of moderate strength and low risk.
They also said skin reactions and SIDS should be closely monitored and that the national pharmacovigilance survey should continue.
Despite the nearly 200 detailed cases of adverse events discussed in the report, French media reported the findings were “reassuring.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/nearly-14000-children-have-been-transitioned-since-2019-database-shows-tip-of-the-iceberg,"Nearly 14,000 Children Have Been ‘Transitioned’ Since 2019, Database Shows: ‘Tip of the Iceberg’",By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,4 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) – Do No Harm, a group of physicians that advocates “keeping identity politics out of” medicine, has launched a new database of hospitals that practice “gender transitioning” confused minors, revealing in the process that more than 13,000 children have been subjected to various procedures to reinforce their gender confusion, most of them in just five states.
Do No Harm chairman Dr. Stanley Goldfarb described the data as just “the tip of the iceberg.”
13,994 children underwent “sex change related” procedures from 2019 through 2023, Stop the Harm reported in a press release announcing its searchable Stop the Harm database. 5,747 of those children were subjected to full-on “sex change” surgery, while 8,579 were written prescriptions for cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers – services that added up to well over $119 million for the hospitals.
Fox News further notes that most of those numbers come from just five left-wing states – California, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, and Washington – putting in perspective how many children are impacted by even one state allowing or prohibiting youth “transitions.”
“With the launch of the Stop the Harm Database, Do No Harm is building on our mission to expose the dangers of experimental pediatric gender medicine and bring the practice to an end,” said Do No Harm chairman Dr. Stanley Goldfarb. “This first-of-its-kind project provides patients, families, and policymakers with a resource that reveals the pervasiveness of irreversible sex-change [procedures] for minors in America. While this data represents the tip of the iceberg, this is the first step in holding the medical establishment accountable for participating in, and often times promoting, predatory and unscientific medical interventions for vulnerable children.”
“This new project from Do No Harm proves the lies from the medical establishment and radical politicians who argue that cases like mine are rare,” added Chloe Cole, who has become an outspoken critic of so-called “gender-affirming care” after suffering from it firsthand and now works with Do No Harm as a senior fellow and patient advocate. “The stats in this database represent thousands of kids who are being treated like Guinea pigs for unproven, and sometimes dangerous, medical experiments.”
A significant body of evidence shows that “affirming” gender confusion carries serious harms, especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity, and life experience to consider the long-term ramifications of the decisions being pushed on them, or full knowledge about the long-term effects of life-altering, physically transformative, and often irreversible surgical and chemical procedures.
Studies find that more than 80 percent of children suffering gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence and that “transition” procedures, including “reassignment” surgery, fail to resolve gender-confused individuals’ heightened tendency to engage in self-harm and suicide – and even exacerbate it, including by reinforcing their confusion and neglecting the actual root causes of their mental strife.
Many oft-ignored “detransitioners,” individuals who attempted to live under a different “gender identity” before embracing their sex, attest to the physical and mental harm of reinforcing gender confusion, as well as to the bias and negligence of the medical establishment on the subject, many of whom take an activist approach to their profession and begin cases with a predetermined conclusion in favor of “transitioning.”
“Gender-affirming” physicians have also been caught on video admitting to more old-fashioned motives for such procedures, as with an 2022 exposé about Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Clinic for Transgender Health, where Dr. Shayne Sebold Taylor said outright that “these surgeries make a lot of money.”
The database, available at StopTheHarmDatabase.com, allows users to search their own hospitals to find out whether they are complicit in transitioning minors, as well as look up what limits are in place from state to state.
In December, the U.S. Supreme Court is slated to begin considering a legal dispute over a Tennessee law banning “gender transitions” for minors, which could have far-reaching implications for every state’s ability to protect children from the practices.",0

“We are getting destroyed and it’s very recent,” Dr. Means told Rogan and his audience. “And it’s accelerating.”
As of this writing, about 74 percent of, or one in four, Americans is either overweight or obese – and that figure seems to be rising all the time. Young adults are also developing cancer at a rate of 79 percent higher compared to 10 years ago.
“Twenty-five percent of men under 40 now have erectile dysfunction,” Dr. Means added.
“Fifty percent now of American adults have type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. These were diseases where there was one percent of Americans in 1950 that had type 2 diabetes. Now, it’s 50 percent of Americans have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.”
(Related: The sick and wealthy are so desperate for new organs to replace their own decaying ones that hospitals across the country are now harvesting organs from donors who are still alive.)
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been saying many of the same things while campaigning, both as an independent candidate for president and as a top pick for Donald Trump’s cabinet should the former president win a second term.
Like Kennedy, Dr. Means understands that something is very, very wrong with public health in America today, especially compared to not that long in the past when most people were generally considered to be healthy.
“Alzheimer’s, dementia are going through the roof,” Dr. Means warned. “Young adult dementias have increased, like, three times since 2012. So, early onset dementias.”
Even more disturbing is the risk of developing cancer, which is higher than ever. Today, one out of every two people, or 50 percent of the population, will develop cancer at some point in life, while another one in 36 will develop autism.
“That was one in 150 in the year 2000,” Dr. Means explained about how autism was relatively rare even as recently as the turn of the century.
“In California where I live, [autism rates are] one in 22. One in 22 with a lifetime neurodevelopmental disorder.”
Every year, infertility rates increase by another percentage point, she continued, while 77 percent of young Americans are no longer even eligible to serve in the military because of obesity and / or drug use.
Then there is the autoimmune disease crisis, which is increasing by a whopping 13 percent year over year.
“Heart disease, which is almost totally preventable, is the leading cause of death in the United States, killing around 800,000 people per year,” Dr. Means added. “It’s basically like all of us are a little bit dead while we’re alive.”
As difficult as it might be to acknowledge these sobering statistics, they serve as a pertinent reminder that America as a whole is sick – so sick, in fact, that its future may be on the precipice.
“It’s so bad right now,” tweeted The Vigilant Fox (@VigilantFox). “So many people report getting into the ‘best shape of their lives’ the moment they leave America. That tells you that the American food supply is literally poison.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-shots-trigger-deadly-cytokine-storms-and-anaphylaxis-study,Covid Shots Trigger Deadly Cytokine Storms and Anaphylaxis — Study,By Sean Miller,4 months ago,"A study published October 1 documented the pathology of mRNA Covid vaccine-triggered cytokine storms (an overreaction of the immune system) and anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction to an antigen).
“Acute adverse reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are a major concern, as autopsy reports indicate that deaths most commonly occur on the same day of or one day following vaccination. These acute reactions may be due to cytokine storms triggered by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and anaphylaxis induced by polyethene glycol (PEG), both of which are vital constituents of the mRNA-LNP vaccines,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The pathology of the lethal Covid injections and the mechanisms of harm they inflict were further elaborated on by the researchers.
“Kounis syndrome, in which anaphylaxis triggers acute coronary syndrome (ACS), may also be responsible for these cardiovascular events. Furthermore, COVID-19 mRNA-LNP vaccines encompass adjuvants, such as LNPs, which trigger inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6. These vaccines also produce spike proteins which facilitate the release of inflammatory cytokines. Apart from this, histamine released from mast cells during allergic reactions plays a critical role in IL-6 secretion, which intensifies inflammatory responses. In light of these events, early reduction of IL-1β and IL-6 is imperative for managing post-vaccine cytokine storms, ACS, and myocarditis,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The researchers also provided a flowchart depicting the deadly path from vaccination to cytokine storm.
Interestingly, the researchers even went so far as to state that the upcoming ‘replicon’ saRNA exotic technology injections can also cause this ailment.
“The upcoming self-amplifying COVID-19 mRNA-LNP vaccines also contain LNPs. Given that these vaccines can cause a cytokine storm and allergic reactions post vaccination, it is crucial to consider corticosteroids and measure IL-6 levels for effective management,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The novel saRNA gene therapy injections were elaborated on further as to their mechanisms versus the mRNA exotic technology gene therapies.
“Intriguingly, a self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) vaccine was recently approved in Japan in 2024. An sa-mRNA vaccine functions by encoding both the target antigen—typically the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein—and an enzyme called replicase. The mRNA in the vaccine instructs the cells to produce the initial spike protein. Then, replicase, or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, facilitates a crucial role by enabling the mRNA to replicate multiple times within the transfected cells. This amplification increases spike protein production, allowing a smaller initial dose of mRNA to trigger a robust immune response, reinforcing vaccine efficiency [88]. As the sa-mRNA vaccine uses LNPs, similar precautions are needed due to the risk of cytokine release triggered by LNPs, the spike protein, and mRNA,” the study said in the ‘Discussion’ section.
The researchers also provided information on possible treatments for those afflicted with these side effects.
“Corticosteroids can restrict inflammatory cytokines and mitigate allergic responses, while colchicine, known for its IL-1β-reducing capabilities, could also prove effective. The anti-IL-6 antibody tocilizumab also displays promising treatment of cytokine release syndrome. Aside from its significance for treating anaphylaxis, epinephrine can induce coronary artery spasms and myocardial ischemia in Kounis syndrome, making accurate diagnosis essential,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/mass-murder-pills-what-happens-when-antidepressants-trigger-killer-instincts,Mass Murder Pills: What Happens When Antidepressants Trigger Killer Instincts?,"By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"The issue of antidepressant-induced homicide brings into focus the broader problems with prescription drugs, psychiatrist Dr. David Healy said during an Oct. 5 webinar.
Those problems include the failure of medical professionals to recognize serious side effects of drugs, and the justice system’s tendency to protect pharmaceutical companies — not people.
Healy, one of the United Kingdom’s foremost experts on serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has studied antidepressants for 40 years as a researcher, clinician and consultant for Big Pharma.
In the webinar, he presented cases involving people who were living stable and healthy lives — until they were prescribed antidepressants, after which they became aggressive, delusional and homicidal.
Those impulses subsided once the people stopped taking the drugs. However, in many of the cases Healy highlighted, by the time they stopped taking the drugs, they had already committed homicide.
One well-documented case involved 12-year-old Christopher Pittman. Pittman began exhibiting aggressive behavior — fighting with other children and acting extremely agitated in church — almost immediately after taking Zoloft.
Less than one month after starting the drug, he said he heard a voice tell him to kill his grandparents, with whom he lived. That night, he shot them and burned down their house.
In 2005, Pittman was sentenced to 30 years in prison, after a jury declined to find that Zoloft had caused his homicidal behavior. However, U.S. Circuit Judge Daniel Pieper gave him the most lenient sentence possible.
Healy quoted Pieper’s statement during sentencing:
“It seems to turn the whole medical system on its side if you can’t rely on the medication your doctor prescribes. It potentially forces you into a situation of lifetime commitment if that drug induces an effect of which you are unaware when you go on it. There’s something disconcerting about that … probably of a legal nature, that’s troubling me.”
That same year, just before the verdict, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began requiring SSRIs like Zoloft to carry suicide warnings, The New York Times reported. In Canada, SSRIs also carry an additional warning: a potential increase in hostility, aggression and “harm to others.”
Zoloft’s manufacturer, Pfizer, maintained the drug was safe. However, according to the Times, Pfizer also reported immediately following the verdict that 14 other criminal cases blamed Zoloft for people’s actions.
Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Prozac, confirmed the drug had been blamed in over 75 criminal cases. The drugmaker said it was unaware of any cases in which the defense had succeeded.
That’s precisely the problem, according to Healy. Today, nearly 20 years after Pittman’s case, no jury has acquitted a person who claimed antidepressants caused them to commit a murder.
However, there were a few cases in which courts recognized the link between antidepressants and homicide, Healy said.
In one case, a man killed his wife, children and himself 48 hours after being put on GSK’s SSRI, Paxil. One of the daughter’s husbands sued GSK in Wyoming and won financial damages.
In Australia, the case of a man who killed his wife after he was prescribed Zoloft was heard by a judge — not a jury. The judge dismissed the charges, ruling that Zoloft had caused the man’s behavior.
Healy said that when these defenses — blaming antidepressants for violent behavior — first emerged, Pfizer and GSK developed a strategy to combat them. The Zoloft prosecutor’s manual, which Healy said was later refined and revised, was a playbook for prosecutors to rebut the “Zoloft defense.”
The manual’s rebuttal hinges on the claims that violence is common in the U.S. and that the FDA has found the drug to be safe. It also advises lawyers to emphasize the lack of statistically significant evidence from double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials causally linking Zoloft to aggressive behavior or to akathisia, which are strong subjective feelings of distress or discomfort that could also induce violent behavior.
Pharma knew the dangers but manipulated the data
During the “Mad in America” webinar, Healy outlined a long history of the link between drugs and “automatism” — when drugs produce involuntary actions in people taking them. Those involuntary actions can range from pacing to sleepwalking to homicide.
Swedish neuropharmacologist and Nobel Prize winner Arvid Carlsson, M.D., Ph.D., created the first SSRI, Zelmid, which went on the market in 1982. Carlsson recognized from the outset that the drugs would have positive effects for some people and negative effects for others, Healy said.
When Pfizer started marketing Zoloft in 1992, Carlsson — knowing that SSRIs affect people differently — advised the company to carefully monitor how different people responded to the drug. But that approach ran counter to Pfizer’s ambitious plans to have the drug prescribed widely, replacing addictive drugs like valium, Healy said.
According to Healy, at the time, Pfizer already knew that Zoloft had caused suicidal and homicidal impulses, even in healthy trial volunteers.
The challenge of identifying these serious adverse effects is compounded by the fact that “doctors today have great trouble” monitoring how a drug actually affects each patient, as opposed to how the doctor believes the drug should work.
“They are people of the book increasingly and not able to see and hear what’s happening when you’re on these drugs,” he said.
Healy believes most people mistakenly think SSRIs act on the brain, but that most of their effects occur in the body.
The drugs are meant to produce a “serenic effect,” or anti-aggressive effect, which they often do. The problem is that in some people, they have the opposite effect.
SSRIs reduce sensory input from the body to the brain, which can cause feelings of physical and emotional numbness, Healy said. That’s also why SSRIs are often associated with loss of libido and sexual dysfunction.
The drugs work less by treating an illness and more by changing personality, he said. The emotional muting and feelings of aggression and akathisia are what can make the drugs induce suicide or homicide.
Healy walked through a range of examples, including cases documented in the scientific literature and cases he has seen in his own clinical practice of people who experienced dramatic and violent personality changes — changes that disappeared once they stopped taking the drugs.
He also said that companies like Pfizer and GSK — with the FDA’s full knowledge —  manipulated and buried much of the data indicating drugs like Zoloft were either ineffective for the conditions they were supposed to treat or induced aggressive behaviors toward self or others.
The drugmakers’ altered studies were then published in journals like the New England Journal of Medicine, Healy alleged.
Healy said he believes most people have great faith in these institutions. This makes it difficult for them to accept that the FDA could license a drug that could cause a person to commit murder, or that top journals could publish trial results manufactured by Big Pharma.
“The greatest concentration of ‘fake news’ on this earth centers on the drugs your doctor gives you. Not just the SSRIs, but all of them,” he said.
Healy called for a return to a clinical practice of medicine where doctors and patients engage in dialogue, and together analyze how a drug affects each patient. He also called for a legal system that recognizes when drugs have caused serious problems.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/genetically-modified-crops-a-growing-threat-to-health-and-the-environment,Genetically Modified Crops: A Growing Threat to Health and The Environment,By Olivia Cook | Natural News,4 months ago,"Bioengineered foods and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are commonly confused with each other, but they have different meanings. “Bioengineered” describes food and products that are enhanced with scientific techniques to add particular traits. In contrast, “GMOs” involve changing the genetic makeup of animals, plants or microbes in ways that do not occur naturally using methods like genetic engineering.
Some notable issues related to the consumption of GM foods and products include the following:
Genetic modifications can transfer allergens from one food to another. For instance, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) revealed that soybeans engineered with a Brazil nut gene caused allergic reactions in people who are nut-sensitive. This led to the withdrawal of some products due to this serious risk. Without proper labeling, people with allergies can unknowingly consume these harmful ingredients.
GM food and products might also introduce new allergens. The genetic changes can create novel proteins not previously in the human diet, potentially triggering allergic responses. Despite warnings from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists about this risk, mandatory long-term testing for new allergens is not required, leaving many consumers, especially children, at risk of severe allergic reactions.
GM foods and products could potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance, making it harder to treat infections. According to the Food Standards Agency, most GM foods contain “antibiotic resistance markers,” which help identify successful genetic modifications. However, introducing these markers into the food supply might render essential antibiotics, like ampicillin, ineffective against bacterial infections. This concern led several European countries, including Britain, to ban certain GM crops for fear of the spread of antibiotic resistance. Despite warnings from scientists, the FDA has continued to allow these markers in GM foods even though public health experts view them as a significant threat.
In 1993, the FDA approved the use of genetically engineered recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH) to boost milk production in cows, assuring consumers of its safety. However, Canada and Europe later banned the treatment due to concerns about animal and human health. Research has shown that dairy from rBGH-treated cows has higher levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone linked to breast, colon and prostate cancers. While the FDA overlooked studies showing that IGF-1 can survive digestion and enter the bloodstream – increasing cancer risk – the American Cancer Society states there is no current evidence linking GMOs to cancer and more long-term research is needed.
A study published in The Lancet by Dr. Arpad Pusztai and Stanley W.B. Ewen, funded by the Scottish government, investigated the effects of GM potatoes containing the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) on rats. The research found that rats consuming these potatoes experienced negative impacts on their immune function, metabolism and organ development. Although the biotechnology industry criticized Pusztai’s work, they haven’t provided any studies to disprove his findings. Additionally, 22 leading scientists have supported the validity of animal tests linking GM foods to immuno-suppression.
Genetic engineering can reduce the nutritional value of food. In 1992, FDA scientists warned that altering foods genetically might lead to “undesirable changes in nutrient levels.” They highlighted the risk that these changes could go unnoticed without specific testing. Despite these concerns, the FDA chose not to require mandatory testing for nutritional content in GM foods.
GM foods are unstable by nature. The process of inserting new genes into food is unpredictable, with no way to ensure the added genetic material doesn’t create harmful effects. This randomness means that each gene insertion could potentially turn safe food into something toxic.
FDA scientists were aware of this risk before setting their policy of no mandatory testing. They warned that genetic engineering could increase known toxins, introduce new ones, or cause foods to absorb more environmental toxins, like heavy metals and pesticides. Despite these warnings, the FDA chose to ignore the potential dangers and didn’t require toxicological testing for GM foods, prioritizing industry interests over food safety.
GMOs pose several environmental risks, including:

https://www.infowars.com/posts/walzs-covid-19-legacy,Walz’s Covid-19 Legacy,By Anita Jader | Brownstone Institute,4 months ago,"As a medical professional with over two decades of experience in laboratory science, I observed Governor Tim Walz’s handling of the 2020 Covid-19 crisis in Minnesota with increasing concern. What started as a reasonable two-week pause quickly evolved into a series of questionable policy decisions that contravened scientific reasoning, constitutional rights, and fiscal responsibility.
The reliance on PCR test results was pivotal in Governor Walz’s decision-making process. With my background, I recognized that the high-cycle thresholds used could lead to false positives. Each cycle doubles the genetic material, potentially amplifying insignificant viral loads to misleadingly positive results. This issue could significantly skew the reliability of mass testing, especially among asymptomatic individuals—a strategy Governor Walz heavily depended on.
As the lockdowns dragged on from weeks into months, the haphazard nature of Governor Walz’s “essential” business classifications became glaringly apparent, showcasing blatant biases within his administration. Notably, while churches were compelled to close their doors, liquor stores and casinos were allowed to continue operations. This selective enforcement was not only illogical but a direct infringement on our First Amendment rights, particularly the freedom of religion.
Moreover, while small businesses were mandated to shutter, large retail chains remained open, highlighting a clear disparity in treatment with profound impacts on Minnesota small businesses. In the first year of the pandemic, these small businesses hemorrhaged over 72,000 jobs. Minnesota now finds itself trailing far behind in new business creation, a clear indicator of economic stagnation and leadership failure.
During the same period, Minnesota experienced a sharp increase in excess deaths. According to the Mayo Clinic, there was a 17% rise in “deaths of despair”—including suicides, drug overdoses, and deaths from malnutrition. These deaths disproportionately affected ethnic minorities and were considered preventable.
The policies implemented during this time had negative consequences for all Minnesotans, but they were particularly harmful to the Black community. This outcome stands in stark contrast to the Governor’s stated intentions of protecting citizens, which were used to justify the response to street protests in Minneapolis. These events and their consequences suggest a significant failure in leadership.
Perhaps the most detrimental policies were those concerning education. Governor Walz’s decision to shutter schools and mandate online learning disregarded the developmental needs of children. Personally, as a grandmother, I saw this firsthand. Fortunately, my kindergarten-aged grandson could attend a private Christian school that balanced safety with practicality, unlike most public school children under Walz’s policies. These closures ignored evidence that children were at minimal risk from Covid-19. Walz, a former teacher, faced embarrassment when Minnesota’s fourth graders’ reading scores fell below the national average in 2022, signaling the lasting impact of his policies.
Simultaneously, the Department of Education under Walz overlooked rampant fraud in federal Covid-19 nutrition aid. By September 2022, 48 Minnesotans from Feeding Our Future were charged in what US Attorney General Merrick Garland described as the nation’s largest pandemic-related fraud, involving $250 million. Governor Walz knew of these irregularities by November 2020 but continued reimbursements, claiming judicial mandate, though court records show otherwise.
A June 2024 audit criticized the Department of Education’s oversight, leading to Walz receiving a congressional subpoena for related communications. While 26 individuals from Feeding Our Future have been convicted, no state officials have been charged, highlighting another administrative failure.
In the 2024 legislative session, under the complete control of Democrats, Minnesota’s staggering $17.5 billion surplus was entirely depleted, coupled with an additional $10 billion in new taxes levied on its citizens. This financial strategy propelled a colossal 40% growth in government, placing an immense burden on the state’s small businesses which constitute 99% of Minnesota businesses, under the highest corporate tax rate in the U.S., at 9.8%.
Amidst these events, the local media has consistently overlooked the failings of Governor Walz, even as tens of thousands of residents choose to leave the state annually.
Governor Walz’s tenure during this crisis has been a stark lesson in governance overreach, lack of accountability, and fiscal irresponsibility. It has urged many Minnesotans to reassess their understanding of civic rights and the role of government, which is especially pertinent given the upcoming election. This legacy should serve as a cautionary tale for all.
As we move forward, it’s crucial that we remain vigilant. We must question narratives, scrutinize data, and hold elected officials like Governor Walz accountable. The pandemic revealed how fragile our liberties can be when fear takes hold and when leaders overstep their constitutional bounds by imposing emergency orders. Let this be a lesson: knowledge of our constitutional rights isn’t just academic—it’s our best defense against future encroachments on our freedoms.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-vaccines-cause-turbo-leukemia-case-study,Covid Vaccines Cause ‘Turbo-Leukemia’ — Case Study,By Sean Miller,4 months ago,"A preprint case study documented how the second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccination quickly induced Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes – a blood-based cancer) in a healthy, young, athletic woman.
Only 4 months had passed from the ill-fated second injection to the diagnosis of cancer.
“In this report we describe the case of a healthy, young, athletic woman who developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech modified mRNA (modRNA) COVID-19 genetic vaccine (marketed as Comirnaty®),” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Interestingly, the woman lucked out with the first dose, only succumbing to its effects in the second round.
“The first dose of the genetic vaccine did not appear to illicit any noticeable side effects, but within 24 hours of the second dose the patient suffered widespread and intensifying bone pain, fever, vomiting, and general malaise,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Notably, the researchers pointed out the exotic genetic mutation technology platform used in the injections.
“The massive and indiscriminate use of genetic vaccines to fight COVID-19 is raising serious concerns about their safety and about the technology platform as a whole for this purpose. Growing evidence is accumulating regarding the biodistribution and persistence of the modRNA which can reach, thanks to the lipid nanoparticles, a multitude of tissues and organs of the body, including the bone marrow and other blood-forming organs and tissues,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The authors brought the discussion back to how this technology can lead to the specific pathology of leukemia.
“…there is evidence that the modRNA vaccines display a particular tropism for the bone marrow, influencing the immune system at multiple levels and being able to trigger not only autoimmune-based pathologies, but also neoplastic mechanisms,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.

It compared non-vaccinated mothers (Group A) to vaccinated mothers (Group B).
“…women in Group B had a significantly higher rate of abortions, oligohydramnios (24.4%), abnormal placentas (size and location), 103 (42.7%) abnormal fetal growth, 122 (53.7%) problems breastfeeding, blood pressure problems, and more cases of malaise, headaches, chest pain, breathing problems, and sleep problems than women in Group A,” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
The researchers compared the health outcomes of 438 vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant women who had given birth within the past eight weeks. Data for the research was collected via face-to-face interviews with nurses at 13 randomly selected primary care facilities using a questionnaire. There was no significant differences in demographics between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups.
Despite the serious consequences to the mothers and babies, the researcher’s conclusion focused on the fact that the vaccinated mothers, after multiple lethal injection doses, had lower rates of the Covid cold virus. They pointed to many of the side effects getting ‘treated’ with drugs, as being a ‘good’ thing.
“The COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces post-vaccination COVID-19. Although COVID-19 vaccine-related AES are prevalent, analgesics and antipyretics effectively treat most of them,” the study said in the ‘Conclusion’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/shocking-heavy-metals-nearly-50-pesticides-detected-in-school-lunches,"‘Shocking’: Heavy Metals, Nearly 50 Pesticides Detected in School Lunches","By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",4 months ago,"Food items served to school kids in Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., contained heavy metals, including lead, and roughly 50 pesticides, according to new testing commissioned by ABC News.
The Health Research Institute (HRI), an accredited independent lab in Iowa, conducted the testing. HRI’s Chief Scientist and CEO John Fagan told The Defender, “We tested every part of the lunch … it was pretty shocking.”
Nearly 30 million U.S. kids eat school lunch every day, according to the School Nutrition Association.
Fagan’s lab identified 49 pesticides — listed at the end of this article — with 38 different pesticides detected in just one elementary school lunch. Among them was carbendazim, a fungicide banned in most European countries that can cause infertility and endocrine disruption.
Many wheat-based items contained the weedkiller glyphosate, commonly marketed as Roundup, which causes cancer and disrupts immune function.
A single strawberry cup contained 23 pesticides, ABC News reported.
Fagan’s lab also found numerous heavy metals in the samples. According to the Cleveland Clinic, exposure to heavy metals can cause irreversible damage to the human body, and may even be life-threatening.
Lead — which “at any level is harmful to children’s IQ,” Fagan said — was found in 100% of the samples.
Some samples contained cadmium, a heavy metal known to increase the risk of lung cancer, at a level 12 times higher than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) limit for bottled water, according to ABC News.
The lab also found arsenic in rice at levels 6 times higher than what’s allowed in apple juice, ABC News said.
Fagan said, “The children need our help and protection.”
Zen Honeycutt — founder and executive director of Moms Across America, a nonprofit representing hundreds of thousands of mothers who want safer food served to their kids — agreed.
Honeycutt told The Defender that if foreign countries were serving these types and amounts of toxins to our children, “we would call it poison and be at war with them.”
“It is time,” she added, “for parents and concerned citizens to demand that our regulatory agenciesrequire the food suppliers and farmers to do better. This is not an impossible task … it is, in fact, what regenerative, organic and biodynamic farmers do every day.”
School meals should not be ‘another source of toxic exposure’
ABC News released its school lunch testing results nine days after Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced the Safe School Meals Act.
If passed, the bill would direct the FDA to place limits on heavy metals, ban certain pesticide residues and do a safety reassessment of food additives, including artificial food dyes linked to health harms, according to a press release.
The bill also would ban PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals,” phthalates and bisphenols from school meal food packaging.
Booker said in a Sept. 18 press release that U.S. children consume far too many harmful substances in the food.
“School meals should be a child’s safest source of nourishment,” he said, “not another source of toxic exposure.”
The bill would create “a significant new market opportunity for organic and regenerative farmers” by increasing the funding available for schools to buy safe school meals, Booker added.
Honeycutt urged people to tell their federal representatives to support the bill. “We must make access to safe, nontoxic, nutrient-dense food a priority for the safety of our children and the future of our country.”
Epidemiologist: ‘Our regulatory system is not succeeding’
Epidemiologist Melissa Perry, dean of the George Mason University College of Public Health, who reviewed the school lunch testing results told ABC News, “50 pesticides in school lunches, it’s not okay.”
Perry has researched pesticides for over 25 years. She said the test results demonstrate “that our regulatory system is not succeeding in ensuring that the food that children eat are free from chemical burden.”
According to a statement to ABC News from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the FDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) “establish limits … and work together with USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to test and monitor contaminants in the food supply and environment, including heavy metals.”
The amount of pesticides detected in the testing mostly fell below the EPA’s limits, ABC New said. However, that doesn’t mean those quantities are safe — especially for children’s developing brains and bodies, Perry said, adding:
“The variety and the volume of chemicals that are being introduced in the market every year makes it practically impossible to evaluate the health effects of each and every chemical. …
“We don’t know what it means to be exposed over time at low levels continuously, especially for developing children.”
Rather than doing individual risk assessments for each chemical, some researchers suggestedregulatory agencies should use the Key Characteristics (KC) framework for making science-based decisions on how best to protect consumers from harm.
Under the KC framework, chemicals can be grouped and assessed based on their properties — or key characteristics — making it easier to quickly identify which chemicals might be harmful.
Still, we don’t know what happens when children are exposed to multiple pesticides simultaneously, Perry said. More research needs to be done.
The Defender reached out to both the FDA and EPA for comment but did not receive a response by the deadline.
‘This is something that will affect their whole life’
In 2022, Moms Across America commissioned the HRI to analyze the contents of 43 school lunchesgathered from public schools in 15 U.S. states.
Fagan said ABC News’ recent testing produced comparable results to the 2022 testing.
However, he said, the 2022 testing also looked at nutritional value — an area that needs more attention.
Many U.S. school kids come from low-income families, Fagan said. “They’re food-insecure. School lunch is probably the best meal many of those kids have during the day. And yet it doesn’t give them the essential nutrients they need for their brain to grow and be healthy and strong.”
According to Fagan, fast food companies — including Subway, Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, Taco Bell, and Chick-fil-A — commonly supply school lunches. Other suppliers include large food-service companies including Aramark, Chartwells, Sodexo, Opaa!, Revolution Foods and Whitsons Culinary Group.
Prior testing of popular foods sold by fast food chains showed that many items contained high levels of toxic metals, pesticides and “abysmally low” nutritional levels.
Parents need to understand that what their kids are eating at school doesn’t just impact their kids the day they eat that meal, Fagan said. “This is something that will affect their whole life because it’s that nutrition that supports the development of their brain and their muscles and every part of their body.”
The Defender asked the USDA — which sets the nutritional standards for school meals — what the agency does to ensure that the meals are free of pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins but did not receive a response by the deadline.
The Defender also didn’t receive a response when it asked ABC News for a copy of its testing results. However, ABC News included the full list of the 49 pesticides identified in its report:",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/elon-musk-to-tucker-carlson-we-shouldnt-force-people-to-take-vaccines,Elon Musk to Tucker Carlson: ‘We Shouldn’t Force People to Take Vaccines’,By Matt Lamb | Lifesite,4 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Vaccines deserve “caution” and “scrutiny,” Elon Musk told Tucker Carlson during a recent interview.
The X (formerly Twitter) owner said that while vaccines may have helped stop the spread of smallpox and polio, shots do not deserve a free pass. He also said he opposes vaccine mandates.
“I’m not anti-vaccine in general, I think we want to exercise caution with the use of vaccines,” he said.
Musk made the comments in the context of a potential repeal of Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act. Repeal of the section, which gives liability to tech platforms for published content, would end X, Musk said.
He predicted Democrats will try to repeal Section 230 if they win in November. Some Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have also endorsed removing Section 230 as a way to rein in Big Tech power as well. Musk is backing Trump for president and appeared with him at a rally over the weekend.
Carlson joked that the liability for vaccine manufacturers is not likely to be repealed, however.
Musk said that without vaccines there would be more deaths, soon after citing smallpox and polio.
“That doesn’t mean that vaccines should not have any scrutiny. Of course, we should be making sure that the quality control is incredibly good, especially if we’re giving them to children and whatnot,” Musk said.
“And we shouldn’t force people to take vaccines,” Musk said. Carlson called that statement “controversial.”
“I believe in freedom … America’s supposed to be the land of liberty,” Musk said during the interview.
He has previously said he is not opposed to vaccines in general but supports medical freedom.
“If you scare people enough, they will demand removal of freedom,” he wrote in December 2022. “This is the path to tyranny.”
He previously shared a video that exposes the false narrative about the efficacy and safety of the abortion-tainted COVID-19 shots, which have been linked to myocarditis, stroke, death, and a host of other problems, as extensively documented by LifeSiteNews.
Musk, the CEO of Tesla, previously said he would have ignored the Biden administration’s jab mandate for private businesses if the Supreme Court had upheld it.
“We would not have done so. I would rather go to prison than fire good people who didn’t want to be jabbed,” he said in September 2023 on X.
During the recent interview, Carlson and Musk also discussed the declining birth rate and why women feel children would ruin their lives.
The Tesla CEO has garnered attention from Christians and other conservatives for his social commentary, including his support for medical freedom when it comes to vaccines and his warnings about abortion and society.
He has also championed the need for more kids, though he has had many of his own children out of wedlock and through immoral means such as surrogacy.
“We need to stop scaring women that having a kid destroys your life,” Musk said during the interview, posted on Monday night. “This is false. We terrify girls into saying that if you get pregnant your life’s over. This is what schools teach.”",0

In an Instagram post Tuesday, the Hollywood leading lady credited “Food Babe” Vani Hari with helping get the word out on harmful food dyes found in the American food supply and, alarmingly, children’s breakfast cereals.
“I grew up on cereal. I still love it but I won’t eat @kelloggsus anymore after I found out that so many of the ingredients they use here in the US are BANNED in other countries. Why? Because they’re harmful for children,” the The Other Guys actress wrote Tuesday.
“Gracias to @thefoodbabe for helping to bring this to light and demand that [Kellogg’s] remove these harmful artificial food dyes for us – just like they do in other countries,” Mendes, 50, added.
The Hitch actress, whose account boasts 6.6 million followers, also posted an image illustrating how a Canadian version of “Froot Loops” omits food dyes Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1 and Yellow 6, some of which have been found to cause cancer in lab rats.
The Ghost Rider actress additionally posted a flyer highlighting an upcoming demonstration outside Kellogg’s headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich.
The “Food Babe” appeared at a roundtable discussion hosted by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) last week, where she slammed US regulators for allowing the foods to be sold in the US, despite containing harmful ingredients that are banned in Europe.
“Our government is letting US food companies get away with serving American citizens harmful ingredients that are banned or heavily regulated in other countries,” Hari said.
“Even worse, American food companies are selling the same exact products overseas without these chemicals but choose to continue serving us the most toxic version here,” she said, adding, “It’s un-American.”
The outspoken clean food advocate went on to explain how numerous popular US food products differ from their UK counterparts, including McDonalds fries, which she pointed out contain 11 ingredients – including formaldehyde – in the US, compared to three ingredients in Europe.
American food companies are making a fool out of us. They are knowingly poisoning us. It’s time for this to stop. Our movement is growing like I have never seen before. It's going to be historic! This is a clip from my Senate testimony in Washington DC yesterday, watch the whole… pic.twitter.com/FrZRAV5Op2
“This is Skittles. Notice the long list of ingredient differences,” she said pointing to a chart. “10 artificial dyes in the U.S. version and titanium dioxide. This ingredient is banned in Europe because it can cause DNA damage. Artificial dyes are made from petroleum and products containing these dyes require a warning label in Europe. And they have been linked to cancer and disruptions in the immune system.”
The issue of toxic chemicals in the American food supply has also been brought to the forefront by former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has been exposing the dangers of ultra-processed foods and seed oils and recently teamed up with former President Donald Trump to proclaim a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-shots-cause-blood-clots-in-the-lungs-case-study,Covid Shots Cause Blood Clots in the Lungs — Case Study,By Sean Miller,4 months ago,"A case study published earlier this year chronicled the story of a 26-year-old female who was diagnosed with acute extensive pulmonary embolism (the blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream) following her receiving the Pfizer mRNA Covid injection.
“Our report however portrays a case of a 26-year-old female who developed extensive pulmonary embolism following administration of the Pfizer- BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The patient did not have any risk factors for thromboembolism,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Despite facing a potentially life threatening side effect, the patient’s condition improved following treatment with several drugs.
“She was admitted, put on enoxaparin, and given Altaplase thrombolytic therapy. Her condition improved and she was discharged on Apixaban. The Thrombophilia screen performed on the 6-month follow-up was negative and following the resolution of thrombosis, Apixaban was stopped,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Ironically, the researchers led off by lauding the Covid vaccine, then saying they are proven to cause these ailments and ending by saying the vaccinated should be monitored for such ailments. A problem, reaction, solution dialectic.
“COVID-19 vaccines, a cornerstone of the fight against the disease have generally proven to be safe with most commonly reported side effects being mild and self-limiting. Uncommon severe adverse effects like thromboembolism have been reported during postmarketing surveillance,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “Our case highlights the importance of continued surveillance of uncommon adverse effects and the need for prompt diagnosis and management of such side effects.”

“Data derived from the Department of Defense [DOD] Joint Trauma System … by a military whistleblower offers a stark contrast to results of multiple clinical trials involving the liberal usage of remdesivir in military treatment facilities and other civilian facilities, as well as its potential contribution to, at minimum, hundreds of untimely deaths,” the documents state.
Yet according to the documents, the military began “liberally” administering remdesivir to service members who were suspected of having COVID-19 — months before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug.
The whistleblower, known by the pseudonym Daniel LeMay, shared the documents with investigative journalist J.M. Phelps, who published them last week in The Gateway Pundit.
In interviews with The Defender, LeMay and Phelps discussed the documents and their significance.
LeMay said the DOD’s Joint Trauma System is responsible for tracking “all sorts of patient data.” He told The Defender that the “initial trial depicted data manipulation in favor of remdesivir.”
He also said that based on his analysis of the data, several clinical trials did not have a true placebo group for which results could be compared with the remdesivir-receiving group. “The primary issue is with patient data. If we can’t verify the placebo group … then we can’t determine the actual efficacy of remdesivir.”
Reacting to the revelations, Brian Hooker, Ph.D., chief scientific officer for Children’s Health Defense, told The Defender:
“All of the information here needs to be made public and the public officials, including Tony Fauci, need to be held to account for the criminal acts associated with the fraudulent ‘trials’ of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine that were tainted in order to preclude their use, and making remdesivir the standard of care despite the obvious data showing that it kills people.”
Former victims of the COVID-19 hospital protocols, which included administration of remdesivir, and advocates for those victims welcomed the documents’ release.
Gail Seiler, Texas chairperson of the FormerFedsGroup Freedom Foundation, escaped from a Texas hospital in 2021, where she was given remdesivir and listed as “Do Not Resuscitate” against her and her family’s stated wishes. She said “The Remdesivir Papers” only “scratch the surface as to the homicide toll in military hospitals.”
The documents “tell us that our government orchestrated the needless deaths of COVID patients who did not need to die,” Seiler said.
Charlene Delfico, New Jersey state chair of FormerFedsGroup, previously told The Defender that COVID-19 protocols, including remdesivir, implemented at a New Jersey hospital “ran roughshod” over her parents. She said the new documents “validate our grievances regarding remdesivir and the ‘out the window’ standard of care protocol put in place by our government.”
“The whistleblower highlights what we’ve been saying all along,” Delfico said. “This drug is dangerous, and in most cases, fatal. There’s been no transparency or oversight. This should enrage people and make them push for an immediate investigation by Congress.”
“While people were dying, their deaths were being unlawfully labeled COVID deaths — when the deaths should have been attributed to the treatment protocol,” LeMay told The Gateway Pundit.
Military administered remdesivir despite known risks, leading to 941 deaths
According to the whistleblower’s data, 941 military service members — or 63.9% of those who were treated with remdesivir — died between March 2020 and March 2024, with deaths peaking between November 2020 and July 2021.
“While the military is only a subset of the larger population, it’s clear that service members and veterans who contracted severe COVID and were subsequently treated with remdesivir had a much higher chance of dying,” the documents state.
According to the documents, the DOD administered remdesivir to service members — despite the drug’s known risks and dangers.
“Gilead had already created a monopoly on the drug” with a U.S. patent it secured in 2017 “valid for up to 20 years,” the documents noted.
The drug, developed to treat Ebola, “was subsequently proven to be lethal in human patients.” According to a 2019 New England Journal of Medicine article, remdesivir resulted in the highest mortality rate among four investigational therapies for Ebola administered in the Democratic Republic of Congo — with 53.1% of patients dying.
In 2017, the documents noted, two University of North Carolina researchers, including Ralph Baric, Ph.D., received a $6 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), then headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, to “accelerate the development of a promising new drug (remdesivir) in the fight against deadly coronaviruses.”
Despite its deadly history, in February 2020, Gilead Sciences received FDA approval to initiate two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir in treating COVID-19.
In March 2020, the DOD announced “a cooperative research and development agreement with an industry partner” — Gilead — “to gain access to an antiviral drug for treatment use in our medical centers.”
According to the documents, aside from this expedited approval on the part of the DOD, “remdesivir moved quickly through government scrutiny,” with the FDA issuing emergency use authorization in August 2020 and full approval in October 2020.
“I think the DOD has a track record of making the FDA’s life easy,” LeMay said. “If investment and preparations precede approval, who will say no to the DOD, especially if the president is in agreement on a course of action?”
Phelps noted that Public Law 115-92 allows the FDA “to authorize the emergency use of an otherwise unapproved medical product if the Department of Defense … determines that there is a military emergency involving an agent that may cause imminently life-threatening and specific risk to U.S. forces.”
“The expedited timeline for the FDA’s emergency use authorization is beyond concerning, given remdesivir’s troubling history,” Delfico said. “It was very disturbing to read that the DOD and Gilead directly contracted to do this experiment on our military.”
Clinical studies lacked placebo groups
The documents compared several civilian and military clinical studies involving remdesivir, finding a high rate of deaths and injuries among participants who were administered remdesivir. The documents also showed that studies of remdesivir revealed the drug’s dangers.
According to the documents, a May 2020 study published in The Lancet “brought concerns about the efficacy of remdesivir,” noting that administration of remdesivir was stopped early in China “because of adverse events in 18 (12%)” of patients “versus four (5%) who stopped placebo early.”
And a 2021 study published in JAMA Network Open of over 2,300 veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 found that “remdesivir treatment was not associated with survival,” with more deaths and longer hospital stays among those patients who received remdesivir compared to those who did not receive the drug.
According to the documents, “service members and veterans participated in at least four Phase 3 Adaptive COVID19 Treatment Trials” in 2020 and 2021, all of which were sponsored by NIAID. Another study was sponsored by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC).
The documents revealed questions about studies and how they were conducted.
In one study, NCT04280705 [ACTT-1], “A true placebo, like saline, wasn’t used other than … where there were limitations on matching placebo supplies” and no distinction was made “as to who received which placebo.” Its findings “ignored those who didn’t finish the trial for various reasons, including adverse events.”
As a result, “this study is problematic due to multiple confounding variables that appear to exist intentionally to present a positive outcome for the remdesivir group,” the documents note. Yet, this study “ended up being the only comparison between remdesivir and a type of placebo.”
According to the documents, three other studies, NCT04401579 [ACTT-2], NCT04492475 [ACTT-3] and NCT04640168 [ACTT-4], had “no true placebo group.” Instead, the two groups in each trial received remdesivir alongside another drug.
In these three trials, all-cause mortality ranged from 3.5% to 7.1%, while the rate of serious adverse events ranged between 14.2% and 24.6%. In NCT04401579, “59 participants didn’t finish the trial due to death, which isn’t characterized as being caused by the investigative treatments.”
Another study, NCT04302766, sponsored by USMARDC, was conducted at 22 military facilities, “involving an undisclosed number of participants.”
But according to the documents, “While the trial examined the effects of remdesivir on the treatment of COVID-19, there are no details available at ClinicalTrials.gov to determine the amount of remdesivir administered to participants. There are no results posted to determine all-cause mortality or serious adverse events.”
“In four of five trials, the use of remdesivir resulted in a minimal positive effect on instances of all-cause mortality and serious adverse side events when compared to the administration of a placebo,” the documents stated.
“In some cases, these patients also had comorbidities (e.g., renal and liver disease) that could have been exacerbated by remdesivir and resulted in some of the reported complications such as acute renal injury and failure, as well as liver dysfunction and hepatic failure,” the documents noted.
“With many clinical trials involving service members and veterans taking place before Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s now-rescinded 2021 shot mandate, I question whether the deaths in these trials should have been attributed to remdesivir, or the overall treatment protocol, rather than COVID,” Phelps asked.
“If this was the case, what better coercion technique is there than to improperly say, “Look at all the people dying from COVID,” when you’re trying to convince someone to take a so-called vaccine that can also wreck people’s lives or send them to their graves?” Phelps added.
Remdesivir risks withheld from service members
The documents also noted that key details about the risks of remdesivir were concealed from service members, depriving them of being able to provide informed consent.
For instance, participants in NCT04302766 were told “there have not been kidney problems seen in humans who have been given remdesivir,” while there was “no mention that the use of remdesivir resulted in the highest mortality rate among participants” in the African Ebola trial.
Gilead’s lobbying may have played a role in the lack of military or regulatory oversight the drug enjoyed. Between 2018 and 2021, Gilead increased its spending on lobbying from $3 million to $8.1 million. By spring 2020, taxpayers had already funded Gilead to the tune of at least $70.5 million for the development of remdesivir.
Delfico connected Gilead’s lobbying to remdesivir’s inclusion in the National Institutes of Health’s COVID-19 hospital protocols. She said:
“Under the CARES Act [Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act] hospitals received significant payments for administering specific treatments, including remdesivir, which created a financial incentive for hospitals to use the drug despite its mortality rates.
“The lobbying, financial incentives and treatment protocols raise questions about the motivations behind remdesivir’s widespread use and the potential impact on patient care.”
Questions about the remdesivir clinical trials, missing clinical trial results and the potential lack of informed consent were addressed in a Sept. 27 letter by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) to Austin and the heads of other federal and military agencies, including the FDA.
Separately, on Sept. 24, Phelps submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the USAMRDC, for the results of the NCT04302766 trial. According to LeMay, “They’ve been unresponsive and will likely continue in that fashion unless there’s an official inquiry by Congress which is specific to this matter.”
Seiler called on “more whistleblowers and victims to come forward.”
Phelps said:
“While emails, a FOIA request, and a congressional inquiry may be ignored, we are writing history. It’s a matter of public record. The American people, especially those who lost loved ones during the pandemic, deserve to know the truth.”

“I’m currently in Asheville, North Carolina with my company doing disaster security for a dialysis company, and we’re also doing search and rescue for patients to bring them to dialysis so they don’t die,” the man said in a social media post that’s gone viral. “This place is a war zone people, and the military is not here.”

The man explained that when he worked in disaster relief during Hurricane Katrina, the government was extremely quick to respond and provided military assistance. But this time around, there’s no government presence.
“The reason I’m pissed because I was part of the operation during hurricane Katrina. I was stationed in San Diego and within 96 hours we were in Louisiana,” he said. “And these bastards are not sending the military here. There’s so much destruction. There’s no news crews here. That’s why you’re not seeing it. The American people should be angry at what our government is doing to this town. There are people hurting here. There are so many people dying.”
He went on to describe how he’s seen young children wandering around the devastated area looking for their parents — a dire situation that appears ripe for human traffickers to exploit.
“I drove past a young kids about 5 to 7 years old. They were brother and sister, and they were looking for their parents. We got them to a church. These young kids don’t know where their mom and dad are,” he said. “And the military is being fucking hamstringed by these goddamn DOD fucking executives. If you’re not angry, you should be. Because this is what our government thinks about us. They’re not here to help us. We have to take care of ourselves.”
“This is bad, people. You’re not here. It is very bad. We need water. We need food. We need clothes,” he continued. “I’m sick to my stomach that our government treats our American people this way. And then when they get slapped in the face, oh, here’s $750. After we sent over $200,000,000,000 overseas. Alejandro Mayorkas, you’re a traitor to your country.”
Unfortunately, this man’s testimony is not an isolated account. A number of outraged citizens have taken to social media to document the lack of government assistance and even instances of FEMA actually blocking volunteers from trying to help.

Trump made the promise during a town hall event, in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
An ex-Green Beret who was forced to leave the service because he would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, asked the former president what he would do to reverse the damage caused to the military by the vaccine mandate. The veteran noted that thousands of servicemen and -women were forced to leave, and recruitment for the military is “the lowest… in modern history.”
Trump said he wants personnel forced out by the mandate to return “with pay.”
“There should have never been a mandate,” Trump said. “That should have never happened. You should have been given choice.”
Trump then asked the former Green Beret if he would return, given the opportunity, and was told “as long as there’s accountability.”
“There’d be accountability all right,” Trump said. “We’ll fire their asses.”
The crowd erupted into applause.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-shot-ingredients-have-tainted-blood-products-research-article,Covid Shot Ingredients Have Tainted Blood Products — Research Article,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A peer reviewed research article published Tuesday reported that ingredients in the exotic Covid injection technology (lipid nanoparticles, modified mRNA, adenoviral DNA, and/or spike proteins) have tainted the blood transfusion and blood product supply.
“Exposure to lipid nanoparticles, modified mRNA, adenoviral DNA, and/or spike protein from a Covid-19 injectable product or through secondary exposure via blood transfusion, is a potential source of human physiological harm,” the research article said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “Biodistribution may not be limited to the body of the product recipient, as a growing body of evidence demonstrates the possibility of secondary exposure to injection by-products. These can be via bodily fluids and include the following routes of exposure: blood transfusion, organ transplantation, breastfeeding, and possibly other means.”
The authors also listed numerous side effects that are attributed to the lethal Covid injections.
“Blood reactions are an acknowledged side-effect of Covid-19 product injection; not limited to haemolysis, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, chronic cold agglutinin disease, immune thrombocytopenia, haemophagocytosis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and many other blood-related conditions. Adverse event occurrence in these contexts has motivated investigation into the cardiovascular mechanisms of harm by Covid-19 injectable products, and their biodistribution properties and pharmacokinetics,” the research article said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
NEW STUDY – Inadvertent Exposure to COVID-19 Injectable Product Artifacts Via Bodily FluidsHalma et al raises concerns over secondary exposure to COVID-19 injectable product artifacts (lipid nanoparticles, modified mRNA, adenoviral DNA, and/or spike protein) via blood… pic.twitter.com/Juaf48SE4I
“As Covid-19 injectable products are associated with an increased risk of stroke, the persistence of product artifacts in the blood presents a possible threat to a recipient of a blood donation from an injected donor who suffered from Vaccine Induced Thrombosis or Thrombocytopenia (VITT),” the research article said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “We assess the feasibility and significance of these risks with an overview of the case report literature of blood disorders in injected individuals, pharmacovigilance reports from the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), and a meta-analysis of the available literature on organ transplants from injected organ donors.”
One may be curious as to if the requirements to get vaccinated with the Covid shot to receive an organ transplant may be to muddy the waters as to potential exotic technology-based side effects.
“Vaccination mandates with respect to transplantation, especially for recipients, have been a source of controversy during the Covid-19 pandemic (602–607). Several centers have refused to provide transplants to uninjected prospective recipients,” the research article said in the ‘Organ Transplant Safety’ section.
The research article listed several facts validating the theory of harm via vaccinated-transfusion/transplantation in the ‘Methods’ section.
The researchers discussed the mechanisms of harm caused by the exotic technology within contaminated transfusions. This doesn’t just include blood clotting, but the actual ‘vaccination’ of transfusion recipients, as they may begin producing the spike protein – the effect of the mRNA and viral vector vaccines themselves.
Note the numbers in parenthesis correspond to studies linked in the research article’s ‘References’ section.
“Spike protein-induced clotting, being an unanticipated side effect of the products, warrants attention and caution when transfusing blood from one person to the other, depending on the time since injection, as there may still be LNP particles, aberrant proteins or spike protein present in the blood. It was previously assumed that the LNPs would remain at the site of injection (38) and break down rapidly (39). However, both vaccine spike antigen and mRNA have been found in vaccine recipients 60 days (40) post-vaccination and spike protein antigen has been found 120 days post-vaccination (41),” the research article said in the ‘Mechanisms of Harm’ section. “The Red Cross claimed in a wishful public statement that vaccine particles do not enter the bloodstream (42), which has been contradicted by biodistribution studies (43). It is possible that some of the Covid-19 product modified mRNA could be reverse-transcribed via LINE-1 to stably transfect the cell which would result in the observed continued production of spike protein(44).”
The numbers of the total vaccinated population of the U.S. were give, totaling 80 percent, as well as the number of blood transfusions given, the affected transfusions and the amount of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database reports stemming from the transfusions.
“There are 1352 transfusion reports in VAERS as of May 15, 2023 (Figure 1). As of May 25, 2023, according to the Worldometer (570), the population in the United States is 336,688,028. And according to Our World in Data, the number of Americans who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 injectable products is 270,230,000, or 80% of the US population (571). Considering the time course of injection, from the period of 1st March, 2021 to May 25, 2023, the time-averaged injection percentage is 70% (571). A 2019 statistic puts the number of blood transfusions occurring yearly in the USA at 10,852,000 (572), putting the approximate number of blood transfusions during the above period at 24.2 million,” the research article said in the ‘Blood Transfusions’ section. “Of the 24.2 million, approximately 17 million would have received a Covid-19 vaccine. Using the number of individuals who had received both an injection and a transfusion, and the number of reports of adverse events in VAERS of transfusions, we get a rate of 1/12,570 and with an under-reporting of 31, this becomes 1/405.”
The breastfeeding route was also analyzed.
“…by these rates, there were approximately 6,911,289 women breastfeeding at the time of injection with COVID products. This is a rough estimate, but based on recent data provided by the CDC,” the research article said in the ‘Breastfeeding and other routes of exposure’ section. “Using this number to compare it with the number of reports in VAERS, we get 1,835 reports of adverse events out of approximately 7 million mother-infant pairs (with the mother having received a Covid-19 injectable biological product), or approximately 1/3800. While seemingly low, this estimate does not account for underreporting, where the underreporting factor is estimated to be 31(577).”
Shedding was also discussed.
“While dosage would likely be minimal, it is possible that others may be exposed to injection particles via other routes. Shedding is observed in adenovirus vectored products (581), which would apply to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca (581). One important distinction is that while viral shedding can be ruled out with modified mRNA injectable products, because they lack a viral vector, exposure to the injection particles and their artifacts can occur, albeit in smaller quantities than the original injection,” the research article said in the ‘Breastfeeding and other routes of exposure’ section. “In households where one person was injected, other family members developed spike protein antibodies (582). While the cited article explained this in terms of the transfer of antibodies themselves, this would likely not be persistent. In cases where the antigen (spike protein) is transferred, this may possibly explain the presence of anti-spike antibodies in the serum of uninjected and unexposed (to SARS-CoV-2) individuals.”
Sexual intercourse was detailed as well.
“Sexual intercourse is a possible mode of transmission as spike protein RNA has been observed in semen during SARS-CoV-2 infection (583). Inactivated viral vector Covid-19 injectable products have been observed to impair sperm morphology (584), motility (585), and increase DNA fragmentation (584),” the research article said in the ‘Breastfeeding and other routes of exposure’ section. “Conflicting information exists on the impact of mRNA injections on semen parameters, with a study showing impaired semen concentration and sperm counts (586), and two studies seeing no impact (587,588). It may be of interest that sperm motility decreased 22% at a sperm bank in Denmark from 2019 to 2022 (589), and the drop in quality may be due to Covid-19, Covid-19 biological products, or it may be spurious.”
Organ translation risks from Covid shot-contaminated organs were also discussed in the literature. Increases in adverse events following transplants have been observed globally following the Covid shot rollout.
“There are several case reports of transplants from Covid-19 injected donors. This literature focuses mostly on donors who died due to VITT [Vaccine Induced Thrombosis or Thrombocytopenia]. In the case of organ transplantation, with few exceptions, such as the kidney, the donor must be deceased. Considering these donors were classified as having died from VITT by a medical professional, these donations are more likely to present safety issues than blood donation, where the donor does not have manifested VITT, as this would deem them ineligible or at the very least reluctant to donate,” the research article said in the ‘Organ Transplant Safety’ section. “Several national hemovigilance systems do not observe a significant increase in adverse event rates in 2021 compared to previous years (623,624). Other systems have not yet published hemovigilance for 2021 (625), though Austria reported a 49% increase in transfusion reactions from 49 in 2020 to 73 in 2021 (626), Denmark saw a significant increase in adverse reactions between 2020 and 2021 (627) and UK hemovigilance data shows an increase in blood component issues from 2020 to 2021 (628). Additionally transplantation AE rates in  Canada rose significantly, from less than 3 transfusion adverse events per year to 12 between 2020 and 2021 (629). In Japan there was a slight increase of 7% from 2020 to 2021 (630).”
The researchers pointed out that the vaccines are actually genetic modification injections.
“It has been brought to attention that with regard to the injectable Covid-19 biological products, these may be better classified as gene therapies as opposed to vaccines (631),” the research article said in the ‘Discussion’ section.
The Covid shots are known to:

https://www.infowars.com/posts/more-covid-shots-less-immune-system-study,More Covid Shots = Less Immune System — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A study published in September indicated that repeated inoculation with mRNA Covid vaccinations reduce the functionality of the immune systems of old people. Infowars previously reported on a different study that indicated a similar phenomenon in children.
“In conclusion, these findings show that, like younger individuals, older adults produce antibodies with reduced functional capacity upon repeated COVID-19 mRNA vaccination,” the study said in the ‘Conclusions’ section.
The specific mechanism of immune system reduction is increased levels of IgG4 (subclasses of immunoglobulin which are proteins in the immune system that act as antibodies but can result in a reduction of immune system function).
“…we have shown that older adults, like younger individuals, are inclined to develop IgG4 responses upon repeated COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and that increased IgG4 levels associate with a relative reduction in Fc-mediated effector functionality,” the study said in the ‘Conclusions’ section.
In so many words, this article adds to mounting evidence that repeated mRNA COVID vaccination reduces functional capacity of the immune system, particularly in older people!How many more studies are needed before the recommendation of repeated (outdated) boosters is banned??? pic.twitter.com/Cy1E9eubO4
The researchers analyzed patients aged 65 to 83-years-old for one month after their fifth Covid injection. They compared their immune system effects with a younger group aged 18 to 47-years-old for one month after their third Covid injection. The researchers assessed the development of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgG subclass levels in the older adults vs the younger adults.
Bret Weinstein previously discussed this phenomenon on Joe Rogan’s podcast.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-vaccinated-kids-are-six-times-more-likely-to-die-than-non-vaccinated-kids-study,Covid-Vaccinated Kids Are Six-Times More Likely To Die Than Non-Vaccinated Kids — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A study published earlier this year but gone mostly unreported, demonstrated a link between new-onset of asthma in children and Covid infection, with worse outcomes for infected children who received the Covid vaccination. Even more alarming, buried in the data is the fact that vaccinated kids are six-times more likely to die than non-vaccinated kids.
“The study highlights a strong link between COVID-19 infection and an increased risk of new-onset asthma in children, which is even more marked in those vaccinated,” the study said in the ‘Conclusion’ section.
Children who had Covid infection without being vaccinated had a 4.7 percent rate of new-onset asthma, while the infected and vaccinated children had an 8.3 percent rate of new-onset asthma.
While the results section listed these percentages, it only listed asthma, but deeper into the study it is revealed that those numbers refer to asthma or death.
“4.7% of COVID-19 infected unvaccinated children developed new-onset asthma or death, compared to 2.0% in their non-COVID-19 counterparts within a year. For Cohort 2, COVID-19 infected vaccinated children exhibited an 8.3% incidence of new-onset asthma or death, which was higher than the 3.1% observed in those who were not infected,” the study said in the ‘Incidence of new-onset asthma in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups’ section.
“They show that 354 of the 64,000 children and teenagers who received a Covid mRNA shot died within a year after vaccination – a death rate of almost six kids per 1,000. In contrast, only 309 out of 320,000 unvaccinated kids died, fewer than one per 1,000,” Alex Berenson said on Substack on Tuesday. “Both the difference and the absolute death rates reported in the study are shockingly high (Covid infections did not cause more deaths, the data show).”
The researchers defined the pathology of asthma, as well as the broad array of health ailments that may stem from it. Interestingly, they also mentioned asthma can impact future societal outcomes, possibly due to missed opportunities and lower productivity rates.
“Asthma, marked by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity, profoundly affects children’s health across the globe. Childhood asthma significantly impacts long-term health, leading to deteriorations in health status, increased obesity rates, and a 40–50% rise in absenteeism in early adulthood. These outcomes highlight the profound influence of early health conditions on future health and societal outcomes,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section.
Covid infection is believed to influence onset of asthma due to its inflammatory nature impacting the respiratory system. It should be noted that the Covid vaccines have an inflammatory effect of their own.
“Emerging evidences indicate a potential link between COVID-19 infection and an elevated rate of new-onset asthma in adults, possibly resulting from the virus’s inflammatory response, which may induce permanent alterations in airway functionality and sensitivity,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/hospitals-harvest-organs-from-donors-who-are-still-alive,Hospitals Harvest Organs From Donors Who Are STILL ALIVE,By Ethan Huff | Natural News,5 months ago,"Dr. Heidi Klessig, M.D., appeared on Children’s Health Defense (CHD) TV the other day to warn people that registering to be an organ donor puts them in danger of having their organs harvested from their bodies while they are still alive.
When registering to become an organ donor at the DMV, well-meaning people are told that they are “giving the gift of life,” but Dr. Klessig says this is a complete misnomer based on what she knows about how the process really works.
“When you go to sign up to be an organ donor, you go to the Department of Motor Vehicles and you see the brightly-colored signs saying ‘give the gift of life,’ you’re not offered a consent form,” she explains in the video below.
“You’re never told that when you become a brain-dead organ donor, you are not biologically dead. These people have a beating heart. Their lungs are working. Their digestive system works. Their kidneys work.”
Because of how the word sounds, braindead can make it seem like a person is pretty much already dead and ready for their organs to be harvested and given to someone else in need. The truth, though, is that being braindead does not mean that a person is actually dead.
“People who have been declared braindead have delivered healthy babies,” Dr. Klessig says. “These people are in no way dead.”
In recent weeks, there have been two such cases of organ donors who were declared braindead before their organs were extracted for transplant. Both individuals may have been able to recover were it not for being taken advantage of, it appears, by the organ transplant industry.
A 19-year-old athlete named Terrance Howard was declared braindead following a serious motor vehicle accident that left him with a terrible brain injury. Howard’s parents have what Dr. Klessig describes as “shocking and horrible” video footage that they shared to social media begging medical professionals to help their son get better, but to no avail.
The other case involves 23-year-old Jamaican business student Amber Ebanks who, following her braindead diagnosis, was neglected and left to die of starvation. Ebanks suffered some kind of injury that prompted her to drive herself to Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, only to 10 days later end up actually dead with her organs harvested by the hospital.
“She had a beating heart. She had lungs that were working. She looked like every other patient in the hospital that was getting better. And her family fought for her. They wanted care for her, but they were pressured almost every other day – doctors wanted to remove her life support.”
“The organ procurement team actually showed up the very first day after her procedure, even before she was declared braindead – you know, being interested in seeing her become an organ donor, which her family refused.”
If you are interested in watching the full video interview with Dr. Klessig, visit ChildrensHealthDefense.org.
“Once on, it’s not easy to get off,” someone on X wrote about becoming an organ donor. “You can’t just request it like you can to add. You can’t even do it online. You fill out a form and mail it. You never hear from anyone that it was completed. Then you go to renew and tell them you’re no longer a donor and they tell you computer says you are.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/switzerland-pays-out-15000-to-covid-vaccine-victims,"Switzerland Pays Out $15,000 to Covid Vaccine Victims",By Angeline Tan | Lifesite,5 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Switzerland is finally paying out its first victim of the experimental COVID-19 vaccines.
For the very first time in Switzerland, a person will receive financial compensation from the government for injuries incurred as a result of the experimental COVID-19 vaccines.
According to local reports, a spokesperson for Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA) confirmed that the department authorized the first compensation handout. The person injured by the experimental injection, who has not been named and whose injuries were not listed, will be receiving 12,500 Swiss francs ($14,696 USD) in compensation payment and another 1,360 ($1,598) in damages.
“So far, one application has been approved,” the spokesperson told local media, explaining that the compensation figure of a successful applicant is tied to the severity of the person’s injury, with a causal connection between an applicant’s health problems and the experimental COVID-19 shots first needing to be established.
At this time, Switzerland’s Department of Home Affairs has received 320 applications for vaccine injury compensation and according to Swissinfo.ch, 50 applications are pending approval, 30 of which are being evaluated carefully.
In December 2020, the Swiss government pushed people to get “vaccinated” against COVID, despite reports of adverse side effects from the experimental shots.
As extensively reported by LifeSiteNews, the abortion-tainted COVID jabs, while marketed by governments worldwide as “safe and effective,” have been linked to numerous severe side effects.
An analysis of 99 million people across eight countries published in February in Vaccine “observed significantly higher risks of myocarditis following the first, second and third doses” of mRNA-based COVID jabs, as well as signs of increased risk of “pericarditis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis” and other “potential safety signals that require further investigation.” In April, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was forced to release by court order780,000 previously undisclosed reports of serious adverse reactions, and a study out of Japan found “statistically significant increases” in cancer deaths after third doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 shots and offered several theories for a causal link.",0

Generations of people have been poisoned through the water supply without their consent. This toxic byproduct – hexafluorosilicic acid – has been dripped into most municipal water supplies for decades. The institutions that thought they knew what was best for everyone’s dental health have instead dumbed down entire generations of people, harming their IQ and cognitive development. This widespread dumbing down of human populations helps explain the lack of critical thinking skills in the 21st century.
None of these serious matters of public health seem important to institutions like the American Dental Association, however. In fact, the ADA immediately issued a statement, doubling down and defending water fluoridation.
Some institutions, like the American Dental Association, are pushing back against the science and dismissing this federal court ruling, demanding that fluoride be considered safe for everyone, against all available evidence.
The ADA, representing some 159,000 dentists across the country, posits itself as “the premier source of oral health information.” The ADA claims that they have “promoted the art and science of dentistry since 1859” while advocating for the public’s health. But the ADA aren’t thinking about the big picture with fluoride and how it is destroying the cognitive abilities of those exposed on a daily basis.
Immediately after the court’s ruling, the ADA hastily wrote:
The American Dental Association (ADA) remains staunchly in support of community water fluoridation at optimal levels to help prevent tooth decay. The district court ruling against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides no scientific basis for the ADA to change its endorsement of community water fluoridation as safe and beneficial to oral health.
The ADA called the ruling and the barrage of social media posts that followed “pseudo-scientific information.” The ADA claims that social media users are spreading information that “is not always based on research conducted according to impartial and evidence based scientific methodology.” The ADA contends that “conclusions drawn from research are not always scientifically justifiable or without bias.” One might point out that the ADA is drawing their own biased conclusions from research that was validated in court. By ignoring the latest evidence on fluoride’s damage to children’s brains, the ADA might be guilty of spreading “pseudo-scientific information.”
The ADA wrote that the District Court Judge did “not conclude with certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health.” However, the ruling does require the EPA to take regulatory actions to protect future children and populations from this toxic byproduct. The EPA and CDC’s current recommendation of .7 parts per million fluoride in drinking water is now outdated and not consistent with the latest science. The ADA fails to acknowledge this reality and is therefore acting against the best interest of communities that want to protect future generations.
The court’s recent decision should effectively undo the longstanding fluoride recommendations of the Environmental Protections Agency (EPA), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). These corrupt agencies contend that fluoridated water is “one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.” The CDC has historically recommended, and currently recommends, fluoride at a level that was found to be damaging to children’s brains. Public water systems have added fluoride to drinking water for more than 75 years. This was done in the name of “preventing tooth decay” although tooth decay still remains a serious health issue. This is because the ADA is too busy poisoning children’s brains instead of working to eliminate added sugars from food.
The real question is: Will municipal water systems across the nation begin to phase out fluoride use, in the face of opposition from American institutions that have misled the public for decades?",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/canadian-government-agency-admits-covid-boosted-individuals-died-more-document,Canadian Government Agency Admits Covid-Boosted Individuals Died More — Document,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has responded to a parliamentary inquiry into death rates during the Covid pandemic. The data revealed that the Covid boosted individuals died at higher rates than the non-vaccinated individuals during the same period.
“Across all weeks in the time period of interest, the number of deaths were highest among those with aprimary series and 1 additional dose,” the PHAC response said on page 2.
The inquiry was initiated by Conservative MP Cathay Wagantall on May 29 and returned with answers on September 16.
Page 1 and 2 of the response document listed the numbers of deaths experienced during various months of 2022. It showed that more of the vaccinated died than the non-vaccinated. It also showed that in many cases, the more shots a group got, the higher their death numbers were. Infowars previously reported on data out of the U.K. that showed similar results.
Notably, the data presented showed average numbers of deaths per week, which is why the data is not in whole numbers.
“PHAC previously argued that as vaccine effectiveness waned, an increase in deaths among those who had received two doses (the primary series) was expected, given that the majority of the population had been vaccinated with two doses,” The Canadian Independent said on social media on Monday. “However, for the fourth doses, which we want to draw specific attention to, only a small percentage of Canadians chose to receive a fourth dose, which was being offered during the time period of MP Wagantall’s request, making it impossible for PHAC to apply the same argument.”

The Northern Ireland government is currently running a public consultation for the policy proposal. The 79-page proposal, ‘Policy underpinning the Public Health Bill (Northern Ireland) – A Consultation Document’ lists actions the government would be granted to take against its people in the event of a declared health emergency.
The proposal lists a series of alarming powers the legislation would allow a magistrates’ court to exercise.
Page 47 lists the forced medicalization procedures that the magistrates’ court can subject individuals and groups of individuals to.
Ironically, the bill will not mandate ‘medical treatment’, but specifically exempts vaccination from its definition of ‘medical treatment’. Also, while one section says the proposed legislation will not mandate medical treatment, another section lists forced medical examinations it will allow for.
“Specific provision will be made prohibiting regulations that impose or enable the imposition of a requirement that a person undergoes medical treatment. Medical treatment does not include vaccination and other prophylactic treatment,” paragraph 144 on page 48 of the legislation said.
Paragraph 114 to 115 on page 39 detail the nature of the proposed forced medical examinations. In a sneaky move the bill states that ‘invasive procedures’ must not be conducted, but also states that they may be conducted if deemed necessary. Paragraph 115 exempts certain examinations from the prohibited category of ‘invasive procedures’ all together, effectively green-lighting them, while using language that appears to indicate the opposite.
Paragraph 96 on page 34 states that people’s buildings may be destroyed.
Paragraphs 78 and 79 on page 30 detail how a person or group need not even be infected nor have come into contact with a disease in order to be subjected to the ‘interventions’, as the individual or group of individuals need only have the potential to have contacted the disease.
Paragraph 72 on page 29 said that a person could be forced to do, or forced not to do ANYTHING if it’s deemed necessary for a public health measure, opening the door to even more powers not enumerated in the proposed legislation.
Paragraph 60 and 61 on page 25 list the powers the authorities will have to enter properties, take samples, confiscate property, documents and search electronic devices.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-shots-once-again-linked-to-heart-damage-study,Covid Shots ONCE AGAIN Linked to Heart Damage — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A study published in September documented a link between Covid vaccination and heart damage in those who contracted Covid infection. This is the latest in a long line of research into the phenomenon. This particular research documented a particular kind of heart attack that beset the infected vaccinated – STEMI.
“An ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a type of heart attack that mainly affects your heart’s lower chambers,” Cleveland Clinic said.
The study analyzed 949 patients. 656 with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) and 293 with non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI).
“The combination of vaccination and natural SARS-CoV2 infection was associated with the development of severe heart failure and cardiogenic shock in patients with STEMI, possibly related to an increased serological [blood serum immune] response,” the study said in the ‘Conclusion’ section.
Interestingly, this research specifically found that individuals who were both vaccinated and infected with Covid had an increased risk of heart disorders. Infowars recently reported on a study that documented how Covid booster doses had a negative efficacy rate, meaning that the boosters increased infection rates.
“The main finding of the present study was the association between post-infection SARS CoV-2 seropositivity in vaccinated patients and the development of severe heart failure and cardiogenic shock after STEMI,” the study said in the ‘Discussion’ section.
Notably, the research indicated that the infection, resulting in a positive blood test result (seropositivity) came after the vaccine was injected, meaning not only did the vaccines not prevent infection, but worse, they increased heart attacks after said infection.

Following a long, drawn-out legal battle, plaintiffs in a case against water fluoridation successfully argued that it simply does not make sense to continue lacing public water supplies with fluoride chemicals.
“Plaintiffs have proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that water fluoridation at the level of 0.7 mg/L – the prescribed optimal level of fluoridation in the United States – presents an ‘unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,'” the judge ruled in the case.
Across New Zealand, most fluoridated water supplies fluoridate at a level of 0.85 mg/L, with some councils fluoridating even higher at the top-end amount of one part per million (1 ppm) of fluoride.
(Related: Did you know that fluoride does absolutely nothing to protect teeth from cavities, despite what public health authorities claim?)
Drawing from a pool benchmark dose analysis carried out by renowned toxicologist Prof. Philipe Grandjean, who is famous for his work on mercury neurotoxicity, the judge highlighted the fact that drinking fluoridated water causes a child’s IQ to drop.
“The pooled benchmark dose analysis concluded that a 1-point drop in IQ of a child is to be expected for each 0.28 mg/L of fluoride in a pregnant mother’s urine,” the judge explained. “This is highly concerning, because maternal urinary fluoride levels for pregnant mothers in the United States range from 0.8 mg/L at the median and 1.89 mg/L depending upon the degree of exposure.”
“Not only is there an insufficient margin between the hazard level and these exposure levels, for many, the exposure levels exceed the hazard level of 0.28 mg/L.”
Other research confirmed that people who drink fluoridated water show noteworthy levels of fluoride in their urine. In New Zealand’s Palmerston North, which is fully fluoridated, test subjects showed levels of fluoride in their urine at 0/82 mg/L.
Mothers who drink fluoridated water while pregnant were shown to give birth to children with sustained central nervous system damage that likewise results in lowered IQ and symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and / or depression.
Dr. Diana Sarfati, New Zealand’s Director-General of Health, now has the option to completely call off all water fluoridation efforts across the country in order to protect the nation’s citizens, and especially its children. The question remains: will she do it?
Fluoride Free New Zealand has created a petition that it is urging people to sign calling for an end to all water fluoridation in New Zealand. Be sure to check it out and sign!
“It’s a good sign, but it needs to go to the top supreme court to be valid and implemented,” tweeted someone on social media in response to the news.
Others here in the United States shared Fluoride Free NZ’s tweet about the court ruling with their own politicians – one this writer saw shared it with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his consideration – so perhaps they, too, will take similar action.
“They’re still poisoning us with the death shots, so they’re not going to stop poisoning our water,” tweeted another with a more skeptical take on the situation.
“All those of us that stood against fluoridation were called all kinds of nasty crap,” added Counterspin Media NZ to the conversation. “It may have been because those that targeted us, were themselves affected by lower IQ?”

Their then-15-year-old daughter was removed from the familial home 19 months ago after they objected to giving her puberty blockers and assist their daughter in facilitating a supposed “sex change.” Puberty blockers frequently cause permanent and irreversible damage, including osteoporosis, spinal problems, increased risk of heart problems, sexual dysfunction, and permanent infertility.
Despite that reality – and the fact that many European medical institutions, including the U.K.’s National Health Service, now see puberty blockers as experimental at best and dangerous at worst – a Swiss court ordered the young teenage girl, who is now 16, to be taken from her “transphobic” parents by social services and placed in a group home called the “foyer.” She has now been there for over a year while her parents risk criminal changes to get her back.

The parents recently described their ordeal in a lengthy report to Fox News. “This is not a question of human rights,” the father told Fox News. “This is a question of conducting medical experiments on children.” The parents call their struggle against an array of powerful institutions – the school system, the medical establishment, social services, and the courts – a nightmare, saying that they feel “marginalized,” “powerless,” and that their lives feel like the “Twilight Zone.”
According to the father, when their daughter told them in 2021 that she identified as a boy, “it was an absolute surprise. She was 13 at the time and she had never previously demonstrated any inclination towards masculinity or any proclivity for masculine behaviour, ever.”
Like so many parents, they decided to reach out for professional medical help, unaware that many health institutions have been captured by trans activists. The father had always been close to his daughter, and the pandemic – with school closures and consequently much time spent online – had been difficult for the entire family. “We said to our daughter, ‘Well, this is a surprise, but we will listen to you, and we will seek medical advice,” the father told Fox. “We will all learn together and make decisions together.” The advice they received, however, put their family on a tragic trajectory. According to Fox:
At the recommendation of their child’s pediatrician, they took their daughter to the public children’s hospital in Geneva, where she was shown a “gender unicorn” [I covered the “gender unicorn” here] and was asked to identify with various aspects of the image, after which it was determined that she was “likely experiencing gender dysphoria.” The director of the ward then met with the parents and explained that the hospital was conducting “rigorous research” around the question of gender identity and that their daughter would receive a “comprehensive and serious assessment.”
The family was told that their role was to “support [their daughter] in her identity,” including assisting her in “socially transitioning,” which meant helping her to “present as male” by facilitating a short haircut and buying breast binders, which would flatten her chest to disguise her femininity. The parents agreed and continued to consult with the psychiatrist at the hospital.
Several months later, they were told that the next step for their daughter was puberty blockers, which would begin to facilitate major physical changes in their daughter. At that, the parents balked.
“We’re not at the stage where we’re going to be giving our daughter any medication,” the father responded, telling Fox: “We saw firsthand in our interaction with the hospital, that there was no serious medical assessment being conducted. It was simply, ‘Well your daughter has pointed to these elements on the gender unicorn, and therefore, she’s a boy because she says so.’” The family secured a private psychiatrist for a second opinion – but against the parents’ wishes, the private school their daughter attended began to facilitate a “social transition,” treat her as a male, and even “connected her with a transgender advocacy organization.”
READ: 21 states threaten top medical group with legal action for claiming puberty blockers are ‘reversible’
A school psychiatrist called Swiss Child Protection Services and informed them that the girl needed “protection from her ‘transphobic’ parents” following their continued objection to puberty blockers.
According to the father:
The school was facilitating meetings between our daughter and [the trans activist group] and our daughter and [child services] not only without our knowledge, but fraudulently, because they were marking her absentee form as if she was doing school activities. We later found out she wasn’t. She was out of school meeting with the [trans activists] and [child services].
Child services got a court order permitting them to remove her from her parental home based on “mental and physical health concerns.” The Swiss authorities declined to provide any comment to Fox News, while the father told Fox that the specific type of abuse that they had allegedly perpetrated was never specified.
The parents are now desperately attempting any legal avenue possible to get their daughter back, and the case has begun to attract international attention. “I want her to come home so that we can get her back on a healthy track,” the father told Fox News. “For her own well-being and that of her entire family.”
This Swiss family is not the only one. In every jurisdiction that implements gender ideology, the state eventually comes to take children away from their parents – in Canada, the United States, and elsewhere.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-booster-shot-efficacy-becomes-negative-after-one-month-study,Covid Booster Shot Efficacy Becomes Negative After One Month — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A recent preprint study documented how the effectiveness of the Covid booster shots is not just non-existent, but negative, leading to boosted individuals having higher rates of Covid infection.
The researchers analyzed data from healthcare workers in the country of Georgia during the Omicron variant circulation between January to June 2022. The data demonstrated that in the first month after boosting, there was an effective result from the shot, but in the second and third months, that effectiveness went negative. In the fourth month that negative effectiveness rate got dramatically worse.
“Absolute VE [vaccine effectiveness] for a first booster was 40% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -56 – 77) at 7– 29 days following vaccination, -9% (95% CI -104 – 42) at 30 – 59 days, and – 46% (95% CI -156 – 17) at ≥ 60 days,” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
Notably, the Covid vaccines (viral vector and mRNA) make the vaccinated produce the spike protein of Covid, so testing positive for Covid after becoming a spike protein factory may come as no surprise.
In addition to a negative efficacy after repeated doses, the Covid vaccine is also documented to increase in lethality after repeated doses and increase Covid infection rates after repeated doses.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/australian-government-stops-accepting-covid-vaccine-injury-claims-today,Australian Government Stops Accepting Covid Vaccine Injury Claims Today,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"The Australian government is no longer accepting Covid vaccine injury claims as of Monday, despite the ongoing suffering of the vaccine victims.
“Following the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) update published on 13 December 2023, the Australian Government has made the decision to extend the closing date of the Scheme until 30 September 2024. Claims for compensation under the Scheme may continue to be lodged until 30 September 2024,” the Australian Department of Health website said.
The scheme that has ended was in place for those who have suffered moderate to severe injury from the Covid vaccine.
“The Australian Government has implemented a claims scheme to enable eligible claimants who have received a TGA-approved COVID-19 vaccine to obtain compensation for recognised moderate to severe vaccine-related adverse events,” the Australian Department of Health website said.
The program covered losses or expenses of $1,000 AUD and above due to Covid vaccine side effects.
Investigative journalist Maryanne Demasi further discussed the sunset of this program on her Substack on Sunday, stating that many people are still beginning to experience latent side effects from the exotic injections.
“Today, the Australian government’s Vaccine Claims Scheme stops accepting new claims, despite thousands of people continuing to suffer with covid-19 vaccine injuries,” Demasi said on Substack.
She said that many vaccine victims feel left behind and could not benefit from the compensation program.
“Many victims feel abandoned by the government, saying the scheme’s eligibility criteria was too narrow, too cumbersome, and it lacked transparency,” Demasi said on Substack.
While the Australian government has paid out $32 million AUD, it has not revealed how many claims have been approved or denied.
“One of the primary criticisms of the scheme has been the overly stringent criteria for eligibility,” Demasi said on Substack.
The Australian Department of Health still recommends the Covid vaccine, despite the compensation program sunsetting, leaving those who get injured out in the cold.

“In summary, we have demonstrated simple and efficient plasmonic-magnetic nanorobot-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection assay,” the study said in the ‘Conclusion’ section.
The researchers began by explaining how the novel pandemic led to exotic technology injections.
“The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has prompted an urgent demand for nanotechnological solutions towards the global healthcare crisis, particularly in the field of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. As an emerging tool for nanoscience and technology, micro/nanorobots have demonstrated advanced performances, such as self-propelling, precise maneuverability, and remote actuation, thus hold great potential to provide breakthroughs in the COVID-19 pandemic,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
They then went into their detection method for this exotic technology.
“Here we show a plasmonic-magnetic nanorobot-based simple and efficient COVID-19 detection assay through an electronic readout signal. The nanorobots consist of Fe3O4 [iron oxide] backbone and the outer surface of Ag [silver], that rationally designed to perform magnetic-powered propulsion and navigation, concomitantly the probe nucleic acids transport and release upon the hybridization which can be quantified with the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Nanorobots, also called nanobots (a form of nanotechnology) are defined by the researchers.
“Micro/nanorobots are small-scale artificial machines that rationally designed to perform predefined tasks by converting various energies into mechanical motion and various chemical triggers to perform the designed action,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section. “In particular, micro/nanorobots have been exploited to enhance the analytical performance in biosensing applications.”
The researchers detailed the atomic-level mechanisms that the Covid vaccine nanotechnology uses to self assemble. They documented which metals are used by the technology and how they bind together and for what purpose. Infowars previously reported on a recent study documenting the phenomenon of this nanotechnology.
“Here, we present a simple and efficient COVID-19 detection assay with plasmonic-magnetic nanorobots through an electronic readout platform (see Scheme 1). As a nanoscale building block of nanorobots, the Fe3O4/Au/Ag nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a sequential chemical reduction method. Firstly, under 10 nm Au seeds were formed on the Fe3O4 NPs, which facilitates nucleation and growth of high-density Ag particles, leading to the hierarchically structured Fe3O4/Au/Ag NPs. The nanorobots were readily fabricated by assembling Fe3O4/Au/Ag NPs into rod-shaped microaggregates, which enables controllable propulsion and navigation under the rotating magnetic field. Also, the Ag surface of nanorobots provides the probe DNAs tagging and releasing site depends on hybridization reaction. The magnetic actuation of probe DNA-tagged nanorobots led to promoted target binding reaction with their complementary nucleic acids,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section.
Based on the nature of the nanotechnology, the researchers were able to demonstrate a pathway for detecting it – using electromagnetic systems.
“The resulting hybridized duplex can be released from the nanorobots due to the change of electrostatic properties. Thus, the quantifying remnant probe DNAs by electrochemical signal confirms the detection of target nucleic acids. Exploiting these versatile concepts, we demonstrated magnetically actuated nanorobot-based detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section. “Experimental results verified the nanorobot swarming enhanced sensing efficiency, with nanomolar detection limit and high selectivity. Further, the clinical applicability of the proposed assay was validated using extracted SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA samples.”
Furthermore, the researchers stated that the detection method they developed could be utilized for various other areas of research.
“This strategy is versatile to extend targeting various nucleic acids, thus it could be a promising detection tool for other emerging infectious diseases, environmental toxins, and forensic analytes,” the study said in the ‘Conclusion’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/childrens-health-defense-scientists-uncover-evidence-of-pfizer-hot-lots-linked-to-higher-rates-of-covid-vaccine-injuries,Children’s Health Defense Scientists Uncover Evidence of Pfizer ‘Hot Lots’ Linked to Higher Rates of Covid Vaccine Injuries,"By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. | The Defender",5 months ago,"Different batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine distributed in the U.S. had very different rates of serious adverse events (SAEs), according to a peer-reviewed research letter published late Thursday in Science, Public Health Policy and the Law.
Children’s Health Defense (CHD) scientists Brian Hooker, Ph.D, chief scientific officer, and Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., senior research scientist, co-authored the letter.
Hooker and Jablonowski found the highest SAE rates occurred in COVID-19 vaccine batches distributed during the first two months of the vaccination program — and the highest proportions of those batches were sent to government agencies, hospitals, universities and health departments, as opposed to clinics, pharmacies and doctor’s offices.
The “extremely high” amount of variability from lot to lot suggests “very poor manufacturing controls,” and a “manufacturing process that should have never been approved in the first place,” Hooker told The Defender.
Under emergency use authorization, vaccine makers aren’t required to have their final filled and finished vials inspected, according to Dr. Peter McCullough. Contaminants from the manufacturing process can be concentrated in certain lots. Product transport, storage and use issues also may affect particular lots.
The paper is the latest in a series of papers to analyze vaccine lot and adverse event data by country. Researchers in Denmark, the Czech Republic and Sweden conducted similar studies with similar results.
For this study of U.S. data, CHD researchers analyzed vaccine lot data for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. This type of analysis allows researchers to track where the vaccine was manufactured and where it was distributed.
Informed Consent Action Network obtained the data in October 2022 through a Freedom of Information Act request.
CHD scientists matched that data to reports of adverse events in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a passive reporting system where providers or recipients can report injuries. It is not a complete inventory of all adverse events and is known to capture less than 1% of them.
The lot data showed that 410 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine produced in 156 different lots were distributed to 46,327 vaccine administration sites across the U.S. between Dec. 13, 2020, and April 26, 2022.
According to the data, on average 1,011,055 vaccines were distributed per day. The vaccines came from between one and 10 different lots, and the number of doses produced in each lot varied widely — from 10,530 to over 11.8 million.
For the three years of data analyzed, 977,542 adverse events were reported to VAERS. Of those, 455,820, or 46.7%, were related to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.
Only 29% of the reports included a lot number. Among those, 290,835 of the serious adverse events could be linked to the lot numbers in the Pfizer data.
The reports included a wide range of side effects:
The researchers found that the adverse events were not distributed proportionally across the different lots — some batches were associated with more side effects, and in some cases, significantly more.
The earlier batches sent to mass distribution centers like hospitals had more side effects than the later ones sent to pharmacies and large grocery chains. Some lots, particularly early ones, had higher rates of deaths and serious adverse events.
The rate of serious adverse events declined through time in all categories, which the researchers noted could be attributed to system management, fewer people reporting injuries, or fewer injuries.
The scientists said they expected to find a high number of deaths in states with the highest populations, such as California, Texas or New York. Instead, the proportions of serious injuries and deaths were relatively higher in places such as South Dakota, Kentucky and Tennessee.
The authors noted that data were made available only through legal action, which makes it challenging to do this type of research. Also, the VAERS database is insufficient to capture all adverse events and regional variations within states, posing another challenge to understanding the full range of possible issues with the lots.
U.S. data confirm Danish study that was subjected to ‘obsessive criticism’
CHD scientists built their analysis on work published by Danish researchers in 2023, who analyzed Pfizer lot data associated with reported serious adverse events in Denmark.
That Danish study analyzed data from Dec. 27, 2020, to Jan. 11, 2022. The analysis found larger vaccine lot sizes were associated with fewer serious adverse events and 71% of the suspected adverse reactions occurred in 4.2% of the vaccine batches.
The study raised the alarm about safety issues associated with the vaccine production process.
The author of the Danish paper, Vibeke Manniche, M.D., Ph.D., told YouTube commentator John Campbell, Ph.D., in an interview that the study raised essential questions about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, “Has the product changed? When did it change? Why did it change?”
That paper garnered significant attention in the press and on social media, what the authors called “obsessive criticism” in the form of multiple responses from researchers attempting to discredit the study’s methodologies and interpretations.
The authors responded publicly in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation. They defended their interpretations and said they “eagerly await more definitive studies of batch-dependent safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, for example, from the SSI [Danish Statens Serum Institut], to refute or validate our results and increase the evidence base for this important area of research.”
In June, Czech researchers from the University of Ostrava and other research institutions reproduced the Danish study’s methodology. They used Czech Republic data, released through a Freedom of Information Act request, from the beginning of the vaccination campaign through March 1, 2023.
They also analyzed adverse events reported after the COVID-19 vaccine by batch number and compared them to the results from the Danish registry data, but they had data from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.
They similarly found that different batches had different rates of adverse events and that there were significantly higher numbers of adverse events associated with the early vaccine releases for all of the vaccines — “confirming the results of the study by Schmeling et al.”
Last month, the authors of the original Danish study expanded their analysis to Sweden and published their findings in the journal Medicina.
In that paper, the authors reported that the batch-dependent issues they identified in Denmark were confirmed in Sweden and suggest that early commercial doses of Pfizer’s vaccine may have differed from later ones. They concluded the issue merits further study.
The letter published today in Science, Public Health Policy and the Law similarly reproduced the Danish study’s methodology and made largely similar findings that there were clear variations in Pfizer’s lots and the patterns were similar.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/excessive-dna-contamination-in-mrna-vaccines-presents-substantial-risk-of-cancer-say-52-scientists-and-academics,"Excessive DNA Contamination in mRNA Vaccines Presents ‘Substantial Risk’ of Cancer, Say 52 Scientists and Academics",By The Daily Sceptic,5 months ago,"The Australian Government should immediately suspend the use of Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines due to accumulating evidence of high levels of synthetic DNA contamination in the shots, which present a “substantial risk” of genomic integration and long-term health impacts, including cancers, say leading scientists and academics.
In a letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Russell Broadbent, independent MP for the federal seat of Monash, said that “immediate action through a suspension of these products is critical to mitigate further risk”, after independent testing of Australian vials of modified RNA (mod-RNA) Covid vaccines detected residual synthetic DNA at levels up to 145 above the legal limit.
The letter, circulated to all Australian MPs and Senators, is co-signed by 52 scientists and academics, many at the top of their fields, including Professor of Oncology Angus Dalgleish, Emeritus Professor Wendy Hoy, an expert in chronic disease, Emeritus Professor Robert Clancy, an immunologist who developed a bronchitis vaccine, geneticist Professor Alexandra Henrion Caude and microbiologist Professor Sucharit Bhakdi MD.
An accompanying science summary describes the concerns of Broadbent and co-signatories, who are asking the PM to adopt a “precautionary approach”, with the recommendation that “the Minister for Agriculture initiate a Biosecurity Import Risk Analysis of these products, potentially leading to the suspension of these products due to the risks they pose to human health”.
“Excessive synthetic foreign DNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles can integrate into human cells, potentially leading to genomic instability, cancers, immune system disruption and adverse hereditary effects,” explains the summary, which details the results of independent testing of the vaccines to date.
Residual synthetic DNA, a byproduct from the mod-RNA vaccine manufacturing process, is allowed under TGA regulations in levels of up to 10 nanograms (ng) per vaccine dose, a regulatory limit that was set for traditional vaccines and was not amended for mod-RNA products using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).
The summary goes on to explain why the LNP packaging of residual synthetic DNA makes these products different to traditional vaccines that may contain “naked” residual DNA.
“Crucially, naked DNA has no ability to cross cell membranes and enter cells. In contrast, synthetic DNA encapsulated in LNPs possesses a high transfection efficiency, meaning, the LNP-modDNA complexes are efficient at delivering synthetic DNA into human cells,” the summary states.
The summary cites research indicating that the presence of foreign DNA within the cell alone can induce cancer, but the risk is increased if the DNA enters the cell nucleus. This can occur in dividing cells, and the presence of an SV40 enhancer sequence (in Pfizer only), which is “long known to assist entry into the nucleus, even when cells are not undergoing cell division”, increases the risk further.
Once synthetic DNA is inside the cell nucleus, genomic integration is possible, the summary explains. And, “when genomic integration of foreign DNA occurs at the wrong place within the genome, it frequently induces malignant diseases, cancers, especially leukaemia”.
Genomic integration and cancer formation arising from synthetic DNA contamination are yet to be proven in vivo (in human tissue). However, the summary lists 19 resources from the scientific literature justifying the stated concerns and calls for a full and thorough investigation. Additionally, the summary cites putative evidence of genomic integration of residual synthetic DNA from the Pfizer vaccine in cancer cell lines.
To date, regulators, including the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), have said that the LNP packaging of residual synthetic DNA is of no significance, that the vaccines are not contaminated with high levels of DNA, and that the vaccine contents cannot enter the cell nucleus or genomically integrate.
Notably, the TGA did not require testing for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity before providing provisional approval and, eventually, full registration for mod-RNA Covid vaccines.
As regulators maintain that they are unconcerned by the potential risks posed by reported high levels of synthetic DNA in the mod-RNA Covid vaccines, several independent labs are now carrying out testing of human tissue to see if these potential risks are indeed occurring.
The letter in full, below, dated September 25th 2024:
Dear Prime Minister,
I refer to my letter of September 20th 2024 calling on the Government to immediately suspend the use of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 products due to the evidence of significant synthetic DNA contamination, as detailed in Dr. David Speicher’s report.
Unlike the Thalidomide tragedy, which resulted in over 10,000 victims globally, the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to more than 20 million Australians, totalling over 63 million doses. The contamination detected in these vaccines, if not addressed, presents a substantial risk, with the potential for these dangers – such as genomic integration and potential long-term health impacts – to multiply with each additional dose administered. Immediate action through a suspension of these products is critical to mitigate further risk.
To assist in adopting a precautionary approach and minimising further harm, I enclose a Science Summary created and endorsed by eminent Australian and international scientists and medical experts. The summary reinforces the known and potential dangers of DNA contamination and highlights the need for an urgent and independent investigation. As advised by the co-signatories, the Department of Health and Aged Care has produced no evidence to demonstrate why the detected DNA contamination will not produce the dire adverse health outcomes detailed in the Science Summary.
Additionally, I have reason to believe that multiple attempts by prominent scientists to warn the TGA of these risks have been disregarded since early 2021, raising serious questions about the agency’s ability to protect the health and well-being of Australians.
Finally, I draw your attention to the Biosecurity Act 2015, which may now be relevant. Given the contamination evidence, I recommend the Minister for Agriculture initiate a Biosecurity Import Risk
Analysis of these products, potentially leading to the suspension of these products due to the risks they pose to human health.
I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the 52 co-signatories below in the preparation of this letter and reiterate my call seeking your urgent action to ensure the safety of all Australians.
Yours sincerely,
Russell Broadbent MPMember for Monash
This is the second letter sent to the PM on the contamination issue by Broadbent, who is known for his advocacy for the Covid vaccine injured.
In the previous letter, sent to the PM on September 20th, Broadbent criticised the Department of Health (DOH) and the TGA for “ignoring repeated warnings by experts” over the synthetic DNA contamination, which was first detected by genomics scientist Kevin McKernan in early 2023. McKernan’s findings were subsequently replicated by scientists in Germany, the U.S., Canada and most recently Australia, by Dr. David Speicher.
Broadbent’s office advised that no response to either letter had been received from the office of the Prime Minister, the DOH or the TGA at the time of publication.
Broadbent, who lost his preselection for the Liberal Party (conservative) last year and resigned from the party soon after to become independent, was the only federal MP from a major party to publicly declare that he would not take a Covid vaccine during the rollout.
The MP has since come out as a strong critic of Australia’s No Jab No Pay legislation, which he says “creates new layers of inequity and exclusion” by withholding family and childcare benefits from parents whose children are not vaccinated according to the full childhood schedule.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/thousands-of-potentially-toxic-chemicals-in-food-packaging-find-their-way-into-the-human-body,Thousands of Potentially Toxic Chemicals in Food Packaging Find Their Way into the Human Body,By Raw Egg Nationalist,5 months ago,"Over 3,600 potentially toxic chemicals found in food packaging may end up in food, according to a new study.
The researchers previously catalogued around 14,000 food-contact chemicals (FCCs), all of which are capable of migrating into food from packaging made from a wide variety of materials, including plastic, paper, glass and metal.
In their new study, the researchers looked for these chemicals in existing biomonitoring databases around the world, which catalogue chemicals found in human samples.
The researchers expected to find hundreds of chemicals in the databases, but instead they found 3,601, a full quarter of all known FCCs.
Around 100 of these chemicals are already known to be of “high concern” because of studies establishing their toxicity—chemicals such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), bisphenol A and phthalates—but the rest have little to no data establishing their risks to human health.
In response to the new study, health advocates have pointed to the current system for chemical regulation in the US as one of the main reasons so many chemicals are ending up in food packaging and, ultimately, in our bodies.
“Some have never been reviewed by the FDA at all because food and chemical companies are exploiting a loophole that lets them, rather than the FDA, decide whether a chemical is safe,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, one of several nonprofit organizations that have repeatedly petitioned the agency to ban toxic substances in food and packaging.
“It’s no surprise that consumer confidence in food chemical safety is falling.”
The FDA is now vowing to change its review processes for new food chemicals and to conduct reviews of chemicals already on the market. However, representatives of the agency have said current funding levels need to be increased significantly.
Jim Jones, the FDA’s first-ever deputy commissioner for human foods, said that the FDA needs “a systematic approach for chemical reassessment.”
Reforming the FDA and other regulatory agencies is a central plank of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make American Healthy Again” agenda, which he has allied with Donald Trump in an effort to pursue, after finding the Democrat Party unreceptive to his suggestions.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-towns-suspend-water-fluoridation,US Towns Suspend Water Fluoridation,By Raw Egg Nationalist,5 months ago,"Two towns in New York state will suspend water fluoridation, after a federal judge ruled this week that the EPA must address risks to children’s cognitive development associated with fluoridation.
Yorktown and Somers have both announced that they will stop adding fluoride to their municipal water supply.
“In light of this federal ruling and the long-standing concerns expressed by many Yorktown residents, I have decided to suspend water fluoridation as a precautionary measure,” Yorktown supervisor Ed Lachterman said in a statement, released on Thursday.
“Our priority is the safety and well-being of our community, and we believe it is prudent to pause fluoridation to further assess its potential impacts.”
Somers Supervisor Robert Scorrano said that the town’s decision to stop fluoridating the municipal water supply would “give residents the freedom to choose their own sources of fluoride, ensuring personal control over their health decisions. Additionally, concerns about potential long-term health risks from fluoride exposure support reevaluating its use in public water systems.”
Yorktown and Somers are the first towns in the US to have announced an end to municipal fluoridation after U.S. District Judge Edward Chen’s ruling, which was announced on Tuesday.
Judge Chen ruled in favour of a number of advocacy groups and instructed the EPA to address the risks of fluoridation. The agency must ensure there is a sufficient margin between the hazard level for fluoride and the exposure level.
“If there is an insufficient margin, then the chemical poses a risk,” the judge wrote.
“Simply put, the risk to health at exposure levels in United States drinking water is sufficiently high to trigger regulatory response by the EPA.”
Judge Chen also cited “scientific literature in the record” that “provides a high level of certainty that a hazard is present” and demonstrates “fluoride is associated with reduced IQ.”
Judge Chen’s order comes weeks after the National Toxicology Program found a link between levels of fluoride of exposure and a reduced IQ in children. The Program found that exposing children to higher levels of fluoride, at around 1.5 milligrams per liter, is “consistently associated” with lower IQ in children.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/boris-johnson-medieval-lockdowns-didnt-work,Boris Johnson: “Medieval” Lockdowns Didn’t Work,By Raw Egg Nationalist,5 months ago,"Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he doubts lockdowns played a significant role in bringing the COVID-19 pandemic to an end.
In extracts released from his new memoir Unleashed, he describes the lockdowns as “literally medieval in their savagery and consequences,” and likened himself to King Canute attempting to “repel the waves of a highly contagious disease.”
He also says he believes the COVID-19 virus did originate in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than a wet market.
At the British government’s COVID inquiry last December, Johnson said there were “appalling harms on either side of the decision” to lock down the country, and he apologised for any mistakes he and his government made.
These new admissions, however, go much further and indicate a profound change of attitude. Johnson never indicated that he doubted the lockdowns were effective.
Initially, according to the extracts, Johnson said he believe the lockdowns were reducing the spread of the virus.
“It was only later that I started to look at the curves of the pandemic around the world—the double hump that seemed to rise and fall irrespective of the approaches taken by governments,” he writes.
“There were always two waves, whether you were in China, where lockdowns were ruthlessly enforced, or in Sweden, where they took a more voluntary approach.”
He continues: “I am not saying that lockdowns achieved nothing; I am sure they had some effect. But were they decisive in beating back the ­disease, turning that wave down? All I can say is that I am no longer sure.”
Johnson goes on to say that the lockdowns showed Britain had “barely progressed” from the Elizabethan era, four hundred years ago, when theatres were closed and the number of mourners at funerals were limited to stop the spread of pestilence.
Three national lockdowns took place in Britain, from March 2020 to June 2020, from November 2020 to December 2020 and from January 2021 to May 2021.
Boris Johnson was forced to resign in 2022, after a series of scandals including so-called “Partygate,” when it was revealed the members of the government did not abide by the social-distancing restrictions imposed on the country.
Allies of Mr Johnson, such as Michael Gove, have suggested the lockdowns went totally against the former prime ministers “worldview.”
Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and MP, said that Johnson had been “basically bullied” by government scientists.
“Boris realises in hindsight that we had been led down the garden path by the scientists,” he said.
“I wrote that this was a mistake—we should have only looked after the most vulnerable.
“His advisors poo-pooed that. The reality is he should have looked at other sources.”",0

https://www.infowars.com/posts/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-increased-post-covid-shot-rollout-study,Sudden ‘Unexpected’ Infant Death Increased Post-Covid Shot Rollout — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A study published Thursday documented how sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) increased slightly during the Covid pandemic of 2020, after which a massive increase was documented following the Covid exotic technology injection rollout in 2021.
“In this cross-sectional study of 14,308 SUID cases, the risk of SUID and SIDS increased during the intrapandemic period (March 2020 to December 2021) compared with the prepandemic period (March 2018 to December 2019), with the greatest increases noted in 2021 (9% for SUID and 10% for SIDS). A marked statistically significant monthly increase in SUID from June to December 2021 was observed,” the study said in the ‘Findings’ section.
While there was an uptick in infant deaths beginning in July 2020, between June 2021 and December 2021 there was a massive increase of up to 14 percent. Notably, the lethal Covid injections generally rolled out around the start of 2021.
“Monthly assessments revealed an increased risk of SUID beyond the prepandemic baseline starting in July 2020, with a pronounced epidemiologic shift from June to December 2021 (ranging from 10% to 14%),” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
The researchers defined these deadly syndromes as umbrella terms for dead babies. It should also be noted that there is now ‘post Covid vaccine syndrome‘.
“Sudden unexpected infant death is an umbrella term used to describe the sudden death of an infant younger than 1 year for whom the cause of death is not apparent prior to investigation. Deaths from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which occur during sleep and remain unexplained after a thorough postmortem investigation, comprise more than one-third of SUID cases,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section.
Ironically, the researchers bypassed the elephant in the room and claimed that the cause of the 2021 increase came down to ‘altered infectious disease transmission’.
“These findings suggest that the pronounced shift in SUID epidemiology during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with altered infectious disease transmission at the time,” the study said in the ‘Meaning’ section.
The researchers even included the Covid injections in their analysis, but attributed any association with it to death by the vaccine’s justification of holding public activities, not the vaccine’s side effects.
“As COVID-19 vaccines became available in 2021, pandemic precautions were lifted across the US, with schools and workplaces reopening and social gatherings resuming. As a result, the second year of the pandemic saw resurgences of seasonal respiratory viruses at unexpected times and with increased severity,” the study said in the ‘Discussion’ section.
They did however mention an interest in looking at the baby death syndrome following RSV vaccination, as a causal link may be discovered, alluding to the glaring truth.
“It may be particularly interesting to evaluate SUID rates following the rollout of several new RSV countermeasures, including maternal RSV vaccination and infant nirsevimab administration. Data such as ours may help theorize plausible causal pathways and potential mitigable risk factors to further reduce the risk of SUID,” the study said in the ‘Conclusions’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/number-of-homeless-people-in-america-to-reach-all-time-high-in-2024-due-to-surge-in-illegal-immigration,Number of Homeless People in America to Reach All-Time High in 2024 Due to Surge in Illegal Immigration,By Laura Harris | Natural News,5 months ago,"Data from the Wall Street Journal has revealed that the number of homeless individuals in the United States is set to reach an all-time high this 2024, with a major contributing factor being the surge in illegal immigration.
The data was collected from more than 250 homeless service organizations spanning dozens of cities, metropolitan areas and rural regions nationwide. The numbers were based on counts conducted during a single night in January and reflect the situation at that moment.
According to the WSJ, early numbers show that there are more than 550,000 homeless individuals as of January 2024. This marks a 10 percent rise from the same period in 2023 – the highest number since the government began collecting comparable data in 2007. (Related: Homeless encampments make Los Angeles look like a Third World country.)
The WSJ links the growing homeless population directly to the influx of illegal immigrants, many of whom have successfully claimed asylum – and thus protected from deportation – and bused to major cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston and Denver.
Cities that have seen a rise in migrants have also seen public safety concerns grow, as the influx of migrants leads to authorities stretching their resources and letting crime and gang activity escalate.
For instance, in Massachusetts, homeless numbers more than doubled, rising from about 4,430 in 2023 to nearly 12,100, with migrants making up a significant portion of the population housed in hotels and motels. The state expects to spend more than $1 billion on housing migrants this fiscal year, which, in turn, strained local government budgets.
Similar trends have been seen in Chicago, where the homeless population tripled to 18,800, with more than 70 percent being migrants brought into the city from Texas. Meanwhile, Denver has seen its homeless population spike by 42 percent, with reports of migrant gangs exacerbating their struggles. Boston, San Francisco and Seattle have also reported substantial increases in homelessness due to a surge in migrants seeking shelters.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which collects homeless data every year, expects that 2024 is set to surpass the unprecedented homeless count of 653,000 in 2023 – the highest figure since the government began tracking homelessness in 2007.
Aside from illegal immigration, the WSJ also cited other factors contributing to the growing homeless crisis. These factors include rising fentanyl addiction, skyrocketing housing costs and the expiration of pandemic-era financial assistance programs, which left many families without a safety net.
“It’s deeply unfortunate, but it’s not surprising,” said Diane Yentel, the chief executive at the nonprofit National Low Income Housing Coalition, on the latest homeless increase.
“The rising cost of housing, coupled with escalating expenses like insurance and taxes, is causing more people to experience homelessness. The American Dream, once attainable, is slipping further out of reach,” said Professor Stephanie Southworth of Coastal Carolina University.
Southworth further stressed that the lack of affordable housing intertwines with limited access to healthcare, a shortage of living-wage jobs and insufficient public transportation. They also addressed the criminalization of homelessness, exposing how minor offenses, such as sleeping in public spaces, are used to push homeless individuals out of sight.

Entitled “True or False? The Science of Perception, Misinformation, and Disinformation,” the APA children’s book exists to “pre-bunk” the next generation from believing “conspiracy theories” about things like vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and government oppression as a response to a “pandemic.”
“This book explores how we think and perceive and why false beliefs, superstitions, opinions, misinformation, or wild guesses can just stick around and mess things up,” the book states.
“You’ll see how misunderstandings and misuse of scientific findings can lead people to the wrong conclusions. Readers learn how to outsmart their brain to gain critical thinking skills and find ways to identify and correct false beliefs and disinformation.”
(Related: Did you know that many state-employed psychological experts are distancing themselves from the APA and other corrupt medical associations due to the behavioral manipulation they pushed during Covid?)
It is an undeniable fact that the human brain is the most advanced “supercomputer” in the universe. Science can barely explain how it works despite thousands of years’ worth of inquiry into determining how it works.
The APA recognizes that the human brain is an advanced wonder, however it argues that the human brain has problems that could cause some people to believe things that the establishment does not want them to believe.
“Our big brains are super-efficient but glitchy,” the book’s text states.
“Scientists estimate that 90% of what we see, hear, smell, or sense never really sinks in. Instead, we pick up on the big things, general impressions, or important stuff and end up leaving our brains to fill in the missing info. And on top of that, people sometimes twist information on purpose. False beliefs can be shared from person to person or go viral in a flash, often by people who think the info is true.”
According to the APA, two-time failed presidential wannabe Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election not because she is a creep that nobody likes, but because of “disinformation.” Trump, in other words, did not legitimately win the election, the APA insists.
Children can still generally trust books, newspapers and certain “trusted news shows” because those are easily controlled by the powers that be (TPTB). Children should avoid the internet, however, because the APA says there is no “gatekeeping mechanism” in place to ensure that all information found there is “true.”
“It doesn’t have a way to fact-check information for accuracy before it is made available to the public,” the APA further insists about the internet. “This means a lot of what you read or see online or on social media might not be reliable. Or exactly true. And some people can take advantage of that to spread disinformation.”
One of the top dogs behind this APA brainwashing campaign aimed at children is Jacqueline B. Toner, a retired clinical psychologist based out of Maryland.
“This is the sub-species of human (loosely defined) that aspires to be the Gods of the Brave New World,” argues Ben Bartee of Armageddon Prose about Toner and her ilk.
“Since the American Psychological Association resorted to the use of drugging millions of kids for the purpose of controlling them, their credibility is zilch,” added one of Bartee’s readers to the conversation.
“Their tactics continue to resemble what the Soviets did to homosexuals, outcasts, dissidents, political prisoners etc. It’s unlikely that all of those drugged kids who are now adults will forget any time soon.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/21-states-threaten-top-medical-group-with-legal-action-for-claiming-puberty-blockers-are-reversible,21 States Threaten Top Medical Group with Legal Action for Claiming Puberty Blockers are ‘Reversible’,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,5 months ago,"BOISE (LifeSiteNews) — More than 20 state attorneys general are banding together to warn the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that it could face legal action if it continues to promote surgical and chemical “transitioning” of gender-confused minors, Idaho’s top law enforcement official Raul Labrador announced Tuesday.
As previously covered by LifeSiteNews, the AAP sides firmly with LGBT activists on how to approach children suffering from gender dysphoria, endorsing the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgical transformation of developing bodies, going so far as to accuse states that deny minors so-called “gender-affirming care” of “state-sanctioned medical neglect and emotional abuse.”
AAP’s position is based on “evidence free standards,” the Idaho Attorney General’s Office contends, the “most concerning” of which is its claim that the “use of puberty blockers on children is safe and reversible. This assertion is not grounded in evidence and therefore may run afoul of consumer protection laws in most states.”
“When used to suppress hormones below normal ranges during or before puberty, puberty blockers: (1) may interfere with neurocognitive development; (2) compromise bone density and may negatively affect metabolic health and weight; and (3) block normal pubertal experience and experimentation,” reads the coalition’s letter to outgoing AAP president Benjamin Hoffman and his incoming successor Susan Kressley. “And when puberty blocker use is followed directly by cross-sex hormone use, which is often the case, infertility and sterility is a known consequence, at least for those who began puberty blockers in early puberty.”
“Telling parents and children that puberty blockers are ‘reversible’ at the very least conveys assurance that no permanent harm or change will occur. But that claim cannot be made in the face of the unstudied and ‘novel’ use of puberty blockers” for gender dysphoria, it continues. “It is even less defensible now that the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and its standards of care—the AAP’s apparent cornerstone source—have been exposed as unreliable and influenced by improper pressures,” referring to revelations earlier this year that Biden administration officials pressured WPATH to remove age limits.
The attorneys general of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia, as well as the Arizona Legislature, went on to threaten legal consequences for AAP if it does not reverse course.
“Idaho law, for example, prohibits ‘[e]ngaging in any act or practice that is otherwise misleading, false, or deceptive to the consumer,’” the letter says. “Most other states likewise prohibit making statements to consumers that are false, misleading, or deceptive. Each of us takes our responsibility to protect consumers in our states very seriously.”
The AAP has until October 18 to answer a series of information requests about its decision-making process on the subject.
“It is shameful the most basic tenet of medicine – do no harm – has been abandoned by professional associations when politically pressured,” Labrador said. “These organizations are sacrificing the health and well-being of children with medically unproven [procedures] that leave a wake of permanent damage […] Parents should be able to trust that a doctor’s medical guidance isn’t just the latest talking point from a dangerous and discredited activist agenda.”
A significant body of evidence shows that “affirming” gender confusion carries serious harms, especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity, and life experience to consider the long-term ramifications of the decisions being pushed on them, or full knowledge about the long-term effects of life-altering, physically-transformative, and often-irreversible surgical and chemical procedures.
Studies find that more than 80% of children suffering gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence and that “transition” procedures, including “reassignment” surgery, fail to resolve gender-confused individuals’ heightened tendency to engage in self-harm and suicide – and even exacerbate it, including by reinforcing their confusion and neglecting the actual root causes of their mental strife.
Many oft-ignored “detransitioners,” individuals who attempted to live under a different “gender identity” before embracing their sex, attest to the physical and mental harm of reinforcing gender confusion, as well as to the bias and negligence of the medical establishment on the subject, many of whom take an activist approach to their profession and begin cases with a predetermined conclusion in favor of “transitioning.”
“Gender-affirming” physicians have also been caught on video admitting to more old-fashioned motives for such procedures, as with an 2022 exposé about Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Clinic for Transgender Health, where Dr. Shayne Sebold Taylor said outright that “these surgeries make a lot of money.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-approves-gmo-wheat-grown-with-neurotoxic-herbicide,US Approves GMO Wheat Grown with Neurotoxic Herbicide,By Sustainable Pulse | The Defender,5 months ago,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved the cultivation of genetically modified (GM) wheat. It is yet another confirmation of how a very small group of powerful people get to decide the food, health and suffering of large sectors of the population.
The world’s first GM wheat, from the Argentinean company Bioceres and the multinational Florimond Desprez (France), is grown with the dangerous agrotoxin glufosinate ammonium (banned in the European Union).
Below is a review of the lies and violation of rights associated with GMOs.
HB4 GM wheat is an unprecedented step in the advance of agribusiness over the rights of populations. Bread, a food that is as ancient as it is central to people’s lives, is being transformed into a product with health risks.
The media partners of agribusiness reported the news from the U.S. They even described it as a “milestone” for national agriculture. Only 24 hours later, the company Bioceres issued its position on X (formerly Twitter):
“The HB4 wheat crop has reached the US. HB4 technology is the only drought-tolerant technology in the world, and this new approval shows that Argentine science continues to lead the way in finding solutions to major global challenges.”
However, Infobae, based on information from Reuters, points out:
“According to the industry group US Wheat Associates, before drought-tolerant HB4 wheat can be marketed in the United States, additional measures, including field trials, are still needed. ‘It will take years for Bioceres to complete the additional steps,’ the organisation said.”
The world’s first GM wheat is a big step for agribusiness and a step backwards for the world’s population.
For the moment, “only” the population of Argentina is the guinea pig with which GM flour (consumed in such products as bread, pastries, noodles and empanadas) is being tested. The move to deregulation in the U.S. is a warning sign for other countries and markets where the grain is exported.
There are many reasons to reject (or at least question) GM wheat:
Of partners, accomplices and peoples
The advance of GMOs in Argentina began with Carlos Menem, president of Argentina from 1989 to 1999, and has been state policy with all subsequent governments. In the case of wheat, Mauricio Macri did not move forward with the approval of HB4.
It was the Peronist government of Alberto Fernández and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner who, via Julián Domínguez at the head of the Ministry of Agriculture, gave the final green light (May 2022).
Curiosities: Last February, the newspaper La Nación reported that the former president is a shareholder of Bioceres.
The same company whose founders include Gustavo Grobocopatel (“the king of soy”) and whose shareholder is the multimillionaire Hugo Sigman, who was presented during the pandemic as a quasi benefactor and producer of vaccines and did big business with the COVID-19 vaccine. At the same time, he is a promoter of extractivism (agribusiness and forestry).
Among peasant movements, family farmers, indigenous peoples, agroecological producers and socio-environmental organizations, there is no doubt that they do not need or want GM wheat.
The campaign “Not with our bread!” is very clear:
“GM wheat is not intended to solve the problem of hunger, but to favour the exports of the agro-industrial sector. We have already experienced this with GM soy: What has changed and how has it benefited the Argentine social fabric?”
Meanwhile, organizations in Latin America, Africa and Asia denounced the harmful effects of GM wheat. In a detailed 14-page document, social movements, peasants and indigenous peoples requested the intervention of United Nations (U.N.) special rapporteurs because of the risks to food, health and the environment posed by Bioceres’ GMO.
They confirmed that there are no independent studies confirming its harmlessness, denounced the dangerous herbicide glufosinate ammonium, and also pointed out that it is less productive than conventional wheat.
“No to GM wheat. Global alliance seeks UN intervention against the cultivation of GM wheat HB4,” is the title of the communiqué from the international organization GRAIN, which reports on the unusual — and irregular — way in which GM wheat has been approved in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay on the basis of supposed studies by the company that markets it and with confidential documentation.
At the same time, there are numerous examples of agroecological wheat cultivation, without GMOs or agrotoxins, with very good yields and profitability.
The history of agriculture is more than 10,000 years old. The agribusiness model, a child of the so-called “green revolution: (mid-20th century), is only 70 years old, a brief moment in the history of food production.
Time enough to show that these (claims about GM wheat’s benefits) are deceptions that the peoples of Latin America no longer accept.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/maine-warned-public-about-a-measles-case-but-didnt-mention-it-was-caused-by-the-vaccine,Maine Warned Public About a Measles Case — But Didn’t Mention it Was Caused by the Vaccine,"By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",5 months ago,"A case of measles in 2023, reported by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and mainstream media as being the state’s first case in four years, was vaccine-induced, according to documents released Tuesday by Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN).
Kim Mack Rosenberg, general counsel for Children’s Health Defense, told The Defender that measles “outbreaks” are a well-worn tactic of state and federal governmental agencies to churn up fears about people who choose not to vaccinate or who do so selectively.
“We have seen measles used this way over and over,” Mack Rosenberg said. “Here, the narrative backfired and Maine officials swept under the rug the fact that the child’s measles strain was vaccine-related.”
According to the Mayo Clinic, measles is a viral infection typically accompanied by a skin rash, fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes and tiny white spots on the inner cheek.
On May 5, 2023, Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services warned that the Maine CDC had been notified of a positive measles test — ostensibly the state’s first measles case since 2019.
The health department said the child “received a dose of measles vaccine” and that Maine CDC officials were “considering the child to be infectious out of an abundance of caution.”
The news was quickly picked up by mainstream news outlets such as CNN, which blamed low vaccination rates for recent measles outbreaks, and USA Today, which stressed that the best way to prevent measles is for children and babies as young as 12 months to get the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.
However, the child’s May 3, 2023, test results — which ICAN obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request — revealed that the measles strain was “consistent with vaccine strain” — meaning the vaccine caused the child’s rash symptoms.
Roughly 2% of people who get a measles vaccine develop a rash, according to a World Health Organization report. But the Maine CDC never went public about this information.
Nearly two weeks after the testing was done, the Maine CDC on May 16, 2023, announced that the child didn’t have an infectious strain of measles — but the announcement failed to state that the child’s rash was vaccine-related.
Why did the Maine CDC take so long to confirm the strain?
It’s inexcusable that Maine CDC officials took so long to determine the strain of measles, Mack Rosenberg said.
“Their fear is that such information would lead to more vaccine hesitancy,” she said. “However, obfuscating information in this way deprives the public of crucial information about vaccine safety and effectiveness.”
ICAN in a press release questioned why the Maine CDC raised the alarm and then took so long to confirm the specific strain.
Mack Rosenberg noted that mainstream news outlets “immediately” jumped on “the fearmongering bandwagon” before the strain type was identified.
“Yet when the true nature of this child’s exposure was revealed,” she said, ”ranks were closed to prevent the truth from getting out.”
Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., a senior research scientist at CHD, told The Defender it was “reckless fear-mongering” to identify one case of measles in a vaccinated child and then issue a press release saying that anyone who isn’t immunized against measles, or doesn’t know their immunization status, should get vaccinated.
“Fear-mongering is formulaic: danger, solution and vilify those who do not conform,” he said.
If it’s well executed and done in coordination with media, it may get people to do what you want — but at a cost, he said. “One of the greatest threats to our public health is that our public health institutions lack integrity.”
Reports of measles outbreaks continue
Reports of measles outbreaks have continued since May of 2023.
CBS News on Sept. 24 reported a newly confirmed case of an elementary student in Minneapolis, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the Twin Cities to over 50.
So far in 2024, there have been 262 reported cases of measles, according to the CDC.
In 2024, cases were reported in Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia.
From Jan. 1, 2020, to March 28, 2024, the CDC was notified of 338 confirmed measles cases. None of them resulted in death.
The Maine CDC on April 14 issued a health advisory regarding an “increase in global and domestic measles cases and outbreaks.” The advisory said that Maine has not seen any measles cases since 2019 and made no mention of the May 2023 case it initially reported.
Health risks from measles vaccine outweigh getting the disease
Although media reports sometimes blame the unvaccinated for recent outbreaks, Dr. Liz Mumper, a pediatrician, told The Defender in an earlier interview it doesn’t make sense to assume the unvaccinated are to blame.
She said cyclical outbreaks still occur even in populations with nearly 100% vaccination, such as college students.
The overwhelming majority of the approximately 130,000 measles deaths annually occur in countries in the global south that have weak health infrastructures, according to the World Health Organization. Those deaths, along with measles hospitalizations in the global north, are associated with vitamin A deficiency.
“Measles can be deadly if a child does not have access to safe water and medical care,” Mumper said. “In developed countries, fatalities from measles are very rare.”
Effective treatments include vitamin A in high doses and attention to hydration status, Mumper said.
Other pediatricians who spoke with The Defender said it’s likely better for a U.S. child to get a measles infection than to receive an MMR vaccine.
Dr. Michelle Perro, a pediatrician, said the idea of vaccinating children to protect them from getting measles isn’t completely without merit. “It is worth noting that training the immune system to recognize deleterious foreign pathogens has had public health success.”
However, the risks associated with the MMR vaccine — since it’s nearly impossible to get a single measles vaccine — outweigh getting measles “due to the rise in neurocognitive and other health challenges directly caused by the MMR vaccine” which contains toxic adjuvants, she said.
Dr. Paul Thomas, a retired pediatrician and author of “Vax Facts: What to Consider Before Vaccinating at All Ages & All Stages of Life,” agreed. He said the MMR vaccine is associated with many serious side effects including seizures, encephalopathy, death and autism.
Perro said children’s health took a big hit when Big Pharma and the American Medical Association over 100 years ago forced the public to transition from a natural health platform that included the use of health-promoting diets, herbal medicine and homeopathics to a drug-based system.
Measles can be challenging for children, Perro said, particularly when it’s accompanied by high fevers, diarrhea, uncomfortable rashes and potential negative sequelae such as pneumonia.
Parents must relearn how to manage common viral illnesses, she said. “Be clear, it is much easier to manage a febrile illness in a child than a chronic disease like autism or autoimmunity.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/cnn-runs-bizarre-headline-proving-the-unvaccinated-were-right-the-fully-jabbed-are-dying-from-covid,CNN Runs Bizarre Headline Proving The Unvaccinated Were Right: The Fully Jabbed Are ‘Dying From Covid’,By Ethan Huff | Natural News,5 months ago,"Fake news giant CNN is going through a metamorphosis regarding its position on Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines.” In the beginning, CNN pushed the notion that Covid jabs would save people’s lives, but now the network is admitting that the shots are killing people – oh, but that “doesn’t mean the vaccines are ineffective,” reads a recent CNN headline.
On Feb. 26, 2021, at the height of the “pandemic,” CNN covered a study out of the United Kingdom claiming that a single dose of Pfizer’s mRNA (modRNA) injection is enough to provide “strong protection for those who’ve had Covid-19.” A few months later, CNN claimed that people who got jabbed could safely go indoors without wearing a face mask.
A couple months after that, CNN ran the following headline counteracting its earlier story to the contrary:
“CDC updates guidance, recommends vaccinated people wear masks indoors in certain areas”
After that, CNN was informing its readers that if they listened to the earlier guidance about getting jabbed for protection, well, that protection does not exactly last like was initially claimed. According to CNN as of Dec. 23, 2021:
“Vaccine protection against Covid-19 wanes over time, especially for older people, CDC says”
(Related: Earlier this year, CNN published a piece calling for the government to restrict how much Americans are allowed to travel abroad: “carbon passports may be the answer.”)
Concerning the Johnson & Johnson injection, which differs from what Pfizer and Moderna offered, CNN told its readers and viewers who took it that the one-and-done format initially recommended by the manufacturer was no longer enough, as of Oct. 16, 2021: J&J jab recipients would now need a second dose as soon as possible.
After that, Tony Fauci came out to recommend a third dose of whatever Covid injection you want, assuming you only got two jabs. And CNN parroted Fauci’s recommendations as scientific fact.
Then, not long after that, CNN was pushing people to take a fourth dose of Covid shot, this time claiming that the CDC said to do this. In other words, if Fauci and / or the CDC say to do it, then CNN wants you to do it.
All of this culminated with an Oct. 19, 2021, article from CNN bearing the following bizarre headline:
“Why vaccinated people dying from Covid-19 doesn’t mean the vaccines are ineffective”
It is difficult to ascertain how CNN got away with pushing all this contradictory content all around the same time to its followers. Are CNN supporters schizophrenic just like the network’s editorial team apparently is?
Keep in mind that around the time CNN was publishing all these schizophrenic headlines, the federal government of the United States was busy changing the definition of terms like “vaccine” and “immunization” to fit the emerging narrative.
“They changed the scientific and medical definition of vaccine and immunization in late 2021,” someone wrote on X about this.
“MSM changes any definition to fit their narrative like the definition of a woman etc.,” wrote another.
Another person joked about what CNN is actually saying with all of its contradictory content about Covid jabs:
“It went from ‘safe and effective’ to ‘well, you’ll die, but you’ll go to heaven’ at warp speed.”
“Four of my family members died from the vaccine,” added another. “Autopsy showed strange, horrible blood clots throughout their bodies. They were all previously healthy and under 40.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/transgender-prisoners-in-tim-walzs-minnesota-could-get-free-surgeries-and-drugs-for-life,‘Transgender’ Prisoners in Tim Walz’s Minnesota Could Get Free Surgeries and Drugs for Life,By Matt Lamb | Lifesite,5 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Minnesota Governor and Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’ administration worked closely with an LGBT activist group to craft a new policy allowing gender-confused male inmates to be housed in a women’s prison.
Furthermore, the new policy opens the door for any gender-confused prisoner to have taxpayer-funded transgender drugs and surgeries – potentially forever, even after leaving prison. The changes came without any vote in the state legislature, any public hearings, or other opportunities for citizens to express their opposition.
READ: In Tim Walz’s Minnesota, ‘transgender’ male pedophiles are being sent to women’s prisons
Rather, “a constellation of interests was able to negotiate a deal behind closed doors,” according to Open the Books, a government watchdog.
The policy followed a lawsuit from a gender-confused man who goes by the name “Christina” and successfully obtained so-called “hormone therapy” and a transfer to a women’s prison.
The “deal” means that the Minnesota Department of Corrections will now follow the standards of the “World Professional Association for Transgender Health” (WPATH) – a transgender activist group – for gender-confused individuals.
This will happen even though it is impossible to change one’s sex and the group has come under scrutiny for ignoring evidence on the dangers of chemical and surgical procedures for gender-confused individuals.
The new deal came about when “Gender Justice” (which has a board member working as a manager for the state) sued Minnesota. The LGBT group was represented by law firm Robins Kaplan, which has donated nearly $25,000 to Walz’ re-election campaign several years ago.
Open the Books compared the deal to “sue and settle,” a strategy environmental activists used prominently during the Obama administration to extract concessions from sympathetic Environmental Protection Agency staffers without any oversight.
“The EPA would routinely settle claims from environmentalist nonprofits seeking stronger regulations,” Open the Books wrote in its article. “By making those deals in private, it cuts the taxpayer out of the conversation – including state governments and local business owners who have a stake in the outcome.”
The group provided further comments to LifeSiteNews.
“Taxpayers elect representatives and send them to legislatures for a reason – to approve a budget and pass laws that advance the public good,” spokesperson Christopher Neefus told LifeSiteNews via email.
Lawmaking “requires open debate” and should involve a “reasonable cost-benefit analysis” since tax dollars are at stake, Neefus said.
“These surgeries and [cross-sex hormones] are expensive and require lifelong [intervention], and now Minnesotans are meant to pay for them – potentially in perpetuity,” Neefus said. “After inmates are released, this settlement says the Department of Corrections – that is, state taxpayers – will cover ongoing out-of-pocket costs. Who signed up for that, exactly?”
The Department of Corrections told LifeSiteNews that agencies “have authority to create their own department policies” in a response to a question about policymaking without votes.
“Policy decisions by state agencies, like those concerning the management and placement of people who [identify as] transgender, are informed by litigation and a review of appellate cases around the country,” Director of Communications Shannon Loehrke told LifeSiteNews. “Questions about legislative actions should be directed to the legislature.”
The Supreme Court’s decision over the summer to reverse the Chevron doctrine means bureaucrats will be held more accountable in crafting regulations.
“Career bureaucrats are happy to expand their authority if they can manage to do it without having to pass a pesky new law,” Neefus, the Open the Books spokesman, told LifeSiteNews. “That’s true even if it incurs costs on businesses, stakeholders and taxpayers.”
He said “sue-and-settle” “skyrocketed during the Biden administration” after decreasing during the Trump administration.
“Nevertheless, freewheeling federal rulemaking will now be up for scrutiny by the courts,” Neefus said. “While the Gender Justice deal is a statewide matter, taxpayers should take a look at this controversy in DC and consider how they feel about aligned interests expanding their authority in private.”
The change in Minnesota policy comes despite mounting evidence of the dangers of transgender drugs and surgeries. The drugs have been linked to depression, suicide, bone density loss, and other problems. The surgeries can render someone permanently infertile and make it impossible for females to breastfeed in the future.
The deal fits in with Walz’s agenda as governor to push for LGBT interests, including signing a law that could allow state courts to seize temporary custody of a gender-confused child if a parent was not supportive of drugs and surgeries.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/breaking-fluoride-in-water-poses-unreasonable-risk-to-children-federal-judge-rules,"Breaking: Fluoride in Water Poses ‘Unreasonable Risk’ to Children, Federal Judge Rules",By Jamie White,5 months ago,"A federal judge ruled Tuesday that fluoride in the drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children.
In a massive vindication to Infowars sounding the alarm about the dangers of fluoride for decades, Judge Edward Chen of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California wrote in an 80-page landmark decision that the current “optimal” levels of water fluoridation exposure may damage human health.
Over 200 million Americans currently drink water treated with fluoride at the “optimal” level of 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L).
“In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote.
“EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.”
The ruling concludes a historic 7-year lawsuit brought against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by environmental and consumer advocacy organizations like the Fluoride Action Network, Moms Against Fluoridation and Food & Water Watch, along with individual parents and children.
Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), as amended by Congress in 2016, U.S. citizens can petition the EPA to evaluate whether a chemical presents an unreasonable risk to public health and should be regulated.
The ruling represents a devastating blow to the EPA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Dental Association (ADA), who for decades staked their reputations on the safety of water fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.
For over 70 years U.S. public health officials have pushed water fluoridation as a key strategy for maintaining and improving dental health.
Rick North, board member of Fluoride Action Network, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said, “What’s false is the CDC claiming that fluoridation is one of the 10 greatest health achievements of the 20th century. What’s true is that ending fluoridation will be one of the 10 greatest health achievements of the 21st century.”
In fact, these regulatory agencies ignored mounting compelling evidence showing fluoride’s neurotoxic risks, and even worked to suppress the research and discredit the scientists carrying it out.
The judge wrote, “One thing the EPA cannot do, however, in the face of this Court’s finding, is to ignore that risk,” adding they must take some sort of regulatory action.
“The judge did what EPA has long refused to do, and that is to apply the EPA standard risk assessment framework to fluoride,” said Michael Connett, attorney for the plaintiffs.
“In so doing, the court has shown that the widespread exposure to fluoride that we now have in the United States is unreasonably and precariously close to the levels that we know cause harm.”
Judge Chen also shot down the EPA’s argument that the exact level at which fluoride is hazardous is too unclear for the agency to determine whether the chemical presents an unreasonable risk, concluding it was “not persuasive.”
“Under even the most conservative estimates of this level, there is not enough of a margin between the accepted hazard level and the actual human exposure levels to find that fluoride is safe,” Chen wrote.
“Simply put, the risk to health at exposure levels in United States drinking water is sufficiently high to trigger regulatory response by the EPA under Amended TSCA,” he added.
Experts noted that the ruling means the EPA will have to go beyond simply ending water fluoridation.
“EPA will have to consider what to do in the southwestern parts of the country where the fluoride content of groundwater is too high due to minerals in the soil containing fluoride,” said Harvard environmental health professor Philippe Grandjean, M.D., Ph.D. “And then there is the question about ingestion of toothpaste.”
Once again, Infowars has demonstrated it’s years ahead of the curve and truly lives up to its motto, “Tomorrow’s News Today.”

In Part One of the Dr. Varma exposé, the “Mug Club Undercover” team released footage of the doctor admitting to locking down citizens and forcing them to get shots while secretly attending drug-fueled orgies and raves during the Covid pandemic.
Crowder confronted Dr. Varma about being caught in an undercover sting:
In the second video, the ex-government doctor described working for a pharmaceutical company to “spin” the narrative so consumers and investors believe the drug works despite the fact it has yet to receive FDA approval.
He also admitted the risk for Monkeypox in America is “very low” and is basically only an issue for “gay men” who “have tons and tons of sexual partners and often don’t use condoms,” making the disease spread “more easily.”
Louder With Crowder founder Steven Crowder posted to X Wednesday, noting, “SIGA Technologies stock is down 17% in the last month. This isn’t good for investors, and why Varma says SIGA needs media ‘spin’ to ‘keep up people’s belief that [TPOXX] works’ for Monkeypox ‘That’s why spinning it in the media is helpful.’ ‘You can spin them [TPOXX study results] so that people – won’t like, dump the stock thinking that the company is worthless.’”
Crowder later pointed out the pharmaceutical company’s largest client is the United States government.

We may reach out to you as we investigate how common this practice is.
“First of all, I don’t want this to be hidden from the world,” Alexis Lorenze, who is currently hospitalized in California with a severe reaction to multiple vaccines, told CHD.TV in an interview on Monday. “And second of all, I don’t want this to ever happen to anyone else ever again.”
For over a week, the 23-year-old has been suffering serious and possibly life-threatening side effects — including temporary blindness, swelling, bruising and sores over her entire body, and severe chest pain — after a hospital required her to receive three vaccines before giving her a blood transfusion to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).
Alexis was diagnosed in January with PNH, a rare autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to attack and damage the body’s red blood cells. She traveled from her home in Florida to a UCI Medical Center in Orange County for the treatment.
She said doctors there required her to get three shots — rather than the one shot she anticipated — before they would treat her.
Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccines, Alexis reported that she lost her vision, her jaw locked and she began vomiting. Other symptoms followed.
The Vaccine Safety Research Foundation sent an advocate, Angela Wulbrecht, a registered nurse, to help Alexis and her family negotiate the medical system. CHD.TV has been doing live interview updates with Alexis and Wulbrecht.
In the latest update, Wulbrecht told CHD.TV the last several days have been challenging as Alexis negotiates infection issues. Wulbrecht described Alexis’ health as “touch-and-go.”
She also said the hospital has experienced 10 bomb threats and has had to heighten security. “That has put the staff under a lot of stress and is not helpful,” Wulbrecht said. She said she didn’t know who was behind it, but that “it’s obviously not in our vaccine injury community.”
Wulbrecht said they are frustrated with some of the doctors who won’t concede that Alexis’ condition— which began 10 minutes post-vaccination — is a result of the vaccines, and instead blame her condition solely on the PNH.
It is frustrating, she said, because as Alexis’ story has circulated, doctors from “all over the world” have confirmed that “giving somebody who’s this immunocompromised, her condition was not stable at the time to do this to her was too much for her immune system.”
Several doctors told The Daily Mail that a patient with a serious autoimmune condition shouldn’t be given multiple vaccines at once, because it could lead to complications that a healthy person would not likely experience.
“It really hurts my heart,” Wulbrecht said, “because when you walk through this hospital everywhere, there are signs that say ‘discover, teach, and heal.’ That’s their motto. And they are not discovering, they’re not teaching.”
She said they should be trying to figure out what happened. Instead, both Alexis and Wulbrecht said it’s unclear which vaccines were administered.
Alexis said she was told by her doctor in Florida that she would need to get the meningitis vaccine before treatment, and that was her expectation.
However, when she got to the California hospital, she said she and her sister were told she actually needed three vaccines — meningitis (meningococcal), pneumonia (pneumococcal) and tetanus — and the specialist read the names to her and explained the vaccines. When they were administered the next day, her symptoms began immediately.
Wulbrecht told CHD.TV that she checked Alexis’ medical records and they instead list meningococcal A, meningococcal B and haemophilus B (tetanus toxoid conjugate) as the vaccines administered.
They have been unable to get clarity on the situation and the provider that administered the vaccines has “completely disappeared,” she said.
Alexis told CHD.TV she wants her story to be a warning to people that they need to research and understand what doctors are proposing to put in their bodies, rather than simply trusting them.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/sanitation-nutrition-caused-decline-in-disease-rates-not-vaccines,"Sanitation & Nutrition Caused Decline in Disease Rates, Not Vaccines",By S.D. Wells | Natural News,5 months ago,"Nearly all pro-vaccination humans have one thing in common: They believe that the relative diseases and virus rates of infection for each vaccination significantly dropped after mass vaccination began, along with the chance of death from infectious diseases, and that vaccines have saved humanity from the worst infections on earth; however, they have all been duped.
Real data and statistics, that the CDC, WHO, FDA and the Vaccine Industrial Complex do not want anyone to see, have been published and reveal that all the major infectious disease mortality rates were greatly diminishing and on a consistent downward trend BEFORE those vaccines were invented and mass administered.
Several whistleblowers then and now have proof, but a few billion vaccine zealots still won’t be able to wrap their jabbed heads around it. This requires careful consideration and a total rethinking of everything we know about vaccine efficacy, infectious disease rates, and the entire concept of the so-called “holy grail” of medicine.
Take a good look at the graphs of these documented mortality rates in England and Wales from 1838 to 1978, well into the years that these ever-popular vaccinations were invented and mass administered to the populace. We see now, in plain sight, the mass illusion that was perpetrated on the public that vaccines were the saving grace for humankind, and saved billions of injected people from dying from the world’s scariest infectious diseases.
In fact, vaccines and their efficacy were so overblown, that Big Pharma and governments around the world had to make them compulsory so the majority of the populace would comply. In other words, the brainwashing propaganda and faked science wasn’t enough to convince them all.
The graphs even look similar for infectious diseases where there never was a vaccine created. That’s even more “proof in the pudding” that vaccines aren’t helping decrease mortality rates much, if any at all. It was really all about improvements in hygiene, plumbing, sanitation, use of clean water, and hospitals and doctors learning how to disinfect everything, including surgical instruments.
Every human being on earth should be questioning the contribution of vaccinations to the decline of mortality in the world. We already know that nearly all prescription medications only “manage” the symptoms of disease and disorder, rather than address the root cause and actually cure the illnesses. Plus, prescription medications create a host of side effects and adverse events that bring with them new health horrors, only to be addressed with MORE crooked medicine. It’s a vicious cycle and a cash cow for Big Pharma, just like with vaccines.
Pro-vaccine zealots love to scream “science!” when referring to why they believe so wholeheartedly in vaccination, but they should all take a look at the statistics of mortality from that science, based on infectious diseases and the relative vaccines that are supposed to prevent infection, prevent transmission, prevent death. It’s all been a huge farce.
Folks need to look at what really contributed to the decline of mortality over the past century and a half, and they will see it’s really about the rising standards of living. Vaccines may have contributed to this decline of mortality, but only in a miniscule amount compared to the propaganda and disinformation that’s been spread about them, around the globe, for decades. This now includes all the LIES about the safety and efficacy of the Covid mRNA clot shots.

Vyacheslav Vologyin, the chairman of the State Duma, announced that the representatives are currently examining a draft law which would ban “abortion” propaganda on the Internet, in movies, in advertising, and in the media.
According to Hungarian outlet Mandiner, Putin, who used to refer to Russia as a “bastion of traditional values” fighting a vital battle against the decadent West, is encouraging women to have at least three children, saying it will help secure the nation’s future. Currently, Russia’s birth rate, which stands at 1.49, is higher than the EU average of 1.46, but both are far from the replacement level of 2.0.

Francis warns Europe’s demographic collapse means ‘ugly future’ aheadMany conservatives are at odds with Pope Francis, but his statements on… pic.twitter.com/C2HGlPnZnc
Russia’s birth rate has fallen to its lowest level in a quarter of a century, while the death rate has risen as the country is at war with Ukraine, according to official data.
Vologyin accused the phenomenon referred to by the authorities as a “childless ideology” of devaluing the institution of the family and discouraging women from having children. Many Western publications are known for promoting a childless lifestyle, with Russian lawmakers worried this trend is now prevalent in Russia.

“Groups in social networks often disrespect motherhood and fatherhood, and show aggression towards pregnant women, children and large families,” said Vologyin.
According to Vologyin, under the proposed bill, those found guilty of spreading “child-free propaganda” could be fined up to 400,000 rubles ($4,300). For government officials, the fine can be as high as 800,000 rubles ($8,602), and for companies, the fine can be up to 5 million rubles ($53,763).

https://www.infowars.com/posts/proposed-new-jersey-legislation-would-censor-penalize-doctors-for-disseminating-misinformation,Proposed New Jersey Legislation Would Censor & Penalize Doctors for ‘Disseminating Misinformation’,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A piece of legislation introduced in New Jersey seeks to censor and penalize doctors who ‘disseminate misinformation’. If passed, healthcare workers who ‘disseminate misinformation’ can face professional misconduct charges from occupational licensing boards, with the nature of the punishments being determined by said boards.
The bill defines ‘misinformation’ as something that is ‘contradicted by contemporary scientific consensus’. It should be noted that, according to the ‘contemporary scientific consensus’, Dr. Tony Fauci IS the science.
“This bill establishes the act of disseminating misinformation or disinformation by a health care professional as an act of professional misconduct subject to disciplinary action. It is the sponsor’s intent that this legislation will help combat health misinformation and curb the spread of falsehoods that threaten the health and safety of New Jersey residents,” the bill said. “The bill defines ‘disseminate’ to mean the conveyance of information, in the form of treatment or advice, from a health care professional to a patient under the health care professional’s care. ‘Misinformation’ means any health-related claim of fact that is false and contradicted by contemporary scientific consensus contrary to the standard of care. ‘Disinformation’ means misinformation that is deliberately disseminated with malicious intent or an intent to mislead.”
The bill was called a ‘grave danger to medical freedom‘ by the McCullough Foundation on Tuesday.
“The bill is meant to combat rising misinformation in the health care space following the pandemic, said bill sponsor Assemblyman Herb Conaway (D-Burlington),” the New Jersey Monitor said Monday.
One critic pointed out that under the bill, ‘independence in women’ would be seen as a psychological disorder if the bill were to have been enacted in 1860, showing that the ‘consensus’ in medicine is continually changing and therefor should not be legislated into a legal requirement.
“Renee Kohanski, a Somerset County psychiatrist representing the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a conservative nonprofit that backed hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, pointed to beliefs in bygone eras that included pathologizing independence in women, noting the case of Elizabeth Packard, whose husband wrongly committed her to an insane asylum in 1860,” the New Jersey Monitor said Monday.
Undoubtedly the law targets those who do not wish to take vaccines.
“A range of anti-vaccine activists opposed the bill before the committee, alleging it would stifle doctors’ ability to treat patients,” the New Jersey Monitor said Monday.
The one-size-fits-all approach to medicine, decreed by the United Nation’s (U.N.) World Health Organization (WHO), then passed down to the national-level agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), then adopted by state agencies and finally medical facilities is likely the only protocols doctors can verbally promote under this legislation.
While treating every human on Earth’s health with a single set of protocols sounds globalistic in nature, the WHO goes a step further with their ‘One Health‘ agenda that ‘balances and optimizes’ the health of people, animals and ecosystems. In other words, everyone on earth will have animals and ecosystems considered in their health decisions, leading to the risk of overpopulation being factored into healthcare decisions.
California had passed a similar law, which it then repealed in 2023.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/parents-now-allowed-to-give-kids-nasal-flu-vaccine-at-home-despite-vaccines-link-to-severe-reactions,"Parents Now Allowed to Give Kids Nasal Flu Vaccine at Home, Despite Vaccine’s Link to Severe Reactions","By Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. | The Defender",5 months ago,"Parents can now give their children ages 2 and up — at home — a nasal flu vaccine that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew in 2016 because it was ineffective, and which has been associated with reports of children’s deaths, according to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
AstraZeneca’s FluMist vaccine won FDA approval late last week for at-home administration, making it the first “take-out” flu vaccine that doesn’t need to be administered by a healthcare provider.
According to MedPageToday, the FDA approved FluMist for self- or caregiver-administration, for people ages 2-49, with a doctor’s prescription. A usability study determined people ages 18 and over could either self-administer the vaccine or administer it to eligible people using the instructions provided.
The vaccine, which is sprayed into the nose, targets influenza virus subtypes A and B, MedPageToday said.
FluMist was first approved in 2003 but previously was allowed to be administered only in medical and pharmacy settings.
In a statement, Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said FluMist “provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families.”
Live attenuated vaccines pose risk to children, pregnant women
According to the FDA, “FluMist contains a weakened form of live influenza virus strains.”
Brian Hooker, Ph.D., chief scientific officer for Children’s Health Defense, told The Defender he “can’t think of anything good that could come of an at-home administered live virus vaccine.” He added:
“Live virus vaccines shed with consequences, especially to pregnant women and infants where this vaccine is contraindicated.
“Flu shots in general lead to myriad adverse events, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, and have led to a 4.8-fold increased incidence in non-influenza acute respiratory infections in children under age 5. It is also clear that most years, the flu shot provides minimal protection against the flu. The risks far outweigh any benefits here.”
Dr. Peter McCullough confirmed concerns about shedding, citing a 2022 study that demonstrated shedding of live attenuated influenza vaccines.
Dr. Michelle Perro, a pediatrician, told The Defender that live attenuated virus vaccines pose “the theoretical risk of contracting the disease, especially in individuals that are immunocompromised.”
Dr. Meryl Nass, an internist, called out the nasal vaccine’s efficacy. She said FluMist was taken off the market for several years “because it was found to be ineffective — how do they know it is effective now?”
According to the FDA’s statement, FluMist was initially approved by the FDA in 2003 for people ages 5-49. In 2007, the agency approved FluMist for children ages 2-5.
However, in 2018, NBC News reported that FluMist was pulled off the U.S. market in 2016 “because it barely worked against one common strain of flu in kids.” The FDA did not mention the 2016 withdrawal in its Sept. 20 statement approving the vaccine for self- or caregiver administration.
In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices “voted 12-2 to add FluMist back to the mix of flu vaccines that doctors and clinics can use,” NBC News reported at the time.
Two panel members said they were worried about “hurting children and further undermining the public’s perception of the safety of flu vaccines if FluMist comes back on the market and does not work well,” NBC News added.
48 deaths, 943 serious adverse events connected to FluMist
According to VAERS data, a total of 11,065 adverse events have been reported in connection with FluMist products — including 943 that were classified as “serious.” About half of the reports were for children under 17 years old.
VAERS data show 48 reports of adverse events resulted in death — including 23 deaths in children under 17, with an additional 13 deaths listed with an “unknown” age.
A 2010 Harvard study found that less than 1% of all adverse events are reported to VAERS.
McCullough said FluMist has had a troubled history, especially when it comes to kids. “FluMist has been an unpopular vaccine since 2003. Children under age 2 have an increased risk of hospitalization after they take it. The package insert says that caution should be exercised in asthmatics and anyone with wheezing.”
Perro said some of FluMist’s ingredients may pose a risk:
“Its formulation contains MSG [monosodium glutamate], which is often produced from genetically engineered yeast, not to mention [it] may have neuroexcitatory properties for some children at risk.
“The porcine gelatin likely will contain glyphosate, and the sucrose will be derived from HFCS [high fructose corn syrup]. The antibiotic gentamicin can be allergenic and toxic to our microbiota. EDTA [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid] is a metal binder which can bind beneficial minerals as well.”
According to the FDA, “The most commonly reported side effects of FluMist are fever over 100°F in children 2 through 6 years of age, runny nose and nasal congestion in individuals 2 through 49 years of age and a sore throat in adults 18 through 49 years of age.”
But Perro pointed out that FluMist’s website states that clinical trials showed “the risks of hospitalization and wheezing were increased in children <24 months of age who received trivalent FluMist” and that “Children <5 years of age with recurrent wheezing and persons of any age with asthma may be at increased risk of wheezing” following administration of FluMist.
FluMist also “has not been studied in persons with severe asthma or active wheezing,” FluMist’s website states.
“Considering the fact that as many as 1 in 5 U.S. children may already be diagnosed with asthma, the potential risks of an exacerbation of asthma as well as the development of the new-onset of asthma are significant,” Perro said.
Nass questioned why FluMist is not approved for adults over the age of 49.
“Is it effective for older people or is it not effective enough? Is it unsafe for older people? Since the target group for influenza vaccine is over 65, why is this vaccine being licensed at all?” Nass asked.
AstraZeneca’s safety record called into question
Some of those interviewed by The Defender questioned AstraZeneca’s safety record.
“AstraZeneca has a horrible track record, considering that its COVID-19 vaccine offering (based on a chimpanzee adenovirus) led to so many serious adverse events that it was taken off the market voluntarily by the manufacturer,” Hooker said.
“We would be remiss if we didn’t discuss the merger of AstraZeneca with Novartis to create a new company, Syngenta,” Perro said. “They were the company that harassed UC Berkeley professor, Dr. Tyrone Hayes, who exposed the endocrine-disrupting toxic effects of their pesticide, atrazine,” Perro said.
“Is this the company we should trust to create a ‘take-out’ vaccine to administer at home?” Perro asked.
AstraZeneca is facing a class-action lawsuit in the U.K. filed by people injured by the company’s COVID-19 vaccine and by claimants acting on behalf of a loved one who allegedly died from vaccine-induced blood-clotting issues.
Perro said parents should consider alternatives for protecting their children from the flu:
“Children fare very well clinically when dealing with a flu illness which stems from my care of thousands of children with the flu. Parents will have difficulty finding information on how to care for their children when exposed due to scrubbing of the internet and inundating search engines with pro-flu vaccine messaging.
“For example, there are nasal sprays that can be used when children are exposed to the flu which can minimize their risks, as well as diet/supplements which can boost immunity such as vitamins C and D. This type of public health education is nearly nonexistent in a Pharma-driven narrative.”
“Because each child has far less than 1% chance of contracting influenza in any given year, it is more appropriate to be ready to treat this rare infection rather than be bothered by FluMist or any other influenza vaccine,” McCullough said.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/could-bird-flu-be-the-october-surprise,Could Bird Flu Be the October Surprise?,"By Clayton J. Baker, MD | Brownstone Institute",5 months ago,"Bird flu was the hot topic in pandemic fear-mongering until very recently. Just a few months ago, former CDC director Robert Redfield publicly described Bird flu (also known as H5N1 Influenza A or Avian Influenza virus) as the likely next pandemic – predicting a laboratory-leaked virus as the cause. Meanwhile, Deborah Birx, aka the “Scarf Lady” of Covid infamy, was making the TV news, promoting an unrealistic and excessive program of testing farm animals and humans for Bird flu.
At present, bird flu seems to have been put on the back burner by the authorities. Monkeypox has since taken center stage, with the World Health Organization declaring a state of emergency over that virus. Furthermore, the “experts” have trotted out numerous other viruses with which to terrify the public. Examples include West Nile virus – who no less than Anthony Fauci himself supposedly contracted – and even the exotic “Sloth virus” (also known as Oropouche virus).
The first step in dealing with these continual reports of horrific pathogens is recognizing the vital importance of living in knowledge rather than in fear. “Fear porn” is a real psychological weapon and one that is being used against us on a daily basis. As we painfully learned during Covid, a terrified population is easily manipulated, controlled, and exploited. As free citizens, we must remain mindful and knowledgeable, rather than fearful, about the flood of information and propaganda that is hurled at us.
Regarding bird flu, we should remain mindful of the following. In its current iteration, bird flu has caused no widespread human illness, no human deaths, and sporadic outbreaks in farm animal populations. However, there is much evidence that bird flu could be used as a bioweapon. Furthermore, it could also be applied to disrupt the November 5 US Presidential election.
Here are 3 reasons why bird flu may still be weaponized to alter the election:
In the bigger picture, a number of viruses could potentially be employed as an “October Surprise” to disrupt the election. Bird flu appears to be a leading candidate (pun intended), but it is not the only one.
We, as citizens, must remain vigilant to this threat to our electoral process. We should contact our local and state officials now, before anything is attempted, and express our absolute insistence on fair, legal, and regular elections. We should share this information widely with others so that all are aware of what might be attempted. Over the longer term, we must work to end Gain-of-Function research.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/new-us-policy-unleashes-unchecked-bio-labs-paving-way-for-the-next-lab-created-pandemic-mccullough-foundation-says,"New US Policy Unleashes Unchecked Bio-Labs, Paving Way for the Next Lab-Created Pandemic — McCullough Foundation says",By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"Dr. Peter McCullough’s foundation has recently sounded the alarm over a new U.S. policy which will result in biological laboratories with very little oversight being able to operate with the U.S., a similar phenomenon as was seen in the Wuhan Lab in China which released Covid.
The policy, ‘United States Government Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential’ was published in May and outlines protocols and requirement changes in the relationship between biological laboratories and the U.S. regulators over such labs. Overall the policy which focuses on ‘oversight’ weakens the oversight, according to McCullough.
The McCullough Foundation pointed out that much of the funding of these dangerous pathogens comes from the private sector, so reporting, and thus decent oversight, will be optional.
“For labs funded by foundations such as Gates, Wellcome Trust, Rockefeller and many more, government funding is not a risk, so reporting becomes optional,” the McCullough Foundation said in a social media post on Sunday.
Dangerous pathogens such as Covid could be developed in order to develop countermeasures to it. There is great irony in a lab developing a cure to a disease that only that lab has. It is a textbook case of problem, reaction, solution.
“It describes the development of ‘pathogens with enhanced pandemic potential’ as a goal of covered research. For example, SARS-CoV-2 could have been dually developed as a biological threat to populations but also the development of counter-measures including monoclonal antibodies and vaccines which would be considered benefits to the world,” the McCullough Foundation said in a social media post on Sunday.
Alarmingly, this policy will allow for a possible release of a yet-known ‘Disease X‘ pandemic pathogen, according to The McCullough Foundation.
“As a result, we can expect the next Disease X pandemic(s) to have laboratory origins supported by this policy,” the McCullough Foundation said in a social media post on Sunday.
Dr. McCullough himself commented on the policy on his Substack.
“…a 31 page document that outlines an oversight plan for the development of biological threats (viruses, bacteria, fungi, toxins) that can be of dual use to humanity—for benefit or harm. The paragraphs of this guidance reads like a dream for National Institutes of Health (NIAID, BARDA) and Department of Defense (DARPA) funded laboratories,” McCullough said on his Substack on Sunday. “There is very little reporting required, no comprehensive inventories, and recommended but not required bio-security (hoods, reverse ventilation, protection of workers, etc): ‘In such cases, agents affecting humans that are recommended to be handled at Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) or Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) per the BMBL guidance are subject to this Policy.’ No mandate or audits are mentioned.”",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/sunlight-clouds-not-greenhouse-gasses-are-responsible-for-climate-change-study,"Sunlight & Clouds, Not Greenhouse Gasses, are Responsible for Climate Change — Study",By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A study published in August documented how real climate change is caused by the sunlight and clouds, not greenhouse gasses nor people having cars and air conditioning like former President Barack Obama has insinuated.
“Our analysis revealed that the observed decrease of planetary albedo along with reported variations of the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) explain 100% of the global warming trend and 83% of the Global Surface Air Temperature (GSAT) interannual variability as documented by six satellite- and ground-based monitoring systems over the past 24 years,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “Changes in Earth’s cloud albedo emerged as the dominant driver of GSAT, while TSI only played a marginal role. The new climate sensitivity model also helped us analyze the physical nature of the Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) calculated as a difference between absorbed shortwave and outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere.”
Notably, ‘albedo’ refers to the effect of light reflection that a surface has, chiefly in this case, sunlight. The albedo factor of clouds is the main factor in global surface air temperatures. The researchers also found that the ‘heat trapping’ effect of greenhouse gasses such as CO2 (the source of climate hysteria) is misinterpreted as a source of global warming.
“Observations and model calculations revealed that EEI results from a quasi-adiabatic attenuation of surface energy fluxes traveling through a field of decreasing air pressure with altitude. In other words, the adiabatic dissipation of thermal kinetic energy in ascending air parcels gives rise to an apparent EEI, which does not represent “heat trapping” by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases as currently assumed. We provide numerical evidence that the observed EEI has been misinterpreted as a source of energy gain by the Earth system on multidecadal time scales,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
In the ‘Results’ section, the study has a chart that shows how global surface air temperatures (GSAT) are controlled by changes in sunlight absorption, a factor that changes with cloud’s albedo factor, not from greenhouse gas emissions.
The researchers also described how if greenhouse gases were warming the earth, the temperature data would reflect that, yet it does not.
“…if we use the IPCC’s Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of 0.76 K/(W m−2) calculated from the projected average global warming of 3.0 K by climate models in response to an effective radiative forcing of 3.93 W m−2 due to a CO2 doubling [2], then we should have witnessed an extra warming of 0.89 K over the period 2000–2023,” the study said in the ‘Results’ section. “The fact that no warming has been observed above and beyond the amount expected from the measured solar forcing alone suggests a lack of physical reality to the theoretical greenhouse-gas radiative forcing.”
Lastly, the researchers called out the life ending measures the climate cult is trying to impose with their fake science.
“These findings call for a fundamental reconsideration of the current paradigm of understanding about climate change and related socio-economic initiatives aimed at drastic reductions of industrial carbon emissions at all costs. An important aspect of this paradigm shift should be the prioritized allocation of funds to support large-scale interdisciplinary research into the physical mechanisms controlling the Earth’s albedo and cloud physics, for these are the real drivers of climate on multidecadal time scales,” the study said in the ‘Conclusions’ section.
Infowars previously reported on another study that showed how manmade climate change based on ‘imagination & assumptions’.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/60-of-young-people-with-myocarditis-from-covid-vaxx-had-heart-damage-six-months-later,60% of Young People with Myocarditis from COVID Vaxx Had Heart Damage Six Months Later,By Raw Egg Nationalist,5 months ago,"A majority of young people who suffered myocarditis from getting an mRNA COVID vaccine showed heart damage six months later, according to a new study funded by the FDA.
The study authors looked at health data for 333 patients aged 5-30 from 30 US hospitals. All of the patients had been diagnosed with vaccine-related myocarditis.
The researchers discovered that 60% of patients still showed signs of heart damage six months after diagnosis.
While the researchers called the results “reassuring” and suggested “continued clinical surveillance and long-term studies,” critics who spoke to The Defender have suggested that the results are actually a “ticking time bomb.”
“It’s telling that 60% of the myocarditis patients were still showing significant inflammation and damage,” said Children’s Health Defense Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker.
“You get vaccinated, get myocarditis and then have a ticking time bomb in your chest for the rest of your life.”
Myocarditis has been shown to be life-threatening, causing sub-clinical changes and permanent scarring to the heart.
Dr. Peter McCullough told The Defender that as a cardiologist, he was “greatly concerned” that COVID-19 vaccine heart damage in the majority of young people studied hadn’t resolved at the time of follow-up.
“The investigators should extend their efforts and measure spike protein or its antibodies in the blood and study strategies to eliminate mRNA and spike protein from the body,” McCullough said.
“This is the best hope of reducing the damage done by COVID-19 vaccination.”
Dr McCullough dismissed the study authors’ claims that myocarditis is a “mild condition.”
“I disagree with the authors that this is a ‘mild condition,’ as Takada et al. recently reported a 9.6% mortality rate in young persons with vaccine myopericarditis. Even small areas of damage invisible to cardiac MRI could put vaccine recipients at risk for a future cardiac arrest.”
Many of the authors of the study have positions at universities or research labs associated with Pfizer-BioNTech’s clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine for children.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/link-between-cataracts-and-vascular-dementia-found-study,Link Between Cataracts and Vascular Dementia Found — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A recent study that analyzed biobank participants (those who submitted various bodily samples to medical research databases) indicates that those with cataracts often had lower brain matter volume and a higher risk of dementia, particularly vascular dementia (the type stemming from low blood flow to the brain).
“In this cohort study of 304,953 UK Biobank participants, cataracts were associated with lower total gray matter volume, white matter hyperintensities, and increased risk of dementia, especially vascular dementia,” the study said in the ‘Findings’ section of the ‘Key Points’. “Mendelian randomization analyses estimated that cataracts were associated with a 92% increase in the odds of vascular dementia risk; although poor visual acuity was associated with an increased risk of dementia, myopia was not associated with dementia in genetic analyses.”
Since the eyes are part of the neurological system with the optic nerve connecting into the brain, a link between neurodegenerative disease and ocular degeneration may not sound so far out.
Alzheimers, a type of dementia, is also associated with vision disorders.
“Vision and eye conditions are associated with increased risk for Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs), but the nature of the association and the underlying biological pathways remain unclear. If causal, vision would be an important modifiable risk factor with viable population-level interventions,” the study said in the ‘Importance’ section of the ‘Abstract’.
Another study indicates similar findings.
“Cataracts are associated with the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, and vascular dementia,” that study said in the ‘Conclusions’ section.
A third study shows similar results, although the results indicate that the cataracts may be an associated factor but not a causal one.
“The findings suggest that cataract may be associated with cognitive impairment in older adults. However, the causal relationship between cataract and cognition remains unclear and requires further investigation,” that study said in the ‘Conclusions’ section.
A different study however may indicate a causal link, as removing the cataracts also appears to aid in diminishing dementia risk.
“In this cohort study assessing 3038 adults 65 years of age or older with cataract enrolled in the Adult Changes in Thought study, participants who underwent cataract extraction had lower risk of developing dementia than those who did not have cataract surgery after controlling for numerous additional risks. In comparison, risk of dementia did not differ between participants who did or did not undergo glaucoma surgery, which does not restore vision,” the study said in the ‘Findings’ section of the ‘Key Points’.

Kennedy Jr. vice president selection Nicole Shanahan revealed during a recent sit-down discussion on Tucker Carlson’s speaking national tour that her daughter was diagnosed with autism just months after receiving her seven-month vaccines.
Allowing the audience a look into her personal life, Shanahan explained her daughter was healthy and seemed fine until after she received a vaccine when she was seven-months old.
“I had an enormous amount of grief, but then set in the confusion because I was not allowed to consider the fact that the shot caused anything,” she said.
After realizing the jab could have been responsible for her daughter’s diagnosis, Shanahan said she felt very “alone” because there weren’t many people in her life she could talk to about her newfound skepticism.
She explained, “This notion that perhaps the shot caused an adverse reaction, this is a no-go for progressives. You cannot talk about these things amongst these communities.”",0

Dr. Varma, who was the Senior Advisor for Public Health for Democrat NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio during the Covid pandemic, revealed to an undercover reporter he did not follow the same rules he helped create.
“I actually was the one who convinced the Mayor [De Blasio] to make it [Covid Vaccine] a mandate,” the doctor bragged during a dinner with the clandestine journalist.
He also boasted about forcing people to get the experimental Covid shots, saying, “What we do in public health is we make it very uncomfortable to be unvaccinated. I don’t expect your education to change your behavior. I’m just gonna make it really fucking hard for you to do your job. You can’t get a job, you can’t go to a restaurant, your kid can’t go to school. It’s like, ‘Fuck it, I’m just gonna get vaccinated.’ They [the public] didn’t get vaccinated because they heard it’s safe, they gave in because it was really hard.”
Regarding his behavior during the infamous and deadly lockdowns, Dr. Varma said he attended an “underground” dance party underneath a Wall Street bank where took ecstacy in an environment he described as “not Covid-friendly.”
Later, the former public health official discussed setting up an MDMA-fueled orgy with his wife and around “nine” friends at a hotel where “everyone had a blast” because they’d been “pent up” from the very Covid lockdowns he was responsible for.
This type of arrogant above-the-law behavior is par for the course when it comes to the bureaucrats running American into the ground.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/bill-gates-says-urging-people-to-avoid-vaccines-is-inciting-violence-and-he-wants-antivaxxers-censored-by-ai,Bill Gates says Urging People to Avoid Vaccines is ‘Inciting Violence’ and He Wants ‘AntiVaxxers’ Censored by AI,By Lance D Johnson | Natural News,5 months ago,"Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and former friend to Jeffrey Epstein, was recently interviewed by CNBCto discuss how to handle “vaccine hesitancy” using real-time censorship imposed by artificial intelligence (AI). Bill Gates said those who urge people to avoid vaccines are “inciting violence” and are therefore a threat to public health. He proposes a totalitarian approach, calling for speech “boundaries” that weed out “vaccine misinformation” in real time.
Gates’ “philanthropic” organizations are heavily invested in vaccines, from the traditional antigen-based biologics to the experimental mRNA jabs, which are linked to excess mortality worldwide. He recently announced plans to turn all vaccines into mRNA and expand the realm of vaccination to include hundreds more diseases and potentially thousands more boosters. Gates’ resume includes the mass injury of teenage girls via HPV vaccine programs in India and the spread of vaccine-derived polio strains through polio vaccine campaigns in third world countries.
During the covid-19 scandal, Gates frequently appeared on the mainstream media networks, urging every person in the world to stay home, lock down and get vaccinated. He has proposed that individuals submit to his climate change proposals, too, which include: blocking out the sun using chemtrails, controlling global farming and ridding the world of cow farts, forcibly releasing millions of genetically modified mosquitoes, and getting populations to eat bugs and switch to fake meat.
Now the prominent philanthropist wants to use artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time censorship of vaccine-related “misinformation.” Gates’ comments, made in a recent CNBC interview, have sparked a heated debate about free speech rights, mind control and the rewriting of history by the elite.
Gates, who is deeply and psychotically invested in vaccines through the Gates Foundation, GAVI, and the World Health Organization, has increasingly focused on combating vaccine “misinformation” — which is really just the suppression of vaccine injury testimonials and the abolition of informed consent. In his latest interview, he expressed a desire to impose “boundaries” on speech, particularly when it pertains to vaccines. Gates argued that while free speech is important, there should be limitations, especially if such speech incites violence or deters individuals from getting vaccinated.
“We should have free speech, but if you’re inciting violence or causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries?” Gates said. He suggested that the U.S. might need new rules to address these issues, indicating a preference for AI-driven systems that could swiftly identify and suppress harmful content before it has a chance to spread.
Ironically, everyone knows that the true purveyor of “vaccine misinformation” has always been Bill Gates, as he looks for ways to exploit populations with propaganda and force vaccine programs down people’s throats to advance his “philanthropic” mission of transhumanism and population control.
Gates’ totalitarian approach could lead to excessive censorship and a suppression of legitimate debate, eroding informed consent in medicine and making a mockery of healthcare systems globally. Using AI to enforce Gates’ vision for the world will set a dangerous precedent, leading to broader restrictions on free speech, the uncontested implementation of vaccine passports, and further restrictions to the scientific method and the progress of human civilization. Gates’ AI censorship will prioritize thought control over public discourse at the expense of transparency, informed consent, and free will.
Dr. Emily Carter, a free speech advocate, warned that Gates’ proposals could undermine democratic values and erode the principles of our Constitutional Republic. “The idea of AI-driven censorship is fraught with challenges. It risks stifling important discussions and could lead to a situation where only sanctioned viewpoints are allowed,” Carter said. “This approach could erode the principles of open dialogue and informed consent, which are essential for a functioning democracy.”
Gates’ psychopathic attempt to control people and bury vaccine injuries and deaths using AI continues a pattern of malicious behavior. Over the past five years, he has repeatedly called for social media companies to remove what he believes is “vaccine misinformation.” The so-called “vaccine misinformation” and “conspiracy theories” that Bill Gates complains about ultimately turn out to be the TRUTH. His actions have negatively affected millions of lives in the U.S. and hundreds of millions of lives globally. People have been injured and killed all to push forth Gates’ false promises of vaccine safety and efficacy. Meanwhile, Gates continues to cash in on his investments, pushing narratives that have led to mass deception, injury, and death. His collaboration with OpenAI is apparent, as the vaccine propaganda stemming from their large language model is sinister and appalling.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/girls-field-hockey-team-forfeits-game-instead-of-risking-injury-from-male-opponent,Girls’ Field Hockey Team Forfeits Game Instead of Risking Injury from Male Opponent,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,5 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Another school girls’ sports team opted to forfeit a game rather than put its members at risk facing an opposing team with a “transgender” member who is actually a boy, this time in Massachusetts.
The College Fix reported that the girls’ field hockey team at Dighton-Rehoboth Regional High School is forgoing a planned match against Somerset-Berkely Regional High School, citing the latter team having a biologically male player.
Dighton-Rehoboth superintendent Bill Runey defended the choice to “place a higher value on safety than on victory,” even at the potential cost of “chances for a league championship and possibly playoff eligibility,” but expressed hope for their example making “other schools consider following suit to achieve safety and promote fair competition for female athletes.”
The danger is no hypothetical for this particular community; last year, a female Dighton-Rehoboth field hockey player was “severely injured” by a gender-confused boy on the opposing Swampscott High School team, but Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) assistant director Sherry Bryant insisted at the time the association’s “hands were tied because of lawsuits.”
“I told her, ‘You’re telling me, Title IX allows players of the opposite sex on what are typically single-sex teams, but what are the implications of a girl who does not get as much playing time or gets cut because someone who is bigger and stronger, like most males are, takes her playing time or gets her cut?’” Runey recalled.
“I would sincerely hope the MIAA would respect our position not to play in a particular game and not compound the problem with any other consequence,” he added.
Mandatory inclusion of gender-confused individuals in opposite-sex sports is promoted as a matter of “inclusivity,” but critics note that indulging “transgender” athletes undermines the original rational basis for having sex-specific athletics in the first place, thereby depriving female athletes of recognition and professional or academic opportunities as well as undermining female players’ basic safety and privacy rights by forcing them to share showers and changing areas with members of the opposite sex.
There have been numerous high-profile examples in recent years of men winningwomen’s competitions, and research affirms that physiology gives males distinct athletic advantages that cannot be fully negated by hormone suppression.
In a 2019 paper published by the Journal of Medical Ethics, New Zealand researchers found that “healthy young men (do) not lose significant muscle mass (or power) when their circulating testosterone levels were reduced to (below International Olympic Committee guidelines) for 20 weeks,” and “indirect effects of testosterone” on factors such as bone structure, lung volume, and heart size “will not be altered by hormone therapy;” therefore, “the advantage to transwomen (biological men) afforded by the (International Olympic Committee) guidelines is an intolerable unfairness.”
Both aspects of the controversy have been highlighted by former University of Pennsylvania swimmer William “Lia” Thomas, who reportedly retains male genitalia and is still attracted to women yet “identifies” as female and lesbian. Thomas quickly started dominating women’s swimming after switching from the men’s team and caused his female teammates unrest due to sharing lockers with them. Yet the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) reportedly pressured swimmers and their parents against speaking out.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/canada-approves-modernas-latest-experimental-covid-shot-starting-after-6-months-old,Canada Approves Moderna’s Latest Experimental Covid Shot Starting After 6 Months Old,By Clare Marie Merkowsky | Lifesite,5 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Health Canada approved Moderna’s new mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for all Canadians over six months of age.
On September 17, Moderna announced that its latest COVID-19 vaccine, targeting the KP.2 variant of SARS-COV-2, was approved by Health Canada, despite overwhelming evidence of the dangers of the shots.
“With vaccines ready, Moderna will begin delivery of updated doses to the Public Health Agency of Canada, ensuring supply is available in time for provincial and territorial vaccination campaigns,” the company said in a news release.
“Receiving the most recently updated COVID-19 vaccine is expected to provide a better immune response against circulating COVID-19 strains compared to earlier vaccines,” Moderna claimed. “It is especially important for those at increased risk for COVID-19 infection or severe COVID-19 illness.”
The promotion of the experimental shot comes over three years after government officially declared a COVID “pandemic” and forced Canadians to take the vaccine. Additionally, there has been no outbreak of COVID for several years.
Health Canada’s decision to approve the shots follows a bombshell study of Pfizer and Moderna COVID shots that shows “self-assembling nanostructures.”
According to the report, researchers in Korea observed what appear to be “self-assembling,” “synthetic” nanostructures such as spirals and tubes that form within the contents of the COVID Pfizer and Moderna mRNA shots over the course of months.
Canada’s promotion of the vaccine also comes as Canada’s program to compensate those injured by the COVID vaccines has reached $14 million, but the vast majority of claims remain unpaid.
Despite the need for a federal program to address those injured by the vaccines once mandated by the Trudeau government, Health Canada still says “it’s safe to receive a COVID-19 vaccine following infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Vaccination is very important, even if you’ve had COVID-19.”
Interestingly, the claims of safety did not stop the Trudeau government from earmarking an extra $36 million for VISP in its 2024 budget.
The federal government is also continuing to purchase COVID jabs despite the fact the government’s own data shows that most Canadians are flat-out refusing a COVID booster injection.
Some people who were successful in getting payouts from VISP have said that the compensation awarded was insufficient considering the injuries sustained from the COVID shots.
As reported by LifeSiteNews last year, 42-year-old Ross Wightman of British Columbia launched a lawsuit against AstraZeneca, the federal government of Canada, the government of his province, and the pharmacy at which he was injected after receiving what he considers inadequate compensation from VISP.
He was one of the first citizens in Canada to receive federal financial compensation due to a COVID vaccine injury under VISP. Wightman received the AstraZeneca shot in April 2021 and shortly after became totally paralyzed. He was subsequently diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
Wightman was given a one-time payout of $250,00 and about $90,000 per year in income replacement but noted, as per a recent True North report, that he does not even know if those dollar amounts “would ease the pain.”
LifeSiteNews has published an extensive amount of research on the dangers of receiving the experimental COVID mRNA jabs, which include heart damage and blood clots.
The mRNA shots have also been linked to a multitude of negative and often severe side effects in children.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/fda-approves-monkypox-vaccine-says-it-may-cause-death-in-the-vaccinated-and-people-they-come-in-contact-with,"FDA Approves Monkeypox Vaccine, says it May Cause Death in the Vaccinated AND People They Come in Contact With",By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"On August 29 the FDA approved for use in the U.S. a vaccine [ACAM2000] for Monkeypox. While the injection is actually a Smallpox vaccine initially approved in 2007, this new approval allows the shot to be injected into those at ‘high risk’ for the Monkeypox disease, such as those in the LGBTQIAAP2S+ community. It carries with it serious side effect risks, including death to those who have contact with the vaccinated.
“…the FDA approved a new indication for ACAM2000 [the vaccine], to include the prevention of mpox disease in individuals determined to be at high risk for mpox infection. ACAM2000 has been approved since 2007 for the prevention of smallpox disease in individuals determined to be at high risk for smallpox infection. ACAM2000 is a live replicating vaccinia virus vaccine,” an FDA press release said on August 30.
The medication guide found on the FDA’s website for the vaccine lists numerous serious side effects on page 1.
While many of the side effects are similar to that of the Covid exotic technology injections, perhaps the most alarming sentence of the medication guide is that these serious side effects can afflict those who come into close contact with a Monkeypox-vaccinated individual.
“[The vaccine] can cause serious complications in vaccinated individuals and in their close contacts to whom the vaccine virus has spread,” the medication guide said on page 1.
The package insert for the Monkeypox vaccine also includes the proviso of serious side effects for those shed upon by the vaccinated.
Importantly, that piece of literature goes so far as to state that the same specific serious side effects can be spread via shedding,
“[The vaccine] is a live vaccinia virus that can be transmitted to persons who have close contact with the vaccinee and the risks in contacts are the same as those stated for vaccinees,” the package insert said on page 1 in the ‘Warnings and Precautions’ section.
While that section only mentioned fetal death as a side effect, the initial ‘Serious Complications’ section of the package insert, found on page 1, does mention death as a side effect of the Monkeypox vaccine, implying that those who have contact with a Monkeypox-vaccinated individual may die.
ACAM2000 is a vaccine used to prevent smallpox and mpox disease.Read from the FDA site:https://t.co/ZVxvBqVyXqThis is disaster waiting to happen! pic.twitter.com/0RlFN2pttZ
An unusual direction is given in section 2.4 ‘Vaccine Administration’ on page 4 of the package insert. Cleaning the vaccination site (the upper arm) with an alcohol wipe is advised against, unless the arm is dirty. This likely sounds bizarre by anyone who’s gotten vaccines before, however it’s stated that the residual alcohol can deactivate the live viruses of the injection.
“No skin preparation should be performed unless the skin at the intended site of vaccination is obviously dirty, in which case an alcohol swab(s) may be used to clean the area. If alcohol is used, the skin must be allowed to dry thoroughly to prevent inactivation of the live vaccine virus by the alcohol,” the package insert said in the ‘Vaccine Administration’ section on page 4.
Post-vaccine care also differs from most other vaccines, as a usual bandaid over the injection site is not called for, but rather gauze.
“Ensure each vaccine recipient has the FDA-approved Medication Guide, which includes instructions for care of the vaccination site. Cover vaccination site with gauze and secure it loosely with first aid adhesive tape. The gauze provides a barrier to protect against spread of the vaccinia virus. If the vaccinee is involved in direct patient care, the gauze may be covered with a semipermeable (semi-occlusive) dressing as an additional barrier. A semipermeable dressing is one that allows for the passage of air but does not allow for the passage of fluids. Do not use a bandage that blocks air from the vaccination site. This may cause the skin at the vaccination site to soften and wear away,” the package insert said in the ‘Care of the Vaccination Site’ section on page 5.
These differentiating factors with vaccine administration stem from the fact that the Monkeypox vaccine is also administered in a different way than most other vaccines.
“[The vaccine] is given ‘percutaneously.’ Your healthcare provider will make 15 pokes in the skin ofyour upper arm with a two-prong needle holding a small drop of [the vaccine]. The pokes are notdeep but will cause a drop of blood to form. Where the 15 pokes are made is called thevaccination site,” the medication guide said on page 2.
Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. reported in The Defender on Tuesday that the Monkeypox vaccine manufacturer is tied to biochemical warfare threats.
“ACAM2000 — made by Emergent BioSolutions, a company specializing in vaccines for biochemical warfare threats such as anthrax and smallpox,” Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. reported in The Defender on Tuesday.
The Monkeypox vaccine, like the smallpox vaccine, is considered ‘effective’ when development of a major cutaneous reaction (characterized by a pustule) at the site of inoculation occurs.
“In an individual vaccinated for the first time (primary vaccination; vaccinia-naïve), the expected response to vaccination is the development of a major cutaneous reaction (characterized by a pustule) at the site of inoculation. The lesion evolves gradually, with appearance of a papule at the site of vaccination after 2-5 days. The papule becomes vesicular surrounded by a red areola, then pustular, and reaches its maximum size at 8-10 days after vaccination; the pustule dries and forms a scab (See Figure 1). In primary vaccinees, scab separation and re-epithelialization occurs 3-6 weeks after vaccination, leaving a pitted scar. Formation of a major cutaneous reaction by day 6-11 is evidence of a successful ‘take’ and acquisition of protective immunity. An equivocal reaction is any reaction that is not a major reaction,” the package insert said in section ‘Interpreting Vaccination Response’ on page 5 and 6.
Images of the pustule are included on pages 7 and 8 of the package insert.
Dr. Peter McCullough wrote on his Substack that Monkeypox is a disease that primarily affects the butts of gay men.
“President Biden and HHS Secretary Becerra declared a US Monkeypox Public Health Emergency in 2022 and let the declaration expire early in 2023. The crisis conjured up little fear for the average American as it was learned that the infection was largely a pustular rash that occurred with intense sexual contact among gay/bisexual men with the skin blisters around the anus and buttocks or mouth,” McCullough said on his Substack on August 18. “A report by Kannan et al, indicated that what happened in 2022 almost certainly occurred because of a gain-of-function mutation in one or more genes within the Monkeypox virus.”

One of them, a lady who raises chickens, confirmed that she has had multiple run-ins with Haitian migrants trying to steal or “rent” her poultry for food.
“We had a set of Haitians that showed up in the driveway, pulled in, laying on the horn,” the lady explained. “They were demanding to rent a chicken.”
After the lady told the Haitian migrants that her chickens are not for sale, they “got very angry, very agitated that we would not sell them a chicken,” the lady said. “It took my husband to run them off for them to leave.”
In another instance, a group of Haitian migrants was walking down the street when suddenly they “dipped under the fence chasing my little duckies here,” the lady further revealed.
“I found them, yelled at them, screamed at them, and they left” – watch the video below:
(Related: Have you checked out this other video footage suggesting that Haitian migrants are eating all sorts of local mammals?)
The internet is abuzz with folks talking about the Haitian migrant invasion from the perspective of major cultural and religious differences. Haitians in particular are known to engage in ritualistic practices that involve animal sacrifices, which does not mesh with popular American culture.
The lady whose chickens have been targeted again and again by migrants says there are definitely some ritualistic practices involving poultry, though one would be hard-pressed to get the migrants to admit it.
“It’s not usually a spoken thing; it’s a voodoo thing,” the lady said. “They do use animals as ritual sacrifices or in different ways.”
This report about the chickens is just one among a growing number that contradict what ABC News declared about there not being an animal sacrifice problem in and around Springfield, Ohio.
“I lived in the islands for a few years and I can confirm they use a car horn as a doorbell and steal chickens,” someone wrote on X, affirming the claims of the lady in the above video.
“They also mow their ‘lawns’ with a machete (cutlas or ‘machette’).”
Another shared the following screenshot with information about how Haitian Voodoo practices involve the ritualistic killing of animals:
“I don’t doubt these stories, but why don’t we have more footage of this yet?” asked another. “Is Springfield, Ohio, down so bad they don’t have iPhone 6 or up?”
“This is what happens when you have open borders and zero accountability,” said another. “When will they put Americans first?”
Someone whose ancestry traces through the United Kingdom shared a story about what things used to be like in Scotland as the native culture protected itself against the possibility of house pets getting slipped into food supply.
“When my grandmother used to go to the butcher’s shop in Scotland, it was required by law that rabbits still have their heads attached,” this person wrote, expressing support for the idea that Haitian migrant abuse of animals is real. “This was so you could ensure that it wasn’t a cat.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/australian-woman-fired-dragged-before-tribunal-for-saying-only-women-can-breastfeed,"Australian Woman Fired, Dragged Before Tribunal for Saying Only Women Can Breastfeed",By David James | Lifesite,5 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — In yet another blow to free speech in Australia, Jasmine Sussex, a Victorian breastfeeding expert, is being taken to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal for saying that only females can breastfeed their babies.
Sussex argued that males who take drugs to lactate should not be experimenting on children, describing it is a “dangerous fetish.”
Her tweets about an Australian male breastfeeding his infant with a cocktail of lactose-inducing drugs was removed by X (formerly Twitter) for Australian users, although it remained visible to overseas users. The move came after requests from a “government entity or law enforcement agency”, according to Twitter. Sussex was told she had “broken the law” although it was not made clear what law that was.
Sussex was also sacked from the Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA) for refusing to use gender neutral language. She is one of seven counsellors to be formally investigated by the ABA leadership and one of five to be sacked.
The complaint against Sussex is being brought by Queenslander Jennifer Buckley in Queensland’s Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Buckley was born male and later identified as a woman and “transitioned.” Buckley acted after a transgender parent complained to the Queensland Human Rights Commission.
Buckley reportedly biologically fathered a baby through IVF and is raising the child with his wife. He posted on social media about taking hormones to grow breasts, explaining: “For the past six weeks I have been taking a drug called domperidone to increase prolactin in an attempt to be able to produce breast milk so that I can have the experience of breastfeeding.”
The case is not just about suppressing a person’s right to say what most would consider to be a statement of the obvious. It raises fundamental questions about how the law is to be crafted and applied.
READ: Head of American Society of Plastic Surgeons criticizes ‘sex changes’ for children but not for adults
A legal system depends on clear semantics, the definition of words. The potential confusion that can be created by not having a clear understanding of a person’s sex was exposed in the hearing for US Supreme Court applicant Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Asked to define what a “woman” is, Jackson replied: “I can’t,” adding that she was not a biologist.
The problem here is that, if you cannot define a word, then how can you use it properly in a court of law? For example, if you do not know what a “woman” is, then how can you be said to have transitioned from a man to a woman, as Buckley is claiming?
This definitional problem has been cynically fudged by mixing up the words “gender” and “sex.” It is claimed that there are 72 genders, by implication turning the question of physical sex into a matter of identity and personal psychology. There are presumably only two sexes.
That is the kind of rhetorical move made by Buckley, who said Sussex’s comments were “hurtful” because he was looking to have “the experience of breastfeeding.” This is analogous to saying that gender differences should be reduced to matters of personal perception, not observable physical characteristics.
In that sense, Sussex and Buckley are talking past each other; the words they use do not have the same meaning. Sussex is saying that objectively only “women” can lactate naturally. It is true that with drug assistance it is possible for “men” to mimic breast feeding to a limited degree. But that is artificial. It is not natural breast feeding. Sussex, who is an experienced consultant on breast feeding, also warns there may be medical issues with “male” breastfeeding that need further examination.
Buckley is arguing that her/his personal experience (of breastfeeding) is what matters and that anyone who questions that is infringing on his rights. He wants to be understood as a “woman” who was a “man”, although he reportedly still possesses male characteristics, such as being able to father a child. This is possible because he feels that way, it is how he “identifies”. But the fact that he has to undergo drug treatment indicates that in a physical sense he is a “man”.
In law, there is always a preference for physical evidence over what people say they are thinking or feeling. The latter is often changeable and difficult to demonstrate; it is poor quality evidence. There should also be an insistence on having an unambiguous understanding of the meaning of words.
On that basis Sussex, who is being represented by the Human Rights Law Alliance, should be able to defend herself effectively. But there is little reason to have confidence in the Australian legal system. It has shown itself to be highly susceptible to politics.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/wi-fi-routers-are-significant-emf-emitters-and-should-be-away-from-livingrooms-bedrooms-study,Wi-Fi Routers are ‘Significant EMF Emitters’ and ‘Should be Away From Livingrooms/Bedrooms’ — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A recent scientific study on the specific absorption rate (SAR) values in the brain and body from electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) emitted by modern electronic devices indicate that certain tech devices, such as Wi-Fi routers, should not be in the same rooms that people spend much of their time in, such as living rooms and bedrooms.
Note what the researchers are likely referring to as ‘wireless modems’ are likely ‘Wi-Fi routers’.
“The SAR values created by the broadband electric field measurement values in the living room and entrance area where the modem is located, are well above the limit values determined by ICNIRP for general public environments and accepted by FCC and CE, FCC corresponds to 293.12% CE corresponds to 234.5%, and these values appear to pose health risks,” the study said in the ‘Conclusion’ section. “It turns out that the wireless modem is a significant high frequency electromagnetic emitter and should be away from the livingroom and bedroom where a lot of time is spent.”
Chiefly, the researchers measured the SAR values, the metric commonly used when discussing the safety of a wireless electronic device. While this metric is important to consider, it is based on old science that only focuses on the radiative heating phenomenon associated with EMF.
Modern science has uncovered that aside from general SAR-based overexposure, EMF triggers many other deleterious effects in the human body such as peroxynitrite and free radical production.
“The specific absorption rate (SAR) value in the brain is calculated by using total transmission coefficient of six layers. SAR value surrounding the head is obtained. These SAR values are interpreted by consider- ing the federal communications commission (FCC) and the community european (CE) occupational and general public the SAR limits,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The researchers described how the modern world is blanketed by an array of EMF, from the low 50 Hz of electrical lines (which they found to not cause harmful effects) all the way to the high frequencies of satellites and cell phones and the ultra-high frequencies of millimeter wave 5G.
“Technology, which has an important role in shaping the society, necessitates living in electromagnetic fields of varying amplitude, from the low frequency (50 Hz) formed by network and overhead lines to the high frequency of the Ku (10-12 GHz) band of satellite broadcasts,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section. “Especially with the advent of the 5G system, the frequency used in communication has increased, and the damage it has caused on human tissue has increased even more since they have greater energy.”
It should be noted that ‘5G’ as it relates to cellular telephone systems does not refer to a frequency, but rather the cellular system’s generation. 5G encompasses a multitude of various frequencies, with ‘sub-6’ 5G being below 6 GHz (similar to 4G) and millimeter wave 5G being ultra-high frequencies of up to 71 GHz with a theoretical high of 100 GHz. Millimeter waves up to 300 GHz are the frequencies emitted by naked body scanners used at airports, which began development in the early 1990s.
The researchers conducted their study by analyzing measurements of EMF levels from around a city, in a school and office and in various spots within an apartment. That data was then compared to levels which are considered maximum safe levels set out by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) organization and the regulatory bodies of the FCC and CE.
“Some people are more susceptible to EMFs than others, and a growing number are experiencing ‘electromagnetic hypersensitivity’ (EHS) – a set of symptoms that appear in some individuals when they are in proximity to wireless or electrical technologies such as smart meters, cell phones, wireless computers or power lines,” Jonathan Landsman said in Natural News. “The most common symptoms of EHS are dermatological symptoms, such as redness, tingling, and burning. Fatigue, insomnia, memory problems, dizziness, heart palpitations and digestive disturbances can also occur.”
Interestingly, neurological disorders have also been documented to be caused by EMF as well.
“One of the many damaging effects of excess EMF exposure on the unborn is autism. Autistic children, Klinghardt says, have an average EMF exposure level that is 20 times higher than that of non-autistic children, this demonstrating the 20-fold impact of EMFs on unborn children compared to everyone else,” Ethan Huff said in Natural News.",0

According to Alexis Lorenze, who’s been documenting her worsening condition on TikTok, she recently visited UCI Irvine Medical Center for a blood transfusion, but was recommended three different vaccines – a meningitis, a pneumonia and a tetanus jab – by a specialist, which were all administered during the same visit.
“Within a few minutes my body started reacting and over the past day…literally last night they gave it to me, over this past day I have gotten a thousand times worse,” Lorenze said in a video that’s gone viral in recent days.
“They gave me the pneumonia, meningitis and tetanus vaccine all at once…I’ve never been in so much pain in my life…they kept telling me to get it…”This is state-sanctioned MURDER. pic.twitter.com/ZZ9wGxr2Jl
Lorenze explained she originally went to the hospital to receive blood transfusions to treat a blood disorder she has called PNH (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria), which she was diagnosed with in January.
“I got blood transfusions. My hemoglobin went back up to about a 7 or 8 and they were ready to discharge me, but it didn’t make sense because I was still having very bad symptoms of the PNH and I didn’t think I was ready to go home,” she said.
“The specialist who was overseeing my PNH disease ordered that I get some vaccines, because in order to receive the treatment for PNH you have to take the three vaccines that I mentioned earlier.”
“I saw someone comment that this happened to them after they gave them a bunch of vaccines that they shouldn’t have mixed together. I believe that is what’s happening to me.”
Other viral videos depict Lorenze’s deteriorating state, showing her face and head swelled up, a purple forehead and splotches throughout, as well as swollen puffy eyes.
Have you seen what’s happening to Alexis Lorenze at UCI Irvine Medical Hospital?! She’s fighting for her life right now—Injured by THREE V🪓’s at once, and the hospital is doing NOTHING to help her! She’s being gaslit and neglected—she even had to pee in a bucket because no one… pic.twitter.com/n0LY64AeJx
Update. Lexi says Drs are saying she can’t record! Lexi went to hospital for headaches due to having a blood disorder PNH. They refused to treat her unless she was up2date on vaccines. she hadn’t had any since she was a child. They gave her 3 in one go. This is wt happened pic.twitter.com/D5Ou25JNkA
Lorenze described receiving vaccine injections in each arm, two in her left arm and one in her right, going on to say, “I cannot move my arms at all or lift them, especially in my right arm.”
To top it off, Lorenze says hospital staff are neglecting to look after her.
“The jaundice is setting in because part of PNH is liver failure, but they are not listening to me,” she said.
“Yesterday I had to ask for water for two hours. I had to pee in a bucket on the floor because nobody would come help me use the restroom,” she described, adding that family are there to help but can only do so much.
Recalling how her grandmother’s health recovered after she left a hospital where she was being overmedicated, Lorenze said she too wants to leave the hospital and go back to Florida where she’s from, but that she’s currently not in a condition to do that, in addition to the hospital refusing to release her in her current state.
“This is the worst thing I’ve ever been through and I really want to leave, but again I’m so scared to leave in this condition. I could barely sleep because I’m too afraid to sleep and I won’t wake up but it’s just getting worse,” she said.
Old Instagram photos feature Lorenze prior to her injuries.
New Instagram updates, however, document the aftermath of her severe adverse reaction.
In one of her most recent Instagram videos, she tagged former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris pleading for help, claiming the hospital is trying to kill her.
Lorenze is reportedly in touch with a lawyer and says she will be taking legal action against the hospital, advising others to stay away, saying, “Nobody should ever trust this hospital.”
Meanwhile, scores of social media users are mobilizing and calling on the hospital to take action and help Alexis.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/austrian-woman-convicted-of-homicide-after-neighbor-caught-covid-from-her-and-died-report,Austrian Woman Convicted of Homicide After Neighbor Caught Covid from Her and Died — Report,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A woman in Austria was found guilty of grossly negligent homicide Thursday after a judge ruled she had fatally infected her neighbor with Covid in 2021.
On Thursday the woman was issued a four months’ suspended imprisonment sentence and fined $886.75 for grossly negligent homicide, according to Newsweek.
The name of the defendant and the deceased have not been released due to privacy regulations in Austria.
“The victim, who was also a cancer patient, died of pneumonia that was caused by the coronavirus, according to Austrian news agency APA. A virological report showed that the virus DNA matched both the deceased and the 54-year-old woman, proving that the defendant ‘almost 100 percent’ transmitted it, an expert told the court,” the AP said on Friday.
‘Almost’ 100 percent was apparently enough to convict the woman.
It should also be noted that the facts of the case indicate it is possible the defendant’s infection spread to the deceased through unintentional means, such as through a door gap or air duct, as it is the deceased’s family who alleges the contact, something the defendant denies.
The deceased’s family reportedly told the judge that there had been ‘contact’ between the defendant and the deceased in a stairwell on December 21, 2021, after the defendant would have allegedly known she had Covid. The defendant denied the contact in the stairwell, saying she was too sick to get out of bed and assumed she had bronchitis, something she often got each year, the AP reported on Friday.
It is not clear if the nature of the alleged ‘contact’ was for innocent conversation, maliciously spreading the virus, or just passing by, as may happen when checking the mail, for example.
The defendant’s physician told police that she tested positive for Covid and that the defendant told the doctor that she “certainly won’t let herself be locked up” after getting news of the result, according to the AP.
The precedent set with this case and other potential cases similar to this is a dangerous one. It criminalizes normal human behavior following a positive test result and goes so far as to make the sick into murderers, even if they infect others unintentionally.
It should be noted that Covid rapid tests have a massive false positive rate, the same test that the doctor said the woman tested positive with. The Covid PCR test is also subject to false positive results as well.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/grocery-rationing-within-four-years,Grocery Rationing Within Four Years,By Jeffrey Tucker | Brownstone Institute,5 months ago,"There is a lack of public comment and debate about Kamala Harris’s call for price controls on groceries and rents, the most stunning and frightening policy proposal made in my lifetime.
Immediately, of course, people will reply that she is not for price controls as such. It is only a limit on “gouging” (which she variously calls “gauging”) on grocery prices. As for rents, it’s only for larger-scale corporations with many units.
This is nonsense. If there really are national price-gouging police running around, every single seller of groceries, from small convenience stores to farmers’ markets to chain stores, will be vulnerable. No one wants the investigation so they will comply with de facto controls. No one knows for sure what gouging is.
Don Boudreaux is correct: “A government that threatens to punish merchants for selling at nominal prices higher than deemed appropriate by government clearly intends to control prices. It’s no surprise, therefore, that economists routinely analyze prohibitions against so-called ‘price gouging’ using exactly the same tools they use to analyze other forms of price controls.”
As for rental units, the only result will be fewer amenities, new charges, new fees for what used to be free, less service, and a dramatically reduced incentive to build new units. That will only lead to a pretext for more subsidies, more public housing, and more government provision generally. We have experience with that and it is not good.
The next step is nationalizing housing and rationing of groceries because there will be ever fewer available.
The more the betting odds favor Kamala, the stronger the incentive to raise prices as high as possible now in anticipation of price controls come next year. That will provide even more seeming evidence for the need for more controls and a genuine crackdown.
Price controls lead to shortages of anything they touch, especially in inflationary times. With the Federal Reserve seemingly on the verge of cutting rates for no good reason – rates are very low in real terms by any historical standard – we might see wave two of inflation later next year.
Here are real interest rates historically considered as they stand. Do you see a case here for lowering them?
Next time, however, merchants will not be in a position to respond rationally. Instead, they will confront federal price investigators and prosecutors.
Kamala is wrong that this will be the “first-ever” ban on price gouging. We had that in World War II, along with rationing tickets on meat, animal fats, foil, sugar, flour, foil, coffee, and more. It was a time of extreme austerity, and people put up with it because they believed it was saving resources for the war effort. It was enforced the same as we saw with covid lockdowns: a huge network enlisting state and local institutions, media, and private zealots ready to rat out the rebels.
Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8875 on August 28, 1941. It claimed broad powers to manage all production and consumption in the US. On January 30, 1942, the Emergency Price Control Act granted the Office of Price Administration (OPA) the authority to set price limits and ration food and other commodities. Products were added as shortages intensified.
And yes, all of this was heavily enforced.
In case you are doing the math, that’s a $200,000 fine today for noncompliance. In other words, this was very serious and highly coercive.
Technology limited enforcement, however, and black markets sprung up everywhere. The so-called Meatleggers were the most famous and most demonized by government propaganda.
In a nation with more agriculture in demographic proximity, people relied on local farmers and various methods of bartering goods and services.
Years went by and somehow people got through it but production for civilian purposes came to a near standstill. The GDP for the period looked like growth but the reality was a continuation and intensification of the Great Depression that began more than a decade earlier.
There are fewer people alive now that recall these days but I’ve known some. They adopted habits of extreme conservation. I once had a neighbor who simply could not bear to throw away tin-foil pie pans because she had lived through rationing. After she died, her kids discovered her vast collection and it shocked them. She was not crazy, just traumatized.
How would such a thing transpire today? Look at the program SNAP, the new name for food stamps. For those who qualify, the money goes into a special account managed by the federal government. The recipient is sent an EBT (Electronic Benefits Transfer) card, which is used like a credit card in stores. It costs taxpayers some $114 billion a year, and works out as a huge subsidy to Big Agriculture, which is why the program is administered by the Department of Agriculture.
Transitioning that program to the general population would not be difficult. It would be a simple matter of expansion of eligibility. As shortages grow, so too could the program until the entire population would be on it and it would be mandatory. It could also be converted into a mobile app instead of a piece of plastic as a fraud-prevention measure. With everyone carrying cell phones, this would be an easy step.
And where could people spend the money? Only at participating institutions. Would non-participation institutions be entitled to sell food, for example, at local farmers’ co-ops? Maybe at first but that’s before the media demonization campaigns come along to decry the rich who are eating more than their fair share and the sellers who are exploiting the national emergency.
You can sell how this all unfolds, and none of it is implausible. Only a few years ago, governments around the country canceled gatherings for religious holidays, limited the numbers of people who could gather in homes, and banned public weddings and funerals. If they can do that, they can do anything, including the rationing of all food.
The program that Harris has proposed is not like other matters that she has flip-flopped on. She is serious and repeats it. She spoke about it even during the debate with Trump but there was no followup or critique of the scheme offered. Nor does such a crazy plan require some legislation and a vote by Congress. It could come in the form of an executive order. Yes, it would be tested by the Supreme Court but, if recent history holds, the program would be long in effect before the Court weighed in. Nor is it clear how it would rule.
The Supreme Court in 1942 heard the case of Albert Yakus, a Boston-based meat seller who was criminally prosecuted for violating the wholesale beef price ceiling. In Yakus vs. United States, the Supreme Court ruled for the government and against the meat-selling criminal. That’s the existing precedent.
Nor does all this have to unfold immediately following the inauguration. It can happen as matters become ever worse following anti-gouging edicts and when inflation worsens. After all, a presidency that believes in central planning and forced economic austerity would last a full four years, and the coercion could grow month after month until we have comprehensively enforced deprivation by the end, and no one remembers what it was like to buy groceries at market prices with their own money.
I wish I could say that this is an outlandish and fear-mongering warning. It is not. It is a very realistic scenario based on repeated statements and promises plus the recent history of government management of the population. There is likely another wave of inflation coming. This time it will meet with a promise to use every coercive power of government to prevent increases in prices on groceries and rents.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/who-approves-first-mpox-vaccine-for-adults-in-africa-then-says-babies-can-get-it-too-despite-no-clinical-trials,"WHO Approves First Mpox Vaccine for Adults in Africa — Then Says Babies Can Get It, Too, Despite No Clinical Trials","By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",5 months ago,"The World Health Organization (WHO) today approved the first mpox vaccine for use in adults — and also said it can be used for babies, children, teens and pregnant women if they are in “outbreak settings where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks.”
WHO’s approval of Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine will help governments and international agencies such as the Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and UNICEF, buy it, MedicalXpress reported.
The MVA-BN vaccine — short for “Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic” — is a smallpox/mpox vaccine. It is sold in the U.S. under the name Jynneos.
WHO Assistant Director-General Yukiko Nakatani said, “The decision can also help national regulatory authorities to fast-track approvals, ultimately increasing access to quality-assured mpox vaccine products.”
Children’s Health Defense (CHD) Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker called the WHO’s approval of the shot for infants and children in Africa “a train wreck in the making.”
Hooker told The Defender:
“The safety profile is abysmal in adults (up to 2.1% serious cardiac events in clinical trials) and the vaccine has not been adequately tested for efficacy or safety in pediatric populations.
“In other words, the WHO has no idea whether it will work nor do they know how much damage it will do. The WHO has again abandoned good public health principles and waved their magic vaccine wand on the mpox outbreak.”
Dr. David Bell, a public health physician and biotech consultant, also criticized the WHO for overly focusing on mpox vaccines and neglecting to address broader public health issues in Africa.
“So far this year, about 40,000 children have died from malaria in the DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo] alone, and similar numbers of people from malnutrition, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDs,” Bell said.
Although these numbers “obviously dwarf” the number of mpox deaths, the WHO is allocating fewer resources to addressing them.
Bell — who formerly served as a medical officer and scientist at the WHO — explained what he sees occurring:
“We have become much better at detecting much rarer diseases such as mpox, and addressing these is certainly more lucrative for the growing industry feeding off the WHO’s misinformation regarding rapidly rising pandemic risk.
“However, it is clear that the people of DRC and Africa in general would benefit far more if WHO returned to impactful public health. There has been a move over recent years to a concentration on addressing the symptoms of diseases of poverty (which mpox is) with Western-developed commodities, rather than dealing with underlying causes.
“This signals a return to colonialist-era approaches rather than evidence-based public health. It presumably reflects the way WHO is now funded, with increasing control from the private sector and a few large Western nations with large Pharma industries.”
No clinical trials on kids
In its press release, the WHO said the MVA-BN vaccine can be administered to adults over 18 as a two-dose injection four weeks apart but can also be given as a single dose “in supply-constrained outbreak situations.”
“While MVA-BN is currently not licensed for persons under 18 years of age,” it said, “this vaccine may be used ‘off-label’ in infants, children and adolescents, and in pregnant and immunocompromised people.”
The WHO called for more data on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in these situations.
The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization — which reviewed all available evidence and recommended the use of MVA-BN vaccine — noted in its Weekly Epidemiological Record reportthat “MVA-BN has not been specifically studied in clinical trials in children.”
However, they said:
“The same non-replicating MVA viral vector is used as a platform for other vaccines that include MVA-filo (Mvabea™) against Ebola virus disease (EVD).
“The EVD vaccine is approved by the EU for adults and children aged 1 year and older. Data from 5 published studies on MVA-BN as a viral vector platform for the prevention of EVD, with a total population of 52 229 children, support the favourable safety profile of the product.”
The authors of a new study — published Sept. 11 in The BMJ — presented results on MVA-BN’s effectiveness in adult males but said nothing about children or pregnant women.
In 2023, researchers funded by the UK Health Security Agency looked at the health outcomes of 87 children who received a single dose of MVA-BN.
They reported that the vaccine was “well tolerated” but that larger studies needed to be done to fully assess the shot’s safety and efficacy in kids.
The Defender asked Bavarian Nordic for information about its mpox vaccine in pediatric populations but did not receive a response by the deadline.
The WHO’s process for granting a drug “prequalification” approval for “emergency use listing” requires drugmakers to “commit to continue generating missing information to fulfill prequalification requirements.”
“Once this information becomes available,” the WHO said, “a PQ [prequalification] application should be submitted to complete the full process to achieve  recommendation for international procurement in both emergency and non-emergency settings.”
It is unclear how much pediatric safety and efficacy data Bavarian Nordic has collected so far and what it showed.
Mpox vaccine approved for U.S. kids and teens since 2022
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 granted emergency use authorization for the vaccine for “in individuals less than 18 years of age determined to be at high risk for monkeypox infection.”
Jynneos has been licensed for use in U.S. adults since 2019.
The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC)’s mpox vaccination website states that while teens and children at risk for mpox can receive Jynneos, it is not recommended for babies under 6 months.
The CDC also says Jynneos can be given to pregnant or breastfeeding women.
Although it remains unknown if Jynneos may pose risks to a developing fetus if taken during pregnancy, animal studies haven’t shown any harm to developing fetuses when the vaccine was given to pregnant animals, the agency said.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-rate-of-depression-among-americans-has-reached-a-new-high,The Rate of Depression Among Americans Has Reached a New High,By Zero Hedge,5 months ago,"According to survey data, three in ten people in the United States had been clinically diagnosed with depression at a point in their lives in 2023.
As Statista’s Anna Fleck points out in [this chart], this is the highest rate since the question started being asked, up 10.6 percentage points from 2015. The rate of increase was particularly steep in the first year of the pandemic, jumping up from 22.9 percent in 2020 to 28.6 percent in 2021. Meanwhile, 17.8 percent of respondents said that they currently had depression in 2023.
These averages hide figures even more extreme, as Gallup data reveals how rates among women, young adults, as well as Black and Hispanic respondents have risen particularly fast.
According to the survey, 36.7 percent of women report having been diagnosed with depression in their lifetimes versus 20.4 percent of men. For young people aged 18-29, 34.3 percent had been diagnosed with depression, while for 30-44 year olds it was 34.9 percent. Lifetime depression rates among Black and Hispanic adults have now surpassed those of White respondents.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, 18.4 percent of U.S. adults reported having been diagnosed with depression at some point in their lives. Again, this figure hides disparities, with the CDC data similarly finding that depression prevalence was higher among women (24 percent) than men (13.3 percent).",0

It highlights how women’s life expectancy in the U.S. is at least two years lower than its peers, despite the country spending more on health care…
The figures we used to create this graphic are listed in [this table]. Data availability for life expectancy at birth varied and is as follows: 2020 (UK), 2021 (CAN, KOR, NZ), 2022 (AUS, GER, JPN, NOR), 2023 (FRA, NETH, SWE, SWIZ).
Life expectancy can be attributed to a number of factors including living standards, lifestyle choices, quality of education, and access to health services.
Based on other data collected by The Commonwealth Fund, access and affordability appears to be a leading problem in the United States.
For example, among high-income countries, American women are the most likely to struggle with paying their medical bills, and are also the most likely to skip needed care due to costs.
America’s outlier status on this measure likely stems from the large number of working-age women who lack health insurance – nearly 10 million – as well as the high copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles that many U.S. women enrolled in commercial health plans face when seeking care.
– KFF (2023)
Further data from The Commonwealth Fund shows that 14% of American women do not have health insurance, rising to 26% among Hispanics.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/florida-surgeon-general-advises-against-updated-covid-booster-florida-department-of-health-bulletin,Florida Surgeon General Advises Against Updated Covid Booster — Florida Department of Health Bulletin,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A Florida Department of Health bulletin issued Thursday addressed the recent Covid booster vaccine’s lack of efficacy against the current strain of Covid virus and listed the mRNA shot’s serious side effects. The State’s Surgeon General advises against taking the mRNA Covid vaccine.
A similar bulletin was issued by the Florida Department of Health in 2023.
“Based on the high rate of global immunity and currently available data, the State Surgeon General advises against the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Any provider concerned about the health risks associated with COVID-19 for patients over the age of 65 or with underlying health conditions should prioritize patient access to non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and treatment,” the bulletin said.
The Florida Surgeon General is currently Joseph A. Ladapo.
Peculiarly, the bulletin began by stressing the importance in staying up-to-date with Covid vaccinations, before going on to not recommending any current mRNA Covid vaccination. It also did not advise Floridians who are under 65 or without underlying health conditions to get a traditional Covid vaccine nor a viral vector Covid injection.
“The Florida Department of Health (Department) is reminding health care providers of the importance of remaining up to date with current literature related to COVID-19 vaccines and boosters, and the importance of providing patients with informed consent,” the bulletin said.
Directly after the aforementioned statement, the bulletin discussed the recent FDA authorization of Covid boosters and the lackluster safety and efficacy of said injections.
“On August 22, 2024, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and authorized updated versions of mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna. The FDA approved the vaccine for people 12 and older and provided emergency use authorization for children 6 months to 11 years old. The stated target of these boosters is the Omicron variant which is not causing a significant number of infections,” the bulletin said. “The most recent booster approval was granted in the absence of booster-specific clinical trial data performed in humans. Furthermore, this booster does not protect against thecurrently dominant strain, accounting for approximately 37% of infections in the United States. There are currently limited data to inform whether these boosters offer any substantial protection against the virus and subsequent circulating variants. Although randomized clinical trials are normally used to approve therapeutics, the federal government has not required COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers to demonstrate their boosters prevent hospitalizations or death from COVID-19 illness.”
The bulletin also spoke in specificity and particularity with regards to the exotic mRNA technology, listing several key bullet points on their dangers, not unlike is seen at the end of many of Infowars’ articles on the shots. Regarding these vaccine dangers the bulletin listed:
In perhaps what may be viewed as a more holistic and natural approach to health than what is often promulgated by government health officials and the ‘medical experts’, the bulletin advised Floridians to stay active, eat healthy and spend more time outdoors.
With regards to the 2023 bulletin, the Florida Surgeon General had this to say:
“Once again, the federal government is failing Americans by refusing to be honest about the risks and not providing sufficient clinical evidence when it comes to these COVID-19 mRNA shots, especially with how widespread immunity is now,” State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo said in 2023. “In Florida, we will always use common sense and protect the rights and liberties of Floridians, including the right to accurate information.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-vaccine-induced-psychosis-in-woman-case-study,Viral Vector Covid Vaccine Induced Psychosis in Woman — Case Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"An 18-year-old woman developed psychosis immediately after receiving a virus vector Covid vaccine, according to a case study now making the rounds on social media.
“An 18 years old female student, without any past psychiatric (including the substance use disorders) or medical history, with no family history of mental illness, was brought to the emergency by family members for irrelevant talk and bizarre behavior. There was no past history of physical illness or substance use. Exploration of history revealed that the patient was apparently maintaining well before vaccination and there was no apparent psychosocial stressor prior to vaccination,” the case study said in the ‘Case Description’ section.
The psychotic behavior would be classified within the category of neurological side effects. While there have been numerous pieces of medical literature on the neurological side effects of the Covid vaccinations, they often revolve around more physical ailments such as lethal headaches and seizures, paralysis, Bells Palsy, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
“Over the period of last few weeks, some of the serious side effects with various COVID-19 vaccines have been documented in the form of Guillain-Barre syndrome,” the case study said in the ‘Case Description’ section. “There is limited data with respect to the psychiatric side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. Few case reports have documented new onset psychosis after the use of messenger-ribonucleic acid (mRNA) based COVID vaccine.”
Of note, the patient in question received a viral vector-based Covid vaccination. AstraZeneca and J&J Covid shots are viral vector-based.
“Considering the limited data, in this report we present a case of new onset psychosis, following the use of Covishield vaccine [local version of AstraZeneca’s Vaxzevria (Adenovirus vector vaccine)],” the case study said in the ‘Case Description’ section.
Interestingly, Infowars recently reported that viral vector Covid vaccines have a higher rate of triggering neurological conditions when compared to the mRNA-based injections, albeit by a small margin.
The researchers pointed out that other non-Covid vaccinations have been documented to trigger psychosis as well and explained the root biological cause as possibly being autoimmune encephalitis. Encephalitis is the swelling of the brain, in this case, being triggered by an autoimmune response to the vaccine.
“There is limited data on association of psychosis with the use of vaccines. There are few case reports of development of psychosis after administration of vaccines for rabies (Bhojani et al., 2014), yellow fever (Romeo et al., 2021), smallpox, typhus and influenza. With respect to COVID-19 vaccine, few published case report has documented the association of psychosis with the use of vaccine and some of the reports indicate that psychosis could be an outcome of autoimmune encephalitis,” the case study said in the ‘Discussion’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/therapy-logs-video-sessions-for-1-7-million-american-mental-patients-leaked-to-open-web-after-data-breach,"Therapy Logs, Video Sessions for 1.7 Million American Mental Patients Leaked to Open Web after Data Breach",By Ethan Huff | Natural News,5 months ago,"Austin-based healthcare startup Confidant Health is in the news after an estimated 5.3 terabytes worth of the company’s mental health data was leaked to the open web.
More than 1.7 million activity logs including psychological profiles and therapy sessions for thousands of patients, including “telehealth” audio and video files, were included in the leak, as were patient driver’s licenses.
Since first getting off the ground in 2018, Confidant has been promising to build “the next-generation of virtual care” for mental health patients seeking treatment for addictions and behavioral problems. Instead, Confidant botched the security of its confidential patient files by storing them in a “non-password-protected database.”
Confidant currently offers clinical services to patients in Connecticut, Florida, New Hampshire, Virginia and Texas. The Confidant Health app is available on both the iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) platforms, having been downloaded some 10,000 times in the Google Play Store.
(Related: Did you know that “nearly all” AT&T customers were hacked in a data breach earlier this summer?)
Cybersecurity expert Jeremiah Fowler is credited with discovering the leak. He commented that the patient audio and video files contain “some heartbreaking, really painful family trauma, personal trauma.”
“It’s almost like having your deepest, darkest secrets that you’ve told your diary revealed,” he added. “It’s things that you never want to get out.”
As a show of respect for professional ethics, Fowler chose not to download any of the private medical information. He also did not attempt to access the password-protected databases, though he did say that a dedicated hacker could easily break in if he or she was so inclined.
“Cyber criminals have a range of tools at their disposal including brute force attacks and social engineering attempts that could potentially result in unauthorized access to those protected files and documents,” Fowler further said.
What Fowler did observe as part of his investigation was a trove of publicly visible patient documents that are clearly labeled as things like psychotherapy intake notes and professional assessments on individual patient health. There are also documents outlining patient histories of mental health, substance abuse, family issues, psychiatric history and other problems.
There were also many other files included in the leak such as administrative documents and verification records, i.e., state-issued identification and insurance cards. Other files include drug tests, some with Personally Identifiable Information (PII), that show positive results for substances like cannabis and alcohol.
Much of the leaked data had been collected by Confidant’s proprietary chatbots and artificial intelligence (AI), meaning robots rather than humans were in charge of it. Confidant has long bragged about its advanced chatbots and AI programs, which the company claims are pros rather than cons.
“A data-centric environment like the one we are constructing lends itself to leveraging AI to make predictive suggestions,” said Confidant’s co-founder Sam Arsenault Wilson in a 2022 interview. “That’s where we’re headed once the data reaches proper scale.”
In a report he compiled for the security website vpnMentor, Fowler noted that in a random sampling of data he reviewed, the open and publicly accessible files “contained what could be considered a very serious potential risk to the personal privacy and PII of those individuals.”
Of the approximately 1,000 files he personally reviewed to better understand how the data breach occurred in the first place, Fowler revealed that he “was able to view using only a web browser,” meaning anyone can access the leaked files without any understanding of hacking.
Fowler made note of the fact that maintaining an exposed database of documents without password protection like Confidant has been doing is highly unusual, especially in the healthcare industry.

The researchers tabulated data related to cardiac and neurological complications in Covid vaccine recipients.
Perhaps not surprisingly, not all Covid vaccine technologies behaved exactly the same. mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna held the title of triggering a whopping 90 percent of heart problems while viral vector vaccines such as J&J and AstraZeneca took first place, albeit by a small margin of 52.6 percent, in triggering brain disorders.
“There was no notable difference in the gender distribution between these two groups of vaccine recipients. mRNA vaccines (all brands) were associated with almost 90.0% of the cardiac complications, whereas viral vector vaccines were associated with slightly over half (52.6%) of the neurological complications,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Although it is now time for Americans to receive their tenth Covid shot, the heart disorders often only took two shots to be accomplished while the brain disorders usually just required one. It should be noted however that, at least early on, the viral vector vaccines were given as a one-dose series while the mRNA vaccines required two doses.
“With regard to the dose, cardiac complications were more common after the second (69.1%), whereas neurological complications were more common after the first dose (63.6%),” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Alex Jones has discussed vaccines eating people’s brains for decades.
The researchers said that the vaccinated should now be monitored, as they are known to be dying.
“Nevertheless, 5.9% of cases with neurological complications and 2.5% of those with cardiac complications were fatal, underscoring the significance of the consistent surveillance and vigilant monitoring of vaccinated individuals to mitigate these occurrences,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/bill-gates-wants-ai-based-real-time-censorship-for-vaccine-misinformation,Bill Gates Wants AI-Based Real-Time Censorship for Vaccine ‘Misinformation’,By Didi Rankovic | Reclaim The Net,5 months ago,"Microsoft founder Bill Gates continues with his crusade, as part of the mission of the Gates Foundation, to not only proliferate the use of vaccines but find new justifications to in effect, force them onto those skeptical or unwilling.
One of the methods Gates has clearly identified as helpful in achieving this goal is hitching his “vaccine wagon” to the massive, ongoing scaremongering campaign and narrative around “misinformation” and “AI.”
Gates spoke for CNBC to reveal he may be a vaccine absolutist – but not a free-speech one. He also didn’t sound convinced that America’s Constitution and its speech protections are the right way to go when he brought up the need for “boundaries” allowing some new “rules.”
Gates’ argument incorporates all the main talking points against free speech: misinformation, incorrect information (aka, fake news), violence, and online harassment. And, he sneaked in vaccines in there, while making a case for “rules” in the US as well.
“We should have free speech, but if you’re inciting violence, if you’re causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries that even the US should have rules? And then if you have rules, what is it?” Gates is quoted as saying.
He was evasive on who the authority to introduce that might be, but he clearly wants censorship and wants it to act swiftly. “Is there some AI that encodes those rules because you have billions of activity and if you catch it a day later, the harm is done,” he said.
In case somebody happens to not like Gates, and his lecturing the entire world what it should and shouldn’t do, they’re out of luck: he appears to be on a press tour to promote a Netflix “docuseries” that will have no less than five parts, and is called, “What’s Next? The Future With Bill Gates.”
But looking back at “the past with Bill Gates”  is never a bad idea. We can see Windows, which he now tells CNBC he was allegedly naive about and thought it would only be used for “productive and responsible purposes” as most people would want to have a computer at home.
What they got with Windows, however, is a problem in its own way, — while Microsoft was seen by critics as going after open-source competition like a monopolistic, anti-competitive corporate bully.
But here is Gates now, to tell us what our future should look like.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/patient-developed-post-acute-covid-vaccination-syndrome-case-study,Patient Developed ‘Post-Acute Covid Vaccination Syndrome’ — Case Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A new syndrome, ‘Post-Acute Covid Vaccination Syndrome‘ was one man’s diagnosis following his taking of the Pfizer (BNT162b2) Covid vaccine, according to a medical case study published in August.
“The patient is a 47-year-old male with a 10-year history of HLA-B27-associated spondylarthritis without recurrence, who developed acute and post-acute COVID vaccination syndrome (ACVS/PACVS) after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “The PACVS manifested as cerebral disease, eye disease, and SFN [small fiber neuropathy].”
The new syndrome can strike anyone of any age who takes the shot, arise at an unspecified time and potentially kill them.
“Side effects can manifest as acute COVID vaccination syndrome (ACVS) within hours or a few days after vaccination or as post-acute COVID vaccination syndrome (PACVS) several days or weeks after vaccination. ACVS/PACVS can be mild to fatal and can occur at any age,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Unfortunately for the man, the treatment has been mostly unsuccessful.
“Two years after the onset of the adverse effects, recurrent elevated recoverin antibodies were detected. Despite the administration of various treatments, most symptoms persisted for more than three years, and only a few interventions such as glucocorticoids, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, botulinum toxin, inuspheresis, and HELP (heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation) apheresis showed a transient beneficial effect,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Side effects of the new syndrome include malaise, chronic fatigue, peripheral nerve dysfunction, dysesthesia (an unpleasant abnormal sense of touch), motor weakness, pain, vasomotor dysfunction, cardiovascular impairment, cognitive impairment, headache and visual or acoustic dysfunctions.
“Post-acute COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PACVS) is a chronic disease triggered by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination,” a study said in the ‘Abstract’ section. “[Post-acute COVID-19 vaccination syndrome] is discriminated from the normal post-vaccination state by altered receptor antibodies, most notably angiotensin II type 1 and alpha-2B adrenergic receptor antibodies.”
It should be noted that the patient in the case study does have a history of autoimmune disorders, however the new syndrome is not limited solely to those afflicted with such ailments.
“In conclusion, this case offers an example of a collection of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (SC2V) in a patient with a specific autoimmune disorder and positivity for anti-recoverin antibodies. These clinical manifestations may be triggered by an exaggerated immune response known as multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in adults to SC2V,” the case study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/covid-lockdown-accelerated-aging-of-teen-brains-study,Covid Lockdown Accelerated Aging of Teen Brains — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A study published Monday documented how the Covid lockdowns triggered an accelerated rate of brain aging in teens, particularly in female teens.
“We report that the lockdown measures enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unusually accelerated brain maturation in adolescents and that this accelerated maturation was much more pronounced in females than in males,” the study said in the ‘Significance’ section.
Perhaps not surprisingly, lockdowns, which inhibited social interaction, had a greater effect on females, as anyone who’s been around humans knows females are the more social gender, making them more vulnerable to social upheaval.
“These findings indicate greater vulnerability of the female brain, as compared to the male brain, to the lifestyle changes resulting from the pandemic lockdowns,” the study said in the ‘Significance’ section.
The research showed that the lockdowns served as an interesting, albeit malicious, neuropsychological experiment on the developing human brain.
“They additionally provide a potential neurophysiological mechanism for alterations in adolescent mental health and other behaviors associated with the lockdowns,” the study said in the ‘Significance’ section.
While ‘maturity’ is widely regarded as a positive aspect of the aging process, it should be noted that the ‘maturation’ term used in the scientific research is not a positive attribute.
“Since accelerated brain maturation has been associated with increased risk for the development of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders, these findings highlight the importance of providing ongoing monitoring and support to individuals who were adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the study said in the ‘Significance’ section.
The researchers explained the detrimental effect further in the following section of the paper.
“Social isolation due to lockdowns that were imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on adolescent mental health, with the mental health of females more affected than males,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
The research was conducted via analysis of MRI brain scans of adolescents, ages 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 years of age from before (from 2018) and after (from 2021) the Covid lockdowns. The scans showed ‘accelerated cortical thinning’ in the post-Covid lockdown brains – a trait of neurological aging. Note that the ‘after’ data was compiled from 2021, making the neurological side effects from the Covid vaccines less likely to skew the results than in later years.
“The pre-COVID data were used to create a normative model of cortical thickness change with age during typical adolescent development. Cortical thickness values in the post-COVID data were compared to this normative model. The analysis revealed accelerated cortical thinning in the post-COVID brain, which was more widespread throughout the brain and greater in magnitude in females than in males,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
Also to reduce the risk of other variables, the researchers used the same population and brain scans from the same MRI machine.
“There are multiple strengths of the design of the current study. All study participants were selected from adolescents living in the same community, using identical exclusion criteria; all study participants experienced similar pandemic lockdown timelines; and all brain data were acquired on the same MRI instrument. This design strategy mitigated concerns that arise when normative models are developed on populations with different demographic characteristics and using different imaging systems,” the study said in the ‘Current Study’ section.
The metrics of the cortical thinning was said to be equivalent to 4.2 years in females and 1.4 years in males, meaning the brain of a 15-year-old girl artificially aged to over 19-years-old and the brain of a 15-year-old boy was artificially aged to about 16.5-years-old, albeit without the real-life experience that would naturally coincide with the neurological development.
The researchers detailed the deleterious effects that this artificial aging can cause.
“Accelerated brain maturation as a result of chronic stress or adversity during development has been well documented. These findings suggest that the lifestyle disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns caused changes in brain biology and had a more severe impact on the female than the male brain,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
For those that haven’t pondered this pivotal period of life, the researchers quantified the changes from childhood to adulthood in terms of neuropsychological development.
“Adolescence is a period of dramatic change in emotional, behavioral, and social development. During this period, individuals become more independent of their parents and spend more time with peers. These peer interactions provide necessary opportunities for learning how to navigate social relationships. This time period is also one in which a sense of self-identity, self-confidence, and self-control are developed, but it is also a period of emergence of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, and behavioral disorders,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section. “Adolescence is also a period of significant structural remodeling of the brain. During childhood and adolescence, the brain is neurally plastic and undergoes many structural changes, which are highly dependent on environmental factors. Cortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness peak during childhood, steadily decrease throughout adolescence, and continue to decrease across the rest of the lifespan. Myelination and synaptic pruning are active processes in many regions of the brain during adolescent development. The decreases in cortical thickness observed during adolescence are likely primarily caused by synaptic pruning, but myelination of axons within the cortical layer may also play a role.”
This is not the first study to analyze brain metric outcomes from the Covid lockdowns however. A study from 2023 showed ‘worse mental health and accelerated brain development in adolescents’ as well.
“The two groups differed significantly in both their mental health and brain development. Compared to the pre-pandemic group, adolescents assessed after the pandemic shutdowns reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression and greater internalizing problems,” the 2023 study said.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/drugmakers-shower-young-doctors-with-gifts-freebies-they-hope-to-get-something-in-return,"Drugmakers Shower Young Doctors with Gifts, Freebies — They Hope to Get Something in Return","By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",5 months ago,"Makers of drug and medical devices target doctors early in their careers, through payments, free meals and sponsored education, to “cultivate long term, reciprocal relationships,” according to the authors of an editorial published Monday in The BMJ.
“Ultimately, these relationships threaten the sustainability of healthcare and expose patients to unnecessary risk or harm,” wrote Alice Fabbri, Ph.D., and Quinn Grundy, Ph.D.
Fabbri is a health department lecturer at the University of Bath in England. Grundy is an assistant professor of nursing at the University of Toronto in Canada. In their Sept. 9 editorial, they cited studiesdocumenting levels of Big Pharma industry payments made to early-career physicians.
For instance, a study published Sept. 1 in JAMA Internal Medicine showed that among 5,533 U.S. cardiology fellows, 73% received “industry marketing payments” in the year before graduating and 88% received payments in the first few years after they graduated.
“For fellows in specialties that use a lot of technology (referred to as ‘procedural intensive’),” Fabbri and Grundy noted, “the proportion was even higher: 80% received payments before graduating, and 96% afterwards.”
More industry payments are given to cardiologists than to any other type of specialist, they said. “In one study, just 11 of 195 directors of cardiac catheterisation and electrophysiology laboratoriesreceived no industry payments in a single calendar year.”
A 2018 analysis of industry payments received by cardiologists revealed that payments fell into 1 of 12 categories:
Industry payments influence doctors’ decision-making
Research shows that industry payments influence doctors’ decision-making, Fabbri and Grundy said. “Even the receipt of low value industry-sponsored meals is associated with increased prescribing of the promoted brand name medication.”
Another JAMA Internal Medicine study — published in 2016 — reported on the prescription choices of 2,444 doctors, revealing that as the amount of money doctors received in industry payments increased, so did the likelihood that the doctors would prescribe brand-name statins.
A team of U.K. scientists recently recommended doctors begin prescribing statins to patients as young as age 15.
Statins are prescription drugs people take to lower the level of “bad” cholesterol that builds up in arteries, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
Researchers in 2018 found a similar trend linking increased industry payments with an increase in the number of doctors prescribing opioids.
Increased drug promotion can negatively affect patients’ health “by contributing to overtreatment, undertreatment, and mistreatment,” Fabbri and Grundy said.
Medical schools need to address conflict of interest
Medical schools need to address early on in students’ curriculum the possibility that receiving industry payments can create a conflict of interest, Fabbri and Grundy said:
“Educational interventions should challenge the common belief among health professionals that they are immune to commercial influence, teach them how to critically assess information received from industry … and point them to independent sources of prescribing information.”
Medical schools and training hospitals also should set policies for their staff who oversee medical students to prevent staff from modeling problematic behavior.
The authors of The BMJ op-ed wrote:
“If students are trained in environments that lack policies to regulate relationships with industry and witness their supervisors and teachers interacting with industry on a daily basis, they absorb and normalise this behaviour.
“Medical schools, teaching hospitals, and healthcare institutions need explicit institutional policies that promote and sustain independent clinical decision making (such as eliminating gifts and industry sponsored meals), and robust, enforceable processes to prevent or manage conflicts of interest arising from financial and gift relationships with industry.”
Medical students themselves have advocated for a conflict-free training environment, Fabbri and Grundy said.
In 2019, the International Federation of Medical Students’ Associations issued a policy statement that called for a “careful delineation of commercial and medical interests … to allow students to exercise their critical sense and limit the impact of influences they have been subjected to during their medical curriculum for their future practice.”
Meanwhile, a 2022 systematic review showed that the prevalence and content of conflict-of-interest policies at medical schools and teaching hospitals still varied greatly across countries.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/fda-blew-off-scheduled-meetings-with-covid-vaccine-injury-victims-emails-show,"FDA Blew Off Scheduled Meetings with Covid Vaccine Injury Victims, Emails Show","By Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. | The Defender",5 months ago,"Despite public statements by government officials affirming the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in early 2022, documents obtained by Children’s Health Defense (CHD) reveal that, at that time, public health officials were increasingly concerned about vaccine-related adverse events.
The 300 pages of documents released on Aug. 22 contain private correspondence from 2021 and early 2022 between U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) officials, and emails from vaccine-injured individuals to NIH scientists.
CHD requested the documents via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in 2022. In April 2023, CHD sued the NIH to obtain the records after the agency failed to respond. In an October 2023 settlement, the NIH agreed to produce 7,500 pages of documents at a rate of 300 pages per month.
Last month’s tranche of documents showed that in late 2021 and early 2022, FDA and NIH officials privately expressed concerns about the growing rate of adverse events related to the COVID-19vaccines — concerns that reached high-level FDA officials.
A Jan. 24, 2022, email (pages 239-240) to Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA’s principal deputy commissioner of food and drugs, and Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, alerted them to the existence of “scientific data” regarding adverse events.
The email, titled “Impromptu Meetup” and sent by an individual whose name is redacted, stated:
“We are in [Washington] DC the remainder of today and tomorrow. Some of our epidemiologists happen to be in town as well and would like to have the opportunity to review with you the scientific data they have.
“Also checking in to see what progress has been made with our researchers?”
In a reply later that day, Woodcock said, “We are evaluating the data and analyses that have been done on adverse events after vaccination, particularly neurologic AE’s” (adverse events).
However, she added that the FDA was “not having in person meetings” at that time but stated that “something could be set up for a discussion between the scientists but it would need to be scheduled to ensure the right people attend.” She did not clarify who the “right people” would be.
On the same day, Marks also responded to the email, stating that the FDA has “connected with” NIH researcher Dr. Avindra Nath — who was studying vaccine-related adverse events — and was “also working through contacting other physicians as well.”
Marks added that he “sent a note to our pharmacovigilance group to see if they can free up time today or tomorrow” but said that “setting up a virtual meeting at some point in the near future when there is more time to plan participants and the agenda may make sense.”
There is no indication as to whether this meeting ultimately took place.
The emails followed just months after another NIH scientist, Farinaz Safavi, M.D., Ph.D., of the NIH Division of Neuroimmunology and Neurovirology, appeared to acknowledge the potential dangers of COVID-19 boosters.
In a Sept. 30, 2021, email (page 129), Safavi told a vaccine-injured individual, “We do not have any data to suggest for or against booster shot [sic] but the consensus among our team is not to take if patient develop [sic] significant neurological complications post vaccine.”
The individual emailed Safavi earlier that day asking whether it was advisable to receive the then-new COVID-19 booster, despite saying that “nothing has really changed” regarding their symptoms.“I think my ears are still off, but I have gotten used to it.”
The injured person previously contacted Safavi earlier in 2021 complaining about injuries sustained following vaccination — describing in a March 26, 2021, email (page 136), “severe paresthesias in my face and scalp and tongue and chest band tightness,” and “severe muscle spasms in my scalp and jaw and even my gums and teeth hurt.”
Vaccine injury victims felt ‘very betrayed’
But while some people injured by the vaccines received replies and advice from NIH scientists, the latest documents showed that many others received no such replies. Some sent desperate emails to NIH scientists asking for help or an update.
For instance, in a Jan. 14, 2022, email (pages 234-235) to Nath, a vaccine-injured person praised Nath for his previous work helping the vaccine-injured, but then noted that he and other NIH scientists subsequently abandoned them. The email stated, in part:
“Dr. Safavi left a vaccine injured chat last September, something strange was going on. The active engagement from the spring and summer was replaced with distance and vague responses, then nothing. But then some people get telehealth visits, and vague responses … and others are told ‘there is no research’ and that’s it for them.
“I am sure you would understand now why the hundreds+ who were turned down for any assistance are now extremely upset after waiting for so long … many feel very betrayed. They have been waiting and waiting, all while suffering every single day. … The conversation isn’t happening. They are dying.”
Marks and other FDA officials appear to have met with vaccine-injured individuals a few months prior, according to an Aug. 18, 2021, email sent to Nath (page 283). In that email, the vaccine-injured person wrote:
“Our ‘injured’ MDs and I are meeting with peter marks and paul Richards [sic] at the FDA Monday morning. I have discussed this with Janet Woodcock and Paul for the last few weeks.
“Hopeful they will be willing to help us ‘nobodies’ in our quest to get medical help for people, or any sort of acknowledgement so people are able to begin dialogue with their home physicians.”
Some victims said Marks blew off scheduled meetings with them.
Dr. Danice Hertz, a retired gastroenterologist from California injured by the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 shot she received in December 2020, previously told The Defender that she and a group of vaccine-injured individuals secured a Zoom meeting with Marks in early 2021 — which he then skipped.
Previously released documents from CHD’s lawsuit against the NIH contained emails showing that Marks and Woodcock were aware of reports about COVID-19 vaccine injuries in early 2021, including emails from injured people throughout 2021 and 2022 seeking help regarding their injuries.
Previously released documents also revealed that Dr. Anthony Fauci received such emails during the same period.
Other documents indicate that, as early as January 2022, NIH researchers were aware of at least 850 peer-reviewed case reports and/or research articles about COVID-19 vaccine reactions.
In one email (name and agency redacted), NIH researchers were told the federal government was “saddled” with the “mess” of dealing with those injured by the COVID-19 vaccines, due to the liability shield enjoyed by vaccine manufacturers.
Marks, FDA still publicly claim COVID shots are safe and effective
Marks continues to promote the COVID-19 vaccines as safe and effective and downplay the extent and severity of vaccine-related adverse events.
Last month, he advised the public to get newly updated formulations of the COVID-19 shots, stating the new vaccines “meet the agency’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality.” He said vaccination “continues to be the cornerstone of COVID-19 prevention.”
In a subsequent interview with NPR though, Marks hedged on the question of how effective the new vaccines are.
“The vaccine is not intended to be perfect,” Marks said. “It’s not going to absolutely prevent COVID-19. … But if we can prevent people from getting serious cases that end them up in emergency rooms, hospitals or worse — dead — that’s what we’re trying to do with these vaccines.”
During congressional testimony in February, Marks said, “There was a signal for myocarditis or pericarditis only after the primary vaccination series with the Pfizer mRNA vaccine in those 12 to 17 years of age, and that now that signal is not being seen more recently.”
Marks also claimed that numerous false reports are submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), though other experts have disputed this assertion.
However, Marks also acknowledged that the FDA was overwhelmed with adverse event reports after the COVID-19 vaccines became available, stating that “the avalanche of reports was tremendous.”",0

Bill C-293, or “An Act respecting pandemic prevention and preparedness,” is now in its second reading in the Senate. The bill would amend the Department of Health Act to allow the minister of health to appoint a “National pandemic prevention and preparedness coordinator from among the officials of the Public Health Agency of Canada to coordinate the activities under the Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness Act.”
Bill C-293 was introduced to the House of Commons in the summer of 2022 by Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith. The House later passed the bill in June of 2024 with support from the Liberals and NDP (New Democratic Party), with the Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois opposing it.
A close look at this bill shows that, if it becomes law, it would allow the government via officials of the Public Health Agency of Canada, after consulting the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and of Industry and provincial governments, to “regulate commercial activities that can contribute to pandemic risk, including industrial animal agriculture.”
Text from the bill also states that the government would be able to “promote commercial activities that can help reduce pandemic risk,” which includes the “production of alternative proteins, and phase out commercial activities that disproportionately contribute to pandemic risk, including activities that involve high-risk species.”
It is not clear when Bill C-293 will proceed to the third reading in the Senate. When it was in the House, it took over a year for it to go from the second to the third reading. Should an early election be called this year, or the bill not get to its third reading before the fall of October of 2025, the bill will die.
As reported by LifeSiteNews, the Trudeau government has funded companies that produce food made from bugs. The Great Reset of Klaus Schwab and his World Economic Forum (WEF) has as part of its agenda the promotion of “alternative” proteins such as insects to replace or minimize the consumption of beef, pork, and other meats that they say have high “carbon” footprints.
Trudeau’s current environmental goals are in lockstep with the United Nations’ “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” and include phasing out coal-fired power plants, reducing fertilizer usage, and curbing natural gas use over the coming decades, as well as curbing red meat and dairy consumption.
Bill C-293 would allow the government to mandate industry help it in procuring products relevant to “pandemic preparedness, including vaccines, testing equipment and personal protective equipment, and the measures that the Minister of Industry intends to take to address any supply chain gaps identified.”
It would also allow the minister of industry to procure the “communications capacity and infrastructure for electronic platforms and tools,” which includes electronic applications that “enable contact tracing of persons exposed to infectious diseases that could lead to pandemics.”
The bill will also “take into account the recommendations made by the advisory committee following its review of the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada.”
The federal government, and most provincial governments, during COVID, pushed and enacted contact tracing to monitor the general population. Any Canadians who traveled out of the country had to also use the government’s much maligned and scandal-ridden ArriveCAN travel app, which had a contact tracing feature.
Also during COVID, the Trudeau government took a heavy-handed approach when it came to enacting laws or rules under the guise of “health.” For example, in October 2021 Trudeau announced unprecedented COVID-19 jab mandates for all federal workers and those in the transportation sector. He also announced that the unvaccinated would no longer be able to travel by air, boat, or train, both domestically and internationally.
This policy resulted in thousands losing their jobs or being placed on leave for non-compliance. It also trapped “unvaccinated” Canadians in the country.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/billions-of-people-are-deficient-in-critical-micronutrients-study,Billions of People are Deficient in Critical Micronutrients — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A study published in August detailed how billions of people worldwide are lacking important vitamins and minerals.
“On the basis of estimates of nutrient intake from food (excluding fortification and supplementation), more than 5 billion people do not consume enough iodine (68% of the global population), vitamin E (67%), and calcium (66%). More than 4 billion people do not consume enough iron (65%), riboflavin (55%), folate (54%), and vitamin C (53%). Within the same country and age groups, estimated inadequate intakes were higher for women than for men for iodine, vitamin B12, iron, and selenium and higher for men than for women for magnesium, vitamin B6, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin A, thiamin, and niacin,” the study said in the ‘Findings’ section of the Summary.
The researchers detailed how lacking these critical micronutrients affects human health.
“Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia, leading to impaired cognition and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness globally, affecting mostly children and pregnant women. Both vitamin A and zinc have a crucial role in immunity, especially for populations facing a high burden of infectious diseases. Folate is needed early in pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirths and neural tube defects, and iodine is essential for pregnant and breastfeeding women because of its role in fetal and child cognitive development,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section. “Deficiencies in these and other micronutrients collectively contribute to a large burden of morbidity and mortality.”
The researchers estimated the global nutrient deficiencies for various age groups of both genders.
“We estimated intake inadequacies for 15 micronutrients (appendix p 1) across 34 subnational age–sex groups in 185 countries. This approach required understanding nutrient intake and requirement distributions for each subnational population globally (figure 1). We developed these subnational nutrient intake distributions using estimates of distribution scale (ie, intake median) from the GDD and distribution shape (ie, intake variability) from the nutriR database,” the study said in the ‘Methods’ section.
The results show that, at least for some micronutrients, the majority of the world is deficient in them.
“Estimates of inadequate intake were generally high (figure 2) and were especially common for iodine (5·1 billion people; 68% of the population), vitamin E (5·0 billion people; 67% of the population), calcium (5·0 billion people; 66% of the population), and iron (4·9 billion people; 65% of the population). Niacin had the lowest estimate of inadequate intake (1·7 billion people; 22% of the population), followed by thiamin (2·2 billion people; 30% of the population) and magnesium (2·4 billion people; 31% of the population; figure 2). A few countries had estimated intake inadequacies that diverged from the general patterns. For example, in India, estimated inadequate intakes of riboflavin, folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 were especially high; Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo had high inadequate niacin intakes; and Russia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan had high inadequate selenium intakes (figure 2),” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
The study also included an interesting map listing various micronutrient deficiencies and their geographic-specific prevalence.
“Calcium intake inadequacy was highest in countries in south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and east Asia and the Pacific (figure 3). Intake inadequacy was high across all age–sex groups in these countries, but especially among people aged 10–30 years. Only countries in North America, Europe, and central Asia had a consistently low prevalence of inadequate calcium intake (figure 3). Low prevalence of inadequate iodine intake was observed only in Europe and Canada (figures 2, 3) and, for vitamin E, mainly in Pacific Island countries (figures 2, 3). For riboflavin and vitamin B12, high prevalences of inadequate intakes were common only in countries in south Asia and Africa (figures 2, 3),” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
There was also not ‘gender equality’ with the types of nutrient deficiencies either.
“Globally, the prevalence of inadequate intakes was consistently higher for females than for males in the same country and age group for iodine, vitamin B12, iron, and selenium (figure 4). The prevalence was higher for females than for males in most regions for calcium, riboflavin, vitamin E, and folate. Conversely, the prevalence of inadequate intakes was consistently higher for males than for females in the same country and age group for magnesium, vitamin B6, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin A, thiamin, and niacin (figure 4),” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
The researchers provided more charts which detailed these deficiencies.
One notable point on the research is that it does not take into account supplementation.
“The estimates we present are of inadequate nutrient intake and do not include information on fortification or supplementation. In essence, this means that our inadequate intake estimates are likely to overestimate risk for some key nutrients (eg, iodine) in particular locations. Nonetheless, supplementation and fortification with many of these micronutrients is uncommon globally,” the study said in the ‘Discussion’ section.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/singapore-launches-covid-style-quarantine-vaccine-campaign-for-monkeypox,"Singapore Launches Covid-style Quarantine, Vaccine Campaign for Monkeypox",By Angeline Tan | Lifesite,5 months ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — The dreary days of quarantines are not over, at least in Singapore.
Following the World Health Organization’s August declaration of monkeypox (“mpox”) as a a “public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC),” Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) stated on September 4 that all medical practitioners and healthcare institutions have to report all mpox cases to MOH immediately.
MOH considers mpox “a viral disease that is caused by two distinct clades of the monkeypox virus (MPXV), known as Clade I and II,” with Clade I cases being considered more serious than Clade II.
According to news platform Mothership.sg, blister-like rashes and fever are the most prevalent symptoms of mpox, although “serious complications or death can occur in medically vulnerable individuals.”
Designated hospitals will test all suspected Clade I cases identified by primary care providers via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on swabs of skin lesions for confirmation of the virus, as per a statement on the MOH website.
Notably, the same website admitted that “there have yet to be point-of-care rapid test kits that are sufficiently accurate in diagnosing mpox.”
Once a Clade I case is verified, MOH will immediately start quarantining close contacts of the case in an allocated government quarantine facility for 21 days. This considerable length of quarantine is similar to Singapore’s strict quarantine protocols during the peak of COVID-19 in 2021.
“We are monitoring the situation closely with our international counterparts, and are ready to respond decisively should the situation change,” MOH said in a press release cited by Mothership.sg.
Additionally, the Singapore government has authorized a vaccine supposedly to combat mpox. Known as Jynneos, this “vaccine” will be given to two groups, namely healthcare workers at the highest risk of exposure to mpox, as well as close contacts of mpox cases (Clade I and Clade II), an MOH press release disclosed.
The MOH claims that this vaccine is a live attenuated (non-replicating) one, and added that the Expert Committee on Immunization stated that a single dose of the shot be given within 14 days of exposure to purportedly decrease people’s risk of disease.
Notably, close contacts of mpox cases will have the vaccine given while they are in quarantine, MOH divulged, without revealing details on whether these people would be given a choice to take the shots or not.
MOH asserted that its present supply of Jynneos injections would be ample according to Singapore’s current mpox vaccination strategy.
“We will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our vaccination strategy accordingly, as the pox situation and vaccine supplies evolve globally,” the ministry elaborated.
In turn, Singapore-based critics have been quick to slam the government’s announcement on its approach to dealing with mpox. Iris Koh, founder of Singapore-based group “Healing The Divide” and champion of medical freedom, lambasted the government’s “draconian measures” in a Facebook post on September 5. In her post, Koh stated:
We wish to know from Ministry of Health, Singapore.
Does that mean that they have the POWER to anyhowly VACCINATE us if we are 21 days in the designated Government Quarantine Facility???
Mothership please help to clarify what draconian measures the Government will do.
We know that under the Infectious Disease Act, they can, but I hope this is NOT another EXCUSE to VACCINATE US with EXPERIMENTAL mRNA INJECTIONS.
It’s against the Nuremberg code. They better don’t TOUCH me.
I suspect this may be a Psy Ops. Isolate us for 21 days and then make us cave to the vaccines… You have all been warned.
We should all be very concerned. Help me to share and viral please.
Koh’s post garnered various responses from Facebook users. One such response reads:
‘No cases of the more severe mpox Clade I have been detected in Singapore to date’ Since no severe mpox case detected, why people need to take the mpox jabs? Can the jabs prevent infection, transmission and serious illness? If the close contact has no mpox, he still needs to jab? If he refused to take the jab? If someone died after vaxed, would Moh be responsible? Why there are no other solutions, Moh only anyhow jabbing people? Many people have died from covid vaccine, would mpox vaccine kill many more people? A good vaccine is one which can prevent infection and transmission.
During the height of the COVID-19 craze, Singapore was subject to a regime of draconian government lockdowns and experimental vaccination campaigns. The Singapore government dealt with vaccine resistance harshly, allowing no room for dissent against its “pro-vaccine” narrative. In 2022, religious houses of worship, including Catholic churches, had to implement government-mandated “vaccination-differentiated safe management measures” (VDS). People who chose to remain “unvaccinated” due to health or ethical concerns over the abortion-tainted mRNA shots could not freely worship in religious houses as they wished. No religious exemptions were granted to those who expressed doubts about receiving the abortion-tainted shots.",0
https://www.infowars.com/posts/new-kid-on-the-block-update-novavax-covid-vaccine-approved-without-clinical-trial-data-on-new-version,‘New Kid on The Block’ Updated NOVAVAX Covid Vaccine ‘Authorized’ Without Clinical Trial Data on New Version,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"The FDA authorized the use of a new Covid vaccine from Novavax under emergency use authorization, despite the FDA not licensing or approving it.
The Novavax Covid shot uses a more traditional vaccine technology than the exotic mRNA technology of Pfizer or Moderna, or the exotic viral vector technology of J&J or AstraZeneca. The Novavax vaccine is not a gene therapy. It is very different than the upcoming saRNA self replicating ‘replicon’ Covid vaccine that Japan is set to begin injecting in October.
“The Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (2024-2025 Formula) has not been approved or licensed by FDA, but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA, under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in individuals 12 years of age and older. Refer to the full Fact Sheet for information about the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted,” the Novavax website said. “The EUA of this product is in duration of the COVID-19 EUA declaration justifying emergency use of the product, unless the declaration is terminated, or the authorization is revoked sooner.”
Interestingly, President Joe Biden ended the Covid emergency over a year ago, bringing into question the authenticity of the Covid pandemic ’emergency’ authorization.
Novavax’s Covid vaccine has been available for patients in a number of countries outside the U.S. for a number of years now. It is being billed to Americans as an alternative for those hesitant of taking the exotic modified mRNA novel technology into their bodies.
Despite the Novavax shot being of a more traditional vaccine technology, the listed side effects on the manufacture’s website read similar to what has become synonymous with the mRNA shots, including myocarditis, pericarditis and other ‘serious and unexpected’ side effects.
While the original Novavax Covid vaccines were analyzed in clinical trials, the FDA authorized the use of the new Novavax Covid vaccine (for more current Covid variants) under EUA without clinical trials being done on the updated version.
“The FDA evaluated manufacturing data to support the change to the 2023-2024 formula of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted. Additionally, the FDA evaluated non-clinical immune response data suggesting that the vaccine provides protection against the currently circulating COVID-19 variants. The agency also relied on its evaluation of safety and effectiveness data from clinical trials of Novavax COVID-19, Vaccine, Adjuvanted (Original monovalent) and investigational monovalent and bivalent Novavax COVID-19 adjuvanted vaccines, as well as postmarketing data. The data accrued with these Novavax COVID-19 vaccines are relevant to Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (2023-2024 Formula) as the vaccines are manufactured using a similar process,” an FDA press release said on October 3, 2023.
The Covid shots are known to:

https://www.infowars.com/posts/self-assembling-nanoparticles-confirmed-in-mrna-covid-injections-study,Self-Assembling Nanoparticles Confirmed in mRNA Covid Injections — Study,By Sean Miller,5 months ago,"A peer reviewed study from July documented the exotic technology of self-assembling nanoparticles within the mRNA Covid gene therapy injections, a novel ‘vaccine excipient’ that has been previously exposed by Infowars, but is now confirmed via documented scientific research.
The findings are similar to a previous study from 2022 which also documented the presence of self-assembling nanoparticles in the Pfizer Covid vaccination.
“In addition to cellular toxicity, our findings reveal numerous —on the order of 3~4 x106per milliliter of the injectable—visible artificial self-assembling entities ranging from about 1to 100μm, or greater, of many different shapes. There were animated worm-like entities, discs, chains, spirals, tubes, right-angle structures containing other artificial entities within them, and so forth. All these are exceedingly beyond any expected and acceptable levels of contamination of the COVID-19 injectables, and incubation studies revealed the progressive self-assembly of many artifactual structures,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
What may be more alarming than the self-assembling structures is the fact they grew over time, occasionally disappearing then reappearing.
“As time progressed during incubation, simple one-and two-dimensional structures over two or three weeks became more complex in shape and size developing into stereoscopically visible entities in three-dimensions. They resembled carbon nanotube filaments, ribbons, and tapes, some appearing as transparent, thin, flat membranes, and others as three-dimensional spirals, and beaded chains. Some of these seemed to appear and then disappear over time,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
SHOCKING! Self-Assembling Nano Structures Found In Incubated Specimens From Pfizer and Moderna mRNA Jabs Have Been Shown In a Peer-Reviewed StudyLink to the study https://t.co/RwAwDj8OQ8 pic.twitter.com/wFVn76sA8D
The researchers deduced by these findings that nanotechnology is an ingredient in the exotic Covid gene therapy injections.
“Our observations suggest the presence of some kind of nanotechnology in the COVID-19 injectables,” the study said in the ‘Abstract’ section.
While nanotechnology in vaccines was rolled out in late 2020 with the Covid injections, the development took years or perhaps decades. In 2015 Alex Jones and Dr. Edward Group exposed this exotic technology.
After the release of the Covid vaccinations, Alex Jones and Dr. Lee Merrit exposed the presence of nanotech in them as well.
Infowars’ Greg Reese produced numerous videos on the topic of nanotech in the Covid injections too.
The study authors introduced their research by explaining that the Covid shot’s mRNA factor alone was suspected to cause bizarre effects from the start.
“In the early days of the push to herd earth’s population into the COVID-19 global “vaccine” experiment, a small number of medical doctors and independent researchers began raising concerns about the observed ineffectiveness, even negative impact, of the modified-RNA injectables,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section.
Notably, the authors used the term ‘modified-RNA’ as the Moderna patents for the exotic technology explain what is commonly called mRNA (messenger RNA) is actually modified messenger RNA or mmRNA.
The researchers also discussed the documented vaccine damage from the shots as well.
“In the wake of the mass vaccination program, by as early as March 2021 and over the following months, significant increases in excess deaths of ‘unknown’ causes and severe sequelae —blood clots, inexplicable haemorrhaging, multiple organ damage (and failure), sudden spikes (cardiotoxins) in heart disease, blood cancers including leukemiaand lymphoma, a range of other ‘turbo’ cancers, miscarriages, neurological and autoimmune disorders, to name a few, have appeared in patients,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section.
The study also discussed the extra-exotic nature of the Pfizer and Moderna injections when compared to the other brands.
“Preliminary analysis of the contents showed that the Pfizer and Moderna products were substantially different from the other COVID-19 injectables —AstraZeneca and Novavax,” the study said in the ‘Introduction’ section.
The researchers provided microscopic images of the self-assembling nanoparticles in the ‘Results’ section of the study.
Perhaps most alarmingly however is that electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), the same type of radiation that is produced by cellphone systems, seemed to influence the self-assembling nanotechnology to build what they described as a ‘magnetic nanobot-like structure’.
“Various spirals appeared transiently during 2 ~ 6 months of incubation, especially in distilled water. A magnetic nanobot-like structure appeared at about 180 days incubation and disappeared later in distilled water. An electromagnetic field from a wireless recharger appeared especially to stimulate the Pfizer sample to develop filaments both profuse in number and with lasting structural integrity in distilled water and normal saline. Pfizer 2 for children, not exposed to an electromagnetic field, is originally more diluted than Pfizer 1 for adults, so the developmental trend appeared to mimic that of Moderna. While Moderna did not produce profuse filamentous structures compared to Pfizer, Moderna did show relatively more filamentous structures and ones that were more sustainable in calcium hypochlorite,” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
The researchers documented the changes of the nanotechnology for over a year.
The spiral shaped structures are pictured here.
The researchers also documented chain-shaped structures.
The researchers recored the bizarre behavior of the technology in-depth. Similar to a life form, the structures went through changes with the seasons.
“In what seemed to be the peak stage of developmental activity, the injectable samples had to be resupplied more frequently with water to keep them from dying out. This was especially so during the summer season when the formations described above seemed mostactive. Nearing the latter part of what we are describing as the stage of peak activity —after approximately 150 ~ 180 incubation days—specific algae-type magnetic bio-nano-robot like coils, dark irregular spirals, appeared near the bottom of the medium (Figure 14). After this period, these kinds of structures continued to maintain their shape until about day 366 (and have continued as of this writing) in the Pfizer incubation studies, showing slightly denatured filaments sprouting out. Some of these filaments take the appearance of hollow bundles of tubes branching outward (Figures 15 and 16),” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
“Floating filaments, especially in the Pfizer sample in distilled water, transformed into a few branching figures and, then, morphed again into hollow transparent elongated ribbons or thin tubes just as in images of participant developing from her skin extracts. (Skin extracts from a Moderna vaccinee will be resented in a forth coming paper),” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
The nano-activity carried on for a very long time.
“In the final stage, at about day 337, familiar-looking filaments appeared in the middle layer of the Pfizer sample in distilled water. Depending on the materials, some floated near the bottom of the medium, others in the middle. Transparent wire-like bundles of hollow tubes appeared floating on the surface of the medium just as skin extract 2 (E2) appeared and changed to atripod-like tipped filament (like the form of an anchor for connection to a neuron) or curled striated ribbons shedding bubbles. See Figures 15, 16, 17, and 18 for details,” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
“The structures in the Moderna sample appeared to develop more rapidly than those in the Pfizer sample, (perhaps because Moderna included a higher concentration of particles). In the same way, the Moderna structures also disappeared more rapidly. In normal saline with Moderna, self-assembling structures appeared at the bottom layer with more artificial and chip-like figures emerging more rapidly and profusely, but with less developed filaments and coils (Figure 19),” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
The researchers noted the reappearance of certain structures a year after the process went into action.
“In the late stage of Moderna incubation (day 630) in distilled water, nanoparticles reappeared floating again as previously seen during initial microscopic observations before culturing had commenced. This reappearance suggests a recycling pattern we describe later in a proposed model at Figure 27. While Moderna showed just a few filamentous structures with unique split ends and a few bundles of loose thin transparent nanowires, Pfizer, in contrast, showed very few nanoparticles floating in close proximity to the filaments or ribbons, but in a background largely cleared of surrounding nano-debris,” the study said in the ‘Results’ section.
The study included a model depicting the behavior that the nanotechnology exhibited.
Also of note, the exotic self-assembling nanoparticles are independent and not to be confused with the lipid nanoparticles used to encapsulate the modified messenger RNA. The lipid nanoparticles have been found to be harmful by doctors.
Regarding the 2022 study, those researchers discovered a similar phenomenon that is similar to the aforementioned research.
“After wide intervals of observation under optical microscopy, using different light filters and magnification qualities, objects compatible with the appearance of graphene have been observed in different layers of the sample. In addition, certain objects of quadrangular appearance which self-assemble in zig-zag arrangements are visibly observed in real time. However, after the almost total evaporation of the samples, this evolution in the samples exposed more complex structures reminiscent of artificial patterns typical of intra-body micro- network technology, as reported in various publications from the scientific literature,” the 2022 study said in the ‘Description and Treatment of the Samples Analyzed’ section.
The 2022 study had many microscopic images of the exotic technology and comparisons to a similar technology documented in existing scientific literature.
While the existing exotic technology injections described herein is novel, it is set to be surpassed by a newer injection technology in early October when Japan begins injecting individuals with self-replicating ‘Replicon’ saRNA ‘vaccines’.
The Covid shots are known to:
