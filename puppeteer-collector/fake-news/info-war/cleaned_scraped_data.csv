AL-ca-traz. Three unforgettable syllables. A name to conjure with.
For me at least, the first thing that springs to mind when that word rolls off my tongue is the minor rock band that served as a springboard for two of the most iconic guitar shredders of the 1980s: Yngwie J. Malmsteen and Steve Vai. But that was Alcatraz with a double Z, and that’s just me.
Today I’m talking about Alcatraz with a single Z: the federal prison of legend. The lonely rock in San Francisco Bay where, from 1934 to 1963, some of America’s most notorious prisoners were sent. The place where Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly and the Birdman all did long stretches; the place where, if you tried to escape—and dozens did—the great white sharks patrolling the freezing waters would get you if the guards didn’t. That Alcatraz. The name means “pelican” in Spanish, apparently.
Since its closure in 1963, Alcatraz has been a national park and a very popular tourist attraction, but now it looks like it may be set to return to its roots as a correctional facility for the worst kinds of criminals America has to offer.
On Sunday, in a post on Truth Social, President Trump announced that he had instructed various parties, from the Federal Bureau of Prisons to the FBI, to reopen the prison, so that the “dregs of society” can once again be “kept far away from anyone they could harm.” Doing so, the President said, will help establish that the United States of America is once again a “serious nation.”
“For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,” the President wrote.
“When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That’s the way it’s supposed to be.
“That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders.”
Unsurprisingly, President Trump’s modest proposal has been met with ridicule by his Democrat opponents in- and outside the state of California.
Nancy Pelosi, who was born when California was still part of Mexico and Alcatraz was home only to a load of birds with massive beaks, said it was not a “serious proposal.” Governor Newsom said, via his spokeswoman, “Looks like it’s Distraction Day again in Washington DC.”
Aptly named state senator Scott Wiener—the guy who takes a very keen interest in age-of-consent law when he’s not marching for gay pride in his leather harness and jockstrap—accused Trump of wanting “to turn Alcatraz into a domestic gulag right in the middle of San Francisco Bay.”
“In addition to being deeply unhinged, this is an attack on the rule of law. Putting aside that Alcatraz is a museum & tourist attraction, this is both nuts & terrifying,” he Tweeted.
Civil rights attorney Scott Hechinger called Alcatraz a “domestic torture complex” and said if Trump really wanted to do something about serious crime, he wouldn’t have cut “nearly $1 billion from bipartisan, proven, successful anti-crime, violence prevention programs around the country.”
And smug know-it-all Brian Krassenstein did some rough calculations and then said something smug.
“At least $175-250m just to shore up crumbling concrete, retrofit for earthquakes, and install 21st-century security tech. Operating costs that never stop bleeding. Everything, water, food, fuel, must be barged in, and raw sewage barged out. That pushes the annual budget to 3× a comparable mainland prison, roughly $70 – 75 M every single year,” he Tweeted, smugly.
Sure, the island has no fresh water source—millions of gallons had to be brought in by barge each week to serve the hundreds of guards and prisoners—and sure the whole place is in need of more than a lick of paint, but money shouldn’t be the main consideration here. It’s about sending a message.
Many of the most heinous criminals in the US are foreign-born, and the Trump administration is in the process of deporting them all. A good number of them, members of the Latin American gangs Tren de Aragua and MS-13, are being sent somewhere far, far worse than Alcatraz: the Center for Terrorist Confinement (CECOT), in El Salvador, under a $6 million deal with President Nayib Bukele. CECOT is, if I recall correctly, the largest prison in the world, and it’s full of people who torture, rape and murder for fun—all in huge communal cells with beds that look like shelves in a vast Amazon warehouse.
Rather you than me, Kilmar!
Getting those scumbags out of the country is by far the best and most economical option.
But that still leaves plenty of homegrown criminals and, in particular, a class of people whose crimes are so uniquely bad they demand a uniquely bad form of punishment.
I’m talking about the people responsible for the terrible mess America finds herself in today, the architects of American decay. The people Donald Trump was elected to vanquish forever. America Last. Globalists. Call them what you will.
I don’t need to tell you who these people are, and I don’t need to rehearse their crimes. We all know who they are, what they’ve done, to whom and for how long.
Put them all on Alcatraz and the cost will justify itself, a thousand times over.
Put Anthony Fauci in a cell with Big Mike and once the lights go out, the good doctor will understand something of what it feels like to be a small helpless mammal in one of his heinous NIH-funded experiments. Fauci will wish he was a beagle with sandflies eating his eyeballs instead.
It won’t happen, of course. The Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishment. And, nine years later, we’re still waiting for Trump to make good on his 2016 promise of locking up Hillary Clinton for her manifold crimes. But thankfully, the Trump administration is hard at work destroying these rotten people’s rotten legacy—deporting millions of illegals, gutting bloated partisan bureaucracies, bringing to an end the enormous edifice of anti-white racial discrimination, preventing the sexual mutilation of children—which is punishment enough, I suppose.
My prediction: Trump’s idea to re-use Alcatraz as a penitentiary will just quietly be forgotten. I’d call that a missed opportunity, but oh well."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-again-says-he-will-walk-away-from-ukraine-peace-talks,Trump AGAIN Says He Will ‘Walk Away’ From Ukraine Peace Talks,By Sean Miller,11 hours ago,"On NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday night President Donald Trump reiterated prior statements by him and Vice President JD Vance that the U.S. is ready to “walk away” from the Ukraine peace negotiations if progress fails to be made. Sunday’s statement is notable as the prior statements have all been made before the signing of Washington’s mineral deal.
“I do believe we’re closer with one party. And maybe not as close with the other, but we’ll have to see,” Trump said. “Five thousand soldiers a week on average, are dying. They’re not American soldiers. But I want to solve the problem.”
The “Meet The Press” interview was conducted for Trump’s first 100 days in office. The President recently got his mineral deal signed by Kiev and is now looking to end the war or cut his losses as he moves into the next phase of his presidential agenda.
The White House has already ordered Moscow and Kiev to begin direct peace negotiations with each other. The day prior, the Kremlin announced it is ready for direct negotiations with Ukrainian Dictator Vladimir Zelensky.
It appears the only holdup for peace is Ukraine’s Dictator.
The U.S. is sending more air defense systems to Ukraine, likely to protect the new U.S.-backed mining operations as part of the mineral deal.
The defensive missile systems are not designed for offensive attack and are likely necessary for safe mineral extraction operations due to the country’s Dictator opting to keep his war going while Trump tries to recoup Washington’s financial losses that paid for Zelensky’s military losses."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/romania-right-wing-candidate-wins-first-round-of-presidential-election-after-entire-election-canceled-and-top-candidate-banned,Romania: Right-Wing Candidate Wins First Round of Presidential Election After Entire Election Canceled And Top Candidate Banned,By Staff | Remix,14 hours ago,"With over 94 percent of the votes counted, George Simion, of the ultra-nationalist Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) has won the first round of the Romanian presidential election by nearly 40 percent.
With over 3.3 million votes or nearly 40 percent, George Simion is in first, followed by the joint candidate of the governing coalition parties, Crin Antonescu, with 1.7 million votes, or 20.94 percent, and independent candidate Nicușor Dan in third place with 1.6 million votes, or 20.12 percent.
According to Mandiner, if Crin advances to the second round, he may have a chance at winning the post of president, with Nicușor less likely to prevail.
Simion won almost all of Romania, except areas of Szeklerland where many ethnic Hungarians live. In Harghita, Mureș, Covasna, Satu Mare and Bihor counties, Crin Antonescu is in first place, while Nicușor leads in Cluj-Napoca county with 95 percent.
The second round of the Romanian presidential election will be held on May 18.
The original first round was annulled last December by Romania’s Constitutional Court, citing foreign interference and illegal campaign financing that undermined the fairness of the election and the equal opportunities of the candidates. The move was sharply criticized as anti-democratic.
The winner of that first round, independent Călin Georgescu (previously of the AUR) was disqualified after the top court ruled, with no evidence, that Russia backed Georgescu’s candidacy.
Moscow has denied any involvement; however, after Georgescu was banned from running again in March, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a news conference, “Any election held without him will be illegitimate. The will of the Romanian people has been suppressed.”
At the time, George Simion, president of AUR, announced a parliamentary strike on social media, declaring that all AUR MPs would cease attending parliamentary meetings, calling Georgescu’s disqualification “an attack on democracy.”
After the Romanian Constitutional Court rejected the appeal of the ruling by the Central Electoral Bureau, Simion posted on X: “Today, the masters have decided: no equality, no liberty, no fraternity for Romanians. Long live France and Brussels, long live their colony named Romania.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/white-house-deputy-stephen-miller-slams-transitioning-children-as-child-torture,White House Deputy Stephen Miller Slams ‘Transitioning’ Children as ‘Child Torture’,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,14 hours ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Thursday that “gender transition” procedures on minors amount to “child torture,” which the Trump administration is “coordinating with state and local law enforcement to fight.”
“If a five-year-old or a six-year-old goes to school, or a seven-year-old goes to school, and the teacher … tries to turn the boy into a girl or the girl into a boy, that is child abuse, and this administration is treating that as child abuse,” Miller said at a White House press conference. “And it is a gross violation of parental rights.”
.@StephenM: ""It is CHILD ABUSE to change a child's gender … Castration surgeries, castration drugs, sterilization treatments of children are barbaric. They violate all sound medical ethics. They are completely unwarranted. They harm children for life — irreversibly."" pic.twitter.com/AMNM6eXTau
“Castration surgeries, castration drugs, sterilization treatments of children are barbaric. They violate all sound medical ethics. They are completely unwarranted. They harm children for life, irreversibly. It is child torture, it is child abuse, it is medical malpractice,” Miller went on, touting the administration’s efforts to deny federal funds to entities that continue them.
“We are using every single legal and financial tool we have at President Trump’s direction to make it clear that schools and universities are and will lose federal funds, as you’ve seen in Maine, if you allow men to invade women’s sports and women’s spaces,” he declared.
A significant body of evidence shows that “affirming” gender confusion carries serious harms, especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity, and life experience to consider the long-term ramifications of the decisions being pushed on them, or full knowledge about the long-term effects of life-altering, physically transformative, and often irreversible surgical and chemical procedures.
Studies find that more than 80 percent of children suffering gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence and that “reassignment” procedures fail to resolve gender-confused individuals’ heightened tendency to engage in self-harm and suicide – and even exacerbate it, including by reinforcing their confusion and neglecting the actual root causes of their mental strife.
Many oft-ignored detransitioners attest to the physical and mental harm of reinforcing gender confusion, as well as to the bias and negligence of the medical establishment on the subject, many of whom take an activist approach to their profession and begin cases with a predetermined conclusion in favor of “transitioning.”
Since returning to office, Trump has taken multiple executive actions to reverse the Biden administration’s transgender policies, including an order that ends all federal support for “transition” procedures on minors, rescinds or amends all of the Biden health bureaucracy’s past endorsements of underage “transitioning,” and calls for a review of the medical literature on the subject, enforcing all existing restrictions on underage “transitioning,” and taking regulatory action to “end” the practice to the greatest extent possible under current law.
Another order prohibits males who claim to be female from competing against actual women in sex-specific athletic programs at schools receiving government funding. A third disqualifies gender-confused individuals from military service and prohibits military health services from conducting “transition” procedures, although that has been temporarily blocked by federal courts."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/fda-to-monitor-vaccine-injuries-in-real-time-to-ensure-transparency,FDA To Monitor Vaccine Injuries in Real Time To Ensure “Transparency”,By Raw Egg Nationalist,15 hours ago,"Vaccine injuries will be monitored in real time, in an attempt to ensure greater “transparency” over vaccines.
The new system will use electronic patient records to ensure more accurate and swift reporting of injuries associated with the use of vaccines.
The system will allow the sharing of data between healthcare providers, hospitals, clinics and other authorized providers. It will flag unusual patterns, such as unusual clusters of conditions like myocarditis, and allow health officials to respond to them more quickly and effectively, it’s hoped.
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said the new surveillance system “will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits—because real science demands both transparency and accountability.”
On his first day in office, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowed to address vaccine safety, after claiming that the current Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only captures 1% of all vaccine injuries.
In March, Secretary Kennedy announced the creation of a separate agency within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to focus on vaccine injuries.
At an event in Indian last month, Kennedy said it was “outrageous” that vaccine injuries are not monitored more closely.
“It’s outrageous that we don’t have a surveillance system that functions. … We’re going to find out what contribution vaccines and everything else—mold, [electromagnetic fields], food, all of these other exposures [that] began in the late 1980s — which one of those are the culprits [for America’s chronic-disease crisis]? I suspect we’re going to see that there’s a lot of culprits, but we need to know.”
In related news, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has instructed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin a “scientific process” to look for treatments other than vaccines for measles.
The Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement in which it noted that, although vaccination is still the “most effective way to prevent the disease,”  “we recognize that some individuals and communities across the U.S. may choose not to vaccinate.”
“Our commitment is to support all families – regardless of their vaccination status – in reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death from measles.”
“Secretary Kennedy will be enlisting the entire agency to activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities,” the statement continues.
“This effort will involve collaboration with universities nationwide to develop protocols, conduct testing, and pursue approval for new uses of safe and effective therapeutics that meet the highest scientific standards.”
In a new measles treatment overview posted on its website, the CDC says that “vitamin A may be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider” and that “other therapies, such as antibiotics should be prescribed based on clinical judgement by an individual healthcare provider.”
The overview also suggests the use of inhaled steroids as a treatment.
Secretary Kennedy has been on the receiving end of sharp criticism from long-term supporters for his newfound advocacy of the measles vaccine.
At the beginning of last month, he Tweeted that  “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”
“What’s the point of writing an entire book about dangers of long term side effects of untested vaccines if you aren’t going to mention it once in power?” one Kennedy follower wrote in response to the post.
“You really make a great poster boy for Big Pharma. So much for ‘MAHA.’ GROSS,” wrote another.
Even Kennedy’s very own health nonprofit, Children’s Health Defense, which he founded and served as chairman of, distanced itself from him.
“What he says does not speak for Children’s Health Defense in any way at this point,” said the organization’s CEO Mary Holland.
Some suggested Kennedy was being blackmailed.
A multistate measles outbreak centering on west Texas has now reached 800 cases."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/just-being-right-wing-is-not-forbidden-influential-mayor-of-tubingen-and-former-green-party-member-criticizes-german-government-actions-against-afd,‘Just Being Right-Wing is Not Forbidden’ – Influential Mayor of Tübingen And Former Green Party Member Criticizes German Government Actions Against AfD,By Staff | Remix,15 hours ago,"The influential mayor of Tübingen, Boris Palmer, is harshly criticizing the Office of the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the powerful German domestic spy agency, after it labeled the Alternative for Germany (AfD) a confirmed “right-wing extremist” party. The former Green Party politician, who won Tübingen despite switching to run as an independent, said the secret, 1,000-page report used to justify the AfD’s designation basically just listed public incidents already known to the media.
“Unless Der Spiegel is simply poorly informed, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution has compiled primarily what is publicly known,” wrote Palmer.
In addition, the report seems to focus on the AfD’s stance on migration, but Palmer himself says it is no surprise the AfD is critical of immigration.
He noted that there are vast differences in rates of violence between different regions of the world, and also within Germany, it is clear that some groups are more prone to violence than others, including groups like Afghans and Algerians. However, he argues that this is socially and not genetically determined.
“Terms like ‘knifemen’ are political exaggerations, but not evidence of racism,” he wrote.
“Just being staunchly right-wing and anti-immigration is not forbidden,” he added. “After all, the law of blood was still largely a reality in the Federal Republic of Germany.” He said the 2000 reform of the citizenship law improved this situation, which meant children born to non-German parents could still attain citizenship in Germany, “but were Helmut Kohl and Roland Koch enemies of the constitution because they clung to the old law?”
The report from the BfV could pave the way for a potential ban, but Palmer is also critical of a ban procedure, saying that not only could it benefit the AfD, but that the entire process may be legally questionable with a very uncertain outcome.
He said he cannot imagine that the Constitutional Court, the country’s top court, would classify the party based on statements it has made about migration and even the concept of Germans as an ethnicity. He said accusations about the AfD being racists, Nazis, or misanthropic are to be expected, but for judges to ban an entire party over it is not believable or constitutional.
Notably, the AfD is now polling in first place for the first time ever, and in some polls has reached 26 percent. It is currently the second-largest party in the Bundestag and the largest opposition party.
The BfV is a highly partisan organization. Run by President Thomas Haldenwang (CDU), he reports to the head of the Interior Ministry, Nancy Faeser (SPD). Both parties have a vested interest in removing the AfD as competition in the democratic process.
Regardless of a ban, the “extremist” classification from the BfV is a powerful blow against the party, as it enables the BfV to surveil members with impunity, including chats and emails. It also means civil servants cannot be members of the party, including police officers. In addition, the BfV can now install informants in the party, who can make extremist statements and tarnish the party’s reputation, all without the AfD knowing who is an informant and who is not. In short, it is a massive tool of intimidation and fear using Stasi-like methods with 21st-century technology, including AI tracking and monitoring."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/biden-team-considered-forcing-him-to-take-cognitive-test-months-before-he-dropped-out-of-race,Biden Team Considered Forcing Him To Take Cognitive Test Months Before He Dropped Out of Race,By Raw Egg Nationalist,16 hours ago,"President Biden’s Team wanted him to take a cognitive test months before his disastrous debate performance made it impossible for him to continue in the 2024 presidential race, but then decided against doing so, a new book claims.
2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America is authored by Tyler Pager, a reporter for The New York Times, Josh Dawsey, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal and Isaac Arnsdorf, a reporter for The Washington Post, and is due to release in July.
In 2024, the authors detail debates held by top aides months as early as February 2024 over whether President Biden should be made to take a cognitive test.
The book claims the aides were confident he would pass a test, but they believed making him take one would only highlight his age and play into his opponents’ hands.
February 2024 was when Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report about the former president’s mishandling of classified documents was released.
In the report, Hur described Biden as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”
The book also details how Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, called David Axelrod to remonstrate with him about a New York Times report that quoted Axelrod as saying, “The stark reality is the president would be closer to 90 than 80 at the end of a second term, and that would be a major issue.”
“That comment prompted an angry call to Mr. Axelrod from Ron Klain, then Mr. Biden’s chief of staff, according to the book. Mr. Klain wanted to know why Mr. Axelrod was fueling doubts about a Democratic president who was on track to begin a re-election campaign,” according to The New York Times.
“There’s no Obama out there, Axe,” Klain is reported to have said, adding “Who’s going to do it if he doesn’t do it?”
Meanwhile, former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has claimed she had no idea about President Biden’s cognitive decline until his disastrous performance in his debate last year with Donald Trump, which led to his exit from the presidential race.
Speaking with Ben Smith of Semafor, Psaki dismissed the notion of a “coverup” of Joe Biden’s worsening mental state.
“I never saw that person —not a single time, and I was in the Oval Office every day, that was on that debate stage,” Psaki said.
“I’m not a doctor. Aging happens quite quickly,” she added, before telling her host “coverup” is a “very loaded term,” which should only be used to describe crimes.
“People use that term as related to Watergate. Or the covering up of not sharing public information about a war,” she explained. “I think it’s a bit of a dangerous term.”
The final straw for Joe Biden’s backers was his appalling performance in his presidential debate with Donald Trump.
According to investigative journalist Seymour Hersch, the debate made it impossible to hide his decline any further, and Barack Obama and Kamala Harris stepped in with a threat to invoke the 25th Amendment if Biden didn’t withdraw from the race.
“It’s not surprising that the long overdue unraveling of President Joe Biden’s re-election campaign happened when it became impossible to keep his increasing impairment covered up,” Hersch explains.
“It was the big-time money backers of the Democratic Party who called off the game of see no evil, hear no evil, after Biden’s shocking performance in his June debate with Donald Trump. They balked at continuing to give millions of dollars to the party now that there was evidence that the president is not always there.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/afd-says-attack-on-party-clearly-politically-motivated,AfD Says Attack on Party “Clearly Politically Motivated”,By Zolta Győri | The European Conservative,17 hours ago,"Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla, co-chairs and spokespeople for right-wing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) have released a statement in response to the news of the German domestic intelligence agency BfV classifying the party, currently the largest opposition force, as an extremist entity, paving the way for a potential ban.
The decision of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is a severe blow to German democracy!
Weidel and Chrupalla said in a post on X.

The conservative politicians questioned the legitimacy of the decision, since the current administration is only four days away from stepping down. “The federal government only has four days left in office, the intelligence agency doesn’t even have a president anymore. And the classification as a so-called suspected case is not yet legally binding,” read the statement.
The co-chairs said the party is being “discredited and criminalized” just before the imminent government change, suspected to be a move trying to break the momentum of AfD that has been gaining ground in Germany in recent months.
Weidel and Chrupalla pledged to fight the decision, saying: “The AfD will continue to defend itself legally against these defamations that endanger democracy.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-says-mexican-pres-so-scared-of-the-cartels-she-cant-walk,Trump Says Mexican Pres. “So Scared of the Cartels She Can’t Walk”,By Raw Egg Nationalist,17 hours ago,"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is “so scared of the cartels she can’t walk,” President Trump has said, as he confirmed that he did indeed offer US military assistance to fight the cartels in Mexico.
Sheinbaum spoke at a university event on Saturday and addressed a Wall Street Journal report that claimed President Trump has been pushing for greater US military involvement in fighting the cross-border drug trade.
“In one of the calls, (Trump) said, ‘How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the U.S. Army come in to help you,’” said Sheinbaum.
“And you know what I told him? No, President Trump, the territory is sacrosanct, sovereignty is sacrosanct, sovereignty is not for sale, sovereignty is loved and defended.”
Sheinbaum added that, although Mexico and the US should collaborate against the cartels, “we will never accept the presence of the United States military in our territory.”
In response to Sheinbaum’s claim, President Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday that he had indeed offered to send “troops into Mexico to take care of the cartels.”
Trump said that Sheinbaum is “so afraid of the cartel she can’t walk,” but added that he believes the Mexican president is “a lovely woman.”
“She is so afraid of the cartels she can’t even think straight,” he added.
At the start of his second term, President Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Mexican goods in an effort to force the Mexican government to deal with the cartels and their role in the cross-border drug trade and illegal migration.
In February, the US government designated a number of Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations, in a move designed to enhance the range of options available for dealing with them, including the use of military force.
Aerial surveillance of the cartels has since been increased, as well as intelligence-gathering efforts.
In response, President Sheinbaum has proposed constitutional reforms to bolster Mexican national sovereignty."

Aside from his talk with Trump, Do Rzeczy reports Nawrocki, an independent who scored support from the conservative Law and Justice party (PiS), exchanged words with various officials in the Rose Garden during the National Day of Prayer ceremony. He was seen speaking with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson, WH Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and Secretary of Health Robert Kennedy.
The PiS candidate is also expected to discuss defense, energy contracts, and the stationing of American troops in Poland with members of Congress.
Nawrocki’s sit-down with Trump in the Oval Office is said to have been a surprise.
“President Donald J. Trump welcomes Polish presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki to the Oval Office,” the official White House account posted on X.
“Great meeting with POTUS. It was an honour to discuss the bright future of Poland-U.S. relations,” Nawrocki posted on his own account.
Chicago’s May 3rd Day Parade, first started in 1892, celebrates the ratification of the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791. This year’s slogan will be “1000th Anniversary of the Kingdom of Poland.”  The largest Polish parade outside of Poland being in Chicago makes sense, as the city is home to the largest Polish population in a metropolitan region in the U.S. With more than 720,000 residents claiming Polish heritage, it is purportedly the most Polish city in the world outside of Poland."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/houthi-missiles-hit-ben-gurion-airport-israel-mulls-iran-strike-in-response,Houthi Missiles Hit Ben Gurion Airport: Israel Mulls Iran Strike in Response,By Raw Egg Nationalist,18 hours ago,"A missile fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen hit Israel’s Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, prompting suggestions from within Israel that the country could retaliate against Iran, the Houthis’ main backers.
Six people were injured by the strike, none seriously. The missile landed in the grounds of the airport, in a grove of trees.
Surveillance camera footage showed the moment the missile struck.
The Israeli military said attempts were made to shoot down the missile, including with a US THAAD system deployed to the country, but they all failed.
Israel’s main airport was closed for several hours as a result.
The attack is the first time a Houthi missile directed at Israel has hit Ben Gurion. A Hezbollah missile hit the airport in November, damaging a parking lot.
Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior Houthi official, told an Arab TV channel that the rebel group had shown it is capable of hitting sensitive targets in Israel. He said the group has “no red lines” in its fight against Israel.
After the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting with Defense Minister Israel Katz and other top defense officials to examine potential responses.
In a short statement following the attack, Katz said, “Whoever harms us, we will strike them sevenfold.”
The opposition National Unity party chairman and former defense minister Benny Gantz called on the government to hold Iran directly accountable for the attack.
“This is not Yemen, this is Iran. It is Iran that is firing ballistic missiles at the State of Israel, and it must bear responsibility,” Gantz wrote on X.
“The Israeli government must wake up,” he said, arguing that fire on Israel “must lead to a severe response against Tehran.”

In a post on Truth Social, the President said he was instructing the Bureau of Prisons, Department of Justice, FBI and Department of Homeland Security to reopen the notorious prison, which housed some of America’s most infamous criminals.
“REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ! For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,” President Trump posted.
“When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That’s the way it’s supposed to be. No longer will we tolerate these Serial Offenders who spread filth, bloodshed, and mayhem on our streets. That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders. We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and Judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our Country illegally. The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
Alcatraz served as a federal prison from 1934 to 1963, and housed inmates like the gangsters Al Capone and “Machine Gun Kelly.” Alcatraz Island is currently a national park.
According to the prison’s official government website, “Officials sought to create a new, unique prison for those deemed difficult to incarcerate elsewhere in the federal prison system. A remote site was sought, one that would prohibit constant communication with the outside world by those confined within its walls. Although land in Alaska was being considered, the availability of Alcatraz Island conveniently coincided with the government’s perceived need for a high security prison.”"

Exit polls have put Simion in first place, followed by centrist candidates Crin Antonescu and Nicusor Dan, who are neck and neck for second place.
The presidential election was originally held in November, but the result was annulled after right-wing populist Calin Georgescu won a shock victory in the first round with 23% of the vote.
Roman’s Constitutional Court annulled the victory, citing “irregularities.” It was claimed Georgescu had received help in his campaign from Russia.
In March, Georgescu was barred by the Central Electoral Bureau from running again, on account of his alleged “anti-democratic” and “extremist” stance as well as a failure to comply with electoral procedures.
Eleven candidates are competing for the presidency. The key contenders include George Simion, the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), who is known for his opposition to the EU and NATO, as well as criticism of military support to Ukraine.
Other prominent candidates include Crin Antonescu, representing the governing Social-Democrat and National Liberal coalition, and Nicusor Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, both of whom support pro-EU agendas.
If no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round, a run-off between the two leading candidates will be held on May 18.
Ahead of the rerun, meanwhile, Romanian detained RT journalist Chay Bowes, who had traveled to Bucharest from Dublin, Ireland, to cover the election. According to the reporter, he was told he was “a threat to the security of the state” and therefore should be deported. Bowes, an EU citizen, has insisted that he entered Romania “completely legally… to do [his] job.”"

On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed the immigration history of Felix Rojas, 44, who allegedly performed horrific sexual acts on the body of a man who died inside a Manhattan subway car last month.
Rojas was apprehended last Sunday and charged with rape and grand larceny in connection with the attack, which unfolded on April 8.
The Times’ coverage of the arrest, published on April 28, refers to Rojas merely as a “Brooklyn man,” and has not been updated to include the fact that he is a Mexican national who has illegally entered the U.S. at least five times since 1998.
Instead, the paper focused on his reputation as “part of a churchgoing family with three children” who “did not have a criminal history and was not listed on the state’s sex offender registry.”
On Saturday, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin ripped the Times for refusing to “mention anywhere in its 400-word story on the monstrous rape of a corpse on the NYC subway that the depraved perpetrator is an ILLEGAL alien.”
“Why not report the facts, NYTimes?”

The move marks a major victory for Musk and highlights the rise of private-sector industrial capitalism as SpaceX leads the global space race.
“Becoming a city will help us continue building the best community possible for the men and women building the future of humanity’s place in space,” the city of Starbase wrote on X.

In December, SpaceX sent a letter to officials in southern Texas outlining its move to incorporate the area around the launch facility. This would streamline the processes required to build the amenities necessary to make a world-class town that fuels America’s space industry.
Popular in the 19th and 20th centuries in the US, towns were built around manufacturing facilities for several key reasons:

Moscow has denied all claims of interference.
The annulled election in late November saw independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu, known for his NATO-sceptic stance, unexpectedly prevail in the first round with 23% of the vote. However, the Constitutional Court later invalidated the results, citing electoral “irregularities.” The country’s officials claimed that the candidate’s campaign had utilized undeclared funds, and that Russia was behind “hybrid” attacks, including in the cyber realm.
In March, Georgescu was barred by the Central Electoral Bureau from running again, citing his alleged “anti-democratic” and “extremist” stance as well as a failure to comply with electoral procedures.

Kennedy Jr. has instructed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin a “scientific process” to look for treatments other than vaccines for measles.
The Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement in which it noted that, although vaccination is still the “most effective way to prevent the disease,”  “we recognize that some individuals and communities across the U.S. may choose not to vaccinate.”
“Our commitment is to support all families – regardless of their vaccination status – in reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death from measles.”
“Secretary Kennedy will be enlisting the entire agency to activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities,” the statement continues.
“This effort will involve collaboration with universities nationwide to develop protocols, conduct testing, and pursue approval for new uses of safe and effective therapeutics that meet the highest scientific standards.”
In a new measles treatment overview posted on its website, the CDC says that “vitamin A may be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider” and that “other therapies, such as antibiotics should be prescribed based on clinical judgement by an individual healthcare provider.”
The overview also suggests the use of inhaled steroids as a treatment.
Secretary Kennedy has been on the receiving end of sharp criticism from long-term supporters for his newfound advocacy of the measles vaccine.
At the beginning of last month, he Tweeted that  “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”
“What’s the point of writing an entire book about dangers of long term side effects of untested vaccines if you aren’t going to mention it once in power?” one Kennedy follower wrote in response to the post.
“You really make a great poster boy for Big Pharma. So much for ‘MAHA.’ GROSS,” wrote another.
Even Kennedy’s very own health nonprofit, Children’s Health Defense, which he founded and served as chairman of, distanced itself from him.
“What he says does not speak for Children’s Health Defense in any way at this point,” said the organization’s CEO Mary Holland.
Some suggested Kennedy was being blackmailed.

“Can it be so that Judges aren’t allowing the USA to Deport Criminals, including Murderers, out of our Country and back to where they came from?” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
“If this is so, our Country, as we know it, is finished! Americans will have to get used to a very different, crime filled, LIFE. This is not what our Founders had in mind!!!”
On Thursday, District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. ruled that the Alien Enemies Act does not allow the President the ability to deport Venezuelan gang members to jail in El Salvador.
Rodridguez Jr. said the law can be used when an “organized, armed force” enters the US, but that Tren de Aragua does not fit the definition intended by the Act.
“The Proclamation makes no reference to and in no manner suggests that a threat exists of an organized, armed group of individuals entering the United States at the direction of Venezuela to conquer the country or assume control over a portion of the nation,” Rodridguez Jr. wrote in a 36-page ruling.
“Thus, the Proclamation’s language cannot be read as describing conduct that falls within the meaning of ‘invasion’ for purposes of the AEA.”
President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of foreign gang members has produced a heavy backlash. Within hours of the President’s Executive Order authorizing the use of the Act, Judge James Boasberg issued a ruling blocking the President and ordering deportation planes that were already in the air to return to the US.
Despite Boasberg’s order, hundreds of men alleged to be Venezuelan gang members have been sent to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison.
In mid-April, the Supreme Court upheld the block."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/first-driverless-freight-trucks-make-deliveries,First Driverless Freight Trucks Make Deliveries,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 day ago,"The very first driverless freight trucks have made deliveries in Texas this week.
Pennsylvania-based Aurora Innovation has launched the service, which runs between Dallas and Houston. Uber Freight and Hirschbach Motor Lines are the service’s first commercial customers.
The service uses a specially developed self-driving system called “Aurora Driver.”
“To date, the Aurora Driver has completed over 1,200 miles without a driver,” said a statement from the company.
“The milestone makes Aurora the first company to operate a commercial self-driving service with heavy-duty trucks on public roads.”
The company has plans to extend its service to El Paso, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona by the end of the year.
The introduction of autonomous freight trucks has been strongly opposed by labor unions.
At the beginning of April, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters testified at the Nevada Capitol in support of Senate Bill 395, which would require all commercial vehicles weighing more than 26,000 lbs to have a trained human safety operator behind the wheel.
“For Big Tech companies to think they can come into any state and replace the jobs of hardworking union members with this dangerous and inferior technology is an insult to professional drivers everywhere,” said Peter Finn, president of Teamsters Joint Council 7.
“SB 395 is critical to protecting the middle class. That is why we are demanding that Nevada lawmakers vote in favor of this legislation.”
The Bill passed the Nevada Senate on 16 April and is currently being considered in the State Assembly.
On 4 April, the Department of Transportation said it would ease safety regulations around the use of driverless vehicles, in large part to allow greater competitiveness with China.
“This Administration understands that we’re in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,” said Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy in a statement.
“As part of DOT’s innovation agenda, our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard that spurs innovation and prioritizes safety.”"

Speaking with Ben Smith of Semafor, Psaki dismissed the notion of a “coverup” of Joe Biden’s worsening mental state.
“I never saw that person —not a single time, and I was in the Oval Office every day, that was on that debate stage,” Psaki said.
“I’m not a doctor. Aging happens quite quickly,” she added, before telling her host “coverup” is a “very loaded term,” which should only be used to describe crimes.
“People use that term as related to Watergate. Or the covering up of not sharing public information about a war,” she explained. “I think it’s a bit of a dangerous term.”

The final straw for Joe Biden’s backers was his appalling performance in his presidential debate with Donald Trump.
According to investigative journalist Seymour Hersch, the debate made it impossible to hide his decline any further, and Barack Obama and Kamala Harris stepped in with a threat to invoke the 25th Amendment if Biden didn’t withdraw from the race.
“It’s not surprising that the long overdue unraveling of President Joe Biden’s re-election campaign happened when it became impossible to keep his increasing impairment covered up,” Hersch explains.
“It was the big-time money backers of the Democratic Party who called off the game of see no evil, hear no evil, after Biden’s shocking performance in his June debate with Donald Trump. They balked at continuing to give millions of dollars to the party now that there was evidence that the president is not always there.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/is-china-about-to-come-to-the-table,Is China about To Come To The Table?,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 day ago,"China appears to be readying itself to negotiate with the US over President Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs.
A statement issued by the Chinese Commerce Ministry on Friday appears to mark a shift in tone and a willingness to negotiate, after China initially took a hard line and responded with tariffs and restrictions of its own.
“The U.S. has recently taken the initiative on many occasions to convey information to China through relevant parties, saying it hopes to talk with China,” the statement said, adding that the Chinese government was “evaluating this.”
The statement warned, however, that “attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and extortion would not work.”
President Trump has made China the main target of his “reciprocal tariffs,” which were announced at the beginning of last month. The President quickly relaxed his new tariffs on other nations to allow them time to negotiate new trade deals, but maintained duties of 145% on goods from China, with some exceptions.
Beijing has described the tariffs as “bullying,” and imposed its own duties in response, as well as squeezing the supply of vital rare-earth metals and magnets, which it monopolises.
On Wednesday, President Trump said there is a “very good chance” he can reach a deal with Beijing.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett have also expressed hope for progress in easing trade tensions.
“I am confident that the Chinese will want to reach a deal. And as I said, this is going to be a multi-step process. First, we need to de-escalate, and then … we will start focusing on a larger trade deal,” Bessent said in an interview with Fox Business Network this week."

The arrests all took place on Saturday. In the first batch of arrests, five men, four of whom are Iranian nationals, were arrested in Swindon, west London, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester.
Arrests connected to an apparently separate plot were also conducted in London. Three Iranian nationals were arrested.
“The investigation is still in its early stages and we are exploring various lines of enquiry to establish any potential motivation as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public linked to this matter,” said Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command.
Searches of properties linked to the men are currently taking place.
The police have not disclosed any details of the plots, for operational reasons.
The British government claims to have responded to at least 20 Iranian plots since 2022. It imposed sanctions on a criminal network based in Sweden and linked to Iran that was targeting Israeli and Jewish interests in London."

Sheinbaum was speaking at a university event on Saturday when she addressed a Wall Street Journal report that claimed President Trump has been pushing for greater US military involvement in fighting the cross-border drug trade.
“In one of the calls, (Trump) said, ‘How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the U.S. Army come in to help you,’” said Sheinbaum.
“And you know what I told him? No, President Trump, the territory is sacrosanct, sovereignty is sacrosanct, sovereignty is not for sale, sovereignty is loved and defended.”
Sheinbaum added that, although Mexico and the US should collaborate against the cartels, “we will never accept the presence of the United States military in our territory.”
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that a phone call between Presidents Trump and Sheinbaum on 16 April grew heated as Trump made clear his desire for US forces to lead efforts to fight the Mexican cartels.
In February, the US government designated a number of Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations, in a move designed to enhance the range of options available for dealing with them, including the use of military force.
Aerial surveillance of the cartels has since been increased, as well as intelligence-gathering efforts.
In response, President Sheinbaum has proposed constitutional reforms to bolster Mexican national sovereignty."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/america-in-a-microcosm-what-the-minnesota-autism-scandal-tells-us-about-the-nation-today,America in a Microcosm: What the Minnesota Autism Scandal Tells Us about the Nation Today,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 days ago,"What if America’s autism epidemic wasn’t caused by environmental toxins like mold or artificial colorings in processed food? What if it was actually fake? What if the explosion in cases was actually caused by Somalis and other immigrants gaming the system to collect endless welfare cheques and live off the taxpayer dime for ever?
I’m being serious. These are questions I was asking myself early this morning, as I sipped on my second or third delicious sugary covfefe and began to shake off last night’s sleep. I’d just seen a Twitter post on a crazy scandal involving Somalis and autism clinics in their Midwestern home away from home—Minnesota, where as many as 100,000 of East Africa’s finest now live.
Well, half-serious. Of course America’s autism epidemic is real. One in 31 children really was diagnosed with autism in 2022, according to the CDC’s new statistics, up from a figure of 1 in 1000 in the 1990s, and this is almost certainly due, as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has claimed, to growing exposure to environmental toxins like mold and pesticides, as well as food additives, vaccines and maybe even prenatal ultrasound. Some of it is misdiagnosis, sure, and maybe a serving of “social contagion” like with transgenderism—kids aping their friends, and liberal parents seeking the approval of the Big Other—but autism is a real thing and it really is getting worse.
So it’s great that autism is finally being taken seriously by the people in charge of running America. The money cost of the condition is staggering on its own, projected to increase to $1 trillion by 2035, but the most painful cost is emotional and moral: it’s the lives and the potential this terrible condition destroys.
Since his announcement of the “most comprehensive” investigation into the causes of autism, RFK Jr. has caught plenty of flak for saying that autism “destroys families,” but he’s right. Most of the people attacking him loudly in the media and on Twitter—like terrifying den-mother Gwen Walz—are just looking for reasons to say something bad about him, as if they didn’t have enough already.
But the fraud is real too, and it’s big. Last year, The Minnesota Reformer reported on a huge ethnic scam involving Somalis and the state’s ever-growing number of autism centers.
Since 2018, autism centers—which are unlicensed in Minnesota—have expanded prodigiously. Centers in Minnesota increased 700% in the five years between 2018 and 2023—from 41 to 328 providers—with payments from the state ballooning by 3,000% over the same period. In 2018, Minnesota’s autism centers were paid $6 million dollars by the state, but in 2023, they received a whopping $192 million.
A few paragraphs back, I told you 1 in 31 children is now diagnosed with autism in the US. Well, among Somali children aged 3 to 4 in Minnesota, the prevalence of autism is 1 in 16. In 2009, a Minnesota Department of Health study found that the proportion of 3-to-4-year-old Somali children receiving autism services was seven times higher than the rate for non-Somali children. In the intervening 16 years, that gap has only grown.
Somalis set up their own clinics under the pretext of providing “culturally appropriate care” for themselves, but in truth, they’re just using the clinics to steal money from the taxpayer.
Two providers, Smart Therapy in Minneapolis and Star Autism in St Cloud, became the focus of an FBI investigation last year after former employees came forward with evidence of the scale of the fraud taking place. According to an FBI warrant, these clinics were run by “18- or 19-year-old relatives of the owners who had no formal education beyond high school or certification related to the treatment of autism.” Many of the children being “treated” by the clinics showed no signs of autism at all. One witness cited by the FBI said they believed parents were being paid to bring perfectly normal children to the fake clinics as part of the fraud scheme. They also billed the state even when “care providers” were out of the country, including in Somalia.
Both of these providers received millions of dollars a year from the government. During a three-year period, Smart Therapy billed Medicaid $850,000 for services for a single client, and received $438,000 in payment for those services.
But it doesn’t end there. Many of these autism centers are also tied up in another massive fraud scandal involving government assistance. Feeding Our Future is a program that’s supposed to provide food aid to children in poverty, but it’s alleged hundreds of millions of dollars—maybe as much as $250 million—were instead spent by fraudulent claimants on cars, property and jewellery. According to the FBI, “at least a dozen of the defendants charged for their role in the Feeding Our Future scheme owned, received money from, or were associated with autism clinics and other health care companies that received state funds for providing (autism) services.”
Smart Therapy, for example, claimed it served just under 200,000 meals and snacks in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Feeding Our Future program. I’d be surprised if it actually served 200 meals and snacks to hungry children. Or even 2.
This isn’t really about autism or meals for hungry children, nor is it just about Minnesota. This is about America and how the hard-working, honest American taxpayer has been turned into a paypig, a cashcow, call it what you will, to subsidise the Third World abroad and at home, as million upon million of Latin Americans, Asians and Africans have flooded into the US in recent years. Billions of taxpayer dollars were sent abroad every year by USAID for absurd, farcical purposes—to teach Sri Lankan journalists how to use gender-neutral pronouns, to promote sex-change therapy in Guatemala and prevent the spread of “disinformation” in Kazakhstan—and billions of dollars have been squandered at home on equally lunatic schemes, like “culturally appropriate” autism care for Somali children who don’t even have autism.
The people responsible—America’s craven, traitorous elite—don’t think they’ve done anything wrong. Of course they don’t. Minnesota governor Tim Walz, in his six years as governor, has done his very best to make his state an outpost of some far-flung, sandy little shithole country, a place where the mores are anything but compatible with basic American values—which he hates. When questioned about the autism-center scandal, Walz initially feigned ignorance, according to The Minnesota Reformer. He asked for “clarification” before he could give an answer. Only later, when the scandal couldn’t be avoided, did he don his outrage hat and say some very stern things about sending the perpetrators to jail, because “these are crimes against children” and “this pisses me off unlike anything else.”
Give me a break. What really pisses Tim off unlike anything else is the thought the America-last gravy train might finally be running out of track. That’s the possibility President Trump has finally brought within reach, and Tim Walz and every other traitor sellout wants to avoid at all cost."

It’s the end of an era at America’s largest hedge fund/private equity/insurance float-cum-rollup conglomerate, whatever you want to call it: Warren Buffett just announced during the Berkshire annual pilgrimage to Omaha that he is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire at the end of the year, and that Greg Abel, the vice chairman for non-insurance operations who has been groomed over the past decade for just this moment, will take over the conglomerate.
Buffett – whose track record cemented him, along his long-time sidesick Charlie Munger, into a celebrity billionaire renowned for his investing acumen and witticisms – built Berkshire Hathaway into a business valued at more than $1.16 trillion, generating compounded annual returns to shareholders at double the rate of the S&P (19.9% vs 10.4%), since 1965, and a staggering 5,502,482% overall gain on BRK stocks since 1964, vs “only” 39,054% for the S&P. His investing success gave him the power to move stocks and helped him strike lucrative deals with Goldman Sachs and General Electric during times of crisis.
The announcement stunned the board and even Abel, who, while long signaled as Buffett’s successor, was unaware that the news was coming as the annual meeting drew to a close.
“That’s the news hook for the day,” Buffett said. “Thanks for coming.”
Berkshire grew aggressively over the decades with Buffett as chairman and CEO, as he chose acquisitions and stocks for the company portfolio alongside trusted adviser and vice chairman, Charlie Munger, who died in 2023 at 99. As Bloomberg notes, “the conglomerate acquired a bewildering assortment of businesses, which Buffett often said mirrored the US economy as a whole. A bet on Berkshire, he said, was a bet on America.”
Buffett started managing money when he was young, a disciple of Benjamin Graham’s investing style. He moved more into the corporate world when his Buffett Partnership Ltd. bought shares of Berkshire. In 1965, he took control of the rest of the business.
Composed mostly of struggling textile operations that would eventually fade away, Berkshire became the foundation for Buffett’s modern-day giant. Piece by piece, he built and acquired operations into a varied set of industries, including insurance — which gave him cash, or “float” — to help his investing strategy.
Now, Berkshire owns businesses ranging from railroad BNSF to auto insurer Geico, sprawling energy operations, and even retailers such as Dairy Queen and See’s Candies. Its collection of companies generated $47.4 billion of annual operating earnings in 2024. Buffett also built up the stock portfolio — populating it with giant bets on the likes of Apple Inc. and American Express — and offering Berkshire another way to participate in the gains of businesses that it didn’t fully own.
* * *
Ahead of today’s annual meeting with Berkshire’s faithful, the company reported Q1 results that showed a steep drop in operating earnings from the year-earlier period: operating earnings, which include the conglomerate’s fully owned insurance and railroad businesses, fell 14% to $9.64 billion during the first three months of the year. In the first quarter of 2024, they totaled $11.22 billion. On per share basis, operating earnings were $4.47 last quarter, down from $5.20 a year ago, and below the $4.72 consensus forecast.
Much of the company’s decline was driven by a 48.6% plunge in insurance-underwriting profit, which came in at $1.34 billion for the first quarter, down from $2.60 billion a year prior, and was mostly due to the Southern California wildfires which led to a $1.1 billion loss in Q1.
Berkshire’s bottom line also took a hit from the dollar losing value in the first quarter. The company said it suffered an approximate $713 million loss related to foreign exchange. This time last year, it benefited from a $597 million forex gain. The dollar index fell nearly 4% in the first quarter. Against the Japanese yen, it lost 4.6%.
The company’s overall earnings plunged nearly 64% year over year, as Buffett’s portfolio of publicly traded names took a hit to start the year. As is well-known, Berkshire always advises investors to look past these quarterly changes: “The amount of investment gains (losses) in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” Berkshire’s release said.
Berkshire said Donald Trump’s tariffs and other geopolitical risks created an uncertain environment for the conglomerate, owner of BNSF railway, Brooks Running and Geico insurance. While the firm said it’s not able to predict any potential impact from tariffs at this time, it warned that tariffs may further hit profits.
“Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods by impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events,” Berkshire said in the earnings report. “The pace of changes in these events, including international trade policies and tariffs, has accelerated in 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events. We are currently unable to reliably predict the potential impact on our businesses, whether through changes in product costs, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services” it said.
During the annual meeting, Buffett also addressed Trump’s tariff policies at the company’s annual meeting in Omaha, saying trade “should not be a weapon.”
“You can make some very good arguments for the fact that balanced trade is good for the world,” Buffett said in response to a question about trade barriers. “There is no question that trade can be an act of war.” He added that the US “should be looking to trade with the rest of the world.” Which, obviously is what Trump is trying to do, just on far better terms than effete US leadership had accepted gradually over the past few decades.
Continuing a familiar trend, in the first quarter, Berkshire’s cash hoard ballooned to a fresh record, rising to more than $347 billion from around $334 billion at the end of 2024, as the company now holds a record $305.5 billion in Treasury Bills, which to CNBC showed “that Buffett did not use the first-quarter drop in the stock market to deploy the money.” Which, of course, was to be expected since the stock market dropped sharply only at the start of the second quarter.
During the pandemic, Buffett was stymied on the dealmaking front due to high valuations for good businesses, leaving a swollen cash pile and few attractive opportunities to put money to work. Instead of deals, Buffett aggressively leaned into share buybacks to deploy capital, though he broke with that trend by completing a $11.6 billion acquisition of Alleghany Corp. in 2022.
Last year, he decried a lack of meaningful deals that would give the firm a shot at “eye-popping performance” as Berkshire’s cash pile hit yet another record. The few US companies capable of moving the needle at Berkshire had already been “endlessly picked over by us and by others,” he said. Since then, as the billionaire cut his stakes in Apple and Bank of America while refraining from making major deals, Berkshire’s cash pile kept piling up, reaching $347.7 billion as of March 31.
Meanwhile, Berkshire continued to be a net seller of stocks for a 10th quarter in a row, although at a far slower pace, selling just a net $1.5BN in stocks, down sharply from the $6.7BN in Q4 and from the record $75.5BN in Q2 2024.
The report comes as Berkshire enjoys a stellar year-to-date performance, while the broader market languishes. In 2025, Class A shares of Berkshire are up nearly 19%, while the S&P 500 is down 3.3% as uncertainty from tariffs pressures tech and other sectors. Not surprisingly, with the stock surging to a new all time high, for the third quarter in a row, Berkshire did not repurchase any of its  own stock.

Despite Buffett’s large following, his day-to-day management of Berkshire was simple. He long favored a decentralized management approach, allowing the heads of Berkshire’s various businesses to run the operations how they deemed fit and checking in on the operations every now and then.
Buffett considered one of his more important roles to be a capital allocator for Berkshire, figuring out where the money should go, and reportedly spent a lot of time reading in his corporate office in Omaha. That office had just 27 employees as of last year."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-planning-grand-military-parade-to-mark-us-armys-250th-anniversary,Trump Planning Grand Military Parade To Mark US Army’s 250th Anniversary,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 days ago,"A grand military parade will take place on 14 June in Washington DC to honor military veterans and celebrate the 250th anniversary of the army’s founding. The event will also coincide with President Trump’s 79th birthday.
The event was confirmed by White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly, on social media.
“To celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th Birthday on June 14, President Trump will honor American Veterans, active-duty servicemembers, and military history with a military parade,” she said.
A military spokeswoman told The Epoch Times that the celebration would include fireworks and a parade involved thousands of service personnel and hundreds of vehicles.
“The national level celebration will include a spectacular fireworks display, a parade, and a day-long festival on the National Mall,” U.S. Army spokeswoman Heather Hagan said.
“We anticipate approximately 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, and 6,600 Soldiers to highlight the Army’s 250 years of service to the nation.
“Given the significant milestone of 250 years, the Army is exploring options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community.”
The parade will form part of a larger national celebration that is being coordinated under “Task Force 2050,” which President Trump established in an Executive Order, in January, to celebrate 250 years since the American Founding.
Trump proposed a similar military parade during his first term, but that plan was abandoned over the potential cost, which was estimated at $92 million.
The US army was established on 14 June 1775, a year before the Declaration of Independence. The theme of this year’s historic anniversary will be “This We’ll Defend,” and the celebration will highlight the arm’s proud history as well as its future.
“As we prepare for our future, we also reflect on our past,” Gen. Randy George, Chief of Staff of the Army, said in a February statement to announce the 14 June celebrations.
“We remain committed to honing our warfighting skills, enforcing standards and discipline, and living the values that have defined our Army culture for the past 250 years.”
This week, President Trump also suggested he would rename Veterans’ Day and Victory in Europe Day as “Victory Day for World War I” and “Victory Day for World War II,” respectively."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/stephen-miller-top-candidate-to-replace-waltz-as-national-security-advisor,Stephen Miller Top Candidate To Replace Waltz as National Security Advisor,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 days ago,"President Trump’s senior policy advisor Stephen Miller is tipped to replace Mike Waltz as national security advisor.
Multiple sources are reported to have told Axios that the “brains behind Trump’s controversial immigration crackdown” could step into the role after President Trump removed Mike Waltz on Thursday.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio has temporarily taken over Waltz’s role, and Waltz has been nominated as the US’s next ambassador to the United Nations.
Miller is one of the most effective and visible advocates of President Trump’s second-term agenda.
His slick, aggressive briefings, in which he attacks the President’s critics and highlights their glaring hypocrisy on issues like immigration, have become one of the defining features of the new Trump administration. Miller has also slammed activist judges for frustrating the will of the American people and for violating the Constitution.
One source told Axios that Miller has made the Homeland Security Council run “like clockwork”  and that it’s “infinitely more effective than the NSC [National Security Council] with a tiny fraction” of the staff.
Miller has worked closely with Secretary Rubio on immigration already, and that partnership could continue.
“Given how well he’s worked with Marco, many see him as the perfect person to restore the role of the NSA to a staff-level policy role that reports to the chief of staff, instead of some inflated Cabinet position,” a source told Axios.
Another source, however, noted that Miller might not want the job “if it takes him away from his true love: immigration policy.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/second-military-reserve-created-along-southern-border,Second Military Reserve Created along Southern Border,By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 days ago,"The US government has created a second military reserve along the southern border, in an effort to expand the crackdown on migration, which has seen illegal crossings from Mexico fall to a record low since Trump’s inauguration.
The “Texas National Defense Area,” announced on Thursday, will stretch 63 miles east along the southern border from El Paso, on the Texas-New Mexico state line.
The creation of this new Defense Area follows the creation last month of a military zone in the so-called Roosevelt Reservation, a 60-foot corridor that runs along the border from California, through Arizona to New Mexico.
Over 100,000 acres of federal land on the border were transferred to the Department of the Interior on 15 April, allowing military control of the land for three years.
Military control of the lands will allow trespassers to be treated severely and ejected from the US more easily.
The US government has already initiated criminal proceedings against 82 illegal immigrants who entered the Roosevelt Reservation, charging them with “violations of security regulations” and entering a “restricted and controlled” military area.
“Any illegal attempting to enter that zone is entering a military base—a federal, protected area,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in a video message on April 25 during a visit to the area.
“You will be detained. You will be interdicted by U.S. troops and Border Patrol working together.”
“If you have attempted to evade, that’s evading law enforcement, just like you would any other military base,” he added.
“You add up the charges of what you can be charged with misdemeanors and felonies, you can be looking at up to 10 years in prison when prosecuted.”
Nearly 12,000 troops are now stationed along the southern border.
Construction of Trump’s border wall, which was halted during the Biden administration, with spare materials being auctioned at rock-bottom prices, has now resumed.
Border crossings have been radically reduced under President Trump, reaching a monthly level that’s lower than the number who entered on a single day at the height of the Biden border crisis in 2023.
President Trump took to his social-media platform Truth Social to hail the news, at the beginning of March.
“The month of February, my first full month in Office, had the LOWEST number of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter our Country in History – BY FAR! There were only 8,326 apprehensions of Illegals by Border Patrol at the U.S. – Mexico Border, all of whom were quickly ejected from our Nation or, when necessary, prosecuted for crimes against the United States of America
“This means that very few people came – The Invasion of our Country is OVER. In comparison, under Joe Biden, there were 300,000 Illegals crossing in one month, and virtually ALL of them were released into our Country. Thanks to the Trump Administration Policies, the Border is CLOSED to all Illegal Immigrants. Anyone who tries to illegally enter the U.S.A. will face significant criminal penalties and immediate deportation.”"

“Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,” Secretary Rubio posted on Twitter, in response to news that Germany’s intelligence service was now going to classify the AfD as an extremist party, which will allow it to monitor the party.
“That’s not democracy—it’s tyranny in disguise. What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD—which took second in the recent election—but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes. Germany should reverse course.”
In response to Secretary Rubio’s criticism, a Twitter account linked to Germany’s foreign office responded:  “This is democracy. This decision is the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law. It is independent courts that will have the final say. We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.”
This is democracy. This decision is the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law. It is independent courts that will have the final say. We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.
Rubio was joined in criticizing the move by Vice President JD Vance, who said on Twitter that “the German establishment” has “rebuilt the Berlin Wall.”
“The AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it,” Vance wrote on X.
“The West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt – not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment.”
The AfD placed second in February’s federal elections, winning 152 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag. Last month, it topped national opinion polls for the very first time, with 26% support.
The party is especially popular in the economically underdeveloped regions of former East Germany, which were communist until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
Major German parties have refused to form coalitions and work with the AfD as part of a so-called “firewall against the far-right.”
At the Munich Security Conference in February, Vice President Vance slammed the German government for its efforts to isolate the party and frustrate the will of the German people.
“Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There is no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don’t,” Vance said."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-adds-177000-jobs-in-april-and-wages-rise-surpassing-forecasts,"US Adds 177,000 Jobs in April and Wages Rise, Surpassing Forecasts",By Raw Egg Nationalist,2 days ago,"The US economy added over 175,000 jobs in April, far surpassing forecasted job growth. Wages and the labor-force participation rate also rose.
Analysts had forecast that the economy would add nearly 45,000 fewer jobs—133,000—than the actual total of 177,000.
The figures were released as part of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ latest jobs report, and reflect the first nearly-full month of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which sent a shock through global markets and caused outrage and consternation among President Trump’s opponents when they were announced on 2 April.
President Trump subsequently paused the majority of his increased tariffs, but has maintained an elevated rate of 145% for Chinese goods, with some exceptions.
In response to the report, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “This is the second month in a row where the jobs report has beat expectations. Wages are continuing to rise and labor force participation is increasing. This is exactly what we want to see. More Americans working for higher wages. More winning is on the way!”
In a post on Truth Social, President Trump also hailed the effects of his flagship policy on the economy.
“Gasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon, lowest in years, groceries (and eggs!) down, energy down, mortgage rates down, employment strong, and much more good news, as Billions of Dollars pour in from Tariffs,” Trump wrote.
“Just like I said, and we’re only in a TRANSITION STAGE, just getting started!!! Consumers have been waiting for years to see pricing come down. NO INFLATION, THE FED SHOULD LOWER ITS RATE!!!”
Last week, the President said income tax could even be abolished for earners under $200,000, a promise he also made on the campaign trail.
Last week, President Trump said income tax could be abolished for those earning under $200,000, as a result of the income earned from his “reciprocal” tariffs.
“When Tariffs cut in, many people’s Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated,” Trump posted.
“Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year. Also, massive numbers of jobs are already being created, with new plants and factories currently being built or planned. It will be a BONANZA FOR AMERICA!!! THE EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IS HAPPENING!!!”"

President Trump made no secret of his ambition to abolish federal income taxes during his election campaign.
A week before his inauguration, he made another post on Truth Social where he outlined his ambition to replace the Internal Revenue Service, taxing Americans, with an External Revenue Service, taxing foreign trade.
“For far too long, we have relied on taxing our Great People using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),” President Trump posted.
“Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves. It is time for that to change. I am today announcing that I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources. We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
Despite the uncertainty created by President Trump’s tariffs, wages rose in April and the US economy added over 175,000 new jobs.
“This is the second month in a row where the jobs report has beat expectations. Wages are continuing to rise and labor force participation is increasing. This is exactly what we want to see.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-california-bullet-train-is-a-good-lesson-in-political-deception,The California Bullet Train Is a Good Lesson in Political Deception,By William L. Anderson | Mises Institute,3 days ago,"This week, my wife and I have traveled Amtrak’s route to and from Bakersfield, California, with the Amtrak line running down the state’s Central Valley past cities like Fresno and Modesto. As our train sped down the tracks at speeds of up to 83 mph, we could see construction of the much-hyped boondoggle known simply as the California Bullet Train.
Much has been written about the proposed (and proposed really is an understatement) project, which is supposed to run entirely by electricity created from renewable resources. In 2008, California voters approved a bond issue of $9.9 billion to determine the feasibility of the proposed high-speed railroad that would link San Francisco and Los Angeles with a then-$33 billion price tag. I have weighed in myself on this project and its spiraling costs (the present estimated total cost being $135 billion…and rising), writing:
If one tries to make sense of an exercise in spending billions of dollars for a Train to Nowhere, one cannot use conventional financial logic. There is a logical process at work, but it is a logic of a different sort than what appeals to a typical reader of this page. Political logic, especially in a state like California where progressive politics dominates, veers sharply from economic and business logic.
But what does the Central Valley have to do with linking the two California cities, both of which are on the Pacific coast far away from the likes of Bakersfield and Fresno? There already exists a rail link between LA and San Francisco, but it is the slow-moving Amtrak that must make its way through the Coastal Range that runs down the western part of the state. (An aspiring rail rider would board a CalTrans train from San Francisco to San Jose, then hop aboard Amtrak’s Coast Starlight there as it passes through once a day).
It seems that the promoters of the Bullet Train also are having to bow to the state’s varied geography, which brings us back to construction in the Central Valley. As we looked out the window in the brand-new Amtrak passenger cars recently manufactured for the San Joaquins route, we saw huge concrete viaducts in various stages of completion between Bakersfield and Merced—and that was all the construction we would be able to see, since there is no construction anywhere else on the proposed route.
Understand that no private firm would build a railroad like this because it could never recoup its original costs. The current projected outlay of $135 billion almost surely will grow, as the project continues to miss its goals and run into more difficulties. It will be mathematically impossible for the rail line ever to turn a profit, even if it ever is completed—which is highly doubtful.
This leaves us with the line between Bakersfield and Merced, which is not scheduled for completion before 2030 and probably won’t be available until 2033. To understand the absurdity of the whole thing, one should remember that this original Bakersfield-Merced line is being built first because it has the friendliest geography—the Central Valley being flat—which means the trains can run for miles on straight tracks, avoiding the hairpin turns through the mountains that would be a feature elsewhere in the state.
(I have ridden Amtrak many times in California, including going over the Sierra Nevada and in and around the Coastal Range south of San Jose. High-speed rail could not function in these places).
But, even given the flat terrain, much of the Bakersfield-Merced line will have to run on huge concrete viaducts that are extremely costly and will take years to complete. To put it another way, if the lowest-hanging fruit for a rail line has been extremely costly, think what will be the case if they ever try to carve a path around and through the mountains that surround Los Angeles.
To put it another way, as we looked at the ongoing construction of this rail line, we were not looking at success, but rather a huge governmental failure. One would think this would be obvious to nearly everyone, but when California Governor Gavin Newsom and local politicians dedicated this rail line, the rhetoric was so delusional that it was comical. Here are some snippets:
Members of the community and Gov. Gavin Newsom gathered in Kern County where the initial operating segment is taking place. Leticia Perez, chairwoman of the Kern County board of supervisors, said that this project is important for residents of California’s rural Central Valley, providing a 171-mile system from Merced to Bakersfield.
“What is represented today is a game changer, a transformative moment for the Kern County workforce – our access to UC Merced, our access to other parts of the state,” Perez said.
“As a resident of Fresno County, the high-speed rail built right here in the valley has been a dream come true,” said Structures Superintendent Anthony Canales who has been working on the project since 2015. “This is not just a transportation program; it’s a transformation project.”
However, the Central Valley already has passenger rail courtesy of Amtrak and if what we saw on our trip with near-empty cars is an indication of the Amtrak ridership of that area, one seriously doubts that high-speed rail—while a curiosity—will make a difference for people in that valley. The local political rhetoric notwithstanding, even if this monstrosity is completed, it won’t be a “game changer” but rather a conversation piece at best."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/washington-wants-direct-ukraine-russia-peace-negotiations,Washington Wants Direct Ukraine / Russia Peace Negotiations,By Sean Miller,3 days ago,"On Thursday Vice President JD Vance said that it is now up to Russia and Ukraine to come to a peace agreement, following the signing of President Donald Trump’s mineral deal which codifies Washington’s economic partnership with Kiev. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce announced that day that the U.S. will no longer serve as a mediator in peace negotiations between the two countries.
Previously, the U.S. hosted events where it played the middleman between Russia and Ukraine. Recently both the President and Vice President have said that they are close to walking away from the quarrel if a peace plan isn’t agreed to soon.
“It’s going to be up to them [Russia and Ukraine] to come to an agreement and stop this brutal, brutal conflict,” Vance told Fox News on Thursday. “It’s not going anywhere Bret, it’s not going to end anytime soon, and I think for the Ukrainians, yes of course they’re angry that they were invaded, but are we going to continue to lose thousands and thousands of soldiers over a few miles of territory this or that way. I hope both of them come to their senses.”
“Look, I am optimistic, but it is ultimately, it’s hard to say confident, because the Russians and Ukrainians, they’re the ones who have to take the finals step. We got them talking, we got them offering peace proposals, we got the minerals deal done, I think we’re in a place where they got to say ‘we’re done with the fighting, we’re done with losing thousands and thousands of young people, we’re done with this.’ But only Russia and Ukraine can make that decision, that’s not something even President Trump could do for them,” Vance said Thursday.
A day earlier, Vance explained that the U.S. was instrumental in progressing the agenda of peace, and that Washington will now work to bring Russia and Ukraine together so they can negotiate peace with one another directly.
“So, we’ve got this first step,” Vance said Wednesday. “We’ve got the peace proposal out there and issued, and we’re going to work very hard over the next 100 days to try to bring these guys together.”
On Thursday, another Washington official clarified that the U.S. will no longer mediate meetings between Moscow and Kiev, as has been done in the first 100 days of the Trump administration, yet Washington will be still be committed to helping in other ways.
“We will not be the mediators,” Bruce told reporters when asked about Washington’s future role. “We certainly are still committed to it and we’ll help and do what we can, but we are not going to fly around the world at the drop of a hat to mediate meetings.”
President Trump formed a foundation for the peace talks between Moscow and Kiev. U.S. financial and industrial interest will have a foothold in Ukraine under the mineral deal, yet it appears Bruce wants the two Slavic countries to work out a military settlement themselves. This is potentially because the chance for lasting peace is greater when the countries in question have complete control over the negotiation process.
“It’s time for both of the nations involved in this conflict to come up with concrete proposals about how this conflict ends. It’s going to be up to them,” Bruce said.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Western Europe must also want and show political will for peace in the conflict as well."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/breaking-germanys-afd-party-is-declared-definitely-right-wing-extremist-by-bfv-spy-agency-paving-the-way-for-a-ban,"BREAKING: Germany’s AfD Party is Declared ‘Definitely Right-Wing Extremist’ by Spy Agency, Paving The Way For a Ban",By Staff | Remix,3 days ago,"The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been declared “definitely right-wing extremist,” by the powerful domestic spy agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). The party is reacting with outrage.
The BfV claims that the party is pursuing efforts against the “free democratic order,” which the agency now says is “certain.”
Previously, the party was only declared as a “suspected case,” with this new designation paving the way for not only a ban but also mass surveillance of the entire party, including all its members. With this new designation, the BfV can surveil members, including their emails, phone calls, and chats, without a warrant. In addition, the BfV can now legally infiltrate the entire party with informants and use other spy techniques.
Already, other parts of the AfD at the state level were classified as “definitely right-wing extremist,” but the new designation now applies this label to the entire national party.
The party is reacting with outrage, with Alice Weidel, the co-leader of the party, writing:
“The decision of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is a severe blow to German democracy!”
Regarding the statement by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, AfD federal spokespersons Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said:
Today’s decision by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution is a severe blow to German democracy: In current polls, the AfD is the strongest force. The federal government only has four days left in office, the intelligence agency doesn’t even have a president anymore. And the classification as a so-called suspected case is not yet legally binding.
Nevertheless, the AfD, as an opposition party, is now being publicly discredited and criminalized shortly before the change of government. The associated, targeted interference in the democratic decision-making process is therefore clearly politically motivated. The AfD will continue to defend itself legally against these defamations that endanger democracy.”
The BfV, however, is attempting to justify its decision, which will be seen by many as an attack on the country’s largest opposition party.
Due to the “extremist character of the entire party, which disregards human dignity,” the BfV noted in its statement. Vice presidents of the authority, Sinan Selen and Silke Willems, further indicated that statements and positions of the party “violate the principle of human dignity.”
One of the key factors that the BfV is attempting to use to justify the designation is the AfD’s alleged position on “ethnic Germans.”
“The ethnic-descendant understanding of the people prevailing in the party is not compatible with the free democratic basic order,” reads the statement from the BfV. “The AfD, for example, does not consider German citizens with a migration history from predominantly Muslim countries to be equal members of the German people, as ethnically defined by the party.”

The BfV, which has been led by a Christian Democrat for years who was rabidly opposed to the AfD, a rival party, further writes: “The BfV reached this conclusion after an intensive and comprehensive expert review. Following its statutory mandate, the BfV was required to assess the party’s actions against the central fundamental principles of the constitution: human dignity, the principle of democracy, and the rule of law. In doing so, in addition to the federal party’s platform and statements, the statements and other behavior of its representatives, as well as their connections to right-wing extremist actors and groups, were examined in particular.”
The BfV is no longer led by Thomas Haldenwang (CDU), but here he is discussing the AfD during his tenure. Haldenwang gave up his position to run as an MP but he lost his seat.

The news comes at a time when the AfD is the number one party in the country, according to national polls, a position it has achieved for the first time. As the party surges, its democratic rivals are becoming increasingly concerned, prompting calls for a ban from not only the left, but also the traditional “center-right,” which has shifted more and more to the left over the years.
The latest designation was a key plan in the move to ban the party, with many so-called “moderates” waiting for the BfV designation to move forward with a vote to ban the party.
However, there is no sign yet of how a ban will move forward, with many in the CDU skeptical about banning the most popular party in the country, along with some from the left as well.
Previous attempts to ban the far-right NPD, which took some notably extremist stances, were unsuccessful, with the top court arguing that the party was not large enough to represent a serious threat to the democratic order. There were also questions about the excessive number of informants, making it difficult to ascertain how much of the extremism in the party was due to informants versus the party’s own members.
However, the AfD, in contrast, is not only popular but is now the most popular party in the country.
Emil Sänze, the AfD leader in the state association of AfD leader Alice Weidel, said this was a deliberate attempt to weaken the largest opposition party. He told Bild, “This is outrageous. A purely political decision in the run-up to the chancellor election on May 6.”"

But already, Nigel Farage’s populist Reform Party is the big winner of the day.
Indeed, after the party won the Runcorn and Helsby parliamentary by-election by six votes, new Reform MP Sarah Pochin declared Farage as “the next prime minister of this great country.”
Thank you Runcorn & Helsby. Enough Tory failures, enough Labour lies.Reform UK is the party of change. pic.twitter.com/YFHLemZJKj
The result is close but momentous, not least given the fact that this was one of Labour’s safest seats in England. Waking up this morning, Prime Minister Keir Starmer might well have questioned whether there is such a thing as a safe seat anymore. Reform’s rapid rise certainly means there are far fewer of them.
Party chairman Zia Yusuf said this was “a historic day for Britain”—one which sets great expectations for wider victories at the next general election.
The Conservatives, Britain’s ‘official’ opposition party, finished more than 10,000 votes behind Reform, only beating the largely irrelevant Green Party by 27 votes, prompting Farage to say there was “no doubt” that
In most of the country we are now the main opposition party to this government.
The result certainly helps to embed in the minds of voters that the way to beat Labour is to vote Reform—in other words, “if you vote Conservative, you will get Labour.”
As of 10:00 a.m. (BST), Reform has also won 79 council seats, which is more than any other party. It is currently winning close to 40% of the vote, more than 10 points ahead of the Tories.
This is already a major blow to the establishment parties. And it’s only the beginning."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/imf-and-world-bank-crony-covid-crackdown-enablers,IMF and World Bank: Crony Covid Crackdown Enablers,By James Bovard | Brownstone Institute,4 days ago,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained last week that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are suffering from “mission creep.” But Bessent announced that Trump will be “doubling down” on supporting the largest foreign aid gushers on earth. “Far from stepping back, ‘America First’ seeks to expand U.S. leadership in international institutions like the I.M.F. and World Bank,” Bessent declared.
Bessent complained that the IMF “devotes disproportionate time and resources to work on climate change, gender, and social issues.” Unfortunately, Bessent said nothing about how the IMF and World Bank bankrolled many of the worst crony Covid crackdown policies.
But what should the US government expect when Congress and endless presidents give the World Bank and IMF billions of US tax dollars to play with? The US government is on the hook for $52 billion to the World Bank. The US has a financial commitment of $183 billion to the IMF.
The IMF was created in 1944 to shore up currencies and help nations with temporary balance-of-payment problems. In the decades since the IMF’s founding, global capital markets and fluctuating currency exchange rates have made the IMF a relic. But too many people have gotten rich from IMF largesse to permit the curtain to be closed on this institution.
The IMF enabled scores of governments that chose to pointlessly shut down their own economies after the outbreak of Covid-19. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva declared in April 2021, “While the recovery [from Covid] is underway, too many countries are falling behind and economic inequality is worsening. Strong policy action is needed to give everyone a fair shot—a shot in the arm to end the pandemic everywhere, and a shot at a better future for vulnerable people and countries.”
The IMF’s “fair shot” consisted of its international bureaucrats providing scores of billions of dollars in “emergency financing” to 80 governments, most of whom exploited Covid to stretch their own power. The IMF provided emergency relief via the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) to 29 governments to supposedly help them “combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” The IMF’s deluge of handouts to government helped fuel the worldwide inflation surge in recent years.
The World Bank President Ajay Banga “has sought to emphasize the bank’s focus on job creation…and to prioritize private sector involvement in projects around the world,” the New York Times reported. But the World Bank’s notion of the private sector has often been either a fraud or a political smokescreen. In the late 1980s, the World Bank touted its loans to Communist nations as private sector-oriented loans – one bait-and-switch too many, as I detailed in a 1988 Wall Street Journal article. And permitting the Bank to exonerate its handouts by counting illusory jobs created is a recipe for make-work scams.
The Covid pandemic provided the World Bank with the chance to play savior. In the first months of the pandemic, the Bank proudly announced that its “emergency operations to fight COVID-19 (coronavirus) have reached 100 developing countries – home to 70% of the world’s population.” From April 2020 to March 2021, the World Bank “committed over $200 billion, an unprecedented level of financial support, to public and private sector clients to fight the impacts of the pandemic.  Our support is tailored to the health, economic, and social shocks that countries are facing.” The fact that the World Bank was effectively financing governments to pointlessly shock their own nations was omitted from celebratory press releases.
The IMF and World Bank have helped turn many foreign nations into kleptocracies – governments of thieves. A 2002 American Economic Review analysis concluded that “increases in [foreign] aid are associated with contemporaneous increases in corruption,” and that “corruption is positively correlated with aid received from the United States.”
Most importantly, neither the IMF nor the World Bank has any qualms about bankrolling tyranny. A 2015 report of the United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, concluded that the World Bank “now stands almost alone, along with the International Monetary Fund, in insisting that human rights are matters of politics which it must, as a matter of legal principle, avoid, rather than being an integral part of the international legal order.”
The Bank justifies this position by insisting that it cannot involve “itself in the partisan politics or ideological disputes that affect its member countries” by improper methods such as “favoring political factions, parties or candidates in elections,” or “endorsing or mandating a particular form of government, political bloc or political ideology.”
But any time an international organization financially bails out a regime, it bolsters its power. After the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon coined a term that perfectly captures the effect of foreign aid: “Money as a Weapon System.” The 2015 UN report noted that “the existing approach taken by the World Bank to human rights is incoherent, counterproductive and unsustainable. For most purposes, the World Bank is a human rights-free zone. In its operational policies, in particular, it treats human rights more like an infectious disease than universal values and obligations.”
The World Bank actively blindfolds itself to avoid hearing about atrocities in nations ruled by governments that it is bankrolling. The Special Rapporteur noted, “By refusing to take account of any information emanating from human rights sources, the Bank places itself in an artificial bubble.”
The Trump administration’s lust for “doubling down” on the IMF and World Bank is dicey to reconcile with their terminating 90% of foreign aid contracts from the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Cynics across the land rejoiced that Washington policymakers finally recognized one of the biggest swindles of the past 80 years.
If the Trump team can’t even get sound policy on the World Bank, then what hope is there of them resolving any more complex challenges? I was briefly a consultant for the World Bank in the late 1980s, getting paid to co-author a report on the follies of farm subsidies. At that point, Reagan administration officials had periodically caterwauled about the Bank for almost a decade, and they were followed by sporadic howling by the US Treasury Department ever since. Secretary Bessent complained on Wednesday that the World Bank “should no longer expect blank checks for vapid, buzzword-centric marketing accompanied by halfhearted commitments to reform.” But after almost a half-century of failed US attempts to reform the Bank and IMF, there is no reason to expect any boondoggles to be left behind."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/is-this-the-man-who-created-covid-19-in-faucis-us-lab,Is This the Man Who Created Covid-19 in Fauci’s US Lab?,By Will Jones | Brownstone Institute,4 days ago,"Top US virologist Ralph Baric engineered the Covid-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 in his lab at the University of North Carolina as part of his work in connection with the 2018 DEFUSE funding proposal. That’s the story that’s been going round the internet for some months now (and not just in alternative media) and it all looks very damning for Baric and those connected with his research.
Details of the DEFUSE project were first leaked by Major Joseph Murphy, an employee of US military research agency DARPA, in the summer of 2021 and further details of earlier drafts have come to light this month thanks to public record requests from U.S. Right to Know (USRTK).
In DEFUSE, Baric proposed to create a virus that was, to most intents and purposes, SARS-CoV-2. The proposal included inserting a furin cleavage site into a coronavirus spike protein, an order for the restrictive enzyme BsmBI, the search for a binding domain that would infect ACE2 human receptors and a requirement for a viral genome around 25% different to SARS.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains a furin cleavage site in its spike protein, its genome includes the restrictive enzyme BsmBI, it has a receptor binding domain finely tuned to infect the ACE2 human receptor and its genome is around 25% different to SARS. A number of virologists have said that such features make SARS-CoV-2 a smoking gun for an engineered virus.
Baric obtained a patent for such novel viruses in 2018, just as he was putting DEFUSE together. In DEFUSE he proposed to infect wild Chinese bats with his newly patented viruses.
Many regard this as case closed for the lab leak.
But this is not the full story. That’s because Baric’s DEFUSE proposal did not win the DARPA funding. And while it is rightly pointed out that, with or without the funding, much of the work was already in hand, it’s what happened next with the winning DARPA proposal where the story really gets interesting.
US researcher Jim Haslam has done an incredible job on his Substack article Reverse engineering the origins of SARS-CoV-2 documenting all the toings and froings among the virology community in connection with the creation of this peculiar virus and the subsequent cover-up. What follows is in large part indebted to his meticulous research, though any errors are of course my own.
The winning 2018 DARPA bid was for a project called PREEMPT led by Dr. Vincent Munster (pictured above) based at Anthony Fauci’s NIH Rocky Mountain Lab. Both PREEMPT and Baric’s losing DEFUSE project had the same basic idea: to try to prevent a (hypothetical) future pandemic by using an engineered SARS virus to vaccinate the bats from which it is believed such a virus was likely to spill over.
The idea being, of course, that the vaccinated bats would no longer be a reservoir for the virus, thus ‘defusing’ or ‘preempting’ the zoonotic spillover. Sounds crazy? Too right – far too much meddling with nature and placing too much faith in the ability of vaccines to prevent infection and transmission. But crazy or not, that’s what the scientists proposed, and PREEMPT won and DEFUSE lost.
The key difference between Baric’s DEFUSE and Munster’s PREEMPT – aside from PREEMPT coming in around $4 million cheaper at $10 million – is that rather than relying on spraying bat caves with a non-transmissible virus-vaccine, Munster’s plan involved making the virus-vaccine transmit between the bats via aerosols. This made it a self-spreading vaccine, able (in theory) to reach all the bats without humans having to go and find all their caves and spray them. The risks of such a plan should have been obvious. Indeed, Baric himself, who went awfully quiet after his DEFUSE project leaked in mid-2021, resurfaced in mid-2023 to say that such work involving engineering transmissible virus-vaccines was “too edgy” for him.
After the DARPA funding went to PREEMPT, Fauci rode to Baric’s rescue with a bumper $82 million programme called CREID, awarded in summer 2019, in which both Baric and Munster’s teams would cooperate in the research into Munster’s concept of self-spreading bat vaccines.
Exactly what happened next is not publicly documented, so we do need to fill in some gaps. It appears that Munster took Baric’s patented SARS virus-vaccine and made a transmissible version at his Rocky Mountain Lab (Baric’s version was not intended to be transmissible). What is the evidence for that? Perhaps most telling is that, as Haslam observes, SARS-CoV-2 transmits efficiently in only five known mammals, and those five – American deer, American deer mice, Syrian hamsters, American mink, and Egyptian fruit bats – are all found in Munster (and Fauci’s) Rocky Mountain Lab in Montana. SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t infect lab animals common in Chinese labs or present in the WIV, such as Chinese horseshoe bats. This would suggest that SARS-CoV-2 acquired its transmissibility in an American lab context and not a Chinese one or elsewhere.
The virus-vaccine having been made transmissible in Montana, it would then have been sent to the WIV to be tested on Chinese bats, which were not available in American labs. There can be little doubt who would have done this testing at the WIV, as there was only one scientist with the necessary connections and expertise.
Dr. Danielle Anderson, known as Dani to her colleagues, gained fame in June 2021 as the “last and only foreign scientist in the Wuhan lab” as she went public to make the case for a zoonotic origin. Dani was a member of the Lancet origins commission, chaired by Jeffrey Sachs and disbanded by him in October 2021 over frustrations that the Western virologists like Dani weren’t cooperating. Dani was based on and off at the WIV in the high security BSL4 lab (not Shi Zhengli’s BSL2 lab), but she didn’t work for the WIV. She worked for Duke-NUS, the Singapore-based medical school of North Carolina’s Duke University, under the virologist Dr. Linfa Wang. Linfa and Anderson were part of Baric’s DEFUSE proposal, and Duke-NUS was later a partner in Fauci’s CREID project.
Anderson’s role in DEFUSE was to test the virus-vaccines on “wild-caught captive” Chinese horseshoe bats at the WIV. It is thus reasonable to assume it is her who would be responsible for testing Munster’s self-spreading virus-vaccine on the same Chinese bats. This would explain how the virus got to Wuhan.
It would explain, in other words, how a non-transmissible virus-vaccine designed by Ralph Baric at UNC as per the DEFUSE proposal became a transmissible virus and ended up on the loose in Wuhan. Namely, because it escaped via a laboratory-acquired infection during Anderson’s testing of it on Chinese horseshoe bats in her WIV BSL4 lab, with Dani herself or a colleague as patient zero.
Admittedly, we don’t have direct evidence of this – we don’t have direct evidence that a Munster-Baric SARS-2 virus-vaccine was being tested on Chinese bats in the WIV in 2019, nor that Dr. Anderson or a colleague was infected by it in the lab. But there is a heap of evidence that points to it as a likely scenario.
We know, for instance, that both Baric and Munster were proposing to vaccinate Chinese bats using an engineered virus based on SARS, with a furin cleavage site inserted to increase infectivity. We know that Munster’s PREEMPT proposal, in which the virus-vaccine was to be self-spreading, won the DARPA funding, beating Baric’s DEFUSE proposal for a non-self-spreading virus-vaccine, and that in 2019 both teams were brought together in an $82 million grant from Fauci’s NIAID.
We know that SARS-CoV-2 readily transmits in the lab animals found in Munster’s Rocky Mountain Lab but not in the lab animals found in the WIV. From this we can further conclude that Dr. Anderson’s experiment to infect Chinese horseshoe bats with the new virus at the WIV presumably failed. This may be why she left Wuhan at the end of November, which was the deadline for the ‘scientific merit review’ for CREID.
We also know that where Dani and her colleagues lived in central Wuhan was an early epicentre for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, based on social media data.
It also appears that Dani’s supervisor Linfa Wang may have quickly realised that SARS-CoV-2 was one of his viruses. This would explain why he resigned from his post as Director of Duke’s Emerging Infectious Disease programme, a position he had held for nearly a decade, on the same day that the genome was published, January 10th 2020. The reason for his abrupt resignation has never been disclosed.
Four days earlier he had told the New York Times he was frustrated that scientists in China were not allowed to speak to him about the outbreak. He cautioned against panic, arguing the virus was likely not spreading between humans because health workers had not contracted the disease. But privately was he fretting that it was from his lab – is that why he immediately resigned when the genome was published? It is hard to understand what else could have led him to quit so suddenly at that point, and the lack of explanation adds to the suspicion. He later called January 10th “the most important day in the Covid-19 outbreak” because it was when the genome was published.
If Linfa was anticipating the bad news, it could have been because he and Dani had been aware of the leak at the time it happened. Analysis of mobile phone records discovered an apparent shutdown of Dr. Anderson’s BSL4 lab between October 7th and 24th 2019 (identified by the lack of mobile phone usage in the vicinity). Nothing further has come to light about this incident and what lay behind it, but if it does denote a laboratory-acquired infection that Anderson and Linfa (and presumably others) were aware of, it would explain a lot.
Such a scenario would also explain why Shi Zhengli had been eager to publish the sequence for the RaTG13 virus she held (the preprint appeared on January 23rd 2020), despite this suggesting to many a non-natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. In the paper, the WIV scientist implied that SARS-CoV-2 had not emerged naturally from RaTG13, despite it being the closest known virus (“no evidence for recombination events was detected in the genome”). Publishing it showed that her (BSL2) lab had nothing to hide as it was not involved in the work. The realisation that it was an engineered virus from the US may also have driven the panic that pushed the Chinese Government to lock Wuhan down around the same time.
Since 2021, Ralph Baric has thrown himself into developing vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, even entertaining fantasies of “ring vaccination,” as is done with Ebola, to try to stop the outbreak in its tracks. Is this his way of trying to make amends, however misguided? I wonder if we are also able to detect a hint of him pointing to who he thinks is really to blame for the debacle, when he remarks that “governments, rather than scientists” are primarily responsible for choosing which risky gain-of-function experiments to fund and run – a reference perhaps to how Munster’s “edgy” engineering of transmissible virus-vaccines was picked over his non-transmissible version.
“It looks like American science is going to get shredded for a pandemic that started in China,” he told Time‘s Dan Werb, reverting to denial. When Werb suggested to him that despite the “conspiracy theories” there are many people happy that he became a scientist in the first place, he replied: “A fair number that probably wished I hadn’t. Let’s be honest.”
Is that the closest we’ll get to a confession?"

According to ‘multiple sources familiar with their departure,’ following the Signal snafu, Waltz admitted behind closed doors to the authenticity of Goldberg’s reporting – however he never offered to resign, and President Trump did not ask him to step down.
Wong, meanwhile, served in the first Trump administration as deputy special representative for North Korea, as well as deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department.
The Signal fiasco set off a firestorm of calls for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to resign…
Goldberg is still trying to blame Hegseth for everything, when Michael Waltz is the one responsible for the entire snafu. Now why would that be? Why would Goldberg repeatedly attack a victim of the breach instead of HIS FRIEND WHO SECRETLY INVITED HIM IN?It’s a real mystery. https://t.co/vjq9hO35P6
Among some 18 individuals listed as members of a Signal group that Goldberg was ‘inadvertently’ invited to included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President Vance, national security adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State is Marco Antonio Rubio, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.
According to Politico, the White House has been discussing names for a replacement ‘for weeks,’ but ‘the plans to remove Waltz potentially as soon as this week gained steam in recent days.’

https://www.infowars.com/posts/russian-official-says-trumps-mineral-deal-forces-ukraine-to-pay-for-future-us-military-aid,Russian Official Says Trump’s Mineral Deal Forces Ukraine to Pay For Future US Military Aid,By Sean Miller,4 days ago,"Following the signing of President Donald Trump’s mineral deal by Ukraine, Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said that Washington has broken the Zelensky Regime with the agreement. He posited that Washington is effectively forcing Kiev to pay the U.S. for its future military aid. Medvedev’s analysis appears to pan out based on statements by Reuters, The New York Times and the Ukrainian official who signed the deal.
“Trump has broken the Kiev regime to the point where they will have to pay for U.S. aid with mineral resources,” Medvedev said on Telegram. “Now they (Ukrainians) will have to pay for military supplies with the national wealth of a disappearing country.”
U.S. military aid, specifically air defense, is part of the mineral deal, however that aid will be derived from the newly created fund, which is paid for by Ukraine’s own mineral resources.
“The Fund will finance reconstruction efforts, with both sides contributing – including via future U.S. military aid in the form of air defense, a notable change from the last deal draft,” the Kiev Post said Wednesday.
While the full text of the final mineral deal has not yet been officially published, several sources have reported on the fact the agreement does not provide specific ‘security guarantees’ for Ukraine, a key stipulation of Ukrainian Dictator Vladimir Zelensky’s ‘victory plan‘.
“The Trump administration did not immediately provide details about the agreement, and it was not clear what it meant for the future of American military support for Ukraine. One person familiar with the negotiations, discussing them on the condition of anonymity, said the final deal does not include explicit guarantees of future U.S. security assistance. Another said the United States rejected that idea early in the process,” The New York Times said Wednesday.
“The agreement did not, however, provide any concrete U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, one of its initial goals,” Reuters said Wednesday.
Ukraine’s First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who was the official that signed the mineral deal on behalf of Kiev, discussed possible future U.S. military aid by explaining Washington will contribute to the fund, however she saved face by not specifically stating these U.S. contributions are investments aimed at revenue generation based off Ukraine’s own mineral resources.
“How will the Fund work? The United States will contribute to the Fund. In addition to direct financial contributions, it may also provide NEW assistance — for example, air defense systems for Ukraine,” she said Wednesday.

Terrible timing then, so far as Keir Starmer is concerned, for former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair to blast the current government’s net zero agenda as “irrational” because voters are being asked—or, in many cases, forced—to make serious sacrifices despite making “minimal” differences to the planet.
A report from Blair’s institute was received furiously by Labour, with local officials saying they were “incredibly p****d off” about the impact it could have on the local elections. One party source also bashed the ex-PM’s “public tantrum” as “really unhelpful.” The story splashed on most national newspapers on Wednesday.
The row got worse after Environment Secretary Steve Reed praised Blair for making a “valid and important contribution,” adding that he agreed “with much of what he said.” And senior officials later refused to guarantee that Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband will keep his job.
Farage was, of course, delighted by the very public row, hailing on social media:
Even Tony Blair now says the push for net zero has become “irrational” and “hysterical.”
We are winning the argument!
The Reform leader believes net zero could be the new Brexit, “where parliament is so hopelessly out of touch with the country.”
The Tony Blair Institute report said that simply limiting fossil fuels was “doomed to fail” and pushed for a different approach.
By the time Blair U-turned, attempting to paint Starmer’s approach as “the right one,” the damage had already been done. The green agenda’s role in this week’s major blackouts across the Iberian Peninsula will also have helped to paint a picture of just how dangerous the road to net zero is.
Not that Blair is guilt-free on this front, nor that his institute’s report is not still wedded to the view that Europe must act to avoid a climate emergency. Perhaps, as Net Zero Watch’s Andrew Montford suggested, he is simply trying to “remain on the right side of history.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/future-of-the-party-epp-elects-weber-loyalist-as-new-secretary-general,‘Future of the Party’: EPP Elects Weber ‘Loyalist’ as New Secretary General,By Tamás Orbán | The European Conservative,4 days ago,"After reelecting Manfred Weber as party president the day before, the European People’s Party (EPP) congress in Valencia on Wednesday also elected its new secretary-general and ten vice presidents. The composition of the new EPP leadership reflects the party’s desire to become a more centralized political powerhouse to dominate all three EU institutions.
The EPP’s new secretary general—Weber’s right-hand woman—is Spanish MEP Dolors Montserrat, the leader of the Spanish PP’s EU Parliamentary delegation and vice-chair of the EPP group in Brussels.
Montserrat’s election did not come as a surprise: she was tapped for the role by Weber himself a month ago, and since he was the only candidate for the presidency, his appointee also ended up on the ‘ticket’ unchallenged.
Similarly to Weber’s dual role as group chairman and party president—something that many staffers have complained about, both due to the centralization of power and the corresponding double salary—Montserrat is also expected to keep her parliamentary jobs in addition to her new title.
The 51-year-old is the first woman to hold the second most powerful position in Europe’s largest party family. According to Weber, she represents a “younger” and more “modern” party, the “EPP of tomorrow.”
In reality, however, Montserrat was selected because of her unquestionable loyalty to Weber and willingness to carry out his centralizing mission with ongoing reforms, widely seen as a massive power grab both within and outside the party.
As we described in more detail here, Weber is actively restructuring the operational model of the EPP by deepening his “presidency coordination” system—having delegation leaders, national ministers, and even EPP commissioners agree on joint party lines before every major meeting or decision—as well as handing down policy priorities to members across all three EU institutions without much room for dissent, making sure that he at any point has personal control over the legislative process.
Weber’s methods have often been described as “authoritarian,” with the president aggressively pursuing his manufactured consensus. As one EPP official recently described it, anonymously, it often goes along the lines of: “Here’s a draft, if I don’t get a response in the next 30 hours, we will pass this.”
While this centralization has been ongoing for the past three years, Weber is reportedly shifting gears in this new term, seeking to completely unify the party position across all institutions and in all political matters, under his strict supervision. And to carry this out—being as unpopular among his own cadres as he is—Weber needs someone at his side who would never question him.
And that’s what Montserrat is. When she was asked by reporters how she imagines her role as secretary general—previously a largely administrative but now increasingly politicized role—Montserrat’s reply showed that she knew perfectly what was expected. “I want to be a politician. Loyal to my president, Manfred, of course.”
Corresponding to Weber’s vision, EPP’s ten new vice-presidents represent every EU institution: Parliament, Council, and Commission. However, unlike in the previous presidency, which was dominated by MEPs, an increased number of positions have now been given to government officials representing the national parties, which is meant to counterbalance the fact—even if just superficially—that Weber is elevating himself to be on par or even above them.
The most powerful new vice presidents include Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo; Antonio Tajani and Kostis Hatzidakis, deputy PMs of Italy and Greece, respectively; as well as Dubravka Šuica, the Croatian executive vice-president of the European Commission, and Magnus Brunner, the EU Commissioner for internal affairs from Austria.
As we noted above, the appointment of a large number of national party leaders to the EPP presidency is not accidental. Weber expects to have much more control over policy decisions even in the national capitals, and this is how he plans to achieve that: by symbolically elevating his partners but keeping the real power to himself."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/ukraine-officially-signs-trumps-mineral-deal,Ukraine Officially Signs Trump’s Mineral Deal,By Sean Miller,5 days ago,"On Wednesday Kiev signed President Donald Trump’s mineral deal which aims to bring about the end of the Ukraine war while also paying the U.S. back for the military aid Washington supplied it.
“I am glad to announce the signing of today’s historic economic partnership agreement between the United States and Ukraine establishing the United States Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday. “This partnership allows the United States to invest alongside Ukraine to unlock Ukraine’s growth assets, mobilize American talent, capital and governance standards that will improve Ukraine’s investment climate and accelerate Ukraine’s economic recovery.”

The final agreement includes a 50/50 split of mineral resource revenue between Washington and Kiev, as well as future U.S. military aid. Both of these provisions were added back after being removed due to Ukrainian Dictator Vladimir Zelensky continuing his war.
“The Fund will finance reconstruction efforts, with both sides contributing – including via future U.S. military aid in the form of air defense, a notable change from the last deal draft,” the Kiev Post said.
The new economic partnership has geopolitical implications as well.
“Today’s agreement signals clearly to Russian leadership that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” the Treasury Secretary said. “It’s time for this cruel and senseless war to end.”
In the hours prior to the official signing, Moscow urged Kiev to begin direct peace talks with the Kremlin.
On February 28 Ukraine’s Dictator went to Washington where he insulted America in the White House, then refused to sign the mineral deal and was escorted out of the building.
Following his diplomatic debacle, Zelensky managed to continue botching the deal, going so far as to even have a number of provisions for his country removed from it. Later, Kiev sent ‘a team‘ of delegates to Washington to actually negotiate the deal without the Dictator present.
On April 18 Ukrainian officials agreed to a preliminary mineral deal, paving the way for the official signing of the final agreement.
Moscow has also been affected by President Trump’s geopolitical operations. On Tuesday the Kremlin announced it had backtracked on a previous policy and is now willing to engage in direct peace negotiations with the government in Kiev after Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff held numerous talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/house-overwhelmingly-passes-take-it-down-act-mandating-rapid-online-deepfake-non-consensual-imagery-takedowns,"House Overwhelmingly Passes “Take It Down Act” Mandating Rapid Online Deepfake, Non-Consensual Imagery Takedowns",By Dan Frieth | Reclaim The Net,5 days ago,"A sweeping new internet regulation, the Take It Down Act, is now poised for final approval as it awaits President Donald Trump’s signature following an overwhelming 409-2 vote in the House.
This legislation obliges social media companies to swiftly remove any content flagged as nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-manipulated photos. President Trump has expressed full support, declaring he’ll sign the bill and jokingly remarked during a congressional address, “I’m going to use that bill for myself too if you don’t mind because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody.”
Framed as a measure to tackle the alarming rise in digital image abuse, the bill represents one of the few bipartisan tech safety efforts to pass both chambers in recent years. However, its broad scope and enforcement mechanisms have sparked concern among those who view it as fertile ground for censorship masked as protection.
By mandating that flagged content be taken down within 48 hours of a demand being made, it essentially creates a legal requirement for rapid, largely unchecked removal of material, whether real or artificially generated.
Just like the DMCA, the law adds no obligation to actually check the takedown demand is not suppressing legitimate speech.
While stopping nonconsensual intimate imagery (NCII) is vital, the bill’s approach threatens to erode free expression and invite abuse.
The fact that enforcement of the law falls under the Federal Trade Commission, platforms closely aligned with those in power at the time could evade scrutiny, while others might be overwhelmed by false claims and unable to operate effectively.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation echoed these warnings, highlighting the law’s implications for encrypted services. These platforms, which cannot see the content of user communications, would be held to the same takedown obligations. According to the EFF, this could force services to choose between abandoning encryption or risking legal penalties. “Platforms may respond by abandoning encryption entirely in order to be able to monitor content—turning private conversations into surveilled spaces,” the organization warned, pointing out that such platforms often serve as critical lifelines for vulnerable individuals, including abuse survivors.
Despite such warnings, the bill found a broad base of supporters. First Lady Melania Trump has championed the legislation, and several tech companies and advocacy groups have lined up behind it. Google’s Kent Walker called it “a big step toward protecting individuals from nonconsensual explicit imagery,” and Snap also voiced support. X CEO Linda Yaccarino also supports the bill.
Still, not everyone agreed. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, one of only two lawmakers to oppose the bill, pointed to potential overreach and loss of liberties. “I feel this is a slippery slope, ripe for abuse, with unintended consequences,” he wrote on X, capturing the fears of those who see in the bill an expansive censorship framework rather than a narrowly tailored fix."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/merz-warns-of-democratic-crisis-as-he-seals-pact-with-the-socialists,Merz Warns of Democratic Crisis as He Seals Pact With the Socialists,By Javier Villamor | The European Conservative,5 days ago,"Friedrich Merz, CDU leader and Germany’s incoming chancellor, issued a stark warning on April 28th about the state of democracy in his country. He declared that “trust in our democratic system is damaged like never before in our post-war history.” Speaking in Berlin at the event to ratify the new coalition agreement, Merz painted a bleak picture, saying that “the pillars we have relied on for decades are now faltering around us.”
The most recent survey on trust in democracy within the European Union, Flash Eurobarometer 550, conducted between June 25th and July 2nd, 2024, shows that 55% of EU citizens have confidence in democracy remaining strong in the EU over the next five years, while 41% expressed some level of distrust. In other words, four out of ten Europeans have no trust not in democracy as such, but rather European institutions. Establishment political leaders tend not to make this distinction, preferring to avoid uncomfortable questions.
The CDU leader did not hesitate to point to multiple threats: an imperialist war in Eastern Europe—a reference to Russia—but also growing domestic discontent, with citizens described as “frightened, insecure, and even radicalized.” Merz warned that Germany faces real risks of sabotage and disinformation campaigns orchestrated from Moscow, calling for a “determined defense of our democracy against those who seek to divide Europe.”
However, while paying lip service to the defense of Europe and the need for leadership, Merz has chosen a path that some observers label pragmatic, but many see as a sign of weakness: a coalition pact with the Social Democratic Party (SPD). After the February 23rd elections, in which the AfD (Alternative für Deutschland) surged to become the second-largest political force with over 20% of the vote, Merz concluded an agreement with CDU’s traditional adversaries to form a “grand coalition” that should see him elected chancellor on May 6th.
It is worth noting that according to the latest opinion polls, AfD has now overtaken the CDU.
Merz has justified the agreement as a necessary evil to preserve national stability and prevent the further rise of political extremes. “This is not the time for euphoria,” he told his supporters, asserting that Germany must once again “assume leadership responsibility” within the European Union. His stated priorities include increasing defense spending, modernizing infrastructure, and implementing stimulus measures for a weakened economy.
His government, which will include figures like Johann Wadephul, a former soldier and strong supporter of Ukraine, promises to strengthen the Atlantic alliance. However, Merz warned that with Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency, “we can no longer automatically rely on the transatlantic relationship.” This has reinforced the CDU narrative of a more autonomous Europe, although the lack of specifics regarding his European defense proposals raises doubts among more critical sectors.
The CDU-SPD coalition represents an attempt to avoid political chaos, but at the same time it dilutes the conservative profile that many voters had hoped for following Merz’s electoral victory. Rather than a clear change of direction, Germany seems to be heading towards a nuanced continuity, where centrist consensus prevails over a recovery of firm values.
However, Merz himself admitted that if the new government fails to meet the demands of the majority of voters, Germany could end up in a situation where “perhaps at some point we are no longer able to govern.” This admission highlights the fragility of the balance achieved. Both within the AfD and other sectors, there is growing hope for early elections by 2027."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-canadian-election-does-not-matter,The Canadian Election Does Not Matter,By Scott Greer | Highly Respected,6 days ago,"The Liberals won the Canadian election Monday, despite early polling favoring Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives. The cause of Poilievre’s reversal of fortune owes to two factors. One, the Liberals replaced the unpopular Justin Trudeau with Mark Carney as prime minister before the election. Two, Canadians associated the Conservatives with Donald Trump, who’s seen as a national enemy.
The latter factor has made a number of American conservatives lash out at Trump. Apparently, it’s a massive loss that Pierre Poilievre is not the new prime minister. Except it isn’t. The election doesn’t actually matter to Americans. No matter who would be the new prime minister, Canada would attempt a tough line against Trump. Both serious options in Canada suck. The Conservatives are the equivalent of moderate Democrats. They are not Trumpists at all.
There is no real reason to be upset that Poilievre lost.
Poilievre was no Trump fan. He vowed to “retaliate” against American tariffs and repeatedly criticized the president for suggesting Canada should become the 51st state. His stance was not significantly different from that of the Liberal Party. Neither party looked to be a Trump ally. Each was going to be hostile to the current administration. If your main concern was getting a friendlier prime minister, there wasn’t much of a choice here.
If you were concerned with Canada adopting a more sensible immigration policy, Poilievre wasn’t great either. He has long championed immigration to meet Canada’s “business needs.” He believes employers should set the rates of immigration, which means they would happily welcome in hundreds of thousands of cheap foreign labor. At times, he did sound like he might support some cuts to migration. He believes the country’s immigration rates should be tied to housing development. Canada faces a housing shortage largely due to mass immigration. That might sound radical, but the Liberals also suggest a similar solution. Trudeau moderated his immigration enthusiasm during his last year in office. Carney continued this trend and campaigned on making immigration “sustainable.” The only notable difference between the parties is that the Conservatives emphasize cultural “integration” more than the Liberals.
However, Poilievre still catered to multiculturalism by playing dress up when meeting various minority groups, particularly with Sikhs. Trudeau was widely-mocked for his pandering outfits, but Poilievre did the same thing in his appeals to minorities.
One of Poilievre’s main issues throughout the campaign was the carbon tax, an onerous penalty imposed by Trudeau. Carney repealed the carbon tax when he took power, eliminating Poilievre’s primary campaign pitch and further diminishing the differences between the two.
There is a genuine conservative party in Canada. It’s called the People’s Party, and it got less than one percent of the vote. Canada’s system, like ours, makes it tough for third parties. Besides the two major parties, only the Bloc Quebecois and the far-left New Democratic Party make an impact.
The fact a genuine conservative party does so poorly and that the “Conservative Party” is so liberal speaks to the inherent “libtardism” of Canadians. This is a country whose national identity is based around not being Americans. Canadians and Americans have a lot in common. We both speak English and both countries were founded by Anglo-Protestants. Our cultures and accents are pretty similar. Canadians have to figure out ways to differentiate themselves. So they like to do the opposite of what Americans do. They love to think of themselves as more progressive and tolerant than their redneck neighbors. This makes them champion mass immigration, infringe on individual liberties, and boo our national anthem. If Trump does cool stuff as president, it’s guaranteed that Canada will move in a different direction simply because it doesn’t want to be like America.
It’s true that Trump’s tariffs influenced Canada’s elections. But of all the possible criticisms to make of this policy, making Pierre Poilievre lose is at the bottom of the list. Poilievre may have lost even without the tariffs. Canadians would’ve been disgusted with Trump as president regardless of the trade war. Merely being perceived as Trump-friendly is a disadvantage. In order to help the Conservatives win elections, Trump would have to not be Trump.
Our country shouldn’t be run on the basis of what will hurt the Conservative Party of Canada. America First means America First. Anything bold and controversial the president does will be unpopular with our northern neighbors. We shouldn’t care what they think. Canada is an unimportant vassal state that bases its whole identity on not being us. They can care about us all they want. We don’t need to care about them. American right-wingers should care about elections in countries that matter with serious right-wing parties, like Germany and France. We don’t need to care about the election results in Malta or in Zanzibar.
It would be nice if Canada did have a Trump-friendly right-wing government. But there was no chance of that. Whoever won would be an anti-Trump liberal. That’s why the election doesn’t matter.
If you’re Canadian and upset over the election results, I can understand. But it’s silly to be upset over the results if you’re an American. We have a right-wing administration in our country, and that’s what really matters."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/kremlin-backtracks-now-ready-to-negotiate-with-illegitimate-ukraine-thanks-to-trump,"Kremlin Backtracks, Now Ready to Negotiate With ‘Illegitimate’ Ukraine, Thanks to Trump",By Sean Miller,6 days ago,"In March Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he is no longer willing to negotiate peace with the “illegitimate” government of Ukraine, instead insisting on a U.N./U.S./E.U.-backed temporary government for Kiev which Moscow would then negotiate with. On Tuesday the Kremlin reversed this stance, in part, due to the geopolitical brokering of President Donald Trump. Before the current administration in Washington, the world was sleepwalking toward nuclear war, indicating the only deescalation factor has been the White House.
“When asked about who Russia would consider holding direct negotiations with, given Zelensky’s status, Peskov admitted that while there are certain legal issues related to his legitimacy, ‘the interests of entering the peaceful settlement process are above all else’,” RT said Tuesday.
The move by Moscow to prioritize peace over principle comes after months of footwork by the Trump administration to bring about a settlement in the Ukraine war. Most recently, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow on Friday for more peace talks with Putin. This is the fourth time he has traveled to the capital city for these negotiations. Witkoff delivered Trump’s peace proposal, which would see Crimea and a number of other regions of Eastern Ukraine currently held by Russia to be recognized as part of Russia. President Trump said Friday morning that he hopes to end the Ukraine war very soon and that he believes the U.S. will end up with a lot of good deals, including trade deals, as a result of the peace plan.
Special Envoy @generalkellogg: What @POTUS wants is a comprehensive ceasefire for a minimum of 30 days and then we can extend that… when you look at everything the Ukrainians are willing to work with, now it's over to the Russians, over to Putin… I think we're close. pic.twitter.com/lJuRGfk8iF
“The primary thing is to begin this negotiation process,” Peskov said, as well as clarifying that all other questions are “secondary.” He said however that Moscow still does not believe Kiev is ready for peace negotiations.
Regardless of Moscow’s confidence in Kiev, the resumption of a willingness to engage turns back a months-long resistance which stemmed from a breakdown in trust.
“It would be possible to discuss the possibility of introducing temporary management in Ukraine under the auspices of the U.N., with the United States, even with European countries, of course, with our partners and friends. And for what? In order to hold democratic elections, in order to bring to power a capable and trusted government, and then start negotiations on a peace treaty with them, to start signing legitimate documents that will be recognized all over the world,” the Russian President said in Russian and translated to English.
Interestingly, in December Putin said that he only had one requirement to signing a peace plan, that Kiev hold elections for their Dictator. Zelensky, however, has repeatedly refused to hold elections, causing Trump to call him a “Dictator without elections” in February.
To clarify, Zelensky’s Presidency ended in May. The Dictator refused to step down due to war-time provisions in the Ukrainian Constitution. He reiterated his anti-election stance in November during a speech before the Ukrainian Parliament.
While Russia had been reluctant to negotiate with Ukraine for a month, it still held diplomatic talks with the U.S.
Soon after Kiev had agreed to a temporary ceasefire that Trump brokered in March, which Moscow was then allowed to have a say in the details of before itself agreeing to it, Ukraine broke the agreement by bombing Russian energy infrastructure targets, repeatedly. Trump nevertheless continued his agenda of peace for the region.
On Monday Vice President JD Vance said that Ukraine will not win this war.
“If this doesn’t stop, the Ukrainians aren’t winning the war,” Vance said during an interview with Charlie Kirk during the conservative activist’s podcast on Monday. “I think there’s this weird idea among the mainstream media that if this thing goes on for just another few years, the Russians will collapse, the Ukrainians will take their territory back, and everything will go back to the way that it was before the war. That is not the reality that we live in … You could have millions of more people killed if this thing goes on for another few years, and it could risk escalating into a nuclear war. It has to stop.”
While JD Vance is not bullish on Ukraine’s chances of winning, Putin’s national security adviser Nikolay Patrushev insinuated Tuesday that Europe is bullish on nuclear war, saying that they are delirious with nuclear apocalypse scenarios."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/democrats-are-starting-to-split-over-the-issue-of-lgbtqiaap2sn,Democrats Are Starting to Split Over The Issue of LGBTQIAAP2SN+,By Jonathon Van Maren | Lifesite,6 days ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — As the Democrats continue to grapple with the scale of their 2024 election losses and hone their messaging for the midterms, there is a growing split in the party over one key issue: transgenderism.
Old school Democrats, many of whom likely never bought into the premises of the transgender movement to begin with, want to pivot—or at least want the “T” in LGBT to be a bit quieter for a while. Even hardline progressive Democrats with presidential ambitions, such as Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Pete Buttigieg, quietly dropped their “pronouns” from their social media bios.
Other progressives are desperately trying to persuade Democrats to hold the line. Podcaster Jennifer Welch recently melted down during an interview with prominent Democrat (and former Obama chief of staff) Rahm Emmanuel when he suggested that voters had disliked their focus on trans issues. “That is such bull****! That is total bull****!” she shot back. “That is buying into the right-wing media narrative and I’m so sick of Democrats like you selling out and saying this … It upsets me. It upsets me so much.”
Late night host John Oliver, who has been one of the most prominent celebrity supporters of transgender ideology, including sex changes for children, similarly urged Democrats to stick with the movement. Oliver went so far as to insist that the issue was not difficult to defend at all, and went off on one of his signature rants to prove it. It turns out defending transgenderism to a hand-picked audience with giant “APPLAUSE” signs on either side of your set stage is pretty easy, actually.
But in the real world, the trans movement did hurt the Democrats. According to the Associated Press’ VoteCast, a survey of over 120,000 people who voted this fall found that more than half of voters said that “support for transgender rights in government and society” has “gone too far.” Only 2 in 10 said that support hadn’t gone far enough, and only 2 in 10 said “it’s about right.” 85 percent of those who voted for Trump said support for the transgender agenda has “gone too far.”
A quarter of Harris voters agreed.
One Trump ad highlighted Harris advocating for taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for prisoners, and featured photos of trans-identifying and cross-dressing members of the Biden administration. The ad ends with the slogan: “Kamala Harris is for They/Them. President Trump is for you.” Bill Clinton was so alarmed by the impact of the ads that, according to the New York Times, he reached out to the Harris camp and urged them to repudiate their support for the policy. He was told the ad would be inconsequential. The ads moved voters 2.7 percent.
Those numbers explain why Emanuel, Clinton, and others want Democrats to back away from the transgender movement—and why ambitious Dems are edging slowly away from aspects of the trans agenda. California Governor Gavin Newsom is as slippery as they come, but he is very adept at reading polls, which is why he suddenly had Charlie Kirk on his podcast to agree with him on how unfair it is for men to be permitted in women’s sports.
I have been saying for years that many of the politicians who toe the line of transgender ideology don’t actually believe many of the premises they obediently parrot in public. They don’t actually believe that women can have penises, or that men can get pregnant. They don’t actually believe that a brawny bearded bloke who changed his pronouns on his official documents is a woman—not really. So when trans ideology becomes a political liability, we discover which politicians were true believers.
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, for example, embraced the UK Supreme Court’s affirmation that “transwomen” aren’t women with barely concealed relief. Trans activists attacked Starmer for his willingness to turn on them so swiftly. But the truth is that Starmer probably never fully accepted transgender ideology to begin with. The trans movement was not a grassroots movement—it was a top-down imposition of an ideology. Now, progressive parties are facing a moment of truth. It will be fascinating to discover how the Democrat civil war will resolve itself."

The legislation, which will be voted upon on April 30, was unveiled by state parliamentary party leaders Jochen Danninger (ÖVP) and Reinhard Teufel (FPÖ), marking a hardline stance against what they describe as “refusal to integrate.”
“In Lower Austria, integration means adapting to our way of life and culture — not the other way around,” said Danninger, emphasizing the province’s commitment to upholding traditional customs in kindergartens and schools, such as the celebration of St. Nicholas, Easter, and Christmas. Under the new law, failure to attend mandatory school or kindergarten meetings could result in fines of up to €2,500, with imprisonment of up to six weeks for repeated violations.
The legislative package also includes provisions for a ban on headscarves for girls, mandatory parental cooperation in schools, expansion of extremism prevention programs, a clear enforcement of German as the language of instruction and social interaction, and the codification of Austrian traditions in early education.
Danninger called the initiative a defense of “our blue and yellow identity” — a reference to the state’s flag — adding that Lower Austria is once again “a pioneer among the federal states.”
FPÖ state representatives Martin Antauer and Michael Sommer voiced their support at a press conference, linking the measures to long-standing Freedom Party demands. “Since 2015, we have seen a decline in public safety and cohesion,” said Antauer. “The federal government remains blind to the dangers of political Islam. We in Lower Austria are acting.”
Antauer praised recent changes in kindergartens, schools, and public dress codes, citing the establishment of the State Security Council and an observatory on radicalism. Sommer, FPÖ’s education spokesman, described the measures as a “milestone” for protecting children and criticized Vienna’s education system, which he said suffers from the consequences of failed integration: “Overcrowded classrooms, widespread lack of German skills, and cultural tensions.”
Remix News reported last month how, for the first time, Muslim students had become the largest religious group in Vienna’s schools. Muslim students now account for 41.2 percent of all students, while Christian students fell to 34.5 percent. The trend is only growing and is accompanied by rising problems, including violence in schools, anti-Semitism, and contempt for women.
Sommer further demanded that federal authorities ensure ideological neutrality in schools, prohibit halal-only meal plans, and protect traditional Austrian festivities from being overshadowed by religious sensitivities. “Our traditions – like Advent or St. Nicholas – must be taught and lived freely,” he said.
The motion also includes a proposal urging the federal government to implement a nationwide ban on political Islam. FPÖ’s Reinhard Teufel said the move aims to send a “red card” to radical ideologies: “Mass immigration has brought political Islam to our doorstep. We owe it to our people to act decisively.”"

https://www.infowars.com/posts/france-eyes-musk-style-doge-tactics-to-trim-government-spending,France Eyes Musk-Style ‘DOGE’ Tactics to Trim Government Spending,By Hélène de Lauzun | The European Conservative,6 days ago,"Criticism of the Trump administration may be very fashionable in France at the moment, but his political recipes are being emulated. Public Accounts Minister Amélie de Montchalin has announced that a third of government agencies should be merged or dissolved to reduce public spending.
Interviewed on CNews and Europe 1 on Sunday, April 27th, the minister announced that the government wants to abolish or merge one-third of the State’s agencies and operators “by the end of the year” as part of the next finance bill for 2026. The aim is not only to reduce the public deficit, but also to move towards greater administrative simplification and efficiency.
This programme is not unlike that of Elon Musk, who was appointed head of DOGE—the Department of Government Efficiency—by Donald Trump. Without obviously following in the footsteps of the American president, the minister provides some common-sense food for thought.
The finance bill for 2025 listed 434 State operators, receiving €77 billion in public funding and employing 180,000 people. With the planned restructuring, the state could generate “savings of €2 to 3 billion,” according to the minister. “Today, there are 180,000 people working in the agencies and operators. That’s more than the number of gendarmes in the country!” she exclaimed to justify this upcoming tightening. “The government is going to clean up our organisation, because the French are asking for it,” she added, while denying that she wanted to use the “chainsaw.” She explained that there were a number of levers available, such as the non-renewal of retirements and the pooling of skills.
Montchalin’s speech earned her strong criticism from the Left and the unions, who are always quick to react when it comes to cutting public sector jobs. For the Communist newspaper L’Humanité, this is no more and no less than a drastic “purge.” For the moment, no agency has been specifically targeted. The minister has made it clear that universities will not be affected by the budget cuts, but rumours are circulating about the uncertain future of agencies such as the Agence Bio, founded in 2021 to promote the organic sector. In January, French Minister of Agriculture Annie Genevard commented on the relevance of “the proliferation of bodies dealing with organic farming, most of which receive government funding and some of which carry out identical missions.” Ademe, the French Environment and Energy Management Agency, is also said to be in the hot seat. The environmental transition sector is the one that consumes the most public-sector jobs."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/eu-ombudsman-delays-probe-into-missing-docs-on-romanias-election-annulment,EU Ombudsman Delays Probe into Missing Docs on Romania’s Election Annulment,By Tamás Orbán | The European Conservative,6 days ago,"MCC Brussels has submitted a formal complaint to the European Union’s Ombudsman regarding the European Commission’s refusal to disclose key documents related to Digital Services Act (DSA) proceedings concerning Romania’s canceled presidential elections from last year. In its Monday, April 28th press release MCC argued that voters deserve to know whether there was any foreign interference—either from Moscow or Brussels—before they go to the ballots again this weekend.
MCC Brussels later confirmed to this publication that the Ombudsman has admitted the case and will launch a probe into whether the Commission’s decision to withhold the information is lawful, but not in time to make any difference. Conveniently enough, the Ombudsman’s office assigned the case to an investigator who will be on leave until May 19th, while the second and final round of the election will take place just one day earlier, on May 18th.
The complaint follows multiple unanswered freedom of information requests from MCC Brussels regarding how the Commission was applying the DSA in Romania’s electoral context, which the think tank claims were refused based on exemptions that do not apply in this case under EU law.
🚨 The EU Commission talks transparency but hides DSA proceedings on Romania’s elections behind closed doors. MCC Brussels is calling them out with a formal complaint to the Ombudsman. Democracy deserves better.https://t.co/cTSkEMf2dl
MCC Brussels began investigating after former Commissioner Thierry Breton—the EU’s so-called “censorship czar”— talked about widespread DSA enforcement in national elections to ward off “foreign interference,” and strongly hinted that EU pressure could have played a role in the Romanian decision to cancel last year’s election following the first round victory of nationalist candidate Călin Georgescu.
The European Commission did confirm to MCC Brussels that there are two DSA proceedings linked to TikTok and Romania at the moment, but argued that it cannot disclose documents about ongoing investigations. According to the think tank, however, this exemption does not apply when the disclosure is in “significant public interest”—as it is obviously the case now, with less than a week left until the election is repeated—particularly when it comes to potential foreign interference in a country’s democratic processes.
“The Commission’s habit of ignoring uncomfortable questions past legal deadlines is well documented,” MCC Brussels Director Frank Furedi noted, referring to, among others, the EU Court of Auditors’ recent ruling about the virtually non-existent EU transparency. As Furedi explained:
In this case, the timing is particularly suspect, with the next round of elections just days away. The Romanian people deserve to know what role the EU is playing in their democratic process. While we welcome the Ombudsman’s investigation, this must only be the beginning. Elected officials, the press, and the public must continue to demand accountability.
There’s not much known about these proceedings so far, apart from them looking at TikTok and Romania, and that they were launched by the EU Commission around the same time as the first round of the canceled election.
One additional detail that MCC found buried on the Commission’s website is that days before the election, Brussels instructed TikTok to monitor and save all information related to the campaign. This would imply two things: first, the Commission was at least expecting some kind of foreign interference campaign; and secondly, the Commission should have all the data needed to conclusively prove or disprove the claim of Russian interference.
As we also reported, the election was canceled by the since-resigned Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, based on allegations from intelligence services that Georgescu’s campaign was massively boosted by Russia on TikTok, which resulted in him winning first place. However, despite hundreds of thousands protesting on the streets and all opposition parties (both Left and Right) demanding public disclosure, no conclusive evidence supporting this claim has been presented to Romanians to date.
Meanwhile, a report published by investigative journalists revealed that at least one of the main campaigns that allegedly supported Georgescu on behalf of Russia on TikTok was in fact paid for and organized by the center-right PNL—one of the main establishment parties in the current government and member of von der Leyen’s EPP group—in a failed attempt to divert votes from their main opponent.
The EU Commission’s DSA probe, therefore, should also offer some insight into whether this was truly the case. However, with the Ombudsman dragging her feet and delaying the investigation until right after the election, there is no chance the documents would be released in time to make any difference.
Although it’s worth noting that this would probably be the case even if the Ombudsman were taking the complaint seriously, as her rulings are not binding. The Previous Ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, reprimanded the Commission (and von der Leyen personally) countless times for their violation of EU transparency rules, but she was ignored just as everyone else."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/see-no-evil-why-is-nobody-in-the-mainstream-asking-obvious-questions-about-these-nutters-who-keep-trying-to-kill-trump,See No Evil: Why Is Nobody in the Mainstream Asking Obvious Questions about These Nutters Who Keep Trying To Kill Trump?,By Raw Egg Nationalist,7 days ago,"I gave up on the whole “what if the boot was on the other foot” whine a long time ago, and so should you, frankly. It’s a waste of air. There are moral asymmetries in politics today that no amount of gurgling and mewling will do anything to change. How leftists gleefully do everything in their power to lock up, destroy, even kill their opponents, then scream blue murder as soon as they get one-hundredth of their hate thrown back at them when they’re no longer in power—that’s one example that springs to mind. You’re literally killing democracy! Which is to say, doing exactly what we do, just less ruthlessly and effectively. But, anyway, indulge me for a moment here. What if the boot really was on the other foot?
What if—oh, I don’t know—a plot to assassinate President Barack Obama was uncovered? What if it involved a neo-Nazi teenager in the US who had been conspiring with a foreign actor from a country the US was bankrolling in a massive war? And what if the plot existed because the President had now decided it would be better for the war, finally, to come to an end?
Do you think that would be a big story?
I think it would. It sounds like the plot of a Tom Clancy novel come to life. And imagine wanting to harm Barack Obama!
Well, guess what? I didn’t just pull that scenario out of my backside—or Tom Clancy’s. There really is a transatlantic neo-Nazi plot to kill the President and it involves a close ally the US has bankrolled to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in a war that’s taking place right now, as I type out this article. The only difference is, the President is Donald Trump not Barack Obama, so nobody’s saying a damn thing about it. Oh yeah, and it’s not that close ally the US has bankrolled to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars either—it’s Ukraine.
The teenager in this shocking real case is one Nikita Casap. Seventeen-year-old Nikita was arrested in early March during a traffic stop in Kansas. He was driving a stolen vehicle, had a gun and ammunition, and a large quantity of money in his possession. A week or so earlier, police had arrived at the Casap family residence in Waukesha, Wisconsin to make a welfare check after his mother and stepfather hadn’t been seen in two weeks. When there was no answer, officers entered the property and discovered their dead bodies. It was also discovered that a large quantity of personal items had been stolen.
Nikita was arrested for his mother and stepfather’s murders and for stealing and selling their stuff. When the FBI accessed his electronic devices, they discovered what the money was for. Little Nicky had been planning on buying heavy weaponry—a drone and explosives—to assassinate Donald Trump and topple the government. Standard teenager things.
It’s an incredible story. You can read the FBI’s documents on the case online. They contain screenshots from Telegram conversations Nikita had with a number of different individuals in Ukraine. In multiple conversations, Casap talks about killing Donald Trump using weapons obtained from his Ukrainian contacts and paid for with cryptocurrency; going into hiding in Ukraine after the assassination; and how the whole thing will—conveniently—be blamed on the Russians. He talks about buying a drone with a special “dropper,” presumably to drop a bomb on the President, and asks whether he’ll be able to live a normal life in Ukraine, even “when it’s found out I did it [killed Trump].”
There are also screenshots from a “manifesto”—written by whom, it’s not clear—which outlines an “accelerationalist” project to bring about the final victory of the white race over its eternal desert-wandering, curly-locked arch-enemies.
“It is clear that jews control all of the White countries, and it is clear that they promote White genocide and degeneracy. This [sic] for the white [sic] race to survive, it is necessary to accelerate the collapse of the countries. Jewish occupied governments must fall. The white race cannot survive unless America collapses.”
President Trump’s murder—and maybe the murder of his Vice President too—“is guaranteed to bring some chaos,” the manifesto continues. It will also “further bring into the public the idea that assassinations and accelerating the collapse are possible things to do.”
All to the good, then.
There are references to various neo-Nazi groups in the material, from the Order of Nine Angles to Atomwaffen, both of which sound like factions from a shoddy mid-90s RTS game, except they’re not. They’re real groups.
Reading all of this dreck, I couldn’t help but feel sorry for young Nikita. He’s just a teenager, and he comes off as very naive, especially when he’s asking if he can live a “normal life” in Ukraine when he’s just killed the President of the world’s most powerful country with a bomb dropped from a drone. But nothing changes the fact he killed his mother and step-father in cold blood, took their stuff and sold it so he could kill the President, with the broader goal of killing even more people. We’re all impressionable as teenagers but—bloody hell. This is a long way from Reefer Madness.
Like I say, all of this stuff is online, in the FBI documents, but nobody in the mainstream media is saying or doing a thing about it. At best, Casap will be dismissed as a lone-wolf loser, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. At worst, he’ll simply be ignored and forgotten.
There’s a huge story here and it doesn’t just involve Nikita Casap. It involves two other people who recently tried to assassinate Donald Trump: Thomas Matthew Crooks, the Butler gunman who came within millimeters of succeeding, and Ryan Routh, who lay in wait for the President while he was playing golf, a few weeks later.
Ryan Routh’s connections to Ukraine are well known. He travelled there to recruit soldiers to fight the Russians, and had a grand plan to import Afghan refugees via Iran to that aim. Routh also had apparent connections to Ukrainian neo-Nazis. He appeared in a social-media video to drum up support for the Azov Battalion’s Mariupol garrison; although Azov have, unsurprisingly, denied any association with him. Routh blamed Donald Trump for the war in Ukraine and believed that if he became president the war would be lost. So Trump had to die.
Thomas Matthew Crooks also had foreign connections, including encrypted messaging accounts on platforms based in Belgium, New Zealand and Germany. We still don’t have a clue who he was talking to, but he was precisely the same kind of weird-ass teenage boy as Nikita Casap. Were they talking to the same people, in the same groups? It’s not beyond the realms of possibility.
You can choose to dismiss these people as whackos and assume they’re totally unconnected, lone wolves; or you can choose to see the similarities and pursue them.
The mainstream media is choosing not to see the similarities or pursue them. I think we know why.
So instead, it’s being left to internet users like the sleuths behind the Substack page “Events in Ukraine” to try to draw some lines among all the dots. He does an admirable job; although the range of potential actors, ideologies and interests involved is rather daunting to someone who isn’t as up on his Eastern European neo-Nazi groups as he really should be.
What is clear, I think, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is that there’s a real threat to the President’s life from factions within Ukraine that do not want peace with Russia. That threat will continue and may even grow if peace is concluded. It’s said that one reason Zelensky himself doesn’t want peace, especially if he’s forced to concede territory to the Russians, is because he knows he’ll be a lifelong target for ultranationalists, regardless of which capital he chooses for his exile. They’ll get him whether he’s in London, Paris or Ougadougou.
This is a totally distinct threat from the threat posed to the President and members of the administration by the American left, which is now taking its cues from Luigi Mangione and his murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. This is an international threat, for the purposes of influencing international politics, even if American citizens are used to carry it out.
If these people succeed, God forbid, that will be a story the media can’t turn a blind eye to."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/russia-confirms-north-korean-troops-fighting-ukraine,Russia Confirms North Korean Troops Fighting Ukraine,By Sean Miller,7 days ago,"On Monday Russia President Vladimir Putin thanked the North Korean troops who were fighting alongside Moscow’s forces against Ukraine, confirming the suspicion that the third world Asian dictatorship was involved in the conflict, something Infowars reported in October.
“North Korean leader Kim Jong-un personally ordered his country’s military to fight alongside Russian forces ‘to annihilate Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk region,’ the country’s state media reported on Monday,” RT said.
The statement came after Russian General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov praised the North Koreans for their help in liberating the Kursk Region from Ukrainian occupation.
“The operations for liberating the Kursk area to repel the adventurous invasion of the Russian Federation by the Ukrainian authorities were victoriously concluded,” Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported, citing an official statement by the country’s Central Military Commission.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would help North Korea in defending itself if such a need arises, a statement which indicates a formation of a geopolitical friendship, potentially similar to one Russia has been fostering with Iran in recent years.
Similar to Moscow’s official relationship with Tehran, it holds a partnership agreement with Pyongyang as well.
“Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed a comprehensive partnership treaty between Moscow and Pyongyang in June 2024,” RT said. “One of the articles of the agreement obliges one country to provide immediate military assistance by all available means to the other if its territory is attacked from abroad.”"

The party almost tripled its support to over 20 percent compared to the previous election. The result could further destabilize the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), which shunned the FPÖ to form a national government with left-wing parties.
Despite a drop in support, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remained in first place to continue leading the Austrian capital.
Sámuel Ágoston Mráz, director of the Nézőpont Institute, told Magyar Nemzet that the strengthening of the FPÖ could have a serious impact on the rest of the country, as well as internationally. Coalition negotiations have now begun, and the party leaders have also assessed the results.
🇦🇹 BREAKING: Austria's right-wing FPÖ party has TRIPLED its support in Vienna.It is now the 2nd-strong party after city-wide elections, but the left still dominates. SPÖ: 39.4%FPÖ: 20.4% Greens: 14.6% ÖVP: 9.7% NEOS: 9.7% Left Party: 4.1% pic.twitter.com/DV3PoqyrF5
In particular, the ÖVP saw its support in Vienna crater. The chancellor’s party plummeted to 9.6 percent—a drop of 10.8 percentage points compared to 2020. There is already speculation in Viennese party circles about a possible resignation of the 70-year-old city party chairman, Karl Mahrer. Despite the defeat, the People’s Party is determined to govern alongside the SPÖ.
Michael Ludwig, the socialist mayor of Vienna, made it clear in a statement on Sunday evening that the SPÖ remained the strongest party in the elections and that negotiations will begin with several parties about possible cooperation.
🇦🇹 This is now Vienna on a warm day. The Austrian city is often labeled the “most livable” city in the world. Yet, the Viennese vote overwhelmingly for more mass immigration, even as the city becomes more packed every year. 45.4% of its residents are now of foreign origin. pic.twitter.com/7M7EsfTMTT
“We want to form a stable city and provincial government before the summer,” Ludwig said while ruling out the possibility of a coalition with the FPÖ.
A continuation of the red-green coalition seems likely, but cooperation with NEOS is not ruled out.
On behalf of NEOS, Bettina Emmerling indicated that they would be happy to continue the “progress coalition” with the SPÖ, especially building on cooperation on education policy. The party’s secretary general, Douglas Hoyos, also welcomed the result, highlighting that NEOS achieved almost 10 percent, a historic high for the party in Vienna.
Judith Pühringer, leader of the Greens, said the party’s themes were in line with the SPÖ’s goals. Werner Kogler, the party’s national chairman, also confirmed that the Greens were ready to actively participate in shaping Vienna’s future.
Although the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) suffered heavy losses, party leader Karl Mahrer stated that if the mayor wanted to pursue a policy committed to the political center, economic stability, and social cohesion, the ÖVP was open to negotiations.
The Vienna leader of the Austrian Freedom Party, Dominik Nepp, told broadcaster ORF: “The huge vote of confidence from the voters has been clearly demonstrated. We have tripled our support. This is a clear sign that people want change. From our perspective, a red-blue coalition would be what many people want. Mayor Ludwig must finally abandon his exclusionary policies. We will consistently monitor the functioning of Vienna!”
Herbert Kickl, national chairman of the FPÖ, also spoke: “The strong result of Dominik Nepp and the FPÖ shows that people in Vienna also want change, and change that puts the people back at the center of politics. The people are sovereign, and this sovereign has given a clear signal in Vienna today.”"

In a post on his social-media platform Truth Social, the President said the income from his new “reciprocal tariffs” on foreign nations would be a boon for ordinary Americans.
“When Tariffs cut in, many people’s Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated,” Trump posted.
“Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year. Also, massive numbers of jobs are already being created, with new plants and factories currently being built or planned. It will be a BONANZA FOR AMERICA!!! THE EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IS HAPPENING!!!”
President Trump made no secret of his ambition to abolish federal income taxes during his election campaign.
A week before his inauguration, he made another post on Truth Social where he outlined his ambition to replace the Internal Revenue Service, taxing Americans, with an External Revenue Service, taxing foreign trade.
“For far too long, we have relied on taxing our Great People using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),” President Trump posted.
“Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves. It is time for that to change. I am today announcing that I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources. We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
President Trump’s flagship tariff policy is expected to bring dozens of foreign nations to the negotiating table to hammer out new terms for trade with the US, to avoid punitive impositions on exports.
A deal with China, the main target of the tariffs, remains elusive at present; although President Trump has expressed his optimism that one will be struck soon."

House Minority Leader Chuck Schumer refuse to rule out this possibility in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday.
Speaking to Bash on State of the Union, Schumer said the President is “violating the rule of law in every way.”
Bash asked Schumer whether he agreed with comments made by Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff on Friday at a town hall. Ossoff said that Trump’s actions over the last 12 weeks had exceeded “any prior standard for impeachment.”
“We’re fighting him every single day in every way,” Schumer responded.
“And our goal is to show the American people, over and over again, whether it’s the economy, whether it’s tariffs, whether it’s Russia and overseas and whether it’s rule of law, how bad he is. Two years is too far away to predict, our job is day to day to day, to show who Trump is, what he is doing and it’s having an effect.”
Bash pressed Schumer about impeachment again, but the veteran politician deflected, saying it’s “too far away to judge.”

Ossoff is not the first Democrat to raise the specter of another round of attempts to impeach President Trump. Congressman Al Green has already said he will seek to impeach the President at the first possible opportunity.
Schumer himself has faced challenges to his leadership in recent weeks.
Activist group Indivisible, which is bankrolled heavily by George Soros, has called for Schumer to step aside after he allowed the President’s spending bill to pass.
The group’s co-executive director Ezra Levin announced the plan to oust Schumer shortly after the funding bill passed: “Senator Schumer should step aside as leader. Every Democrat in the Senate should call for him to do so, and begin making plans for new leadership immediately.”
He added that the wrangling over the spending bill should have been used by Democrats as a “rare, precious point of leverage,” but “Schumer did the opposite. He led the charge to wave the white flag of surrender.”
The new campaign to oust Schumer drew pointed comment from a White House official, who spoke to The New York Post.
They said: “The Democrats will have an important question to answer in the coming days: Who actually leads their party — Schumer or Soros?”
Indivisible reckons it has 1,600 local chapters and employs at least 10 paid staffers. As The New York Post notes, it’s unclear to what extent they receive “orders” from their backers.
A representative of George Soros dismissed the claim that he leads the Democrat Part as “a daydream.”
Indivisible has also been coordinating protests against Elon Musk and his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, including offering $200 payments to activists to take part in “Musk or us”-themed protests."

The decision comes just days after a local Antifa group vandalized major venues that hosted the conservative think tank MCC Brussels—an attack the city council has failed even to acknowledge.
Lack of political plurality should be nothing to celebrate, especially in a city that presents itself as a symbol of democracy. Yet, Brussels is adopting the “anti-fascist” label partly to boast about the fact that it has no national conservative councilmen at all. However, it remains unclear what being an “anti-fascist city” really means in practice.
The timing is also ironic, given that just recently, a local Antifa group vandalized ten conference venues that dared to host the events of MCC Brussels, apparently aiming to intimidate them into refusing future events. Numerous MEPs condemned the blatant attack on freedom of expression, but the city council has not even addressed the incident.
This latest declaration was unanimously passed in the Brussels city council last week, ahead of the May 8th celebrations marking 80 years since the end of World War II in Europe.
Officially, the symbolic title aims to highlight the Belgian capital’s historic contributions to the fight against fascism, but the real goal, as explicitly stated by the motion’s author,  is to entrench the city’s political firewall against conservatives for decades to come.
The motion was tabled by Green councilor Zoubida Jellab, who argued that Brussels needs to stand firm because “far-right ideas are very much alive today.” Jellab made clear she was not just targeting extremist fringe groups, but specified that the enemies were conservative parties with broad democratic mandates around the West:
In the United States under Trump, but also here in Europe, in Italy, Poland, Hungary, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Slovakia, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and in Belgium.
Jellab added that by declaring itself an “anti-fascist city,” Brussels reinforces its commitment to fight all forms of hatred, including fascism, racism, Islamophobia, and anti-Semitism. The latter is ironic, given that many of the parties who supported the motion explicitly supported the city’s numerous anti-Israel protests, which called to free Palestine “from the river to the sea”—in other words, to wipe the only Jewish state off the map.
The motion enjoyed unanimous support from the council after Mayor Philippe Close strongly endorsed it in the name of his socialist, liberal, and Christian Democrat coalition.
Mayor Close said he was very proud of the city council’s current multicultural make-up—that councilors came from “all four corners of the world”—and that no “fascist” has been elected into their ranks for over two decades now. In Belgium, these labels usually refer to the Flemish Vlaams Belang (VB/PfE) and New Flemish Alliance (N-VA/ECR), which are, ironically enough, the country’s two largest parties.
“Europe’s largest cosmopolitan city is once again leading by example, because it doesn’t matter where you come from. What matters is what you build together,” the mayor added. Well, if “what you build together” referred to Brussels’ flourishing crime gangs that bomb and shoot each other with automatic weapons every other week, then sure, Brussels really is successful."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/columnist-warns-carney-liberals-will-consider-a-home-equity-tax-on-primary-residences,Columnist Warns Carney Liberals Will Consider a Home Equity Tax on Primary Residences,By Steve Jalsevac | Lifesite,7 days ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Winnipeg Sun columnist warns Carney Liberals considering home equity tax on primary residences
Winnipeg Sun Columnist Kevin Klein is sounding the alarm there is substantial evidence the Carney Liberal Party is considering implementing a home equity tax on Canadians’ primary residences as a potential huge source of funds to bring down the massive national debt their spending created.
Klein wrote in his April 23 column and stated in his accompanying video presentation:
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) — a federal Crown corporation — has investigated the possibility of a home equity tax on more than one occasion, using taxpayer dollars to fund that research. This was not backroom speculation. It was real, documented work.
The Liberals paid a group called Generation Squeeze, led by activist Paul Kershaw, to study how the government could tap into Canadians’ home equity — including their primary residences.
Kershaw, by the way, believes homeowners are “lottery winners” who didn’t earn their wealth but lucked into it. That’s the ideology being advanced to the highest levels of government.
It didn’t stop there. These proposals were presented directly to federal cabinet ministers. That’s on record, and most of those same ministers are now part of Mark Carney’s team as he positions himself as the Liberals’ next leader.
Watch below Klein’s 7-minute, impassionate warning to Canadians about this looming major new tax should the Liberals win Monday’s election.
Klein further adds:
The total home equity held by Canadians is over $4.7 trillion. It’s the largest pool of private wealth in the country. For millions of Canadians — especially baby boomers — it’s the only retirement fund they have. They don’t have big pensions. They have a paid-off house and a hope that it will carry them through their later years. Yet, that’s what Ottawa has quietly been circling.
The Canadian Taxpayer’s Federation has researched this issue and published a report on the alarming amount of new taxation a homeowner equity tax could cost Canadians who sell their homes that have increased in value over the years they have lived in it. It is a shocker!
A Google search on the question, “what does a tax on home equity tax” returns the response:
A home equity tax, simply put, it’s a proposed levy on the increased value of your home, specifically, on your principal residence. The idea is for Government to raise money by taxing wealth accumulation from rising property values.
The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has provided a Home Equity Tax Calculator Backgrounder to help Canadians understand what the impact of three different types of Home Equity Tax Calculators would have on home owners. The required tax payment resulting from all three is a shocker.
Keep in mind that World Economic Forum policies intend to eventually eliminate all private home ownership and have the state own and control not only all residences, but also eliminate car ownership, and control when and where you may live and travel.
Carney, Trudeau and at least several other members of the Liberal government in key positions are heavily connected to the WEF."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/chinese-researchers-in-wuhan-lab-find-new-bat-virus-with-potential-to-infect-humans,Chinese Researchers in Wuhan Lab Find New Bat Virus with Potential To Infect Humans,By Raw Egg Nationalist,7 days ago,"Researchers at the notorious Wuhan Institute of Virology in China have discovered a new bat virus they claim can infect humans.
In a study published in the scientific journal Cell, the researchers describe how the new virus, which they’ve called HKU5-CoV-2, is able to enter human cells via the ACE2 receptor. This is the same pathway by which COVID-19, which sparked a global pandemic in 2020, enters human cells.
The researchers isolated the virus by taking thousands of anal swabs from pipistrel bats across five difference Chinese provinces.
They note that the virus has the potential to jump across mammal species, and that it is similar to sequences found in farmed mink.
However, the virus does not enter human cells as readily as COVID-19, which means the risk of its “emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated.” The researchers identify a number of different antibodies and antiviral drugs that target the virus.
An expert on virology who spoke to The Epoch Times told the newspaper that although the virus “posts minimal threat to humans” in the wild, gain-of-function research could make it more transmissible and deadly.
“This virus could create a highly extremely threatening new bioweapons agent and pandemic pathogen,” the expert cautioned.
The expert also warned that the new research is being led by Shi Zhengli, who was responsible for research on bat coronaviruses that is plausibly linked to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In January, the CIA added its support to the claim that COVID-19 was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, making it the third US executive agency to back the theory.
John Ratcliffe, the new director of the CIA, has said the best way for the world to prevent the next pandemic is to hold Beijing accountable.
“We’ve all survived… the worst pandemic of our lifetime,” Ratcliffe said.
“But it would be a mistake for all of us to assume that it will be the last one.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/kyiv-mayor-suggests-ukraine-may-temporarily-cede-territory-to-achieve-peace,Kiev Mayor Suggests Ukraine May Temporarily Cede Territory to Achieve Peace,By Thomas Brooke | Remix,7 days ago,"Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko indicated in a recent interview with the BBC that Ukraine might be compelled to temporarily retreat from certain territories occupied by Russia to secure a ceasefire, marking the first public acknowledgment by a prominent Ukrainian leader of possible territorial concessions.
His comments come amid mounting international pressure, particularly from the United States, to reach a peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv.
Klitschko stated, “A number of discussions are currently underway about possible solutions. One of the scenarios is the surrender of part of the territory. It’s not fair. But for peace — temporary peace — it could perhaps be the way.” He emphasized, however, that Ukrainians would never accept Russian occupation as a permanent reality.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is proposing a peace plan that effectively recognizes Russian control over Crimea, annexed in 2014, and occupied areas in the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.
U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance recently reiterated the U.S. stance, declaring that Ukraine must agree to territorial compromises or risk losing American mediation efforts altogether. Vance further suggested freezing the conflict along the current front line.
President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized earlier this week that Ukraine has not received any formal proposals from its allies regarding territorial concessions and reiterated Kyiv’s stance against recognizing any Russian occupation.
Meanwhile, Klitschko, known for his strained relationship with Zelensky, revealed he had never directly discussed concrete peace proposals with the president.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed cautious optimism about ongoing negotiations, noting that President Trump’s approach could help address the core issues of the conflict. Lavrov added, however, that specific points of any agreement still required refinement.
On Thursday, President Trump reacted sharply to new Russian attacks on Kyiv, which killed at least 12 people and wounded dozens more, publicly calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin via Truth Social to immediately halt hostilities.
“I’m not happy with Russia’s attacks on Kyiv. They are not necessary and have very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers die every week. Let’s FINALIZE the peace agreement!” Trump wrote.
Despite diplomatic discussions, violent attacks continue. Overnight, Russian drone strikes killed two people and injured eight others in Pavlohrad in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, according to regional military administration head Serhiy Lysak. Fires broke out in residential buildings, causing significant damage.
Additional drone and rocket attacks also targeted the cities of Marhanets, Nikopol, and Kharkiv.
In turn, Ukraine reportedly targeted a top general in Moscow, Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy chief of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, with a car bomb, although Kyiv has not claimed responsibility."

Homan appeared on CBS News’s Face the Nation when he waded into a new controversy about a two-year-old US-citizen child who was deported with their sister and mother to Honduras.
“Having a U.S. citizen child doesn’t make you immune from our laws of the country,” Homan said.
“American families get separated every day by law enforcement.”
Trump’s Border Czar slammed illegals who believe having a child in the US is a “get-out-of-jail-free card.”
When asked about the specifics of the controversial case, Homan said the mother who was deported decided to take her child with her. Homan called it “parenting 101.”

One of President Trump’s first Executive Orders upon taking office was to end birthright citizenship.
Trump’s executive order explicitly stated that the 14th Amendment is being misused to grant citizenship to so-called “anchor babies.”
“The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof,’” the order states.
It continues: “It is the policy of the United States that no department or agency of the United States government shall issue documents recognizing United States citizenship, or accept documents issued by State, local, or other governments or authorities purporting to recognize United States citizenship, to persons: (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.”
One day after the Order was issued, a group of Democrat state attorneys filed a lawsuit to block it. US District Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, then blocked the order, describing it as “blatantly unconstitutional.”
The Trump administration is currently appealing the block."

The lower Ploiești Court of Appeal overturned this ruling on Thursday, creating what national media described as “unprecedented legal chaos.” Legal experts have insisted this decision will have no effect given that Constitutional Court rulings are final. Dr. Tudorel Toader, a former judge and justice minister, criticised the Ploiești judge who he said had
managed to put his name into public discussion, even if through an inadmissible decision, outside the constitutional legal requirements.
The official reportedly now faces a disciplinary investigation.
Others have stressed that the overturning will not impact upcoming presidential elections, two-round ballots for which are due to be held on May 4th and 18th, though confusion reigns.
The November election was officially annulled due to unconfirmed allegations of Russian

https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-hopeful-for-ukraine-russia-peace-deal,Trump Hopeful for Ukraine-Russia Peace Deal,By Raw Egg Nationalist,7 days ago,"A Ukraine-Russia peace deal is very close, claimed President Trump on Sunday, as he said Ukrainian President Zelensky is now ready to cede territory to Moscow to bring an end to the war.
President Trump addressed reporters on the tarmac at a New Jersey airport on Sunday, 24 hours after meeting with Zelensky at the Vatican, during the funeral of Pope Francis.
When asked whether he believed Zelensky would give up the strategically important Crimean peninsula, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, President Trump replied, “Oh, I think so.”
Zelensky said on Friday that Crimea remains “the property of the Ukrainian people.”
Peace plans revealed by Reuters on Friday showed that the US is proposing for Russia to keep territory in Ukraine that it has captured since 2014, including Crimea and regions in the east of the country bordering Russia.
President Trump expressed sympathy for Zelensky, softening his tone on Ukraine’s leader considerably. He said Zelensky “wants to do something good for his country” and is “working hard,” and also suggested his relationship with Ukraine’s President is not as bad as it has been portrayed since the two men’s previous meeting in the Oval Office.
“Look, it was never bad. We had a little dispute, because I disagreed with something he said, and the cameras were rolling and that was OK with me,” President Trump said.
“Look, he’s in a tough situation, a very tough situation. He’s fighting a much bigger force, much bigger,”
President Trump also said he was “surprised and disappointed” by Russian strikes on Kiev after discussions between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian premier Vladimir Putin. President Trump said he wants Putin to “stop shooting.”
“Sit down and sign the deal. We have the confines of a deal, I believe, and I want him to sign it and be done with it.”
President Trump also spoke about China, and said a new trade deal would happen soon.
“They want to make a deal, obviously,” Trump said.
“Now, they’re not doing any business with us, you know, because, not because of them, because of me. Because at 145% [tariffs], you can’t do business. But something’s going to happen, that’s going to be possible.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/suspected-isis-member-deported-to-rwanda,Suspected ISIS Member Deported to Rwanda,By Raw Egg Nationalist,7 days ago,"An Iraqi man suspected of working for Islamic State has been deported from the US to Rwanda.
Omar Abdulsattar Ameen was granted refugee status in the US in 2014. The Iraqi government maintained that he was a member of Islamic State and responsible for the murder of a police officer. In 2021, a judge found that Ameen’s account in response to the case against him was “not plausible.”
During his first term, Trump tried to deport Ameen, and so did Joe Biden, but neither administration was successful. They accused Ameen of lying on his refugee application by saying he had not interacted with any terrorist groups.
According to an unnamed official who spoke to Reuters and an internal government email, Ameen was sent to Rwanda at the beginning of this month.
It has been reported that Rwanda has agreed to host third-country deportees from the US as part of a “new removal program.” No details of a deal between the US and the central African country have been made public.
Rwanda has made itself a destination for Western countries looking to deport foreign nationals who can’t be removed to their home countries. In 2022, it signed an agreement to take thousands of asylum seekers from the UK, but that deal was scuppered by new Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/female-black-hawk-pilot-ignored-instructions-before-fatal-potomac-collision,Female Black Hawk Pilot Ignored Instructions Before Fatal Potomac Collision,By Raw Egg Nationalist,7 days ago,"The female pilot of a Black Hawk helicopter involved in a fatal collision with a passenger plane over Washington DC ignored instructions to alter her course moments before the crash.
Captain Rachel Lobach was taking part in an annual flight evaluation with an instructor when her helicopter slammed into a passenger plane, killing 67 people in total, including herself, her co-pilot and a third person aboard the Black Hawk.
A report published by The New York Times details the avoidable mistakes that led to the tragedy.
“When air traffic controllers informed the Black Hawk that there was an airliner nearby, Lobach and Eaves acknowledged the message and requested to fly by “visual separation,” a common practice that allows aircraft to avoid collisions based on their own observations rather than following instructions from air traffic control,” the report states.
“The Black Hawk was 15 seconds away from crossing paths with the jet. Warrant Officer Eaves then turned his attention to Captain Lobach. He told her he believed that air traffic control wanted them to turn left, toward the east river bank.”
If the helicopter had turned left, this would have opened up more space between it and Flight 5342, which was descending towards Runway 33 at Reagan National Airport, at an altitude of about 300 feet.
Captain Lobach had served as an aviation officer in the army since July 2019 and had notched up around 500 hours of flying time in a Black Hawk.
During the Biden administration, she served as a White House military social aide.
President Trump and other members of his administration were subject to intense criticism from the media and politicians after suggesting diversity, equity and inclusivity (DEI) policies might have been to blame for the tragedy.
In his first remarks on the crash, on his social-media platform Truth Social, President Trump wrote, “The airplane was on a perfect and routine line of approach to the airport. The helicopter was going straight at the airplane for an extended period of time. It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why didn’t the helicopter go up or down, or turn.”
Later, at a press conference, when President Trump was questioned about why he believed DEI could be to blame, he told reporters, “Because I have common sense.”
President Trump pointed to hiring guidance for the Federal Aviation Authority which included positive preference for those with disabilities including “hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism.”
Disability-rights groups including the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) issued a joint statement calling Trump’s comments “irresponsible, disparaging, and wrong.”
“The president is deliberately spreading falsehoods to demonize the quarter of American adults who live with disabilities rather than directing federal resources towards ensuring such a devastating tragedy never happens again,” the statement read."

Additionally, Trump warned the perpetrators almost “destroyed the country” and even called out the legitimacy of the pardon written for Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) because “Biden knew nothing about it.”
“Why did the Auto Pen give Schiff a Pardon? Biden knew nothing about it,” said Trump in a Sunday Truth Social post. “Who operated the Auto Pen? That is the biggest question being asked in D.C. They almost destroyed our Country.”

Hopefully ACTBLUE, the Democrats ILLEGAL SCAM used to raise money, including from not allowed “foreign contributions,” is being looked at by authorities. The Dems only know how to win by CHEATING, something which they do better than any group or party in history. But now, with their terrible policies and candidates, and with people like Crooked Adam Schiff, who demanded a full Pardon from Sleepy Joe, leading the way, it is almost impossible to reach their money goals. The USA is wise to these scoundrels and crooks. Also, why did the Auto Pen give Schiff a Pardon? Biden knew nothing about it. Who operated the Auto Pen? That is the biggest question being asked in D.C. They almost destroyed our Country. They should all be in jail!!!
Notably just weeks ago, Trump warned that the “real president” during the Biden administration was “the person who controlled the Autopen!”
The person who was the real President during the Biden years was the person who controlled the Autopen!Trump Truth Social Post 3/14/25 06:11 PM EST PM
Also last March, Trump called the Biden pardons “void” because of the autopen.
“The ‘Pardons’ that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,” the President wrote.
“In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level. The fact is, they were probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent of the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden!”
Trump added more at the time during an interview on Air Force One:

“I would say they’re null and void, because I’m sure Biden didn’t have any idea that it was taking place,” said Trump. “Somebody was using an autopen to sign off and give pardons…”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-keeps-talking-about-bringing-back-self-deported-illegals-what-is-he-thinking,Trump Keeps Talking About Bringing Back Self-Deported Illegals – What Is He Thinking?,By Allan Wall | Border Hawk,8 days ago,"Once again, President Trump has promoted a bizarre policy of bringing self-deported illegal aliens back to the United States.
As Border Hawk previously reported, Trump proposed this idea at a public cabinet meeting.
On April 15, tax day for American citizens, the President had similar things to say in a friendly and supportive interview with Rachel Campos-Duffy of Fox Noticias, a branch of Fox News directed toward American Hispanics.
(If they are American citizens, shouldn’t they understand English?)
During the interview, Rachel Campos-Duffy shared a video featuring a pro-Trump illegal alien she had interviewed during the campaign.
It is a classic media technique to present a sympathetic illegal alien (in this case a pro-Trumpster) to make deportation look bad.
She asked if this illegal alien (who’s been here 20 years) should be treated differently than those who entered during the Biden presidency.
“Well, from an actual standpoint, no, but from a practical standpoint, yes. I look at this man, and I say, ‘This is a guy that we want to keep.’ I mean I’ll probably take heat for saying it,” President Trump replied.
“Is he supposed to be deported?” Trump inquired.
Campos-Duffy replied, “No,” and Trump said that was good.
“I think that’s the question people have – right now it’s just illegal criminals,” Campos-Duffy prompted.
Trump replied, “Yeah, yeah.”
The President should never say that. All illegal aliens are legally subject to deportation.
Campos-Duffy continued to talk about the pro-Trump illegal alien, of whom the President said, “I don’t think he’s in any danger of [deportation] and that makes this question a lot easier because if you said they’re ready to pick him up and move him out that would be a much more difficult question because he’s a fine person. Yes. And we don’t want to do that.”
Amazing. The Commander-in-Chief undercuts his own government’s enforcement personnel by making such poorly-informed comments to the media.
A better answer would be, “There are many difficult situations. They exist because, for decades (not just during the Biden era), we have allowed illegals to flaunt the law. So now we have these tough decisions.”
But don’t say people won’t be deported.
Trump then started talking about legalizing illegal labor, just as he did in the cabinet meeting.
“One of the things I am doing, though, is I’m also making it easier on the farmers and the hotels and everything because you have a lot of farmers that are not going to be able to do their crops, and pick up the corn, and do all of the things that they do so incredibly well,” he said.
For centuries, farmers have liked cheap labor. Before 1865, they demanded slavery. Now they demand low-cost illegal labor.
A better strategy is agricultural mechanization.
Trump talked about picking corn. Is he not aware that mechanical corn pickers have been around since the early 1900s?
“We’re going to be very soothing in terms of perhaps letting that farmer have, you know – they’re sort of responsible and we’re going to have the farmer take responsibility, but you know ultimately, at some point, we want the people to go out and come back [legally],” Trump rambled.
“As you probably know, we’re doing a self-deportation and we’re going to make it comfortable for people and we’re going to work with those people to come back into our country legally.”
Santa Claus Trump explained the great things he plans to do for these illegal aliens turned legal aliens: “We’re going to give them a stipend. We’re going to give them some money and a plane ticket. And then we’re going to work with them, if they’re good, if we want them back in, we’re going to work with them to get them back in as quickly as we can.”
Is this what Trump was elected to do? Is this what his supporters want? Is this an America First policy?
Let President Trump know what you think."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/white-house-to-evaluate-officials-loyalty-to-trump-report,White House to Evaluate Officials’ Loyalty to Trump – Report,By RT,8 days ago,"A US government agency will begin assessing federal workers based on their loyalty to President Donald Trump, the Wall Street Journal has reported.
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which is the US federal government’s human-resources arm, has been tasked with leading the evaluation program, the outlet said in an article on Saturday.
According to memos from OPM Acting Director Chuck Ezell, which were seen by the WSJ, high-ranking civil servants will be judged based on their “faithful administration of the law and the president’s policies.”
The documents described advancing Trump’s agenda as the “most critical element” in measuring the performance of the officials, the report read.
The new performance plan is expected to be adopted by the US government agencies by the beginning of fiscal year 2026, it added.
The WSJ stressed that civil servants had also been graded previously, but it was done based on factors such as business acumen, leadership skills, ability to build coalitions and results of their work.
During the previous Democratic administration of President Joe Biden, staffing policy focused heavily on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. Critics, however, argued that DEI initiatives often prioritized identity over merit, leading to claims of lowered standards and divisiveness. Many companies, including, Walt Disney, JPMorgan Chase, Amazon, and Google, facing similar criticisms and legal challenges, have since scaled back or entirely abandoned their DEI programs.
Shortly after assuming office in January, Trump signed several executive orders aimed at eliminating DEI initiatives, describing them as “radical,” within the federal government, its contractors, and grantees.
The WSJ said that OPM had already begun approving positions that other federal agencies are looking to add in what it described as an attempt by the Trump administration “to consolidate control over the hiring and firing of federal workers.”
The Office of Personnel Management will also continue some of the government downsizing efforts initiated by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, according to the report. Musk announced earlier this week that he will scale back his involvement as the head of the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and refocus on his business activities.
The world’s richest man explained his decision by saying that “major work” to establish DOGE has now been completed. However, Musk clarified that he has no intention of stepping away from his work at the agency altogether, adding that he would still spend “a day or two per week on government matters.”"

“It’s been a complete bloodbath,” one senior DOJ lawyer told Dilanian. Other sources said that over a dozen senior lawyers – “many with decades of experience working under presidents of both parties,” have been reassigned, while others have resigned in frustration after they were shuffled around.
Dhillon kicked the hornet’s nest last week – issuing a series of memos outlining the shifting priorities, which include (gasp!) “Keeping Men out of Women’s Sports,” and “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling.”
“This is a 180 shift from the division’s traditional mission,” one former senior official said – declining to be named “in fear of retaliation.”
“These documents appear to have been created in a vacuum completely divorced from reality,” the former official continued. “The division can only enforce statutes that have been passed by Congress, and these orders seem to contemplate division attorneys’ executing on work that fundamentally departs from the division’s long-standing mission.”

Dhillon, meanwhile, said the changes were no different than what happens anytime there’s a change in administration, along with a quest for efficiency.
“Each new administration has its own priorities, and allocates resources accordingly,” said Dhillon. “The Trump administration is no different. When I assumed my duties as Assistant Attorney General, I learned that certain sections in Civil Rights had substantial existing caseloads and backlogs, and that formed the basis of temporary details to assist those sections in getting, and staying, caught up.”
10 ‘current and former officials’ in the Civil Rights Division told NBC News that several division chiefs have been transferred to roles unrelated to their legal backgrounds, including handling complaints, as well as the office that handles public requests (lol). So, customer service.
“Every presidential administration has its own policy priorities,” said former employee Stacey Young, who spent 18 years in the division before resigning in January, “but I don’t think there’s any precedent for an administration almost completely refocusing the civil rights division’s enforcement priorities the way this one has.”
So sad."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/wisconsin-governor-tells-state-employees-not-to-cooperate-with-ice-agents,Wisconsin Governor Tells State Employees Not To Cooperate with ICE Agents,By Raw Egg Nationalist,8 days ago,"Wisconsin’s Department of Administration (DoA) has issued a memo to state employees telling them not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.
In a document dated 18 April, the DoA tells state employees what to do if Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrive at state government buildings.
State employees should refuse to answer questions, even about known individuals; deny access to files, even if a warrant is presented; block agents from entering non-public areas if they don’t have a warrant; and tell agents to leave if no attorney is present.
The document was provided in response to “questions from state employees regarding what to do in case of an encounter with federal agents at work,” an email accompanying the document, sent by Deputy Secretary  Anne Hanson.
On Friday,  Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah C. Dugan was arrested after she was alleged to have helped an illegal immigrant avoid arrest in her courtroom.
Dugan, 65, faces charges related to obstructing a proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent their arrest. She is reported to have delayed Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE’s) apprehension of Mexican immigrant Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 30, while he appeared in her courtroom on a misdemeanor battery charge earlier this month. Flores-Ruiz, who was deported once before, in 2013, has now been detained by ICE.
When authorities presented a warrant for Flores-Ruiz’s arrest, Dugan apparently asked for more information and told the agents they needed to speak to the chief judge before they could arrest Flores-Ruiz there.
The FBI’s affidavit alleges the judge “became visibly angry, commented that the situation was ‘absurd,’ left the bench, and entered chambers. At the time, Ruiz was seated in the gallery of the courtroom.”
The affidavit claims a courtroom deputy saw Dugan telling Flores-Ruiz and his attorneys to exit through a side door, while the agents sought out the chief judge.
In response to the arrest, Republican state lawmaker Bob Donovan said, “In all my years of Milwaukee politics and public safety issues, working with cops, district attorneys, and judges, I have never seen a more irresponsible act by an officer of the court, let alone a judge, if true.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/doj-allows-authorities-to-arrest-tren-de-aragua-gangbangers-without-warrants,DoJ Allows Authorities To Arrest Tren de Aragua Gangbangers without Warrants,By Raw Egg Nationalist,8 days ago,"Federal law enforcement officers have been authorized to detain and arrest suspected members of Venezuelan terrorist organization Tren de Aragua without a warrant.
An internal memo, obtained by USA Today, states that law-enforcement officers do not require a warrant to arrest members of Tren de Aragua, who have been scheduled for expedited deportation by the President under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.
The memo advises officers that they should, nevertheless, “consider consulting federal prosecutors in the relevant district to obtain criminal search warrants and/or criminal arrest warrants” for immigration violations.
“While the ultimate goal is immediate identification and removal of Alien Enemies, coordination with federal prosecutors—who are required to support these operations at every step—may enhance officers’ ability to conduct apprehensions safely and efficiently, and may assist in the collection of evidence identifying additional Tren de Aragua members in the vicinity of the Alien Enemy to be apprehended,” the memo states.
Earlier in the month, it was reported that illegals arrested under the powers of the Alien Enemies Act should be given over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be housed and processed for deportation in Texas.
Earlier this week, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said over 600 alleged members of Tren de Aragua have already been arrested.
“f you are here illegally and break the law, we will hunt you down, arrest you and lock you up. That’s a promise,” Secretary Noem said in a post on X.
Last weekend, the US Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting an unknown number of Venezuelans who were due to be deported under the Alien Enemies Act.
“The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,” the order states.
The order, which grants an emergency application filed by the Venezuelan men, was subject to dissent from Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.
The emergency application was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which asked the Supreme Court to block the Trump administration from deporting its clients. The ACLU is also seeking a temporary restraining order in the US District Court of the District of Columbia and a stay of removal from the Fifth Circuit.
Last month, President Trump designated Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, as a foreign terrorist organization. In an Executive Order, he said the President said the group is “perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.”
The President then invoked the Alien Enemies Act to allow the “immediate apprehension, detention, and removal” of members of Tren de Aragua who are Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older and who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States.
On 15 March, the Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to deport nearly 150 Venezuelans to El Salvador, to be incarcerated in the Center for Terrorist Confinement (CECOT).
In a decision on 7 April, the Supreme Court had granted President Trump’s request to pause a district judge’s stay order preventing the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua, but ruled that detainees must be given the opportunity to challenge their removal from the US."

At the rally in Michigan, the President will highlight what he considers to be the main successes of his first 100 days in office: his economic policies, deportations of illegals, foreign-policy changes, and the work of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut waste in the federal government.
One official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity described the first 100 days as “like living in a dreamscape.”
The official went on to explain that there will be more to come, including “torpedoes under the water,” which will include more Executive Orders designed to further Trump’s agenda. President Trump has so far signed 137 Executive Orders during the first months of his second term, more than half the 220 he signed between 2017 and 2021, during his first presidency.
Another official said the President would use his next 100 days to focus on peace talks and trade deals.
At Pope Francis’s funeral on Saturday, President Trump was pictured meeting with President Zelensky of Ukraine at the Vatican for their first face-to-face meeting since their disastrous encounter in the Oval Office.
“We discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered,” Zelensky said of the meeting.
“Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.”
Meanwhile, US envoys have been meeting with representatives of the Russian and Iranian regimes in the hope of secure major agreements to bring an end to the war in Ukraine and limit Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
Next month, the President plans to visit Saudia Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. In an interview with Time Magazine on Friday, he said he would be willing to meet with Iran’s leaders directly if it helped secure a new nuclear deal.
President Trump’s flagship tariff policy is expected to bring dozens of foreign nations to the negotiating table to hammer out new terms for trade with the US, to avoid punitive impositions on exports.
A deal with China, the main target of the tariffs, remains elusive at present; although President Trump has expressed his optimism that one will be struck soon."

The US and Iran concluded a third round of talks on Saturday aimed at imposing limitations on Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The talks took place in Oman between teams led by White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
“The talks in Muscat were positive and productive. There is still much to do, but further progress was made on getting to a deal,” a senior U.S. official said in a statement sent to reporters.
The Iranian Foreign Minister said the talks were “much more serious than in the past,” and that “some differences are serious, some less so. I’m hopeful about reaching a deal, but still cautious.”
The talks are said to have lasted four hours. Details of the discussions have not been released, but Oman’s Foreign Minister said “core principles, objectives and technical concerns were all addressed.”
The next round is scheduled to take place in Europe next week.
In an interview with Time magazine published on Friday, President Trump said he thinks he can make a deal with Iran “without the attack.”
“I hope we can,” the President added.
President Trump also said he was open to meeting with Iran’s leaders."

The apparent attack took place at around 8pm local time on Saturday, when members of the local Filipino community were holding a block party to celebrate the Filipino national hero Lapu Lapu. Thousands of people were in attendance, with dozens of food trucks.
Images of the scene show a black SUV with a crumpled hood and extensive damage to its engine. Video footage posted to social media shows a trail of bodies and paramedics and police attending the scene.

One witness who spoke to the media said he saw the black vehicle being driven erratically before the attack.
“I didn’t get to see the driver, all I heard was an engine rev,” Yoseb Vardeh, who owns a food truck, said in an interview with Postmedia.
“I got outside my food truck, I looked down the road and there’s just bodies everywhere. He went through the whole block, he went straight down the middle.”
Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was “devastated” to hear about the “attack.
“I offer my deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed and injured, to the Filipino Canadian community, and to everyone in Vancouver. We are all mourning with you,” he said.
The driver of the vehicle has been arrested.
At present, the motive for the attack is unknown."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/four-letter-words-why-we-need-to-pay-attention-to-our-prepositions-if-we-want-to-prevent-a-pandemic-re-run,Four-letter Words: Why We Need To Pay Attention To Our Prepositions If We Want To Prevent a Pandemic Re-Run,By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"There’s a short video of Jose Luis Borges in which the legendary writer expounds, surprisingly perhaps, on the peerless greatness of the English language. If I remember correctly, he’s being interviewed by Bill Buckley; although thankfully that prissy old queen doesn’t say much. The video does the rounds on Twitter fairly regularly.
English is such a great language, far more so even than the writer’s native Spanish, Borges explains, because it contains multitudes. There is always more than one word for the same thing, allowing the wordsmith to convey different meanings through his careful choice from the word-hoard. One word might be taken from the roots of the language, in the earthy Germanic soil, and the other from the ornate Latin superstructure that was built on top of it by the medieval Church and England’s new French-speaking rulers after 1066.
“Ghost” and “spirit” are a good example, which of course are synonyms but have very different meanings and associations. If you talk about the “Holy Ghost,” you aren’t referring to the same solemn, far more otherworldly thing that is the Latin-derived “Holy Spirit”—even though you actually are.
Another greatness of the English language, Borges says, again without parallel in other languages, is its flexibility, especially the ability to modify verbs with prepositions and to create totally new meanings almost at will.
You can knock someone up, you can knock them down a peg, you can knock them out, you can knock them about, you can knock them for six… and so on.
The differences in meaning can be subtle or profound, simply by changing the preposition attached to the verb.
The differences can also be political. Very political. This is a lesson we all should have learned during the pandemic, when the substitution of one preposition for another was used, quite literally, to disguise and justify the imposition of a medical tyranny and everything that followed: confinement, censorship, mandatory vaccination—all of it.
Those two prepositions were “from” and “with.”
Perhaps you remember when the media, medical establishment and government started talking about deaths with COVID-19 rather than deaths from COVID-19? It happened overnight, without warning. I remember it well. One evening the BBC was talking about deaths from COVID-19, and the next it was talking about deaths with COVID-19. The two things were obviously not the same.
Of course, you had to be paying attention to notice. As we know, most people weren’t. They were too busy binge-watching Netflix and ordering DoorDash to care.
Still, it was a significant change and it was used to inflate the seriousness of the virus massively. Now a positive result with a notoriously inaccurate test within 28 days of death counted as a death caused by the virus. Just like that, COVID was killing many, many more people than it had been, which then justified the ongoing social restrictions, the censorship, the ceaseless propaganda, the jabs and the firing and ostracism for those who wouldn’t comply.
Exactly how many people were wrongly classified as casualties of COVID-19 hasn’t been clear until now. The assumption has always been that the numbers were exaggerated significantly, but now, thanks to a new study out of Greece, we know that perhaps half of all deaths attributed to COVID-19 may actually have had nothing to do with it.
Researchers looked at records for 530 deaths in seven hospitals in Athens between January and August 2022, during the Omicron “wave” of the virus. They found that about half of all deaths attributed to the virus should not have been. These were deaths with COVID-19 where the virus made no clear contribution to “the chain of events leading to death.”
Just 25% of all deaths recorded as COVID deaths could be verified as being directly linked to the virus, and a further 30% occurred among people whose death the virus had clearly contributed to.
That left 45% of deaths with COVID that simply had nothing to do with the virus. No link between death and the virus could be established.
Such a margin of error cannot plausibly be explained away as accidental.
The study had other interesting findings too. It showed that patients who died with the virus were more likely to be young and to be suffering from immunosuppression and other serious, usually fatal, conditions like end-stage liver failure. Patients who died from the virus were much older. And patients who contracted COVID in the hospital and then died were 130% more likely to be misclassified as having died from COVID. Something very strange was happening in hospitals.
If I were Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in charge of Health and Human Services, I’d commission similar research in the US. Don’t let critics say, “Oh that was just Greece. Things were different here, in America.” They weren’t. Things were exactly the same. Maybe they were even worse, because the stakes were even higher. The pandemic created the conditions that allowed the 2020 election to be stolen.
It’s the perfect time. Attitudes are changing towards the pandemic, including in the academic world. The Greek study was published in a top journal by Springer Nature, the world’s largest and most respected publisher of academic science papers. Stuff that just wouldn’t have been published even a year or two years ago—stuff that might actually have got researchers in serious trouble and impacted their chances of maintaining a job—is now within science’s Overton Window.
If I were still Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and I got to do a second thing, I’d go further. I’d do whatever it took to make sure the experts in charge of science and public health could never play with language like that again. New reporting requirements. A strict set of guidelines for defining disease morbidity—something. Don’t let them twist words.
Don’t let them lie.
First it was deaths with COVID-19 instead of from it. If we’re not careful, it will be deaths with bird flu not from it, or deaths with Disease X or whatever unholy gain-of-function project they’re putting through humanized mice in a Chinese lab somewhere—and before we know it we’ll be re-running the pandemic again. Lockdowns, mandatory vaccinations—the lot.
And all because we just weren’t paying attention to our four-letter words. As the old proverb has it, look after the little things, and the big things will take care of themselves."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/rfk-jr-teases-next-target-after-artificial-dye-ban,RFK Jr. Teases Next Target After Artificial Dye Ban,By Zero Hedge,9 days ago,"If you blinked during Tuesday’s Health and Human Services Department press conference on the agency’s plans to ban artificial dyes, you may have missed Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. teasing his next target.
Kennedy announced plans to target pharmaceutical additives, signaling he is getting ready to fire his opening salvo against Big Pharma.
A reporter asked, “I’m wondering if there’s any pharmaceutical additives that you’d like to eliminate?” prompting laughter from the audience.
“We’re gonna start on that next,” the HHS secretary replied, offering no further details on his plans.
Kennedy on Tuesday unveiled a plan to eliminate eight artificial food dyes and colorings from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, committing to collaborate with food companies to ensure a smooth transition and remove these additives from products.
Kennedy, pioneer of the Make America Healthy Again movement, has long criticized Big Pharma, vowing to hold the industry accountable for what he calls rampant corruption and profiteering. Kennedy has accused pharmaceutical giants of manipulating federal agencies like the FDA and seeks to curb direct-to-consumer advertising that he says taints media. Kennedy also plans to scrutinize vaccine safety. He was one of the most outspoke critics of the COVID vaccine and government-instituted lockdowns.
“I just want to urge all of you, it’s not the time to stop; it’s the time to redouble your efforts, because we have them on the run now, and we are going to win this battle,” Kennedy said. “And four years from now, we’re going to have most of these products off the market, or you will know about them when you go to the grocery store.”
ABC News reports:
Federal officials are taking steps to pull the authorization for two rarely used synthetic food colorings — Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B — within the coming months. In addition, the six other petroleum-based dyes that federal health agencies are seeking to eliminate by the end of next year are Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1 and Blue No. 2.
The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives, officials announced Tuesday.
The plan, however, is contingent on an “understanding” with major food companies that they will voluntarily remove them to meet consumer demand, Kennedy said Tuesday.
“There’s no need to have a regulation or a statute when companies are volunteering to do it,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said. “We are going to use every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done to the best of our abilities.”
“For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,” Makary added."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/miller-rips-dems-for-howling-with-rage-over-arrests-of-judges-for-aiding-illegals,Miller Rips Dems for “Howling with Rage” over Arrests of Judges for Aiding Illegals,By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had choice words for Democrats expressing their outrage over the arrest of two judges for sheltering illegal immigrants scheduled for deportation.
“Democrats spent the last 8 years stripping Americans of due process to jail them for protected political activity; illegally spying on the Trump Campaign; manipulating and fabricating intelligence and then criminally leaking it for partisan gain; using the FBI and intelligence apparatus to pursue political enemies; launching a coup against President Trump and his Administration; persecuting President Trump, his family, his aides and his supporters; censoring and deplatforming and blacklisting the opposition; removing opposition candidates from the ballot; maliciously fabricating false allegations to inflict outrageous financial punishments; raiding President Trump’s home and seizing his property; and weaponizing the entire legal system for the sole objective of incarcerating the Democrat Party’s chief political rival and seeking to illegally obstruct and rig the 2024 election,” Miller posted on X, on Friday.
“At the same time, Democrats orchestrated and engineered a mass invasion of the United States by foreign cartels and enemy terrorists, resulting in immense casualties and suffering across the nation.
“And now these same Democrats howl with rage when the invasion is returned and those who criminally harbor the invaders and feloniously obstruct their removal are held accountable under law.”
Miller’s post came after the arrest of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah C. Dugan, after she was alleged to have helped an illegal immigrant avoid arrest in her courtroom.
Dugan, 65, faces charges related to obstructing a proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent their arrest. She is reported to have delayed Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE’s) apprehension of Mexican immigrant Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 30, while he appeared in her courtroom on a misdemeanor battery charge earlier this month. Flores-Ruiz, who was deported once before, in 2013, has now been detained by ICE.
When authorities presented a warrant for Flores-Ruiz’s arrest, Dugan apparently asked for more information and told the agents they needed to speak to the chief judge before they could arrest Flores-Ruiz there.
The FBI’s affidavit alleges the judge “became visibly angry, commented that the situation was ‘absurd,’ left the bench, and entered chambers. At the time, Ruiz was seated in the gallery of the courtroom.”
The affidavit claims a courtroom deputy saw Dugan telling Flores-Ruiz and his attorneys to exit through a side door, while the agents sought out the chief judge.
In response to the arrest, Republican state lawmaker Bob Donovan said, “In all my years of Milwaukee politics and public safety issues, working with cops, district attorneys, and judges, I have never seen a more irresponsible act by an officer of the court, let alone a judge, if true.”
On Thursday, a former judge and his wife were arrested in New Mexico after a tip that they were sheltering alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, whose members have been scheduled under the Alien Enemies Act for expedited deportation.
The couple have been charged with tampering with evidence."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/rfk-jr-wants-cdc-to-stop-recommending-covid-shots-for-kids,RFK Jr. Wants CDC To Stop Recommending COVID Shots for Kids,By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is considering removing the COVID-19 vaccine from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) list of recommended vaccines for children.
The news was reported by Politico, which claims to have spoken with two sources familiar with the plan. Kennedy is said to have argued that there are no benefits to vaccinating children against COVID-19.
Before being confirmed as Secretary of HHS, RFK Jr. argued that vaccinating children against COVID-19 would be “reckless,” pointing to a number of studies that showed a zero mortality rate for children without underlying comorbidities.
At present, the CDC recommends children as young as six months receive COVID-19 vaccination with three doses of Pfizer’s mRNA shot or two of Moderna’s. The CDC also recommends an annual booster dose at least eight weeks after the most recent dose.
Most European nations have stopped recommending annual COVID vaccinations for children.
Health authorities in Sweden, for example, argued that the risks of vaccinating children against COVID-19 outweighed the benefits.
At present, no final decision has been made by HHS, but if it is decided to remove the recommendation, it could have far-reaching implications, since states and local authorities, as well as insurance companies,  use the CDC’s vaccine schedule for official purposes
At a meeting last week, the CDC’s independent vaccine advisory committee stated that it is considering moving from a universal to a risk-based approach to COVID-19 recommendations. Children are considered to be at very low risk from COVID-19.
Only a small minority of parents are vaccinating their children against COVID-19 in the US. According to CDC data, just 13% of US children have received the most recent COVID shot."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/kennedys-autism-investigation-to-be-the-most-comprehensive-ever,Kennedy’s Autism Investigation To Be the Most “Comprehensive” Ever,By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s “massive testing and research” into the causes of autism will use public and private databases to provide investigators with the most “comprehensive” evidence yet about the condition.
On Monday, Dr Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announced that his department’s investigation into autism will use federal and commercial databases and that new sources of information will be compiled.
The NIH will launch a new disease registry to track US citizens who have autism, and this data will be combined with existing datasets for the investigation.
Among the databases that could be used are the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and state vaccination registries. The VSD, for example, contains data on nearly 4% of the US population.
Many of these datasets have been unavailable to researchers in the past.
Dr Bhattacharya said the NIH wants to give researchers access to “comprehensive” data, so they can identify potential causes of autism with far greater certainty.
“The idea of the platform is that the existing data resources are often fragmented and difficult to obtain,” he said.
“The NIH itself will often pay multiple times for the same data resource. Even data resources that are within the federal government are difficult to obtain.”
Secretary Kennedy said last month that various sub-agencies of Health and Human Services have been withholding data from each other or even asking for money to release them.
Dr Bhattacharya said that the new comprehensive approach would yield insights into other conditions as well as autism, and that it could be used to provide “real-time health monitoring” as part of Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.
He also cautioned that, although Kennedy had promised the results of the autism investigation would be available by September, it was likely to be an “evolving process.”
Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that 1 in 31 children had autism in 2022, up from 1 in 31 in 2020 and 1 in 1,000 in the 1990s.
Last week, Secretary Kennedy told radio host John Catsimatidis the autism epidemic “dwarfs the COVID epidemic” and should be taken more seriously than COVID because of its effects on the young.
“This is an epidemic. It dwarfs the COVID epidemic and the impacts on our country because COVID killed old people. Autism affects children and affects them at the beginning of their lives, the beginning of their productivity.”
“And it’s absolutely debilitating for them, their families, their communities,” he added.
RFK Jr. went on to talk about the massive economic cost of autism, in addition to its emotional toll.
“For our country, just the pure economic cost of autism is, will be by 2035, $1 trillion a year. That’s just the beginning because many of these kids are aging out and their parents worry every day. And I’m talking about people with severe autism, what’s called profound autism, which is about, which is about 26 percent of the total people who are diagnosed with autism,” he said.
“Those families, those children are nonverbal, they’re non-toilet trained. They have all the stereotypical features of autism, head-banging, toe-walking, stimming, agonizing gut pain and head-banging. Those kids are kids that will not hold jobs. And many kids with autism, many of the higher functioning autism actually can, have tremendous potential to live independently, to get jobs, take care of themselves,” he continued."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/study-almost-half-of-covid-deaths-not-covid-deaths-at-all,Study: Almost Half of “COVID Deaths” Not COVID Deaths at All,By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"Almost half of “COVID deaths” in seven Greek hospitals were not COVID deaths at all, according to a new peer-reviewed study.
Researchers looked at 530 deaths in seven hospitals in Athens between January and August 2022, and found that about half of all deaths attributed to the virus should not have been.
Just 25% of deaths recorded as COVID deaths could be verified as directly linked to the virus. Almost 30% of deaths occurred among people who had the virus at time of death and for whom the virus could clearly be said to have “contributed to the chain of events leading to death.”
This left 45% of deaths “with COVID” for which no link between the virus and cause of death could be established.
The size of the inflation suggests the misrecording was not accidental.
An expert interviewed by The Defender said that it was well known since 2020 that the recording of COVID deaths was seriously, if not willfully, inaccurate. What’s different about this new study is that it’s published in a Nature journal. Springer Nature is the world’s largest and most respected publisher of academic science papers.
Among other important findings, the study showed that patients who died “with” COVID-19 were younger on average and more like to suffer from immunosuppression and other serious conditions like end-stage liver disease; patients who died “from” the virus were more likely to be older; and that patients who contracted COVID-19 in hospital and then died were 130% more likely to be misclassified as having died “from” COVID-19.
In addition, nearly 55% of those whose vaccination status was known and who died of COVID had been fully vaccinated or boosted.
According to the Dr Karl Jablonowski, of Children’s Health Defense, the study illustrates the devastating failings of the COVID response.
“There was a fog that settled over mainstream media during the time… That fog invariably erred on the side of fear, leading to fear-based decisions being favored over rational decisions.”
“Regardless of what the intention was behind the over-exaggeration of COVID-19 deaths, the consequences led us down the wrong path, he added.
“We isolated with closed doors and mask coverings. We administered experimental drugs and experimental vaccines. Our hospitals became places of harm.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/real-partnership-rubio-tells-nato-members-to-cough-up-5-of-gdp-for-defense,“Real Partnership”: Rubio Tells NATO Members To Cough Up 5% of GDP for Defense,By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"The US’s junior partners in NATO should ramp up defense spending to 5% of GDP, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a new interview. He said NATO could only “remain credible” if its members “fulfil their responsibilities.”
“NATO is only as strong as the commitments of its members,” Rubio told The Free Press in an interview.
“If the US is carrying the lion’s share, with European nations as mere junior partners, that’s not a true alliance—it’s a dependency.”
At present, under the terms of a 2014 agreement among members, NATO countries are supposed to spend 2% of GDP on defense, but many fail to do that.
“The US is pulling more than its fair weight,” Rubio said.
“For NATO to remain credible, its members must fulfil their responsibilities. If this is to be a real alliance, it must be a mutual commitment—not just one where the US covers the bill.”
Rubio went on to suggest that 5% of GDP would be a more sensible and fair contribution from other NATO members.
The Secretary of State’s comments have been echoed by the President, who was sharply critical of NATO during his first term, and by other members of the new Trump administration, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. Waltz recently said, “Europe’s security cannot remain a one-way street.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also made similar comments recently at the Army War College in Pennsylvania.
The next NATO summit is scheduled for June, at the Hague, in the Netherlands. The future of the alliance, and the US role in it, are likely to figure heavily. There are also major protests planned, because President Trump is due to attend."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/tesla-stock-bounces-back-despite-takedown-campaign,"Tesla Stock Bounces Back, Despite “Takedown” Campaign",By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"Tesla’s stock price is bouncing back, despite attempts by left-wing groups to launch a “Tesla Takedown” using targeted protests, vandalism and a broader political campaign to make buying Tesla products morally unacceptable.
Over the last five days, Tesla Stock has increased in value by a little under 25%.
The trend for the year-to-date, is negative—a decrease of just under 25%—but for the past 12months, the trend is positive, showing an increase of nearly 70%.
The bounce comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that he would be reducing his commitments to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—but not stepping away fully—during a conference call on Tuesday.
“It’s going to be viewed historically as probably the most important conference call Musk has ever had,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said, speaking to Bloomberg TV.
Musk’s support of President Trump and his leadership of DOGE has been extremely controversial, with some on the left accusing the billionaire of being “the real president.”
The most vigorous resistance to Musk’s swingeing recommendations of cuts to government departments has come in the form of a widespread, coordinated campaign of protests and vandalism against Tesla dealerships, charging stations and vehicles which AG Pam Bondi has described as “domestic terrorism.”
Individuals who have been arrested in connection with the protests are facing stiff prison sentences.
DOGE recently revealed cost savings of $150 billion dollars across government departments, as it seeks to achieve its goal of $ 1 trillion in cost savings before the end of its mandate next year.
According to the website, the savings are a “combination of asset sales, contract/lease cancellations and renegotiations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions.”
The latest batch of receipts posted on the website shows over 7,000 terminated contracts, including individual contracts amounting to billions of dollars. One cancelled contract, for refugee resettlement, amounted to $2,902,177,562.
Of all the departments of the US government, Health and Human Services has so far generated the greatest cost-savings, followed by the Department of Education and the General Services Administration.
The Department of Commerce, Department of Justice and Department of Veterans Affairs are among the departments generating the least savings.
DOGE also recently discovered that children and people who are clearly dead have been claiming hundreds of millions in unemployment benefit.
A survey of unemployment claims revealed that nearly 25,000 people aged over 115 claimed a total of $59 million in benefits, and 28,000 people aged between 1 and 5 claimed $254 million in benefits."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/ag-bondi-will-subpoena-journalists-to-catch-govt-leakers,AG Bondi Will Subpoena Journalists To Catch Govt Leakers,By Raw Egg Nationalist,9 days ago,"The Department of Justice will subpoena journalists when investigating leaks, in a reversal of a Biden-era policy restricting the use of such methods.
According to a memo obtained by Axios, Attorney General Pam Bondi will roll back a policy brought in by her predecessor, Merrick Garland which limited the use of subpoenas to obtain information from journalists acting “with the scope of newsgathering activities.”
“I have concluded that it is necessary to rescind Merrick Garland’s policies precluding the Department of Justice from seeking records and compelling testimony from members of the news media in order to identify and punish the source of improper leaks,” Bondi wrote in the memo.
The new Trump administration has been dogged by leaks of sensitive information, which in some instances have compromised planned operations, including deportation raids.
Last month, the Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into a leak of classified information about Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by the Trump administration for expedited deportation under the Alien Enemies Act.
After Trump designated the group as “alien enemies,” The New York Times reported a leaked intelligence document that it claimed challenges the legal basis for the designation.
The document clams with “moderate confidence” that Tren de Aragua are not operating under the direction of the Venezuelan government.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche strongly condemned the leak and described it as a deliberate effort by elements of the Deep State to undermine President Trump’s deportation agenda.
“We will not tolerate politically motivated efforts by the Deep State to undercut President Trump’s agenda by leaking false information onto the pages of their allies at the New York Times,” Blanche said.
“The Alien Enemies Proclamation is supported by fact, law, and common sense, which we will establish in court and then expel the TDA [Tren de Aragua] terrorists from this country.”
The New York Times defended its reporting in a statement.
“Freedom of the press is a cornerstone of democracy and critical for citizens to hold their government accountable. Leak investigations are meant to chill communications between journalists and sources, and undermine the ability of a free press to bring out vital information that may otherwise be hidden,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“Our story raised fundamental questions about whether the American people were getting a straight story about an important national security issue. That is precisely what journalists should be doing, no matter which party is in office.”
Other government departments have also faced a series of damaging leaks.
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard issued a warning to members of the intelligence community after she said some of them had leaked information to news outlets including The Washington Post and HuffPost.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem issued a similar warning after two employees at her department were arrested for leaking information. She said they would face up to ten years in prison."

The claim, one of his most audacious yet, came during an interview with Daily Wire co-founder and conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro.
Shapiro, known for his interventionist views regarding foreign affairs, pressed Zelensky on the issue of transparency, zeroing in on the nearly $200 billion in U.S. aid allocated to Ukraine’s defense.
“There’s lot’s a questions about where the money is going pensions, to war profiteering, to corruption,” Shapiro noted, before asking: “What kind of transparency can you provide to the American people to guarantee that there taxpayer dollars are being used in the best possible way to fight Russia and defend Ukraine, and to ensure, if the United States wants, would an audit be possible by the United States for where those dollars are going?”
“As for the audit, the United States has the understand there’s United States inspectors working, there’s inspectors of European countries, because we’ve also allocated their money and grateful to them,” Zelensky replied. “That is why we told them at once we’re ready to have any inspections from the very beginning of the way, inspectors coming from the United States, Europe, and our own inspectors.”
“We have complete reporting and accounting, absolutely transparent within the ministry of defense,” the Ukrainian president added. “There’s access to all the figures starting from the very first year of the war.”
🇺🇦 ZELENSKY: WE’RE OPEN TO ANY AUDIT—NOTHING TO HIDE“As for the audit, we’ve always been ready. From the very beginning of the war, we’ve welcomed inspectors from the U.S., Europe, and our own. There’s complete transparency within our Ministry of Defense—access to all figures… https://t.co/fXHqVRcEhj pic.twitter.com/VvUeRM7fLY
Zelensky then claimed that Russian “fake news” aimed at undermining U.S. aid to Ukraine was a primary reason for maintaining a comprehensive accounting of all American taxpayer funds provided to his government for the war.
“There’s nothing to hide, we’re absolutely open,” Zelensky told Shapiro. “There’s all the reports available.”
Zelensky’s comments prompted Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), an opponent of additional U.S. aid to Ukraine, to ask his nearly 600,000 followers on X if they believed the Ukrainian president’s claims.
“Funniest thing I’ve read all day,” billionaire Elon Musk tweeted in response, with a pair of laughing emojis.
Funniest thing I’ve read all day 🤣🤣
Not only does Zelensky maintain that Ukraine’s handling is U.S. aid is corruption-free, but he’s suggested in an interview with podcaster Lex Fridman that corruption was an issue in the West.
Kyiv Independent reports:
Ukraine has received less than half of the $177 billion in U.S. aid allocated to support Kyiv throughout the full-scale war, according to Zelensky. He suggested that this shortfall could be tied to issues of corruption or lobbying by U.S. companies.
“If we had $177 billion and if we get the half, where is the second half? If you find the second half, you will find corruption,” he said.
While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy firmly denies corruption allegations, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari claims the Russia-Ukraine conflict is fueling an influx of arms and fighters into the Lake Chad region, strengthening terrorist groups.
Of note, in 2015, The Guardian ranked Ukraine “the most corrupt nation in Europe.”
VOA reported in November 2022:
Buhari called for more vigilance and cooperation among the commission’s six member nations against the increased proliferation of weapons into the Lake Chad basin. He said weapons meant for the Ukraine war and to combat terrorism in the Sahel are being diverted to West Africa and ending up in the hands of terrorist groups.
Zelensky’s comments about U.S. aide comes as President Donald Trump is intensifying efforts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, with recent London talks pushing a ceasefire that would freeze frontlines and cede Crimea to Russia. Zelenskyy resists the plan, calling it unconstitutional, but Trump remains optimistic.
On Thursday evening, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS News that the Kremlin is “ready to reach a deal” with the U.S. regarding Ukraine, but cautioned that some of the terms need to be “fine tuned.”"

Federal authorities raided the home of former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Jose “Joel” Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, on Thursday afternoon.
Both Canos were taken into custody after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) executed a search warrant and probable cause arrest warrant at their house in Las Cruces amid an ongoing probe by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), KFOX14 reports.
The former judge and police officer has reportedly been charged with tampering with evidence and his wife faces a charge of conspiracy to tamper.

The bust comes in the wake of bombshell reporting last week by immigration news outlet Border Hawk which exposed the ex-judge’s apparent ties to the alleged gangbanger, identified as Venezuelan citizen Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, who was reportedly living with the Cano family when he was arrested by HSI El Paso on Feb. 28.
Days later, Cano abruptly stepped down from the bench, but his departure received little attention.
On Friday, Border Hawk published photographs and videos apparently showing Ortega-Lopez socializing with the Cano family – and even passing around and shooting weapons allegedly belonging to them.

Authorities believe Ortega-Lopez was invited to live in a casita on the Cano’s property after he developed a friendship with Nancy Cano while doing handyman work for her.
Ortega-Lopez was reportedly caught by U.S. Border Patrol on Dec. 15, 2023, at Eagle Pass, TX, after illegally entering the U.S. by scaling a barbed wire fence, but was released three days later due to overcrowding at holding facilities.
Ortega-Lopez has been charged with being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm or ammunition and is being held without bond at Doña Ana County Detention Center.

Leading Privacy Expert Asks President Trump to “Use His Gut” on REAL ID"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/dead-voters-forged-ids-germany-and-spain-face-electoral-fraud-scandals,"Dead Voters, Forged IDs: Germany and Spain Face Electoral Fraud Scandals",By Javier Villamor | The European Conservative,10 days ago,"Germany and Spain are facing major electoral scandals that have rocked public confidence in democratic institutions, as allegations of fraud, vote-buying, and systemic irregularities raise serious questions about the integrity of recent elections.
In Germany, a formal 80-page complaint submitted by Marcel Luthe, a former member of the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) and president of the Good Governance Union, has sparked a political storm by revealing systematic irregularities in the federal elections held in February 2025. The complaint, backed by more than 200 supporting documents, was submitted to the Bundestag’s Electoral Review Committee and asserts that the electoral system was “sabotaged according to a plan,” according to Berliner Zeitung.
Among the most shocking revelations is the claim that at least 2.5 million deceased individuals remained on the voter rolls. According to Luthe, this allowed votes to be cast in the names of the dead—a problem that had reportedly occurred in previous elections. Moreover, many polling stations did not require voters to present an official photo ID. In cities like Stuttgart, for instance, election officials were instructed to accept only the voting notification as sufficient identification—a document that is easily forged. This practice directly contravenes German electoral law, which in most cases mandates proper identity verification.
The problems did not stop there. Numerous citizens reported being denied the right to vote because someone had apparently already cast a vote in their name. In Bad Kreuznach, near Frankfurt, more ballots were found than there were registered voters, raising further red flags. Luthe also claims that thousands of German citizens living abroad did not receive their voting documents on time, despite having registered properly.
According to him, these voters tend to reject the traditional parties, so their exclusion may have benefited the governing coalition of Social Democrats and Greens. He described the entire electoral process as a “farce” and demanded that all polling station records be made public to allow for a full audit.
He also insists this is not a case of isolated mistakes, but rather a deliberate strategy to favor establishment forces and silence emerging parties such as Sahra Wagenknecht’s BSW—which missed the 5% parliamentary threshold by just 10,000 votes—and Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party that poses a significant challenge to the political status quo.
Meanwhile, in Spain, the Guardia Civil has uncovered several vote-buying schemes linked to the governing Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) dating back to previous local elections. In Mojácar, a town in the southern region of Andalusia, two PSOE candidates were arrested for allegedly offering money and public sector jobs to Latin American immigrants in exchange for their votes. The amounts ranged from 100 to 200 euros per ballot. In some cases, they also offered employment at the local town hall in return for support. These arrests originally took place just days before the 2023 municipal elections.
An even more scandalous case occurred in Albudeite, in the region of Murcia, where the socialist mayoral candidate was arrested along with twelve others for orchestrating a similar operation. The investigation revealed the use of coercion and identity fraud to manipulate mail-in votes, directly compromising the legitimacy of the election results. These practices, far from being anecdotal, seriously undermine confidence in the system and reinforce the growing perception that some parties are willing to break the law to stay in power.
These scandals in both Germany and Spain reignite a crucial debate about the need to protect the integrity of the electoral process against those who seem increasingly willing to bend the rules in order to maintain power."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/hegseth-orders-pentagon-to-clean-records-of-returning-soldiers-who-refused-covid-jab,Hegseth Orders Pentagon to Clean Records of Returning Soldiers Who Refused Covid Jab,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,10 days ago,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (LifeSiteNews) – U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued an update Wednesday on the Trump administration’s efforts to rehire military personnel discharged by the Biden administration for refusing COVID-19 vaccines, detailing steps underway to ensure no blemishes on their service records remain.
Until December 2022, President Joe Biden’s Pentagon leaders imposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates on American service men and women, provoking lawsuits and threatening soldier and pilot shortages in the tens of thousands that only added to broader problems of force strength, troop morale, and public confidence. In his first month back in office, President Donald Trump issued a directive to reinstate all such members, vowing to give them back pay as well.
On April 23, Hegseth issued a directive to all senior Pentagon leaders and relevant military commanders requiring they provide additional guidance to Military Department Review Boards to “facilitate, as appropriate, the removal of adverse actions based solely on refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine (or requesting a medical or religious/administrative accommodation), discharge upgrades for individuals involuntarily separated solely for refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine whose service was characterized as less than fully honorable, and appropriate remedies for Service members who suffered a wide variety of other career setbacks resulting from their principled refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine.”

“We’re doing everything we can, as quickly as we can, to reinstate those who were affected by that policy,” Hegseth told the public in a message released the same day.
“It hasn’t been perfect, and we know that. We’re having an ongoing conversation with you to get it right,” he added, “working with the White House as well. We want anyone impacted by that vaccine mandate back into the military — people of conscience, warriors of conscience — back in our formations.”
“The guidance also will facilitate the removal of adverse actions on service members solely for refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine, including discharge upgrades and less than fully honorable discharges for individuals separated from refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine,” the secretary said. “We’re trying to scrub all that, clean all that up.”
In his first month back in office, Trump also set to work reversing past presidents’ politicization of the military by ordering the elimination of “Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion” (DEI) programs from the military and discharge of service members afflicted with gender confusion. The administration also banned LGBT and “Black Lives Matter” (BLM) flags from being flown at U.S. embassies and other State Department facilities and ended observation of all identity-based “cultural awareness” months, including LGBT Pride Month."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/most-germans-have-had-enough-of-the-firewall-against-afd,Most Germans Have Had Enough of the ‘Firewall’ Against AfD,By Tamás Orbán | The European Conservative,10 days ago,"After a turbulent election season dominated by the establishment’s demonization of the national conservative AfD—now Germany’s most popular party—the plurality of Germans believe that ending the undemocratic cordon sanitaire against them is long overdue, regardless of who they vote for.
According to a recent Insta survey, published by Junge Freiheit on Wednesday, April 23rd, 46% of all German voters agree with the statement that “AfD should be treated as any other party”—without the others excluding them from decision-making and automatically rejecting any cooperation—while only 33% disagree.
The anti-firewall opinion is shared by almost half of center-right CDU voters (49%), the overwhelming majority of liberal FDP voters (63%), and even 47% of left-wing populist BSW voters.  By contrast, the majority of those who vote for the traditional Left—the socialist SPD, the Greens, and the far-left Linke—want AfD to continue to be excluded.
Nonetheless, a majority of all voters (51%), regardless of their voting intention, now believes that AfD will win the next general elections in 2029. Given the current trends, there’s good reason to think that’s possible: the party finished second  in the snap elections held earlier this year with 20.8% of the votes, but then  the lead in the polls with 26% in just two months.
Die AfD (26%) etabliert sich als stärkste Kraft vor CDU/CSU (25%): Auch in der jüngsten Sonntagsfrage bleiben wir an der Spitze! Herzlichen Dank für die große Unterstützung! pic.twitter.com/wX9Yo3juqC
AfD’s rising popularity is mainly due to incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his CDU backtracking on numerous campaign promises in order to strike a coalition agreement with the socialist SPD, which is set to come back to governance despite delivering the worst election result in its history.
Taken together, the CDU-SPD coalition’s popularity now stands at a mere 40%, a new all-time low for a German government. Since the election in late February, they lost around 5 percentage points, and would no longer be able to govern if the race were held today.
No wonder there’s  growing internal pressure within the CDU to let go of the firewall against the AfD, which is becoming increasingly untenable within the democratic frameworks and only seems to strengthen the party’s popularity at the expense of the center-right.
The disillusionment of CDU voters is also reflected in this latest survey: 45% of them predict that their party will lose the next election. AfD’s victory is deemed more likely by the voters of every party, except the SPD and the Greens."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-pleads-putin-to-stop-striking-ukraine-brutally-attacks-zelensky-for-refusing-peace,"Trump Pleads For Putin to Stop Striking Ukraine, Brutally Attacks Zelensky For Refusing Peace",By Sean Miller,11 days ago,"On Thursday President Donald Trump issued a plea and directive to Russian President Vladimir Putin to cease bombing Ukraine. Washington has been seeking a peace agreement between the warring nations but Ukrainian Dictator Vladimir Zelensky has refused negotiations, causing harsh criticism from Trump on Wednesday.
“I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!,” Trump said Thursday.
The President was referencing Thursday’s strike against Kiev resulting in the deaths of 12 people and 90 being injured after 70 missiles and 145 drones hit the Ukrainian capital city.
Trump requesting Putin to stop the bombardment may be a last ditch effort to end the war. It was recently reported that both him and Vice President JD Vance have said they’re ready to walk away from mediating the conflict if a resolution is not brought forward soon.
“It’s time for them to either say yes or for the U.S. to walk away from this process,” Vance told reporters in India on Wednesday. “We’ve engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy, of on the ground work.”
Vance explained that Washington offered Moscow and Kiev a “very explicit proposal” regarding a war resolution agreement.
“It’s now time, I think, to take, if not the final step, one of the final steps, which is, at a broad level, the party saying we’re going to stop the killing, we’re going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today,” Vance said Wednesday. “Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.”
Trump said Friday that Washington will take a pass on the peace talks if Moscow and Kiev fail to come to an agreement.
The final peace agreement appears to be held up due to Ukraine’s Dictator refusing to give up anything, even land like Crimea which Kiev had lost before Zelensky even took office following a referendum vote. Trump criticized the Dictator for this on Wednesday.
While Trump attempts last ditch pleas for peace, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov explained how Western Europe had done nothing to heed Moscow’s warnings on expanding NATO to its doorstep.
”If you aim to guarantee Ukraine’s security by drawing it into NATO, you are violating Russia’s security,” Peskov said. ”Neither Macron nor other European leaders wanted to listen to Putin when he told them that Russia had been cornered … Today, we talk about peace with the Americans, yet the Europeans are demanding war.”"

The timing of this footage is in tandem with Hegseth raising alarm that there are people within the Pentagon who are trying to sabotage the Trump administration.

In addition to Sahra Wagenknecht, whose party barely missed reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter parliament, Marcel Luthe, a former member of the Berlin House of Representatives and current president of the Good Governance trade union, also filed an 80-page complaint, with more than 200 pages of supporting documents.
Luthe lists the shortcomings of the federal election and how they may have influenced its outcome, perhaps even intentionally.
Just 10,000 votes could have significantly changed the composition of the German parliament, since with the entry of BSW, for example, the CDU/CSU and SPD government coalition would no longer be possible.
One of Luthe’s primary issues revolves around the difficulties Germans living abroad have in voting. His union collected numerous complaints from Germans overseas whose voting documents did not arrive on time, meaning they could not participate in the federal election.
Calling the election a “farce” on X, Luthe said it was “deliberately and systematically sabotaged” in such a way that “especially Germans living abroad, who don’t usually vote for the governing parties, were unable to vote effectively.”
Morgen wird die Bundestagswahl 2025 zwei Monate zurückliegen. Zwei Monate, in denen der geänderte Wille des Souveräns nicht umgesetzt wurde, sondern dieselben Appartschiks weiter wursteln wie bisher.Wie angekündigt werden wir morgen – form- und fristgerecht – diese Farce… pic.twitter.com/gZIP7QrFPV
“Two months in which the changed will of the sovereign was not implemented, but the same apparatchiks continued to muddle along as before. As announced, tomorrow we will challenge this farce of an election – in due form and within the deadline… I am curious to see how those responsible intend to wriggle out of the 85 pages of justification for the challenge – plus attachments. The Federal Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Foreign Office play a central role in this,” he wrote.
Luthe also complains in his filing about the lack of accessibility at polling stations; the leak of “exit polls” by journalists on election day, which may have influenced the outcome; and the existence of the 5 percent hurdle itself.
The issue of voter ID also comes up. According to Luthe, the Federal Election Code mandates that voters must in most cases prove their identity using their official photo ID. However, going even further, he calls Germany’s voter notification itself a letter “without any forgery-proof feature,” which is insufficient in the effort to prevent unauthorized persons from voting.
In one glaring example provided in his complaint, the city of Stuttgart issued a letter to electoral boards requesting that voters with a voting notification be checked “only in cases of doubt, using ID.” In a leaflet for electoral boards, the city even stated that if a voting notification was available, this was “generally” sufficient.
Luthe says such policies allow for “significant abuse,” and given the 65,000 polling stations at stake, this could have led to tens of thousands of incorrectly cast votes and thus had a decisive influence on the election outcome.
Discrepancies are also said to have arisen due to voting notifications disappearing in the mail. There was reportedly at least one case of mass loss or theft of voting notifications in the 2021 election and also in the most recent federal election.
Further compounding concerns include eligible voters who had supposedly already voted were turned away from polling stations. Luthe cites a case in Bad Kreuznach in Rhineland-Palatinate, where a voter was initially turned away from his polling station on the grounds that his vote had already been cast. He was eventually allowed to vote, but this was not an isolated case and raised concerns of false votes having been submitted.
In the polling station for Bad Kreuznach, more ballot papers were found than voters registered. Luthe is therefore demanding that all records from all polling stations be made available to him for review, as such an error violates “the integrity of the election in a significant way.”
Another issue already raised back in 2021 for Berlin’s parliamentary election is that of voter registers not being cross-referenced with death registers, with notifications mistakenly sent out to people no longer alive.
“The right to vote in Berlin still extends to residents in our cemeteries,” Luthe said.
For the election this past February, he says that more than 2.5 million additional eligible voters were registered who are actually dead.
Luthe told Berliner Zeitung: “As in 2021, the deliberate organizational failure is not apparent if one only considers individual cases without context and background.” In 2021, a repeat election to the Berlin House of Representatives was held. The most recent federal election also failed to meet the “requirements of the Basic Law for democratic elections,” he said.
The paper says the Electoral Review Committee can take months to process complaints, and an election review complaint can only be filed with the Federal Constitutional Court after these complaints have been rejected by this committee.
However, today, Luthe posted again on X, saying, “The media will address and dismiss the objections of the BSW and AfD. All the massive electoral errors will then go unreported, and the issue will be dead.”"

https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-admin-we-will-not-tolerate-states-using-gender-ideology-to-strip-parental-rights,Trump Admin: We ‘Will Not Tolerate’ States Using Gender Ideology to Strip Parental Rights,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,11 days ago,"(LifeSiteNews) – A Trump administration spokesman said it will “not tolerate” infringements on parental rights, such as a proposal in Colorado to make “misgendering” potential grounds to remove children in custody disputes.
Named after a victim of the 2022 Club Q nightclub shooting perpetrated by “non-binary” Anderson Aldrich, the Kelly Loving Act would establish that “when making child custody decisions and determining the best interests of a child for purposes of parenting time, a court shall consider deadnaming, misgendering, or threatening to publish material related to an individual’s (so-called) gender-affirming health-care services as types of coercive control. A court shall consider reports of coercive control when determining the allocation of parental responsibilities in accordance with the best interests of the child.”
It would also ban state courts “from applying or giving any force or effect to another state’s law that authorizes a state agency to remove a child from the child’s parent or guardian because the parent or guardian allowed the child to receive” dangerous “gender transition” procedures and has a host of additional requirements unrelated to custody matters. It has passed the Colorado House but not yet the Colorado Senate.
Speaking to the Daily Signal, U.S. Department of Education (DOE) spokeswoman Julie Hartman declared that “children do not belong to the government. They belong to parents.”
Without announcing any specific action, she added, “the department will not tolerate abuse of parents’ rights — or of students who are victims of predatory behavior by adults who are supposed to protect them.”
Critics say transgender activists have inflicted a wide array of harms on society, both to the physical and mental health of gender-confused individuals themselves as well as to the rights, health, and safety of those who disagree, such as girls and women forced to share intimate facilities with males, female athletes forced to compete against biological males with natural physical advantages, and individuals forced to affirm false sexual identities in violation of their consciences, their understanding of scientific fact, and/or their religious beliefs.
Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has taken multiple executive actions to reverse the Biden administration’s transgender policies, including an order that ends all federal support for “transition” procedures on minors, rescinds or amends all of the Biden health bureaucracy’s past endorsements of underage “transitioning,” and calls for a review of the medical literature on the subject, enforcing all existing restrictions on underage “transitioning,” and taking regulatory action to “end” the practice to the greatest extent possible under current law.
The Trump administration has also frozen Title IX grants to Main over the state’s potential noncompliance with rules against gender-confused males in sex-specific school athletic competitions against actual females, and opened investigations into Maine and California for policies related to schools withholding information about a child’s gender confusion from parents."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/majority-of-germans-believe-afd-will-win-next-federal-election-poll-reveals,"Majority of Germans Believe AfD Will Win Next Federal Election, Poll Reveals",By Thomas Brooke | Remix,11 days ago,"A new INSA survey has revealed that a majority of German citizens now believe that the Alternative for Germany (AfD) could become the strongest political force in the next federal election.
At the same time, nearly half of respondents say the AfD should be treated like any other party, amid attempts by Germany’s legacy party to ostracize the populist faction with an ongoing political firewall.
According to the survey, reviewed by the Junge Freiheit news outlet, 51 percent of respondents believe it is likely the AfD will win the most votes in the next Bundestag election. Only 27 percent disagree.
The findings, presented by INSA head Hermann Binkert on YouTube, point to a growing normalization of the AfD’s rise. Alice Weidel’s party became the second-largest party in the Bundestag after February’s election, but its popularity has continued to rise following the election-winning Christian Democratic Union’s (CDU) decision to team up with the Social Democrats (SPD) to form another Grand Coalition.
Among AfD voters themselves, belief in victory is overwhelming at 87 percent. However, even supporters of traditionally centrist or left-leaning parties express similar expectations: 63 percent of BSW voters and 60 percent of FDP voters also think the AfD could come out on top. Only the SPD and Greens’ bases remain broadly skeptical.
Some 46 percent of Germans say the AfD should be treated like any other democratic party, compared with 33 percent who oppose this. While opposition remains strong among SPD, Green, and Left Party supporters, majorities within the CDU/CSU (49 percent), FDP (63 percent), and BSW (47 percent) now favor equal political treatment for the AfD. Unsurprisingly, 83 percent of AfD voters agree.
The softening of opposition contrasts with the hard stance taken by Germany’s major Christian churches, which have repeatedly condemned the AfD. However, voter behavior within the religious communities tells a different story.
Among Protestants, 26 percent support the AfD — second only to the CDU/CSU (28 percent) and way ahead of the Greens (7 percent). Catholic voters also give 25 percent support to the AfD, with the CDU/CSU again leading at 34 percent. The Greens trail with just 13 percent.
Among non-religious voters, the AfD is the most popular party (26 percent), surpassing the CDU/CSU (19 percent) and SPD (14 percent). Muslim voters, on the other hand, typically show strong support for left-wing, pro-migration parties, including the SPD (37 percent) and the Left Party (25 percent), with AfD support negligible at 5 percent.
A Forsa poll published this week showed the AfD out in front as the leading party in Germany for the first time in its history, attaining 26 percent, with the CDU/CSU a percentage point behind.
If the vote back in February were held today, the two parties set to enter government, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the CDU, would not have enough seats for their agreed coalition.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/deported-maryland-father-kilmars-van-full-of-migrants-owned-by-convicted-human-trafficker,"Deported ‘Maryland Father’, Kilmar’s Van Full Of Migrants Owned By Convicted Human-Trafficker",By ZeroHedge,12 days ago,"Last week it was revealed that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a deported El Salvadoran man (aka, ‘Maryland Father’) at the center of an intense political debate, was suspected by a Tennessee state trooper of human trafficking in 2022 after he was pulled over for driving erratically in a black 2001 Chevrolet Suburban – owned by another individual, full of people.
“During the interview, subject pretended to speak less English than he was capable of and attempted to put encountering officer off-track by responding to questions with questions,” reads the summary. “When asked what relationship he had with the registered owner of the vehicle, subject replied the owner of the vehicle is his boss, and that his work is in construction.”
“There was no luggage in the vehicle, leading the encountering officer to suspect this was a human trafficking incident,” according to DHS records.
Now, Just the News reports that the SUV was owned by a man who was himself deported after pleading guilty to smuggling illegal aliens in 2020.
Abrego Garcia told the state trooper that the SUV was owned by his boss. DHS documents, meanwhile, identified the owner of the vehicle as Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes – whose 2001 Suburban was flagged separately by Homeland Security Investigations Baltimore field office as belonging to a target the suspected of human trafficking or smuggling, the documents reveal.
“Vehicle is used by HSI Baltimore target in human smuggling/trafficking operation. Vehicle makes trips to southern border to pick up non-citizens,” reads the record, adding that the Baltimore HSI case agent should be notified if the vehicle is encountered.
Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, who Abrego Garcia claimed he was working for, had been previously convicted of smuggling illegal aliens into the United States.
In 2020, Hernandez Reyes, himself an illegal alien, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months in prison for smuggling fellow illegal aliens in the United States after he was stopped by law enforcement in Mississippi in a car with passengers from Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. Homeland Security records indicate Hernandez Reyes’ “deport order” was reinstated in March 2021, as his 18-month sentence was nearing its end. -Just the News
A DHS official confirmed to JTN that the Hernandez Reyes mentioned in both cases refer to the same individual, though it’s unclear what the relationship was between Abrego Garcia and Hernandez Reyes.
According to the report, the similarities in traffic stops between the two men are striking. According to the DOJ, Hernandez Reyes and one co-defendant were stopped outside in Jackson County, Mississippi in the Suburban, which was being driven by one Modesto Alvarez – later determined to be Hernandez Reyes’ brother-in-law.
Investigators also determined that the eight of the nine men in that stop were in the US illegally, and were citizens of Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras who had previously been deported from the United States and had illegally returned. They were  charged with unlawful reentry into the country.
Officers determined that Alvarez and Hernandez Reyes were transporting the illegal immigrants from their home base of Houston, Texas, to different locations throughout the United States. -JTN
Hernandez Reyes pleaded guilty in August 2020 to smuggling illegal aliens, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison plus three years of supervised release – after which he was slated to face deportation proceedings which carried a 10-year prison threat if he returns.
In the case of Abrego Garcia, he was stopped for driving erratically and speeding, on an expired driver’s license, by a Tennessee state trooper in November of 2022 – similarly transporting a large group of people from Houston, Texas.
Three weeks after the stop, on Dec. 27, 2022, DHS updated its records to urge any personnel who encountered Abrego Garcia to “escort to secondary” – a designation usually applied to someone suspected of wrongdoing."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/peter-schiff-golds-rise-is-a-warning-everyone-ignores,Peter Schiff: Gold’s Rise Is a Warning Everyone Ignores,By SchiffGold,12 days ago,"In Friday’s episode of The Peter Schiff Show, Peter sets his sights on the market’s astonishing complacency in the face of gold’s surge, the misplaced confidence in U.S. trade policy, and the broader implications of America’s debt addiction. He makes the case that the real warning signals aren’t flashing on Wall Street or Capitol Hill, but embedded in the price of gold—while few seem willing to pay attention.
He opens by highlighting one remarkable aspect of gold’s climb—not the price itself, but the collective ignorance around it:
But you know, what’s more significant even than the increase in the price of gold is the fact that nobody cares. Nobody pays attention. You know, I’ve said this before, but it bears repeating. When you don’t know there’s a bubble, you don’t see the pin. And that is something that I came up with during the housing crisis. Because a lot of people, even after 2007, after the subprime market really started to collapse, most people just shrugged it off. They didn’t care. They thought it was nothing.
Peter moves to the unstable environment driving these changes—specifically, the trade wars ignited by tariffs under President Trump. He points out that the expert consensus was flat-out wrong when it came to the consequences for the dollar and the global economy:
What’s even more significant is that this is happening during a time of turmoil. Trump basically started it with these tariffs, launched this global trade war, created all this economic uncertainty. No one knows what the hell is going on. Trade is a big part of the global economy. And again, remember, all of these so-called experts predicted that tariffs would cause the dollar to go up. That’s why the dollar rallied right after Trump won, because the markets were saying, oh, we’re going to get tariffs, that’s good for the dollar.
Turning to international affairs, Peter takes aim at the mistaken belief that China is desperate for American consumers. He challenges the narrative of U.S. indispensability with a clear-eyed assessment of both nations’ economic realities:
I’ve got to counter all the nonsense that I’m hearing… Trump or one of his advisors said  that China is desperate to make a deal. … China needs to make a deal because China wants what we have, the American consumer.  China wants consumers. There’s a billion Chinese. Why would they need consumers? They got more consumers in China than we got in America. What’s so special about the American consumer that China needs us?
Reinforcing the theme of economic misunderstanding, Peter spotlights a fundamental error in how government officials—particularly at the Treasury—think about abundance and scarcity. He uses a simple analogy to question why policymakers seem to prefer an economy of limits, rather than one of overflow:
What is better if you can make more than you need, or you can’t make as much as you need, right? If you make too much food, what’s the worst thing that’s going to happen? Some of it’s going to rot. If you don’t make enough food, you could starve to death, right? So what do you want to have, a surplus? Do you want to have abundance or do you want to have scarcity? See, according to the Secretary of the Treasury … scarcity is better than abundance.
Peter wraps his analysis by returning to the heart of the issue: the United States’ addiction to debt and the inevitable consequences of monetary intervention. He warns that we’re heading toward not just another crisis, but a distinctly American reckoning—one that might spare the rest of the world for once:
I mean, that is the bottom line, right, massive QE. We are heading to another financial crisis, only it’s not a global crisis, it’s going to be a U.S. crisis. We’re going to liberate the world, because they’re not going to be dragged down, they’re not going to be buying our dollar and buying our debt. They’re going to be taking their money home, keeping their goods for themselves. And so the world is going to be better off keeping its stuff and investing its savings in their own economies rather than giving us their stuff and investing their money here in America."

Tuesday where she went after several prominent Republicans and pushed stereotypical divisive rhetoric.
During one of her Ebonics-laden tirades, the representative suggested Americans shouldn’t be discussing policies, because “can’t nobody tell you what Donald Trump’s policies were.” [sic]
Portraying Trump supporters as uninformed idiots, she said, “You ask them, like, ‘What policies?’ ‘I don’t know, but he gonna bring down the price of eggs.’ The last time I checked that didn’t happen, right?” [sic]
Instead of focusing on policy, Crockett claimed, “People are voting on vibes.”

Kimmel pointed out President Trump called Crockett “low IQ” and asked if she’d be open to taking an IQ test publicly to go head-to-head with the president, and she answered, “Absolutely!”

The Texas Democrat continued to bash Republicans, saying, “The level of incompetence is almost like incomprehensible,” and calling tech entrepreneur Elon Musk an “idiot.”
“He is not only, like, very sinister and has no idea what he’s doing, and people are like, ‘Oh, no! He absolutely knows because he’s the richest man in the world.’ Like, yes, he knows how to hire smart people but don’t conflate that and believe that he is the genius, cuz he ain’t.” [sic]
She then alleged Musk has “inflicted so much harm that even Trump don’t wanna talk about it… We ain’t been hearing about him.” [sic]

“She’s dumb and a low-life,” the Democrat said.

The administration went so far as to ‘downgrade’ their presence at a peace meeting in London, England this week as it is now being reported that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will not be in attendance, leaving only Gen. Keith Kellogg to represent the U.S. at the event.
“It’s time for them to either say yes or for the U.S. to walk away from this process,” Vance told reporters in India. “We’ve engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy, of on the ground work.”
Vance explained that Washington offered Moscow and Kiev a “very explicit proposal” regarding a war resolution agreement.
“It’s now time, I think, to take, if not the final step, one of the final steps, which is, at a broad level, the party saying we’re going to stop the killing, we’re going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today,” Vance said Wednesday. “Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.”

Unfortunately Ukraine appears unwilling to give up any territory, at least while under the dictatorship of Vladimir Zelensky.
“[Crimea] is our territory, the territory of the people of Ukraine. We have nothing to talk about on this topic, it is outside our constitution,” Zelensky said Tuesday.
That wasn’t all however, the Dictator even placed the blame on Russia for his own lack of ability to compromise by saying that this is what they want.
“As soon as we start talking about Crimea, about our sovereign territories, we enter the format of prolonging the war,” the Dictator said.
While the U.S. partially steps back their involvement mediating the situation in preparation for a full abandonment, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is hosting a bilateral meeting with a Ukrainian official on Wednesday, although details of what has and will be discussed are not yet clear."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/supreme-court-signals-support-for-parents-fighting-to-opt-children-out-of-lgbtqiaap2sn-school-lessons,Supreme Court Signals Support For Parents Fighting to Opt Children Out of LGBTQIAAP2SN+ School Lessons,By Doug Mainwaring | Lifesite,12 days ago,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (LifeSiteNews) — The U.S. Supreme Court today appeared to be on the side of a diverse group of parents in what promises to be a landmark case concerning parents’ rights to opt their children out of pro-LGBT school instruction aimed at students as young as three years old and that promotes a one-sided, left-wing ideology on gender and sexuality.
“In Mahmoud v. Taylor, the Montgomery County, Maryland Board of Education took away parental notice and opt-outs for storybooks that celebrate gender transitioning, pride parades, and pronoun preferences with kids as young as three and four,” explains a statement from the Becket Fund, the attorney group representing a coalition of Muslim, Christian, and Jewish parents.
The books in question were not even intended for use in human sexuality classes but as an integral part of Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) English and Language Arts classes.
Even left-leaning Justice Elena Kagan seemed to side with the parents against the MCPS’s drastic opt-out ban forcing young children to be exposed to extreme LGBT and “gender identity” material that not only many religious but also non-religious parents would likely object to.
Kagan said she, too, was struck by the “young kids’ picture books” and, “on matters concerning sexuality, I suspect there are a lot of non-religious parents who weren’t all that thrilled about this. And then you, … add in religion and that’s, you know, even more serious.”
Fox News’ justice correspondent, David Spunt, standing in front of the Supreme Court building said, “It looks like the justices will rule in favor of these parents.”
“This is not education, this is indoctrination,” said Billy Moges, a Montgomery County parent who serves as director of Kids First, in a Fox News interview immediately following today’s hearing.
“This is not only about religion,” said Moges, citing the fact that the parents who have joined Kids First represent many different religions and denominations, as well as atheists. “This is about parents with common sense. No parent with common sense will allow their 3-year-old to learn about sexual behaviors, to learn about sexual body parts.”
“This is wicked,” she added. “This is an attack on children and the family.”
“It’s going to destroy communities,” she predicted, “And when communities are destroyed, the nation will be destroyed.”
Moges affirmed that she and the other parents who seek to opt their children out of these lessons love, respect, and bear no hatred toward those who support this curriculum, but “our kids will not be brainwashed, will not be indoctrinated,” she insisted.
“The School Board is pushing inappropriate gender theory on children and running roughshod over parental rights,” said Grace Morrison, a member of Kids First’s board. “Today, we urged the Court to let kids be kids, and let parents guide their religious future. A child’s innocence, once lost, is gone forever.”
“The new ‘inclusivity’ books were announced in 2022 for students in pre-K through fifth grade. Instead of focusing on basic principles of respect and kindness, however, the books champion controversial ideology around gender and sexuality,” explained the Becket Fund.
According to the original complaint, MCPS “claims authority to introduce pre-K and elementary school kids to certain books (the ‘Pride Storybooks’) that promote one-sided transgender ideology, encourage gender transitioning, and focus excessively on romantic infatuation – with no parental notification or opportunity to opt out.”
“One book invites three- and four-year-olds to look for images of things they might find at a pride parade, including an ‘intersex (flag),’ a ‘(drag) king’ and ‘(drag) queen,’ ‘leather,’ ‘underwear,’ and an image of a celebrated LGBTQ activist and sex worker, ‘Marsha P. Johnson,’” the legal filing noted.
Teachers were also instructed to say doctors only “guess” when identifying a newborn’s sex.
The school board revoked notice and opt-outs for these storybooks, which violates Maryland law, the board’s policies, and the advice of its own elementary school principals.
Parents aren’t the only ones who have expressed concern about the addition of these books to the MCPS curriculum.
Early on, “Montgomery County’s own principals objected that these books were inappropriate for the age, they were dismissive of religion and shaming toward children who disagree,” explained Eric Baxter, Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, who presented the parents’ case in front of the Supreme Court justices today.
“The board itself withdrew two of the books for what it said were content concerns, because it finally agreed that what parents and petitioners and its own principals are saying was accurate,” said Baxter.
“In this country, we’ve always trusted families to decide when their kids are ready for sensitive topics,” said Eric Baxter. “Children shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, and gender transitions without their parents’ permission. Today, we fought for common sense and parents’ right to guide the upbringing of their children.”"

The poll, from Forsa, shows the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in second place with 25 percent.
If the vote were held today, the two parties set to enter government, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the CDU, would not have enough votes to enter government. The SPD is at 15 percent, giving the two parties a combined total of 40 percent.

BREAKING: 🇩🇪The AfD party is now the most popular party in Germany for the first time ever, soaring to 26%.The main German parties are working to ban the AfD, and a vote on a ban is expected in the coming months in the new Bundestag.Follow: @RMXnews pic.twitter.com/Czf0gJcNgs
The news comes at a time when the left is racing to vote on a ban on the AfD in the German parliament, the Bundestag, a topic covered in detail by Remix News. However, despite inital reports that the CDU would back such a ban, the picture is becoming muddier.
For one, there are more and more voices in the CDU and its sister party, the CSU, who are calling for “more calm” towards the AfD, including from the influential vice-chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Jens Spahn. Spahn even said that the AfD should be able to lead some of the committee in the Bundestag, which would give the party more say and power. Given that it received the second-most votes during the German election, it should, like all other parties, have access to these committees, but many want to shut it out completely, especially from intelligence committees.
The issue could lead to a major split in the coalition between the CDU and SPD. SPD Bundestag member Ralf Stegner told Welt his party has “absolutely no sense of humor” on any attempt to go easy on the AfD.
🇩🇪🚨 ""Germany needs the AfD""Young women are increasingly promoting the AfD party on TikTok.Many of them feel increasingly unsafe in Germany, and they believe AfD is the answer. pic.twitter.com/iXemPYBV0c
He said any kind of rapprochement would represent a “maximum stress test” for the new coalition govenrment.
“Anyone who wants to form a coalition with the SPD cannot join forces with right-wing radicals. And joining forces also means voting for enemies of democracy,” he said. The MP, known for his left-wing views, instead is calling for a ban on the AfD if the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) classifies the party as “confirmed right-wing extremist.”
“If the Office for the Protection of the Constitution upgrades its classification, then we also have a duty to work towards initiating a ban on the party,” Stegner said.

However, Welt reports that CDU is rejecting an “automoatic” approach to banning the AfD.
The CDU/CSU, in turn, rejects this automatic approach: “To derive an obligation to initiate ban proceedings from an upgrade by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution clearly ignores the legal situation,” said Günter Krings, legal policy spokesman for the CDU-CSU parliamentary group. He instead wants to “fight the AfD politically by exposing its extremism…The best recipe against the AfD is concrete successes by the new federal government, especially in migration, security, and the economy.”

He also claims that initiating proceedings “would only make the AfD rub its hands together and use it as free support for its victim myth.”
Meanwhile, the AfD is slamming calls for a ban. “The renewed call for an AfD ban is completely unfounded and would be completely hopeless,” said Alice Weidel, the co-leader of the AfD. “Instead of engaging in absurd and anti-democratic ban fantasies, Mr. Stegner should be thinking about why his party has been losing voters in droves for years.” Sahra Wagenknecht, who is the leader of the left-wing BSW, told Welt: “First gigantic electoral fraud, then the ban debate: could it get any more stupid? The fact that such proposals are now coming from the self-proclaimed ‘democratic center,’ of all places, is disgraceful and will further strengthen the AfD.”
She went so far as to say it was a purely autocratic move.
“No question, in an autocracy, the ‘problem’ would be solved in exactly the same way.”
Even in the SPD, there is debate about a ban.
SPD Minister President of Saxony Stephan Weil (SPD) warned a ban could also fail, which would be “a feast for the AfD.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/brussels-doubles-down-on-social-media-censorship,Brussels Doubles Down on Social Media Censorship,By Tamás Orbán | The European Conservative,12 days ago,"In a clear jab at the U.S.-based social media companies that have put free speech on their banners and allied with the Trump administration—Meta and X—European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that Brussels will not let global tech companies get away with disregarding the content moderation rules laid down in the EU’s infamous censorship tool, the Digital Services Act (DSA)—regardless of where they are located or who is running them.
“The rules voted by our co-legislators must be enforced,” von der Leyen told Politico on Monday, April 22nd.
“That’s why we’ve opened cases against TikTok, X, Apple, Meta, just to name a few,” she then went on, before claiming that the political bias had nothing to do with Brussels’ enforcement of the DSA:
We apply the rules fairly, proportionally, and without bias. We don’t care where a company’s from and who’s running it. We care about protecting people.
While it’s true that all of these companies are facing punitive action from EU regulators to a different extent, in most cases, the EU has been floating only “modest” fines of a few million euros so far, and mostly for non-compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), not the much more sinister DSA.
However, the case of Elon Musk’s X is different, defeating the entire ‘no political bias’ argument.
We reported earlier this month that Brussels is preparing to impose a completely unprecedented €1 billion fine on the company at the end of an ongoing investigation into its alleged DSA violations that began in 2023, right after Musk purchased the website and turned it into a cornerstone of online free speech.
Specifically, the case covers X’s refusal to police and censor “unlawful” content—anything that’s deemed ‘harmful’ or ‘disinformation’ by Brussels—as well as to share its data with external actors, such as researchers, regulators, or ‘fact-checkers.’ Reasonable things, considering the revelations of the Twitter Files, which many seem to have forgotten.
Meta could soon face a similar situation, as it’s been hit with the same criticism from Brussels since Mark Zuckerberg ditched his fact-checkers for being politically biased and carrying out the will of the Democratic Party and the various U.S. intelligence agencies in their content moderation.
In other words, American companies that have been actively working to restore and protect the freedom of speech are now being coerced by Brussels to allow the EU’s fact-checkers (the same organizations that were booted by Zuckerberg) to resume their previous censorship work under the DSA.
While von der Leyen may act like all global tech giants are treated the same in Brussels, the mainstream parties in the EU Parliament’s ‘Ursula coalition’ made it abundantly clear earlier this year that their problem is specifically with the “tech oligarchs” who aligned with President Trump.
What’s more, the alleged disinformation that spreads on X and Meta was named as one of the key reasons the EU is working on the so-called Democracy Shield, an additional toolbox to help police online content and enforce existing DSA rules.
The EU’s increasingly aggressive stance on free speech-oriented platforms (and U.S. companies in general) didn’t escape the attention of the Trump administration. Back in February, Vice President JD Vance called out the EU’s insistence on political censorship, while the “unfair” targeting of U.S. tech giants is a central point of conflict in the escalating trade war between Washington and Brussels.
With everything happening since Trump took office, von der Leyen’s claim that DSA enforcement is not political is simply ridiculous. Perhaps she should start fact-checking herself next time."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/stop-all-federal-funding-of-universities,Stop All Federal Funding of Universities,By Connor O'Keeffe | Mises Institute,12 days ago,"The Trump administration has found itself in a dispute with Harvard University. It began when the President’s team sent several Ivy League universities a list of changes they expected the schools to make.
The move is part of a new right-wing strategy which recognizes that we currently live under a vague, necessarily politicized system of civil rights law and aims to begin interpreting civil rights laws in ways more in line with the values and social aims of the right.
By threatening to withhold federal funds, the administration was able to get schools like Columbia University to agree to enact changes like banning masks, granting campus police more powers, and appointing an administrator to oversee the Middle East Studies Department with the authority to crack down on rhetoric about Israel that the administration considers antisemitic.
Harvard, however, refused to abide by the administration’s demands. As a result, Trump froze a little over $2 billion in federal funds going to the school last week and announced plans to freeze an additional $1 billion earlier this week—all while threatening to withhold all $9 billion the Ivy League school receives from the federal government each year if they refuse to agree to the President’s demands.
The showdown is largely being framed as either a battle to protect academic freedom from an authoritarian president or an overdue effort to rescue one of the nation’s oldest universities from the radical far-left administrators leading it off course.
But as politicians, pundits, and university officials battle over which characterization is accurate and, therefore, what ought to happen next, few are paying any attention to one of the more outrageous details that this dispute has brought attention to: that taxpayers are being forced to send $9 billion a year to one of the wealthiest colleges in the world.
The $9 billion figure comes from several federal programs—including education initiatives, student aid, research grants, student loan guarantees, and funding for the university’s affiliated hospitals. Much of this funding is composed of multi-year grants and contracts, but the annual figure does, indeed, tend to land around $9 billion.
And that’s just Harvard. Zoom out, and you’ll find that those same federal programs are forcing the over-taxed, heavily-indebted, inflation-rattled American public to send well over $100 billion to colleges and universities every single year.
Conservatives and free-market advocates are right to point out whenever the topic of student debt forgiveness is brought up that such a program is, in effect, a wealth transfer from poorer, working-class Americans without college degrees to their better-off, frequently white-collar, college-educated counterparts. But the same is true for all programs that transfer tax dollars to colleges and universities.
Beyond being blatantly unjust, the federal money pouring into higher education is the main factor behind the exploding cost of college in recent decades. In the name of making college more affordable, the federal government effectively took over the student loan market in the US and—primarily by extending government loan guarantees—expanded the level of lending far beyond what private lenders were willing to provide.
That created significantly more demand for college, which jacked up the price. Then, the artificially high prices forced even more students to turn to loans to afford school, which required more government loan guarantees, which made prices even higher, meaning more loans were needed, and on and on. All the while, the government has started and expanded direct federal spending programs on education that have only fueled the affordability death spiral.
This has been terrible for every non-wealthy student or family straining to pay for a college degree, and all the people who could not afford to go to college at all who are still forced to fund all the government subsidies causing this mess. But, it’s important to understand, this setup has been great for the universities who have gotten to enjoy filling their campuses with cartoonishly lavish buildings and resort-level accommodations, while bloating their administrations with diversity officers, sustainability directors, and other ideological positions.
It has also been great for the politicians and government bureaucrats who have gained leverage over the schools educating the next generation and the scholars and intellectuals currently researching topics relevant to those running our federal government.
In other words, federal higher education policy is best understood as one big government-run scam that’s enriching and empowering a small group of ideological administrators and bureaucrats at our expense. It is, in that way, no different from the healthcare system—through which schools like Harvard are also receiving money through their hospitals.
That is the big unspoken truth at the core of this debate about what the Trump administration is doing with Harvard. A president like Trump can exert control over the internal policies of these universities because of how unnecessarily reliant they are on government money. And widespread pushing of highly unpopular progressive dogmas in classrooms and professional scholarship can only happen at this large a scale because of how—and how much—higher ed and academia are subsidized in modern America.
There is only one genuine and permanent solution to these problems. Halt all federal funding—direct and indirect—for these “private” colleges and universities.
As long as these schools rely on politicians to fund their operations, they will always be politicized. There is no escaping that. And, on the other side, even if Trump is totally victorious and gets Harvard to capitulate on everything, there is functionally nothing stopping the next Democrat to win the presidency from reversing everything Trump did."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-enters-final-stages-of-ukraine-peace-plan-zelensky-resists-concessions,"Trump Enters Final Stages of Ukraine Peace Plan, Zelensky Resists Concessions",By Sean Miller,13 days ago,"On Tuesday it was reported that the United States is mulling recognizing the Crimean region, a coastal area along the Black Sea, as Russian territory. The consideration comes as peace negotiations between Moscow and Kiev, brokered by Washington, are moving into their final stages. Ukrainian Dictator Vladimir Zelensky however quickly came out to say he would reject allowing Russia to keep Crimea. Trump indicated that he will soon give up brokering peace between the warring Slavic nations if his efforts do not result in a deal.
This proposal is expected to be discussed in London later this week with officials of various Western nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg are reported to be in attendance, set to meet with foreign ministers and security advisers from France, Germany, the U.K. and Ukraine. Witkoff is also expected to visit Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as well. It is however unclear if the Moscow trip will take place before or after the London meeting.
Despite Crimea officially joining Russia via a 2014 referendum vote, Zelensky says he will never accept it. The Dictator said the war will go on until he can have everything he wants.
“[Crimea] is our territory, the territory of the people of Ukraine. We have nothing to talk about on this topic, it is outside our constitution,” Zelensky said.
That wasn’t all however, the Dictator even placed the blame on Russia for his own lack of ability to compromise by saying that this is what they want.
“As soon as we start talking about Crimea, about our sovereign territories, we enter the format of prolonging the war,” he said.
President Donald Trump said he will be giving details of his peace plan this week.
“I will be giving you a full detail over the next three days,” Trump said. “But we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia … We’ll see how that works.”
The New York Post claimed that “one senior administration official told The Post they may include deploying European forces to Ukraine should an end to the war and cease-fire be reached,” yet the outlet didn’t specificity who that official was.
One dire detail however is that Trump said he will walk way from the peace negations if no progress is made soon.
“Donald Trump has said the U.S. will ‘take a pass’ on brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if Moscow or Kyiv ‘make it very difficult’ to reach a peace deal,” the BBC said Friday. “The U.S. president told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he was not expecting a truce to happen in ‘a specific number of days’ but he wanted it done ‘quickly’. His comments came hours after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the U.S. would abandon talks unless there were clear signs of progress within days.”
“We’re not going to continue with this endeavor for weeks and months on end,” Rubio said, stating that Washington has “other priorities to focus on”.
Trump’s frustration of Zelensky’s lack of acceptance to peace was on full display in late February when the Dictator went to Washington D.C. and disrespected America in the White House.
The President denied the Dictator’s request to return to the White House, adding his Ukrainian counterpart must first “want peace” before negotiations continue.
“He’s got to say ‘I want to make peace,’” said Trump. “[Zelensky] doesn’t have to stand there and say ‘Putin this and Putin that,’ all negative things.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/massachusetts-proposes-laws-to-remove-religious-exemptions-parental-consent-for-vaccines,"Massachusetts Proposes Laws to Remove Religious Exemptions, Parental Consent for Vaccines","By Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. | The Defender",13 days ago,"Massachusetts lawmakers are considering a bill to remove religious exemptions to school vaccine mandates and two bills that would allow minors to consent to “preventative care,” including vaccines, according to grassroots groups Health Rights MA and Health Action Massachusetts.
Versions of the bill seeking to remove religious exemptions were introduced in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate.
Beth Ingham, a leader of Children’s Health Defense’s (CHD) New England Chapter since 2022, called the proposed legislation “horrendous.”
If passed, children whose families object to school-mandated vaccinations based on sincerely held religious beliefs would be barred from attending public and private K-12 schools, according to Health Action Massachusetts.
Massachusetts’ lawmakers are also considering An Act Promoting Community Immunity, a bill that would undermine religious exemptions for school-based vaccine mandates and remove parental consent for vaccines in some cases.
According to Health Rights MA, the community immunity bill would:
Candice Edwards, executive director of Health Action Massachusetts, told The Defender that the state’s Joint Committee on Public Health will soon announce a hearing date for the two bills.
“Once the hearing is scheduled, we’re asking people to show up in person” to testify about why they oppose the bills. “Given the climate specifically for the removal of the religious exemption, we need an army inside that State House testifying.”
Additionally, Massachusetts’ lawmakers are considering a third bill that ostensibly aims at “enhancing access” to abortion but would also allow minors to consent to “preventative care,” including vaccines, without parental knowledge or consent, the groups said on their websites. Versions of the bill have been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
According to Health Action Massachusetts:
“An Act Enhancing Access to Abortion goes beyond abortion-related care by granting minors the ability to consent to all forms of preventative care, including vaccinations and sterilization, without parental consent or knowledge. It does not include any age delineations or mental capacity guidelines for minors making these decisions.”
This third bill is overseen by the Joint Committee on the Judiciary, rather than the Joint Committee on Public Health. Edwards said her organization will alert people as soon as there is any movement with the bill or a hearing scheduled for it.
Commenting on the ongoing fight to maintain the right to religious exemptions and parental consent in Massachusetts, Edwards said, “We’ve been fighting this since 2019, and it’s now become our lives to fight this and be on top of it.”
Not the first time Massachusetts lawmakers tried to remove religious exemptions
According to Ingham, the latest Massachusetts bills aren’t the first time the state’s lawmakers have tried to remove religious exemptions. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, lawmakers considered a bill that would have removed religious exemptions.
However, the bill never made it to a full vote due to “massive opposition.”
“It just kind of fizzled in committee” after hundreds of people voiced opposition to it during an online hearing, Ingham said.
She recalled:
“They invited people to come online … for three minutes each, and there were 400 or 500 people online and they let all of them testify. It was amazing. It went on for hours and hours and hours.”
The majority of those who testified spoke against the bill, she added.
Ingham said that Health Rights MA and Health Action Massachusetts have “really been involved with this from the get-go,” referring to the three new bills, by providing the public with information about what the bills would do and issuing action alerts.
West Virginia: ‘We’re still moving forward’
If religious exemptions are taken away in Massachusetts, the state would join a small handful of states that deny parents the right to object to school vaccine requirements on the basis of sincerely held beliefs.
California, New York, Connecticut and Maine allow only medical exemptions, not religious exemptions. However, Maine lawmakers are considering bills that would restore religious exemptions.
West Virginia denied religious exemptions until Jan. 14, when Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed an executive order allowing religious exemptions.
On March 24, West Virginia lawmakers defeated a bill that would have codified Morrisey’s Jan. 14 executive order allowing religious exemptions from mandatory school vaccinations.
The bill died in a 42-56 vote on the floor of West Virginia’s House of Delegates after passing the state’s Senate in a 20-12 vote in February.
Despite the bill’s failure to pass during this year’s legislative session, West Virginia parents can still apply for a religious exemption under Morrisey’s executive order, said Chanda Adkins, president of West Virginians for Health Freedom.
The group said it will continue to pressure elected officials during next year’s legislative session to get religious exemptions officially codified into law. “We’re still moving forward,” Adkins told The Defender.
Adkins credited West Virginia’s progress so far to the many parents and guardians — “even the grandparents” — who spoke to their elected officials about how important it is to them to have religious exemptions to vaccine mandates.
West Virginians for Health Freedom has been around since 2016. “We do not plan to abort the mission until there are no mandates,” Adkins said.
Hawaii: ‘The push to erase religious exemptions is still alive and well’
Meanwhile, the battle to keep religious exemptions continues to brew after Hawaii lawmakers, under pressure from constituents, voted on March 4 to table a bill that would have repealed the state’s religious exemption from vaccine mandates.
Rep. Diamond Garcia, House minority floor leader, who opposed the bill, told The Defender, “HB1118 may be dead for now, but make no mistake — the push to erase religious exemptions is still alive and well.”
House Bill 1118 was part of the “governor’s package,” a set of proposed bills that make up Gov. Josh Green’s legislative agenda.The bill, introduced in January in the House and Senate, aimed to curb the growing rates of non-medical exemptions in the state over the last 10 years.
However, the proposed legislation encountered stiff pushback from the public and grassroots organizations in Hawaii, who responded with letters, public statements and rallies opposing the bill.
Constituents submitted more than 2,000 written statements to state lawmakers opposing the bill and just over 100 supporting it.
Garcia called the bill a “direct assault on people of faith.”
“We’re not backing down,” he said. “I will fight any attempt to force families to choose between their convictions and compliance. The government has no business interfering in matters of conscience. We didn’t win the war — we won a battle. And we’ll be ready for the next one, because freedom is always worth defending.”"

It’s called, we do a little juxtaposition.
“Juxtaposition”, noun: The act of placing two or more things side by side, often to compare or contrast them. Or, indeed, to suggest they might be connected with each other causally somehow.
When Cornelius Tacitus chose to describe Nero playing his harp—not a fiddle—in his gardens while Rome burned, the great historian was obviously implying Nero was more than just an observer of the conflagration.
After all, what kind of ruler plays a musical instrument and sings about the destruction of ancient Troy while his own capital city, the most magnificent in the known world, is burning to ashes around him?
It would be like, oh, I don’t know—being California state governor and setting up a website to prove you weren’t responsible for cutting hundreds of millions of dollars from fire services while half of Los Angeles is in flames. That suggests a certain level of self-concern and, dare I say it, guilt, right?
Gavin Newsom actually did that, by the way.
Anyway: juxtaposition. Two things side by side.
Here are two things that happened this week. I just want to place them next to each other for a moment. The implication, obviously, is that they could be connected. But just try to withhold judgment until you’ve read and digested both of them.
And they may not be connected, like Nero may not have been responsible for the Great Fire of Rome, however bizarre his behavior was during it. My two events could just be a coincidence—one that’s mighty convenient for certain parties, all the same.
Okay, so here’s the first. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is in big trouble for his use of the encrypted messaging app Signal. Again.
Over the weekend another story broke, in The New York Times, that Hegseth “shared detailed information about forthcoming strikes in Yemen in a private Signal group chat group that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.”
Unnamed sources told The Times Hegseth created the group in January, before he was confirmed.
In response to the allegations, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman Sean Parnell said “disgruntled former employees” were responsible for the claims.
On X, he said the reports “relied only on the words of people who were fired this week and appear to have a motive to sabotage” President Trump’s wide-ranging agenda at the Pentagon.
“There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story,” Parnell added.
“What is true is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is continuing to become stronger and more efficient in executing President Trump’s agenda.”
The revelations came at the end of a difficult week for the embattled Defense Secretary, as three top officials at the Pentagon were forced out of their jobs. Dan Caldwell, Colin Carroll and Darin Selnick were all fired after being linked by an internal investigation to “unauthorized disclosures” of sensitive information. The three men have protested their innocence.
Former Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot also chose the weekend to launch a blistering personal attack in Politico. The man who just a few months ago described the Defense Secretary as “the best choice to reform the Pentagon,” is now hitting him with both barrels for presiding over a “full-blown meltdown” at the world’s most famous five-sided building. Hegseth’s tenure is becoming a “real problem for the administration,” Ullyot said—the implication being, of course, that he needs to resign.
So that’s the first thing: fresh trouble for Pete at the Pentagon. Now here’s the second.
Earlier last week, on Monday, President Trump decided against joint US-Israel military strikes to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities.
After a tense meeting in the Situation Room, the anti-war party, which argued that a diplomatic solution is not only preferable but still possible, won out. Among the stalwarts of this position were Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, special envoy Steve Witkoff and— Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
President Trump reaffirmed his sensible conviction that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.
“President Trump has been clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and all options remain on the table. The President has authorized direct and indirect discussions with Iran to make this point clear, but he’s also made clear this cannot go on indefinitely,” White House national security council spokesperson Brian Hughes told Axios.
So: Military strikes could still happen, but for the moment, at least, diplomacy has prevailed. The President has given Iran two months to sign a new nuclear deal. Israel, however, has suggested it may carry out strikes unilaterally.
I think you know what I’m driving at with this juxtaposition. You already know that war with Iran, leading to regime-change, has been a long-term policy goal of certain bloodthirsty segments of the US establishment for decades. It was the jewel in the crown of the Bush neocon vision for the future of the Middle East, and it remains the treasured dream of lawmakers like Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton, as well as an entire industry of lobbying groups like the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. And Israel, too.
Let’s be clear: If Hegseth goes—and there are now a great many loud voices calling for his resignation, Two strikes and you’re out— a significant barrier to joint military action against Iran will have been removed.
Indeed, there’s a good chance Hegseth will be replaced by an Iran hawk who’ll actively push for conflict. Back in December, when Hegseth’s personal life was looking like it might derail his confirmation, Mike Waltz was considered as an alternative. Last week, in the Situation Room, it was Waltz arguing for military strikes alongside Marco Rubio.
Like I say, these two events may not actually be connected. Hegseth’s problems at the Pentagon are ongoing, and it may simply be, as Sean Parnell said, that “disgruntled employees” are responsible for the latest claims against the Defense Secretary, true or not. Hegseth has turned the place upside down already in his quest to restore America’s warfighting capability, an enterprise that was bound to make him a lot of enemies even if he didn’t challenge the infinity-war demons as directly as he has.
In truth, it doesn’t really matter if there’s a connection between these two events. All that matters, at this point, is the outcome: Lose Hegseth and war with Iran, with all its terrible potentials, becomes a much greater possibility. That makes supporting him, and ensuring he stays in the job, all the more urgent for patriots who care about a true America First foreign policy."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/russia-formalizes-defense-economic-treaty-with-iran,Russia Formalizes Defense/Economic Treaty With Iran,By Sean Miller,14 days ago,"On Monday, Moscow formalized a defense and economic cooperation agreement with Tehran, codifying the alliance between the two nations. The ‘Treaty on the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation‘ includes provisions for the fields of defense, counterterrorism, energy, finance, transport, industry, agriculture, culture, science and technology.
Particularly notable is the fact that the U.S. currently sits opposite of both nations on the global geopolitical stage. Washington has funded Ukraine to attack Russia, had its troops stationed in Ukraine attacking Russia, and threatened Iran with military strikes.
This is not the first instance of Moscow welcoming Tehran with open arms, however. In October Iran attended the 2024 BRICS economic cooperation summit, their first year as a formal member of the bloc.
While this new friendship blossoms in the East, in the West President Donald Trump seeks to carry out two different geopolitical negotiations with the nations.
Regarding Russia, the Trump administration seeks to end the war in Ukraine, an agenda that the President had made significant progress toward since taking office in January.
With Iran, Trump is seeking the signing of a new nuclear deal which would ensure Tehran does not and will not possess nuclear weapons. This coincides with the President’s global denuclearization agenda, an agenda that the Kremlin has endorsed and signaled a willingness to participate in.
While both White House agendas are currently progressing in positive directions according to officials from either side, the Eastern new alliance being formed will undoubtedly be a consideration to those working the grand chessboard, regardless of their allegiances and agendas.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/mayor-proposes-giving-homeless-all-the-fentanyl-they-want-to-purge-them,Mayor Proposes Giving Homeless “All The Fentanyl They Want” to “Purge” Them,By Sean Miller,14 days ago,"Comments made by Rex Parris, mayor of Lancaster, California back in February have gone viral Friday after he doubled down on his recommendation of administering the deadly opioid fentanyl to his homeless population as part of a “purge” instead of just concentrating them in a camp, as the city seeks to do. The Mayor clarified that law enforcement has failed to deal with these people while they’re alive, leading to his recommendation of distributing the often-lethal drug in order to solve the issue once and for all – a final solution to the homeless question.
During the February 25 city council meeting, a resident criticized the city’s plan of concentrating the homeless in a camp on an abandoned golf course, to which Parris interrupted her, stating that he actually wants to give them endless doses of a drug responsible for tens of thousands of deaths.
“No, what I want to do is give them free fentanyl,” he said, to which she asked him to restate himself. “I want to give them all the fentanyl they want.”
On Friday Parris appeared on Fox 11 Los Angeles where he clarified that the purpose of the free fentanyl is to purge the criminal homeless people for the greater good of society.
“They [the homeless] are responsible for most of our robberies, most of our rapes and at least half of our murders,” he said Friday. “There is nothing that we can do for these people.”
There is however one thing the Mayor believes he can do for “the people that want to camp near your home so that they can burglarize them at night, the people that accost you in the store parking lots and intimidate you into giving them money.”
“Quite frankly, I wish the President would give us a purge,” Parris said Friday. “Because we do need to purge these people.”
The Mayor did admit killing off the homeless is “harsh” however he reaffirmed that the de-facto euthanasia program is necessary due to the lackluster work of law enforcement to manage the homeless while they’re still alive.
“I’m open to any solution,” Parris said.
Interestingly Parris has been mayor since 2008. In March 2009 Alex Jones sent Infowars reporters to Los Angeles to document the skyrocketing homeless population which had dramatically increased since the mortgage-backed derivatives crisis and banker bailout."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/betting-odds-favor-filipino-cardinal-to-replace-pope-francis,Betting Odds Favor Filipino Cardinal To Replace Pope Francis,By Raw Egg Nationalist,14 days ago,"Betting sites have already opened odds on who will be the next pope, with Cardinal Luis Antonion Tagle as the clear early favorite.
Tagle, who hails from the Philippines, is generally seen as a progressive, after expressing his support LGBTQ rights and claiming that universal moral principles may “not apply in all situations.”
He has, however, been the subject of a certain amount of scandal as a result of alleged “shortcomings” during his time heading the Vatican charity Caritas International.
Current bookmakers’ odds give Tagle a 50% chance of winning the nomination.
Other frontrunners include Pietro Parolin, who currently serves as the Vatican’s Secretary of State and has advocated greater engagement with the Communist regime in China; French Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, who is said to have been Pope Francis’s favoured successor and is generally seen as a leftist; and Cardinal Willem Jacobus Eijk, a Dutch cardinal who holds conservative positions against blessings for same-sex couples, transgenderism and the ordination of female clergy.
Pope Francis’s death was announced early on Monday morning by the Vatican.
“At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church,” said Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, the Vatican camerlengo, in the announcement.
The Pope, who suffered ill health for much of his adult life, spent five weeks in hospital from February into March, as he was treated for double pneumonia.
Latin America’s first pontiff and the first Jesuit to hold the office, the Argentinian Pope Francis was elected in 2013 with a mandate to clean house at the Vatican after a damaging series of scandals.
Pope Francis proved to be a progressive leader, pushing the Catholic Church to the left on a variety of issues, including LGBTQ issues, migration and climate change.
In recent weeks, he spoke out against the new Trump administration’s policies, especially the policy of mass deportations. He urged Catholics “not to give in to narratives that discriminate” against migrants and refugees.
As well as addressing the faithful on Sunday, Pope Francis met Vice President JD Vance, who is himself a Catholic.
The College of Cardinals will now elect a new pope, probably within the next three to four weeks."

“What is true is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is continuing to become stronger and more efficient in executing President Trump’s agenda.”
The fresh claims about the Defense Secretary’s use of the Signal app come at the end of a tumultuous week at the Pentagon.
Three tops officials—Dan Caldwell, Colin Carroll and Darin Selnick—were all fired after being placed on administrative leave as part of an internal investigation into “unauthorized disclosures” of sensitive information.
“At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks’ to begin with,” the three men said in a joint statement that Caldwell posted on X.
Hegseth’s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, also left his job, for another role at the Defense Department.
Hegseth was also on the receiving end of sharp criticism from John Ullyot, a former Pentagon spokesman who left his job last week.
In an opinion piece published on Sunday by Politico, Ullyot said  “the last month has been a full-blown meltdown at the Pentagon—and it’s becoming a real problem for the administration.”
Ullyot also accused Hegseth’s staff of “spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.”
Previously, Ullyot called Hegseth “the best choice to reform the Pentagon.”
Last week it was reported that Hegseth was one of the main players, along with Vice President Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who convinced President Trump against US-Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities."

The Keep Kids First Act forbids the state from “requir(ing) any private child placement agency to perform, assist, counsel, recommend, consent to, refer, or participate in any placement of a child for foster care or adoption when the proposed placement would violate the private child placement agency’s sincerely held religious or moral beliefs”; or from “establish(ing) or enforc(ing) any per se standard, rule, or policy that precludes consideration of a current or prospective foster or preadoptive parent for any particular placement based in whole or in part on the person’s sincerely held religious beliefs regarding sexual orientation or gender identity.”
It also says the state “shall not take any discriminatory action against a person whom the state government places custody of a foster or preadoptive child with, whether in whole or in part” on the basis of that person’s “(s)incerely held religious belief, or intent to guide, instruct, or raise a child, based upon or in a manner that is consistent with that person’s sincerely held religious belief”; or his or her “(r)efusal to accept or support any government policy regarding sexual orientation or gender identity that conflicts with the person’s sincerely held religious beliefs.”
“Every child deserves a loving home that can provide them stability and opportunities to grow. Yet other states have put politics over people by excluding caring families and faith-based adoption and foster care organizations from helping children find loving homes,” Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Greg Chafuen responded. “Thankfully, Arkansas has taken the critical step to pass HB 1669, the Keep Kids First Act, which prioritizes the well-being of kids by prohibiting state and local government officials from discriminating against adoption and foster care providers and parents simply because of their religious beliefs and moral convictions.
“ADF commends Rep. Mary Bentley and Sen. Alan Clark for their leadership and steadfastness, and Gov. Sanders for signing it into law to ensure more families can open their hearts and homes to children in need of a safe and loving environment. We also thank the Arkansas Family Council for its monumental work on this important effort. Now and always, children deserve loving families.”
A substantial amount of social science literature supports the truth that children are best served by homes with both a mother and a father, as each sex tends to bring unique strengths and emphases to parenting, which complement one another; and gives children a positive role model of their own sex as well as helping them to understand and relate to the opposite sex. By contrast, a homosexual male “couple” would by definition lack a mother, and a lesbian “couple” would be unable to provide a father.
Yet conservatives and pro-family advocates say that Democrats’ devotion to all aspects of LGBT ideology has come at the cost of a wide array of harms, not only to the physical and mental health of confused individuals but also to the rights, health, and safety of those who disagree, such as parents denied a say in their children’s upbringing or even knowledge of their trauma, girls and women forced to share intimate facilities with males, female athletes forced to compete against biological males with natural physical advantages, and individuals forced to affirm false sexual identities in violation of their consciences, their understanding of scientific fact, and/or their religious beliefs lest they risk firing and/or social ostracization."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/china-warns-countries-not-to-strike-deals-with-us-at-its-expense,China Warns Countries Not To Strike Deals with US at Its Expense,By Raw Egg Nationalist,14 days ago,"China has warned other nations not to strike deals with the US that come at its expense, as President Trump’s trade war with its main competitor continues to escalate.
China’s Commerce Ministry said that while China will respect other countries’ right to negotiate with the US on an equal footing in response to President Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, it will oppose countries that try to benefit at China’s cost.
Beijing “will take countermeasures in a resolute and reciprocal manner” against such countries, a spokesperson said.
“The United States has abused tariffs on all trading partners under the banner of so-called ‘equivalence,’ while also forcing all parties to start so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’ negotiations with them,” the spokesperson added.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration readies itself to put pressure on foreign nations looking to reduce US tariffs or even seek exemptions from them, by asking them to reduce their reliance on China.
Dozens of countries—perhaps as many as 70—are said to have approached US representatives to seek new trade deals.
Bilateral talks on tariffs have already taken place with Japan and Indonesia.
After announcing a swathe of “reciprocal” tariffs on 2 April, President Trump paused them, except for the tariffs on China, which he increased to 145%.
China has raised tariffs on US goods and also squeezed the supply of rare-earth metals and rare-earth magnets, whose production it monopolises, in a move that will affect the production of vital high-tech goods across the world, including cars and military equipment.
“There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,” China’s President Xi Jinping said in an article published in Vietnamese media recently."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/merz-ally-sparks-establishment-panic-after-talking-sense-on-afd,Merz Ally Sparks Establishment Panic After Talking Sense on AfD,By Michael Curzon | The European Conservative,14 days ago,"Efforts to exclude the right-populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) from the German political system—despite it coming second in the recent federal elections and leading national polls for the first time earlier this month—are reportedly crumbling. But establishment figures are scrambling to ensure that this so-called ‘firewall’ remains in place.
Jens Spahn, an ally of incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz and fellow member of his centre-right CDU, last week told Bild that politicians must “simply acknowledge … how many millions of Germans voted for the AfD,” in part because they “wanted to tell us [establishment types] something.” He also “recommend[ed] that
We treat the AfD as an opposition party in the same way in terms of procedures and processes as we would any other opposition party.
Hardly the most extreme of proposals, though the response would suggest otherwise.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, who has previously expressed a desire to sack federal police officers who “actively support” the AfD, accused Spahn of being “irresponsible and oblivious to history” because
The AfD is not an opposition party like any other. Anyone who wants to treat it that way and thereby further normalise it is making a serious mistake.
The left-wing SPD’s Matthias Miersch also bashed Spahn as “fundamentally wrong and very, very dangerous,” while the party’s parliamentary manager, Katja Mast, also insisted she would “continue to protect our democratic institutions” by blocking the widely democratically-backed AfD.
Clearly unnerved by this backlash, Spahn later stressed that he “didn’t use the word ‘normalisation’” when discussing the AfD, adding: “Nobody really needs to tell me what kind of people are sitting in their ranks. I know that.”
For its part, the AfD declared on Thursday it is still willing to cooperate with the CDU, praising “more and more leading Christian Democrats” who are “calling for what should actually be a matter of course in a democracy: to finally treat the AfD like any other opposition party.” Party officials added that
The exclusion of the AfD harms democracy—it does not strengthen it.
+++ CDU-Diskussion um Ausgrenzung der AfD: Wer an der Brandmauer festhält, wird bedeutungslos! +++Es ist ein längst überfälliger Tabubruch – und er kommt ausgerechnet aus der CDU. Immer mehr führende Christdemokraten fordern jetzt, was in einer Demokratie eigentlich… pic.twitter.com/9bM5BFeTZF"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/klaus-schwab-resigns-from-wef-with-immediate-effect,Klaus Schwab Resigns from WEF with Immediate Effect,By Raw Egg Nationalist,14 days ago,"Klaus Schwab, chairman of the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum, has resigned with immediate effect.
At a meeting of the Forum’s Board of Trustees on Sunday, Schwab, who founded the Forum in 1971, announced his resignation.
The Board appointed Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, a former CEO of Nestlé Group, as its interim chairman.
Schwab had already announced his intention to step down, at the beginning of the month, but it was understood that the process of doing so would stretch on into 2027.
At this stage, it’s unclear what has prompted the sudden change from Schwab. Age may be a factor—Schwab noted in his resignation announcement that he was now 88 years old—but the decision may also have something to do with recent controversies about harassment and discrimination at the Forum.
Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported the Forum’s board was working with a law firm to investigate its workplace culture, after allegations of a “culture of harassment” and discrimination at the organization.
In March, the Forum said external lawyers who investigated the claims found it had not committed any legal violations and allegations of misconduct against Schwab himself were not true.
In a statement posted to the World Economic Forum website today, the Forum noted the need for it to “shape the future” has “never been more critical.”
“At a time when the world is undergoing rapid transformation, the need for inclusive dialogue to navigate complexity and shape the future has never been more critical,” the statement says.
“The Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum underlines the importance of remaining steadfast in its mission and values as a facilitator of progress. Building on its trusted role, the Forum will continue to bring together leaders from all sectors and regions to exchange insights and foster collaboration.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/it-dwarfs-covid-rfk-jr-says-autism-is-an-epidemic,“It Dwarfs COVID”: RFK Jr Says Autism Is an “Epidemic”,By Raw Egg Nationalist,14 days ago,"Autism is an “epidemic” that “dwarfs COVID,” Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy has said.
In an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis, RFK Jr. said autism is a “debilitating” condition that should be taken more seriously than COVID because of its effects on the young.
“This is an epidemic. It dwarfs the COVID epidemic and the impacts on our country because COVID killed old people. Autism affects children and affects them at the beginning of their lives, the beginning of their productivity.”
“And it’s absolutely debilitating for them, their families, their communities,” he added.
RFK Jr. went on to talk about the massive economic cost of autism, in addition to its emotional toll.
“For our country, just the pure economic cost of autism is, will be by 2035, $1 trillion a year. That’s just the beginning because many of these kids are aging out and their parents worry every day. And I’m talking about people with severe autism, what’s called profound autism, which is about, which is about 26 percent of the total people who are diagnosed with autism,” he said.
“Those families, those children are nonverbal, they’re non-toilet trained. They have all the stereotypical features of autism, head-banging, toe-walking, stimming, agonizing gut pain and head-banging. Those kids are kids that will not hold jobs. And many kids with autism, many of the higher functioning autism actually can, have tremendous potential to live independently, to get jobs, take care of themselves,” he continued.
Secretary Kennedy also spoke about new research he has commissioned to identify the real causes of autism. He said he believes the focus on genetic causes is misguided, and that environmental factors need to be addressed.
“The problem is that NIH and CDC have blocked all the studies that would determine the environmental exposure. So we don’t know. And instead they’ve studied genes and genes contribute to autism, but they, you know, like I said, you need an environmental toxin. And that’s what we’re, that’s what we are now going to look for,” Kennedy said.
“And we’re going to identify it and using AI [artificial intelligence] and the best scientific protocols, all of it, very transparent. We’re deploying 15 teams to look at all the potential exposures and that could be mold. It could be food additives. It could be pesticides. It could be vaccines. It could be ultrasound.”
Earlier last week, RFK Jr. was on the receiving end of sharp criticism for comments he made at a press conference, when he said “autism destroys families.”
Among those winging blows at Secretary Kennedy was Gwen Walz, wife of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.
​​“This is deeply upsetting, especially coming from our nation’s highest-ranking health official,” Gwen Walz said in a post Thursday on X.
“Individuals with autism are family, neighbors, students, and coworkers and they contribute more to this nation than this man ever will.”
Others said that his comments were “disrespectful” and that his aim of identifying environmental causes of the condition was “unrealistic and misleading.”"

The Supreme Court made its ruling on Saturday in response to an emergency motion by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing 50 Venezuelan men about to be deported from a facility in Anson, Texas. The ACLU filed its emergency motion in three courts: the Northern District of Texas, which rejected the motion; the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans; and the Supreme Court.
Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the Supreme Court must allow the case to go through the lower courts before issuing a ruling of its own. He said the Supreme Court has “improperly skipped over the lower courts.” He also criticized the ACLU, because they “rushed to an appears court and the Supreme Court without giving lower courts time to consider the case.”
Sauer rejected the ACLU’s claim that the deportees had not been given “adequate” warning of their deportation.
The ACLU has been a staunch supporter of illegal immigrants, pushing cases to ensure their right to enter and remain in the US. The ACLU backed President Biden’s termination of the Remain in Mexico policy, which they called “cruel, depraved and illegal.” The Trump-era policy mandated that asylum seekers remain in Mexico while their cases were processed.
The Remain in Mexico policy has since been reimplemented by President Trump, along with a rash of other anti-immigration measures."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/breaking-pope-francis-dead,BREAKING: Pope Francis Dead,By Raw Egg Nationalist,14 days ago,"Pope Francis has died aged 88, just a day after he made a frail public appearance for Easter Sunday.
“At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church,” said Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, the Vatican camerlengo, in the announcement.
The Pope, who suffered ill health for much of his adult life, spent five weeks in hospital from February into March, as he was treated for double pneumonia.
Latin America’s first pontiff and the first Jesuit to hold the office, the Argentinian Pope Francis was elected in 2013 with a mandate to clean house at the Vatican after a damaging series of scandals.
Pope Francis proved to be a progressive leader, pushing the Catholic Church to the left on a variety of issues, including LGBTQ issues, migration and climate change.
In recent weeks, he spoke out against the new Trump administration’s policies, especially the policy of mass deportations. He urged Catholics “not to give in to narratives that discriminate” against migrants and refugees.
As well as addressing the faithful on Sunday, Pope Francis met Vice President JD Vance, who is himself a Catholic.
The College of Cardinals will now elect a new pope, probably within the next three to four weeks."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/miller-calls-for-reparations-for-damage-caused-by-mass-migration,Miller Calls for Reparations for Damage Caused by Mass Migration,By Raw Egg Nationalist,15 days ago,"Americans deserve reparations for the damage caused by mass migration, presidential adviser Stephen Miller told Newsmax TV on Saturday.
“We all deserve reparations for what has been stolen from us,” Miller said.
“It is a tragedy that defies our ability to even describe it.”
Miller was responding to claims from Democrat Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse that America should pay reparations to “Maryland Man” Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to his native El Salvador under the powers of the Alien Enemies Act and is now at the center of an international incident. Garcia is credibly believed to be a member of the notorious criminal gang MS-13, which President Trump recently classified as a terrorist organization, and was suspected of being involved in human-trafficking in the US before his deportation.
“Where do I even begin? Where do I even start?” Miller responded.
“We used to have a functioning public school system in this country. Then we had open borders. Now our schools are in chaos and disarray. We need hundreds of translators. Nobody’s learning how to read or write. We had an entire generation of Americans—multiple generations, in fact—robbed of educational opportunities.”
Miller went on to describe the damage done to Los Angeles—“once a paradise of safety, security, and prosperity”—by foreign gangs; the victims of fentanyl poisoning, including the “hundreds of thousands of moms and dads whose kids are dead and buried in the ground”; and “all the women who have been raped, who been beaten, who have been murdered, all the dads who have been shot dead and aren’t home, all the police officers who have been slain by illegal aliens in ambush attacks in the line of duty.”
What about reparations for these people?
“There aren’t enough volumes that could fit into a library to calculate the carnage that has been inflicted by the Democrat party’s policy of open borders. We can spend the rest of our lives trying to document those harms,” Miller added.
Where do Americans go to get repaid for the damages inflicted by mass migration? pic.twitter.com/lG0PUgTtJU
Miller’s fiery intervention came as President Trump waded into the debate about the future of Garcia with a decisive piece of evidence about his gang affiliation.
On Friday, the President tweeted out a picture of Garcia’s left hand, on which can clearly be seen a marijuana leaf, followed by a smiley face, a cross and a skull, with the cross and skull disguising the numbers 1 and 3. These symbols are meant to denote MS-13, the violent criminal gang which President Trump recently declared a terrorist organization.
“This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‘a fine and innocent person.’ They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
President Trump shared the image in response to attempts by Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, to doctor images of her husband to hide the gang tattoo.
Democrat lawmakers and opponents of President Trump have claimed that Garcia was wrongly deported to El Salvador, where he was confined in President Bukele’s Center for Terrorist Confinement (CECOT) as part of a $6 million deal with the US to house foreign gang members deported from the US using the Alien Enemies Act.
Lawmakers, including Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), travelled to El Salvador this week to call for Garcia’s return. Sen. Van Hollen met with Garcia for a photo opportunity, after he was released from CECOT."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-to-reclassify-thousands-of-federal-workers-making-them-easier-to-fire-as-cuts-continue,"Trump To Reclassify Thousands of Federal Workers, Making Them Easier To Fire as Cuts Continue",By Raw Egg Nationalist,15 days ago,"Thousands of federal workers will have their jobs reclassified, paving the way for more mass layoffs.
According to President Trump, career government employees will be classified as “schedule policy/career” employees.
The reclassification, which puts into effect an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office, will effectively make thousands of federal workers “employees at will.”
Experts who spoke to Reuters said the move could put “hundreds of thousands” of federal jobs at risk.
Towards the end of his first term, President Trump reclassified large swathes of government workers as a prelude to mass layoffs of around 50,000 employees. Schedule F, as it was known, was rescinded by President Biden on his inauguration day.
Tens of thousands of federal workers have already taken voluntary buyouts as part of a broad move by the Trump administration to reduce bloat and inefficiency in the federal government.
A key player in the dramatic cuts to government spending is the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by billionaire Elon Musk.
According to the latest figures on its website, DOGE has now saved taxpayers $150 billion.
DOGE updated its website last week to reflect the most accurate figures available, posting an extra $10 billion in savings from the previous update.
The Department’s savings of $150 billion equate to $931.68 per taxpayer in the US.
According to the website, the savings are a “combination of asset sales, contract/lease cancellations and renegotiations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions.”
The latest batch of receipts posted on the website shows over 7,000 terminated contracts, including individual contracts amounting to billions of dollars. One cancelled contract, for refugee resettlement, amounted to $2,902,177,562.
Of all the departments of the US government, Health and Human Services has so far generated the greatest cost-savings, followed by the Department of Education and the General Services Administration.
The Department of Commerce, Department of Justice and Department of Veterans Affairs are among the departments generating the least savings.
DOGE also recently discovered that children and people who are clearly dead have been claiming hundreds of millions in unemployment benefit.
A survey of unemployment claims revealed that nearly 25,000 people aged over 115 claimed a total of $59 million in benefits, and 28,000 people aged between 1 and 5 claimed $254 million in benefits."

Strips Members’ Work Visas,By Allan Wall | Mexico News Report,15 days ago,"Mexico is a musically-oriented country and recently became the 10th-largest music market in the world.
There are various genres of Mexican music, plus Mexico is a big market for music from other Spanish-speaking countries and from English-speaking countries.
Like other areas of Mexican society, the music business is not untouched by the drug cartels. Some Mexican performers are linked to specific drug cartels and there is a form of song called a narcocorrido. A corrido is a type of traditional music telling a story. Thus a narcocorrido tells a story about the narco world.
A Mexican singer renowned for portraying and romanticizing organized crime declined to perform “narco-corridos.”The audience responded with hostility, vandalizing the equipment of the bands.This incident serves as a stark indication of the profound influence of narco-culture… https://t.co/2Xf20oOWBj
On March 29, the group called Los Alegres del Barranco held a concert in which the face of Nemesio Ruben “El Mencho” Oseguera, leader of the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación, was projected on the screen, and applauded by the audience. This had repercussions north of the border.
As reported by the Mexico Daily Post, “U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, said late Tuesday [April 1] on X that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked… ‘I’m a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn’t mean that expression should be free of consequences,’ Landau wrote on X. ‘The last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists.’”
Revocation of visas is a real punishment – these groups have large audiences in the United States. In fact, Los Alegres del Barranco had a U.S. concert tour scheduled to begin in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4th. So that was cancelled.
According to Billboard, “The band apologized on April 2, saying that it ‘was never our intention to create controversy, much less cause offense.’”
On April 9th, several municipalities in the central state of Mexico banned performances of songs glorifying violence.
On April 11th, singer Luis R. Conriquez had a concert in Texcoco, State of Mexico. This singer is known for narco-related music, in fact his (U.S.-based) record label is called “Kartel Music.”
At this concert though, the singer announced he wasn’t going to sing any narcocorridos.
But the fans weren’t having it. They booed, shouted, threw drinks and attacked the stage, destroying the band’s equipment.
This illustrates one of the many problems posed by the cartels – their popular support among some sectors of Mexican society.
As described by the Blog del Narco (my translation), “A night that promised to be a musical celebration…culminated in an unexpected and violent episode. The attendees of the concert of the famous Mexican singer Luis R. Conriquez reacted with fury and destroyed the stage setup after the artist announced his decision not to sing narcocorridos during his show. A sector of the public…demanded that he sing the narcocorridoes, the singer refused and they began to destroy everything. The frustration of the public was exhibited in such a blatant manner that it was recorded in multiple videos shared on social media by the attendees themselves.”
In the words of Auden Cabello “A Mexican singer renowned for portraying and romanticizing organized crime declined to perform ‘narco-corridos.’ The audience responded with hostility, vandalizing the equipment of the bands. This incident serves as a stark indication of the profound influence of narco-culture on Mexican society.“
So what’s the solution? Is it to ban certain types of music or performances, or not?
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in her April 16 press conference, said she wasn’t in favor of banning such performances, and that “education and awareness are better approaches.” On the other hand, she said, “Of course, there are extremes that cross into criminal territory, right? Like what happened at an event where a video of a drug trafficker was shown as if it were something positive. Everything has its pros and cons.”
As for the Alegres del Barranco, the group that had the narco baron’s face on their screen and got their visas revoked, that incident won them much publicity.On April 9th, Billboard reported that “Los Alegres Del Barranco’s ‘El Del Palenque’ debuts at No. 1 on Billboard’s LyricFind Global chart dated April 12 following interest in the 2021 song amid the Mexican band’s controversy over a concert during which it showed images of a cartel leader while performing the tune. The LyricFind Global and LyricFind U.S. charts rank the fastest momentum-gaining tracks in lyric-search queries and usages globally and in the U.S., respectively, provided by LyricFind. The Global chart includes queries from all countries, including the U.S.  The company is the world’s leader in licensed lyrics, with data provided by more than 5,000 publishers and utilized by more than 100 services, including Amazon, Pandora, Deezer, Microsoft, SoundHound and iHeartRadio. ‘El Del Palenque’ tops the LyricFind Global survey after interest in the song’s lyrics jumped 232% globally following the concert and ensuing news coverage, according to LyricFind.”"

Fox News provided new details about the so-called “champagne socialists”…
Sanders boarded the luxury Bombardier Challenger private jet at the Meadows Field Airport in Bakersfield, California, on Tuesday afternoon, according to a photo captured by a source on the ground and shared exclusively with Fox News Digital. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, whom the source also spotted boarding the private jet, spoke at their “Fighting Oligarchy” event in Bakersfield just hours earlier.
Flight records reveal the jet landed at Sacramento Mather Airport on Tuesday evening, which is about a 20-minute drive to Folsom, California, where the self-identified Democratic socialists hosted their second rally of the day. After publication Thursday, Fox News Digital obtained new footage of Sanders and AOC exiting the private jet in Sacramento Tuesday evening from California resident Matvei Levchenko.
The jet Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were seen boarding and deplaning made stops in Salt Lake City and Boise prior to landing in Bakersfield, according to flight records. The arrival dates match the duo’s “Fighting Oligarchy” events in Salt Lake City and Nampa, which is about a 25-minute drive from Boise Airport.
Also, let’s not forget: when AOC and Sanders aren’t trying to destroy Elon Musk’s US companies – some of which are critical to national security – the leftists are telling Americans to give up their Cummins-powered Dodge Rams, two-stroke weedwhackers, air conditioning, gas stoves, meat, and more.

In a decision issued on Friday, the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals said the Trump administration had failed to demonstrate “irreparable harm” if the order was not lifted. The court therefore declined to issue a stay for Judge Edward Chen’s ruling the maintained Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans.
The decision means that Secretary Kristi Noem’s revocation of TPS status remains blocked. A full judicial hearing on the matter is schedule for the summer.
The Biden administration extended TPS to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in 2021 and 2023, on the basis of humanitarian and political conditions in the South American country. TPS is generally available for nationals of countries that are experiencing extraordinary conditions, such as war and natural disasters, that are judged to prevent safe return.
Secretary Noem had revoked the status for Venezuelans, arguing that conditions in their home country no longer warranted special protections in the US.
Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans were due to lose TPS protections in September.
Half a million Haitian nationals will lose their TPS status in August, after the Department of Homeland Security rescinded it in a separate decision.
Judge Edward Chen decided that the DHS’s decision to remove TPS status from Venezuelans was “unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.”
Chen said the decision would have grave consequences for Venezuelans in the US and that the government had “failed to identify any real countervailing harm” in continuing their TPS status.
Attorneys representing Secretary Noem and the DHS argued that Noem acted within her powers and that her decision was not subject to judicial review.
“A single judge took charge of federal immigration policy with respect to Venezuela and supplanted the Executive’s authority over sensitive determinations of the national interest of the United States,” they said."

Among Democrats as a whole, Harris and Ocasio-Cortez had the highest favourability ratings by far.
The results suggest, clearly, that despite her disastrous performance in the 2024 election, Kamala Harris still commands significant loyalty from Democrat voters.
So far, Harris has been tight-lipped about her plans for the future. There have been suggestions she might run for governor of California, to replace Gavin Newsom, and in recent weeks she has also floated the idea of founding a think-tank.
Among other notable findings, the poll also showed that Gen Z voters under 21 lean Republican by a whopping 11.7 points.
The poll showed Gen Z voters have increasingly eclectic political views, tending left on some issues and right on others, which may have as much to do with a general lack of trust in institutions as anything else.
The Yale Youth Poll sampled 4,100 self-reported registered voters, of whom 2,025 were aged 19-29."

The new study, published in the journal Immunity, Inflammation and Disease, shows that production of the spike protein by the body’s cells continues for far longer than was originally claimed. The study adds to a growing body of work—well over 100 peer-reviewed studies—that shows the persistence of spike protein within the body.
According to the study authors, this persistence is caused by the long-term presence of mRNA from the vaccine as well as lipid nanoparticles used to deliver mRNA to the body’s cells.
The study also showed a significant increase in weight and body mass index among participants in the study, as well as disturbing increases in inflammatory markers such as the levels of immune cells called cytokines.
Experts who spoke to The Defender said the increase in obesity and inflammation go “hand in hand,” and also called for a larger controlled study to investigate the effects described in the new study.
Dr Brian Hooker outlined the range of negative health effects associated with the long-term presence of the COVID spike protein and called for the mRNA jabs to be removed from the market.
“Increased inflammation leads to so many different conditions associated with the COVID-19 vaccine, including cardiac sequelae and turbo cancers. This definitely contributes to the body of literature supporting a complete withdrawal of all COVID-19 vaccines on the market,” Hooker said.
“As yet another study reveals grave harms linked to the COVID-19 mRNA injections, the case for their immediate removal from the market grows stronger and more urgent,” Hulscher wrote.
A number of US states are now considering bans on the COVID mRNA vaccines."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/thousands-of-illegals-self-deporting,Thousands of Illegals Self-Deporting,By Raw Egg Nationalist,15 days ago,"Thousands of illegals in the US are choosing to self-deport rather than be caught and sent home by force.
A new report from The Los Angeles Times states many illegals, even in welcoming California, are considering “leaving with something rather than leaving with nothing.”
The report profiles an immigrant called Celeste, who travelled to the US from Peru nearly 20 years ago and “overstayed her tourist visa.” She worked and paid taxes, hoping that she would one day gain legal status.
“But years passed without the dramatic reforms needed to reshape and unclog the legal pathways to U.S. citizenship,” the report states.
“And in the months since President Trump started his second term, her American dream has imploded. She’s unnerved by the news images of undocumented immigrants being loaded onto planes, shackled like violent criminals, and returned to their native countries. The thought of being ripped from her home, without time to pack up her belongings or say goodbye to friends, shakes her to the core.”
Celeste has made the decision, therefore, to work and save a little bit more money, before returning to her native Peru.
The report goes on to describe a swell in interest from illegals looking for advice about self-deportation. Representatives of migrant-advocacy groups say they are now inundated with questions about the logistics of returning home, especially what they can take with them when they leave.
Luz Gallegos, executive director of TODEC Legal Center in the Inland Empire, said illegals keep expressing the same sentiment, “Prefiero irme con algo, que irme sin nada,”—I’d rather leave with something than leave with nothing.
Exactly how many illegals are self-deporting is difficult to tell at this point, but it’s been reported that 5,000 illegals have already used the official CBP Home app to notify the government of their intent to leave the US.
“Self-deportation is safe,” the app tells users.
“Leave on your own terms by picking your departure flight.”
This week, President Trump said he would be willing to pay the cost of flights and some expenses for illegals who wish to return home.
“We’re going to give them some money and a plane ticket, and then we’re going to work with them,” the President said."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/migrant-crossings-via-darien-gap-have-fallen-99-under-trump,Migrant Crossings via Darien Gap Have Fallen 99% under Trump,By Raw Egg Nationalist,15 days ago,"Migrant crossings via the Darien Gap, the only route from South America into Central America and then on to the US southern border, have fallen by 99%.
According to data provided to The New York Times by the Department of Homeland Security, just 408 migrants crossed through the Panamanian jungle in February of this year.
In February 2024, by contrast, 37,166 people crossed the Gap.
The change represents a 99% decrease in traffic.
Over the full four years of Joe Biden’s term, it’s reckoned 1.2 million migrants crossed the Gap, bound for the US.
Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino has taken credit for the collapse in migration.
““I said I was going to close it, and I closed it,” Mulino said.
“It was like a living in a 21st century concentration camp. Now, that camp is history.”
A more likely story is that Trump’s immigration policies have simply deterred the overwhelming number of migrants from making the perilous journey, since they know it will only end in their being repelled at the US southern border.
Crossings at the US southern border are now down 94% thanks to Trump’s new immigration policies, which have included militarizing large sections of the border, including the Roosevelt Reserve, which spans the length of three border states."

Truth be told, I haven’t had the power even if I’d have liked to. But now I’ve got a pretty big audience, and a cushy writing gig at INFOWARS, so what the hell—here goes. There’s a first time for everything. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to—drum roll!—NICHOLAS DECKER.
You’ve probably never heard of Nicholas Decker and neither had I until last week, when he published a Substack essay entitled, “When Must We Kill Them?” It generated quite a large amount of discussion and comment belied by his rather modest following on the Bird App—a mere 11,800 followers at time of writing.
According to his Twitter bio, Nicholas is a PhD student at George Mason University, reading economics. He’s liberal, an “aspie”—has Asperger’s syndrome—“posts interesting papers,” is a “Michael Kremer stan”—Michael Kremer is a left-wing economist at the University of Chicago—he thinks we should “spend more on drugs,” and he’s also an advocate of “open borders now!”
Nicholas has a Pride flag and a Ukraine flag in his bio, as you’d expect. In his profile picture he’s wearing a pair of furry cat ears, which might mean he’s a Nick Fuentes fan or, more likely, that he’s either gay or transexual—not that those are exclusive options. Quite the opposite.
If you scroll far enough down the media tab on his profile, you’ll eventually come to a photograph of Nick (Decker, not Fuentes) wearing a dress and clutching a plushie toy. His fat swollen nipples suggest gynecomastia and perhaps that he’s taking the female hormone estrogen. In most pictures of himself he posts, though, a series of achingly androgynous selfies, he’s wearing boy clothes.
So rather than assuming young Nick’s gender or sexuality—a cardinal sin in his book, no doubt—let’s just assume he’s a typical, typically confused twenty-something leftist graduate student in the social sciences.
On the basis of this rather slim biographical portrait, I’m sure you can already guess what the main message of “When Must We Kill Them?” is, including the crucial question of who the “them” who must be killed are.
Yes, Nicholas Decker, PhD student at George Mason University, thinks it’s time to start killing members of the Trump administration. Judging by the language he uses, which is vague and metaphorical in places even if the general message is crystal clear, I think he probably believes Trump supporters should be targeted too. He says, “the problem is not one man, but a whole class of people. If one head is cut off, another would take its place.”
A whole class of people.
Cut off all their heads.
Decker’s claim is that the rule of law has come to an end in America—“evil has come to America,” in fact—and all that’s left to do in the face of a Trump administration that revokes the visas of foreign students, imposes tariffs on its competitors, doesn’t let hostile journalists into the Oval Office, deports foreign gang members and disregards the orders of activist judges, is to “decide when we fight.”
“Your threshold may differ from mine, but you must have one,” Decker cautions.
“If the present administration should cancel elections; if it should engage in fraud in the electoral process; if it should suppress the speech of its opponents, and jail its political adversaries; if it ignores the will of Congress; if it should directly spurn the orders of the court; all these are reasons for revolution. It may be best to stave off, and wait for elections to throw out this scourge; but if it should threaten the ability to remove it, we shall have no choice. We will have to do the right thing. We will have to prepare ourselves to die. I hope that we should conduct ourselves with such courage that it will be our finest hour; I expect that we shall do our duty.”
Decker says it brings him “sorrow”—“the sorrow of the world,” actually, whatever that means—to have to call for the death of a “whole class of people,” and that he “fondly hopes” the current administration will turn back of its own accord “in the face of lighter action.” But it’s clear, really, that the whole thing fills him with subversive glee. On Friday, he added a note to the essay in which he had a good giggle at the “inventiveness and facility of my interlocutors,” before clarifying that “violence is a last resort” and must be “narrowly targeted, and aimed only at extirpating those who have power, and are unjustly resisting giving it up.”
So he doesn’t regret or disavow any of it. Not really. He’s just covering his ass—barely. I could make a joke here, but I won’t.
I think it was the French poet Charles Baudelaire who noted, in his essay mon coeur mis à nu, that the most militant writing often pours forth from the pens of the least warriorlike men. Which is to say, weedy little dorks tend to harbour the most violent fantasies of bloodletting, revenge and a general potency they would otherwise never possess.
This is true, for sure, but there’s plenty of reason not to be complacent about the bloodthirsty calls to arms of the Nicholas Deckers of today. I don’t think this is a laughing matter at all.
With the Democrat party in disarray after the election, it’s already clear that mass mobilization is not going to be the theme of resistance to Trump’s second term, certainly not in the near future. A decade of stomping and shouting and pissing in the streets did nothing to stop Trump. In fact, it just emboldened him and made him far more radical. The pussy-hat wearers thought Trump 1.0 was bad, but Trump 2.0 with the 64-bit Service Pack and new themes installed is so, so much worse.
Thankfully, a guy called Luigi Mangione came along in December and showed you can actually do something, even if you’re just one person without the backing of a political party or organization. You can just pick up a gun and go and shoot someone you think is ruining the world. In Mangione’s case, that was the CEO of United Healthcare, because little Luigi, an amateur pornstar in the making, couldn’t get a boner after a botched surgery on his back. You don’t hear that last bit so much, but it’s true.
The “Mangione model,” as I like to call it, is catching. Fast. One of the main organizers of the nationwide Tesla protests has already cited Mangione as an inspiration. More ominously, the male-to-female transgender who tried to assassinate Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in February and burn down the Heritage Foundation also feted Mangione when he was caught.
Be in no doubt: People like Ryan Michael English, Bessent’s would-be killer, and Nicholas Decker are the ones who are most likely to do something, because they have the most to lose from the total collapse of the genital-mutilating tyranny Americans have labored under for the past four years. The most radical creations of that tyranny, the creatures that could not exist without its intimate power, are the ones we must watch most closely of all.
They’re janissaries of the woke regime—tran-issaries, literally.
Trump really is an existential crisis for these people.
Personally, I don’t think Nicholas Decker will be out there leading the slaughter, whatever he says. He’ll probably still be taking pictures of himself drinking boba tea with his ears on when—if—the revolution comes and the streets run with blood.
Even so, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to visit the FBI website and log a tip about him. Here’s the link. Others will heed his call, and that makes him every bit as guilty as them when they do try to do something. And, mark my words, they will."

Judge Jose “Joel” Cano reportedly submitted a letter of resignation on Mar. 3 of this year.
Judge Cano, a former police officer who took the bench in 2011, told a Border Hawk source that he did indeed resign but did not comment further.
Border Hawk contacted the judge’s office on Apr. 1 and was told by a clerk that he had “retired.”
On Feb. 28, 2025, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) El Paso arrested Cristhian Ortega-Lopez at a Las Cruces residence owned by Judge Cano following an anonymous tip.
Ortega-Lopez was reportedly caught by U.S. Border Patrol on Dec. 15, 2023, at Eagle Pass, TX, after illegally entering the U.S. by scaling a barbed wire fence, but was released three days later due to overcrowding at holding facilities.
Ortega-Lopez is a Venezuelan national and authorities believe he has ties to Tren de Aragua, based on tattoos, apparel, and displaying of hand gestures.
Following his release into the U.S., Ortega-Lopez “eventually moved to El Paso, where he roomed with five other people,” the Albuquerque Journal reports.
“Court documents state that he met Nancy Cano [Judge Cano’s wife] doing construction and handyman jobs, and accepted her offer to stay in a casita behind her home. In April 2024, Ortega-Lopez filed a request for immigration relief, listing the Las Cruces address as his residence.”

During his time in Las Cruces, Ortega-Lopez was introduced to Nancy Cano’s daughter, April Cano, “who possessed a large number of firearms,” prosecutors say.
April Cano reportedly allowed Ortega-Lopez to “hold and sometimes shoot various firearms.”
Ortega-Lopez admitted that he had possessed and fired multiple firearms confiscated from the home of April Cano, according to a criminal complaint.
Ortega-Lopez has been charged with being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm or ammunition and is being held without bond at Doña Ana County Detention Center.

Thiel, founding partner of the venture capital firm Founders Fund, made the explosive claims during an interview with his Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale.
“I think there were scams. I think the nonprofit stuff is out of control. It’s sort of like virtue signaling is a sign that you’re doing something evil,” Thiel told Lonsdale on his American Optimist podcast. “So much of this left-wing philanthropy nonprofit world was just a cover for borderline criminal activity.”
Peter Thiel to @JTLonsdale: DOGE uncovered how certain leftwing NGOs were seemingly fronts for ""borderline criminal activity."" ""I think you could prosecute thousands of these people, criminally, for the thing they wanted to prosecute Oliver North for in the 80s."" pic.twitter.com/kq2tVpBbe2
“That’s how you shield yourself—you put a virtue signal up while you’re stealing money from everyone,” Lonsdale replied.
Thiel pulled back the curtain on the murky world of government spending, exposing how vague budget descriptions can mask the true destination of taxpayer dollars.
“There’s all the stuff you’d have to really go into the weeds of how it works, but the way it was explained to me, there’s a level five description, which is a line item description of what the actual dollars are going to. Then there are ways these things get summarized. The way they got summarized for a lot of the political appointees was a level four description, where you summarize a bunch of level five descriptions in a level four way,” Thiel explained. “You can have 20 groups providing food to different African countries, and you can summarize that as food to Africa. That’s maybe an accurate description. But if they’re actually all working on the Biden re-election, that’s an inaccurate description. At some point, the descriptions are so inaccurate that the people in the government could be prosecuted for fraud.”
Thiel then argued that fraud in government spending could warrant criminal prosecution for countless officials, drawing a stark parallel to the Iran-Contra scandal that ensnared Oliver North in the 1980s.
“One of the people who looked at this a lot thinks you could just prosecute these people for fraud. This is something like what Oliver North was prosecuted for in the Iran-Contra scandal in the 80s,” Thiel said. “He mischaracterized the money, mislabeled it, and was accused of defrauding the government. I think you could prosecute thousands of these people criminally for the thing they wanted to prosecute Oliver North for in the 80s.”
Thiel joins President Donald Trump and DOGE leader Elon Musk as the latest prominent voice warning about rampant fraud inside the government. In recent weeks, Trump teased to reporters aboard Air Force One, “They found something today that’s horrible,” adding. “You’ll find out very soon. What they found is incredible.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-to-welcome-self-deported-illegals-back-to-us,Trump to Welcome Self-Deported Illegals Back to US?,By Allan Wall | Border Hawk,16 days ago,"Donald Trump got off to a great start in his second presidency. The border is under control and the administration has deported over 100,000 illegal aliens.
But is the Trump administration now going to allow deported illegals to reenter the country?
Is Trump going to have his own amnesty?
That’s what Trump said.
Don’t believe me?
Watch this clip from Trump’s televised cabinet meeting on April 10:
Trump called on Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who started off well:
“Well, Mr. President, thank you for your leadership at the border. For the second month in a row, you have broken the record in the history of the nation for the lowest number of encounters at the border, which is absolutely remarkable. You have said that America’s laws matter and that they’ll be enforced. And we’re hard at work now to get people to go back home that are here illegally.”
Sounds great.
But in her conversation about getting illegal aliens back to their home countries, she slipped this in:
“And so making sure that these folks have the opportunity to go home so that they can get the chance to come back to America is important.”
Whoa, what did she say there?
I think we can all agree that the goal is to get these illegal aliens to go back to their home countries. But Sec. Noem says it’s “important” that they get the opportunity to return to America?
Trump didn’t correct her.
“Sure, it’s a very big self-deport operation that we’re starting,” Trump said.
Yes, self-deportation is good, but it should happen as a result of mass deportations.
After Noem finished her report, Trump doubled down on the bizarre policy goal of bringing back self-deportees.
Trump on deportations: We are going to work with farmers. If they have strong recommendations for their farms for certain people we’re going to let them stay in for a while… we have to take care of our farmers and our hotels and various places where they need the people pic.twitter.com/OQEScOnGkq
Trump: “And we’re going to work with people so that if they go out in a nice way and go back to their country, we’re going to work with them right from the beginning on trying to get them back in legally. Is that right?”
Noem: “That’s right. They’ll have a chance to come back.”
Trump: “So it gives you a real incentive. Otherwise, they’d never come back. They’ll never be allowed once a certain period of time goes by, which is probably going to be 60 days.”
Why is Trump even leaving this open as a possibility?
Then he got into agriculture:
“We’re also going to work with farmers that if they have strong recommendations for their farms for certain people, we’re going to let them stay in for a while and work with the farmers and then come back and go through a process of — legal process.”
Translation: “We’re going to reward farmers that hire illegal aliens and we’re going to just legalize them.”
How is that different from amnesty?
After Secretary Noem agreed, Trump widened the groups of illegals that will be welcome.
Trump: “But we have to take care of our farmers. And hotels. And you know, various, various places where they’re used, where they need the people. And we’re going to be working with you very carefully on that.”
Noem: “Yes.”
Trump: “So, a farmer will come in with a letter concerning certain people saying they’re great. They’re working hard. We’re going to slow it down a little bit for them. And then we’re going to ultimately bring them back. They’ll go out, they’re going to come back as legal workers.”
What do you want to bet that all those “various, various” employers will assure us that they “need the people”?
What is Trump up to here?
Did I read this wrong? I wish I had, but I don’t think I did.
Where’s the outrage?
There ought to be an eruption of protest from Trump supporters.
The Trump administration should be doubling down on deportations, not encouraging illegal aliens to return and legalizing illegal alien workers.
Trump supporters better not let The Donald get away with this."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/witkoff-arrives-in-rome-for-second-round-of-iran-nuclear-talks,Witkoff Arrives in Rome for Second Round of Iran Nuclear Talks,By Raw Egg Nationalist,16 days ago,"President Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff has arrived in Rome for a second round of nuclear talks with representatives of the Iranian regime. President Trump is seeking a new deal to limit Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
In his first term, President Trump withdraw the US from an Obama-era deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program. He reimposed sanctions on Tehran and called for a new framework to limit access to materials, especially enriched uranium, necessary for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
With the failure of the Obama deal, Tehran returned to enriching and stockpiling uranium. According to a recent report from the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has stockpiles of around 600 pounds of 60%-enriched uranium. The country would require 90%-enriched uranium to produce weapons-grade material.
Since his return to the White House in January, President Trump has offered a new round of negotiations with Iran, but also threatened military action if the Iranian regime doesn’t accept new terms.
President Trump has said that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons; however, he has been more indulgent of Iran than Israel and appears, for now, to have decided against military action. It was recently reported that President Trump put the cosh on Israeli plans to launch ambitious commando raids, with US aerial and logistics support, on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Iran’s foreign minister has said he expects Witkoff to lay out negotiating terms during the meeting in Rome today.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow will help facilitate continuing talks between Washington and Tehran.
“We are ready to help, to mediate, to play any role that will be valuable from Iran’s point of view and that will be acceptable to the United States,” Lavrov said on Friday.
Moscow has deepened its ties with Tehran since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, in the face of international sanctions and isolation."

In recent weeks, Governor Tim Walz has publicly criticized Elon Musk and mocked him for a decline in Tesla’s stock price after widespread protests against Musk for his role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
At a town hall at the beginning of the month, Walz said that people “should demonize” Musk.
“We’re creating a false narrative for them that everybody is super rich and has Lamborghinis and life is easy,” Walz told the crowd, in Ohio.
“But that’s what we’re going to have to figure out in our society about social media and all those things.”
“But I don’t think we should be the party that demonizes someone because they’re able to afford something,” he added.
“What we should demonize is someone like Elon Musk and those people that do that. That’s different.”"

On Friday, the President tweeted out a picture of Garcia’s left hand, on which can clearly be seen a marijuana leaf, followed by a smiley face, a cross and a skull, with the cross and skull disguising the numbers 1 and 3. These symbols are meant to denote MS-13, the violent criminal gang which President Trump recently declared a terrorist organization.
“This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‘a fine and innocent person.’ They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

President Trump shared the image in response to attempts by Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, to doctor images of her husband to hide the gang tattoo.
Democrat lawmakers and opponents of President Trump have claimed that Garcia was wrongly deported to El Salvador, where he was confined in President Bukele’s Center for Terrorist Confinement (CECOT) as part of a $6 million deal with the US to house foreign gang members deported from the US using the Alien Enemies Act.
Lawmakers, including Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), travelled to El Salvador this week to call for Garcia’s return. Sen. Van Hollen met with Garcia for a photo opportunity, after he was released from CECOT.
Garcia was detained by ICE in March and deported to El Salvador after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act.
He entered the US unlawfully in 2012 and was identified as a member of MS-13 when he was arrested by law enforcement in 2019. He was suspected of being involved in human trafficking.
In that same year, an immigration court determined that “the determination that the Respondent [Abrego Garcia] is a gang member appears to be trustworthy and is supported by other evidence in the record, namely, information contained in the Gang Field Interview Sheet.”
However, Garcia was granted a deportation withholding order because it was feared his life would be in danger if he were deported back to El Salvador.
In a twist to the broader saga of deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, early this morning the Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting an unspecified number of Venezuelan men. The men are all alleged to be members of a foreign criminal gang.
“The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,” the order states.
The order, which grants an emergency application filed by the Venezuelan men, was subject to dissent from Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/french-philosopher-banned-from-entering-uk-for-anti-migration-views,French Philosopher Banned from Entering UK for Anti-Migration Views,By Raw Egg Nationalist,16 days ago,"One of France’s most influential living philosophers has been prevented from entering the UK by the British government.
Renaud Camus was due to speak in the UK at a conference this week when his visa was revoked by the UK government, which said in an email to Camus that his presence in the UK was “not considered conducive to the public good.”
Camus is most famous—and controversial—for coining the term “the Great Replacement” to describe the systematic replacement of Western populations with non-Western immigrants. Contrary to mainstream media portrayals of this “conspiracy theory,” Camus has never claimed the Great Replacement is a process being driven by a single group of people.
Instead, Camus blames the Great Replacement on the spread of an attitude he calls “replace-ism,” which strips the individual citizens of Western nations of their unique identity and makes them appear as identical units that are interchangeable with other people from around the globe. Camus attributes the development of this idea to the decline of religion, democracy, industrialisation and mass entertainment, among other factors.
Speaking to Britain’s GB News on Friday, Camus said of the Home Office’s decision to prevent him from entering the UK, “I was sort of amused.”
“I very much like England and, of course, in my idea England has been the country of free speech par excellence.
“It’s just sort of amusing to be banned for saying what I like to say in the conference in England.”
He added: “I was probably banned because they thought I was an adversary to what is going on in this country now, which I am very much.
“I think what is going on in England as what is going on in France or any of the western countries is a crime.
“I disagree very much with all of these governments and it’s not very surprising that they see me as an adversary, I am very much.”
Vauban Books, the independent publisher of Camus’ work in English, said: “The decision to bar Renaud Camus from the UK is only further confirmation that that country has abandoned the most basic principles of liberal democracy.
“Camus is one of our greatest living writers and will be remembered as such by posterity. The Starmer government, by contrast, will be remembered – if it’s remembered at all – only for its serial betrayals and profound mediocrity.
“Here as elsewhere, it has inadvertently shown just how precious Camus’ voice is, now more than ever.”
The state of free speech in the UK has received renewed focus since Donald Trump’s victory in last year’s election, with the new President, and especially his Vice President, JD Vance, making the promotion of free speech a cornerstone of US foreign policy vis-à-vis Europe.
At the Munich Security Conference in February, Vice President Vance told Europe’s politicians that the greatest threat to Europe lay not outside its borders, from adversaries like China and Russia, but from within. He blamed Europe’s leaders for retreating from the fundamental values that have made European civilization great.
During the election campaign, Vance also suggested that America would withdraw support for Europe if its leaders pressed ahead with attempts to censor US social-media giants, especially Twitter.
The Home Office has refused to comment on its decision to block Camus from entering the UK."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/confidence-in-dem-leadership-at-all-time-low,Confidence in Dem Leadership at All-Time Low,By Raw Egg Nationalist,16 days ago,"Confidence in Democrat leadership has sunk to an all-time low, according to new poll.
A Gallup Poll conducted between 1 April and 14 April showed that confidence in the leadership has fallen to 25%, down nine points from the previous low of 34%, recorded in 2023.
The new rating is 20 points below the average confidence level—45%—Americans have had in the Democrats’ Congressional leadership since 2001.
Pollsters at Gallup said the collapse in confidence was driven by members of the Democrat party themselves.
“Democratic congressional leaders’ rating among their own party faithful has fallen 41 points since last year to their lowest point ever,” Gallup explained.
“The previous low for Democratic congressional leaders among Democrats was 60%, recorded in 2005. For their part, Republicans’ confidence in their own party’s congressional leaders has never fallen below 42%.”
At present, confidence in the Republican Party’s leadership stands at 39%, nearly 15 points more than the Democrat figure.
It’s been more than a decade since either party received a minimum 50% confidence rating.
The Democrat leadership has faced a stunning backlash after Kamala Harris’s defeat in the 2024 presidential election, which also saw the party lose both the House and the Senate.
Senate Minority Leaders Chuck Schumer has recently faced an organized campaign to unseat him, funded by Soros-backed group Indivisible, which has also been coordinating protests against Elon Musk and Tesla."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/fda-to-remove-pharma-reps-from-advisory-panels,FDA To Remove Pharma Reps from Advisory Panels,By Raw Egg Nationalist,16 days ago,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will remove representatives of pharmaceutical companies from its advisory committees to reduce industry influence over their decisions.
In a statement on Thursday, the FDA’s new commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, said the move would ensure the FDA makes the right decisions on drug regulation in the future, after being “influenced unduly” by industry in the past.
“Industry employees are welcome to attend FDA advisory committee meetings, along with the rest of the American public, but having industry employees serve as official members of FDA advisory committee members represents a cozy relationship that is concerning to many Americans,” Makary wrote.
“In fact, the FDA has a history of being influenced unduly by corporate interests.”
In total, the FDA has 32 advisory committees, on areas ranging from vaccines to medical devices. Although members are primarily federal employees and non-industry experts, industry representatives do sit on these panels.
The Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, for example, had representatives from Pfizer officer and Dynavax at its most recent meeting.
These industry representatives do not cast votes, but they do provide information that could sway voting.
In his statement, Commissioner Makary said trust needs to be restored in healthcare.
“Public trust in the healthcare-industrial complex is at an all-time low. We need to restore impeccable integrity to the process and avoid potential conflicts of interest.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/supreme-court-blocks-deportations-under-alien-enemies-act,Supreme Court Blocks Deportations under Alien Enemies Act,By Raw Egg Nationalist,16 days ago,"The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting an unspecified number of Venezuelan men from the US under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. The men are all alleged to be members of a foreign criminal gang.
“The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,” the order states.
The order, which grants an emergency application filed by the Venezuelan men, was subject to dissent from Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.
The emergency application was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which asked the Supreme Court to block the Trump administration from deporting its clients. The ACLU is also seeking a temporary restraining order in the US District Court of the District of Columbia and a stay of removal from the Fifth Circuit.
Last month, President Trump designated Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, as a foreign terrorist organization. In an Executive Order, he said the President said the group is “perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.”
The President then invoked the Alien Enemies Act to allow the “immediate apprehension, detention, and removal” of members of Tren de Aragua who are Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older and who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States.
On 15 March, the Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to deport nearly 150 Venezuelans to El Salvador, to be incarcerated in the Center for Terrorist Confinement (CECOT).
The ACLU, in its application, alleged that many of the Venezuelan men deported from the US are not members of Tren de Aragua.
“Such false accusations are particularly devastating given the present Applicants’ strong claims for relief under our immigration laws,” the application said.
In a decision on 7 April, the Supreme Court had granted President Trump’s request to pause a district judge’s stay order preventing the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua, but ruled that detainees must be given the opportunity to challenge their removal from the US."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/white-house-slams-mask-mandates-lockdowns-social-distancing-fauci-after-major-update-to-covid-gov,"White House Slams Mask Mandates, Lockdowns, Social Distancing & Fauci After Major Update to Covid.gov",By Sean Miller,17 days ago,"President Donald Trump’s White House published a presentation documenting the Covid ‘lab leak’ incident which took place at a bioweapons lab in Wuhan, China and led to the plandemic of 2020. These ‘revelations’ come five years after Alex Jones exposed the Wuhan Lab as the source of the viral release.
The fake news mainstream media narrative claimed Covid came out of a weird food market in Wuhan because of Chinese people eating bats. Those who said it was a lab leak were derided as ‘conspiracy theorists’.
Jones additionally detailed how Covid did not ‘leak’, rather it was ‘released’. Trump’s administration has not gone that far, however it also has to be able to make deals with China on the geopolitical chessboard to advance Trump’s America First agenda, so accusing Beijing of a global bioweapons attack may hinder these abilities.
What the White House has detailed however is the bioweapon origin of Covid.
Trump’s presentation also exposed the ‘medical experts’ responsible for the pandemic response.
Particularly notable is the direct identification of Anthony Fauci as a key figure in this conspiracy. President Joe Biden pardoned Fauci, which is interesting as many have called for his arrest.
Trump’s White House also detailed the obstruction that was carried out by government health agencies and officials.
Specific pandemic responses which are now admitted to being fraudulent are global treaties, social distancing, mask mandates, lockdowns and putting Covid-positive patients in nursing homes.
The Biden administration has also been listed as a culprit in the Covid-saga due to their censorship of the truth related to pandemic via labeling it as ‘misinformation’.
While the origins of Covid were largely fleshed out by Infowars in early 2020, back in 2009 Alex Jones predicted a controlled bioweapon release-based pandemic resulting in lockdowns and deadly vaccines.
“Content on this page sourced from the House Oversight Committee website, a Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability in the U.S. House of Representatives,” Covid.gov said.
These Covid origin disclosures coincide with the President’s larger government transparency operations."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/epstein-mossad-or-cia,Epstein: Mossad or CIA?,By ZeroHedge,17 days ago,"“If you look at Epstein’s list, he’s not going after Congressmen… They already own Congress with AIPAC” ~Ryan Dawson
Last night, we hosted the ultimate panel for those wanting to learn more about government-pedo-blackmail operations… aka the craziest thing on Earth that media will not cover. It featured the legendary reporter and author Nick Bryant, relentless researcher Ryan Dawson, and was hosted by Ian Carroll one of the most effective communicators of this information at scale.
Below were the highlights for those who missed it though we strongly recommend listening to the full 2-hour discussion:
“Sexual political blackmail has been around forever,” says Bryant, dating back to the days of the Founding Fathers. He tells the story of Alexander Hamilton’s affair with a married woman whose husband attempted to extort Hamilton. A muckraking journalist published the story while trying to curry favor with and secure a political appointment from Hamilton’s nemesis Thomas Jefferson. When Jefferson refused, the journalist outed him for having sex with his slaves.
“It goes all the way back…”
From there Dawson dives into modern era sex blackmail beginning with American mobster Micky Cohen, who Dawson says was the likely the first to use video tape.
Many know the quote from former Labor Secretary Alex Acosta that Epstein “belonged to intelligence” but under which nation? Dawson laid out the case that Epstein was first and foremost an Israeli asset while Bryant tried to argue it was more likely a joint operation with the U.S.
Central to Dawson’s case is former Mossad agent Ari Ben-Menashe said Epstein worked for the agency: “Someone in Israeli intelligence said he worked for Israeli intelligence.”
Additionally, the father of Epstein’s girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, Robert, was a member of the pre-Israel zionist militia “Haganah”, helped secure arms shipments to the country during its founding, and upon passing off the coast of Spain, his body was was shipped to Israel to receive a highly sacred burial in the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem attended by heads and former heads of Israeli intelligence.
“If you look at Epstein’s list, he’s not going after Congressmen… there’s a couple… but mainly he was aiming at science and technology,” Dawson added. “They already own Congress with AIPAC. You don’t need to re-bribe people you completely control.”
Bryant pointed to Epstein’s Saudi Arabian passport while Carroll mentioned his ties to Saudi Arabian arms trafficker Adnan Kashoggi… though caveated that Kashoggi worked very closely with Israel as well.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/exclusive-team-karmelo-funded-by-soros-groups,EXCLUSIVE: Team Karmelo Funded By Soros Groups,By Patrick Howley | Patrick Reports,18 days ago,"The Dallas advocacy group working with accused murderer Karmelo Anthony has received numerous payments from groups funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros, according to documents obtained by PATRICK REPORTS.
17-year old Karmelo Anthony stands accused of murder in the first degree after he fatally stabbed 17-year old opponent Austin Metcalf at a high school track meet. Since getting his bond reduced, Anthony is reportedly living in a lavish house in a Texas gated community. The “Help Karmelo Official Fund” has raised more than $450,000, prompting a report on suspicious donations to the GiveSendGo page. Of course, left-wing political interests are interceding in the case.
Dominique Alexander, a supposed minister, is the founder and president of the Next Generation Action Network, a black activist group based in Dallas, Texas.
Dominique Alexander had a special meeting with the Frisco (TX) Police Department about the Karmelo Anthony case. The Next Generation Action Network escorted Anthony out of jail when he was released on bond, and Dominique Alexander was photographed with Anthony after the accused murderer returned home. The Next Generation Action Network is front and center on Team Karmelo, whipping up support for Anthony’s defense as racial tensions elevate the case into the national spotlight.
Karmelo Anthony is SAFE at home.This moment is a reminder that a community united can never be divided.The journey ahead is long, but today—we celebrate a victory for justice, for family, and for the power of people coming together to protect our youth.Thank you to everyone… pic.twitter.com/CjLTkhbIiL
On Facebook, the group is stoking racial conflict by using hashtags like #Amerikka and #colonialism on a series of videos complaining about what they call “Racist Messages, comments, emails we get since taking the Karmelo Anthony case as an advocacy group.”
Dominique Alexander is a Kamala Harris supporter, and his group claims in its X bio that “We helped elect @coribush.”
Dominique Alexander has a rap sheet that includes a guilty plea for injuring a former girlfriend’s 2-year old child. In 2016, Alexander helped to lead a protest that will forever be remembered for Micah Xavier Johnson’s deadly ambush shooting attack that killed four Dallas cops and a Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer.
So where does Next Generation Action Network get its funding?
The group appears to have filed IRS Form 990’s under multiple different names, and at least two of the entities had their tax-exempt status revoked for failing to file a 990. For this reason, it is very difficult to track the group’s funding sources.
Luckily, other left-wing groups have filed 990’s that shed light on how the Next Generation Action Network gets its power. Dominique Alexander’s group has received money from at least three George Soros-funded organizations: The Tides Foundation, BVM Capacity Building Institute, and Resist, Inc.
The Tides Foundation gave the Next Generation Action Network in Dallas a $25,000 cash grant, according to the Tides 990 for 2023. The grant was for “EQUITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT,” according to the 990. The Tides Foundation is a San Francisco and New York-based leftist slush fund that partners with the parent group of Wikipedia. The Tides Foundation and its affiliates have taken millions of dollars from George Soros’ foundations, according to the grants database on the Open Society Foundations website.
BVM Capacity Building Institute gave $7,500 to Next Generation Action Network, according to their 990 filing for the year 2023. BVM Capacity Building Institute also gave $51,000 to an entity called “NGAN Foundation” (which used the same exact listed address in Dallas as Next Generation Action Network and is identified on the Next Generation Action Network website as part of Dominique Alexander’s group) according to BVM’s 990 filing for the year 2021.
BVM Capacity Building Institute has received at least $12 million in grants from George Soros’ donation empire, including a $10 million grant in 2021 from George Soros’ Foundation to Promote Open Society.
Next Generation Action Network received a $7,000 cash grant from Resist Inc., according to Resist Inc.’s 990 filing for the year 2022.
Resist Inc. received funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute, which became Soros’ Open Society Foundations, according to Open Society Institute’s 990 for the year 2021.
Meanwhile, the GiveSendGo page for Karmelo Anthony’s family is attracting scrutiny.
The Dallas Express reported that “Numerous anonymous donations to the “Help Karmelo Official Fund” appear with identical messages and similar amounts of money. These donations often occur within minutes of each other and at all hours.”
The Dallas Express‘ report further fuels speculation that an organized influence campaign might be responsible for Karmelo Anthony’s sudden rise to celebrity status.
Karmelo Anthony’s supporters are even pushing merchandise including T-shirts promoting the accused murderer.
NEW: The family/friends of Karmelo Anthony are now promoting new shirts with his face on them that say ""FreeMelo.""A new website has been set up with shirts that customers can buy.The website was first promoted by ""dj_fatboy_eazy"" on Instagram. It's unclear what… pic.twitter.com/fOhbqK0C9o

https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-jesus-death-and-resurrection-the-most-monumental-events-in-all-of-history,Trump: Jesus’ Death And Resurrection The ‘Most Monumental Events in All of History’,By Andreas Wailzer | Lifesite,18 days ago,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (LifeSiteNews) — President Donald Trump acknowledged the importance of Jesus Christ’s death and resurrection during a Wednesday prayer dinner held at the White House.
In his speech at the beginning of the event, Trump said that during Holy Week, “we remember two of the most monumental events in all of history: the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”
“Nearly 2,000 years ago, during the sacred week, the living son of God entered Jerusalem in triumph,” the president stated. “ Soon after the savior of mankind, who brought truth and light into the world, was betrayed, arrested, and tried, beaten, and nailed to a cross and crucified. For our sake, He gave up His life.”
“ And as the very great Reverend Billy Graham once said, ‘God proved His love on the cross when Christ hung and bled and died. It was God saying to the world: I love you.’”
“Three days later, Christ’s followers found the empty tomb,” Trump continued.
“ Jesus had defeated darkness and death and promised new life to all of humankind. And that’s what we celebrate each year at Easter, as we joyfully proclaim on Sunday, ‘He has risen.’”
“The death and resurrection of Jesus are the essence of the Christian faith, whether rich or poor, healthy or sick, young or old, or in times of peace or war, Christians everywhere find solace and hope in the knowledge that Christ died for them and that they could be united with Him in heaven, and that’s what we want. That’s what we all want,” the president said.
“The miracles of Holy Week set in motion a transformation in human existence,” Trump stressed. “Countless millions of Americans have been moved by Christ’s example to heal the sick, defend their families, lift up their communities, and make our country stronger, better, and greater than ever before.”
Trump went on to describe the success of his first three months in office.
“ We are restoring our prosperity, securing our borders. We are rebuilding the U.S. military,” he stated.
The president emphasized his administration’s effort to help persecuted Christians worldwide and to end “anti-Christian bias” in the U.S.
“There is anti-Christian [bias]. You don’t hear about that very much, but there is anti-Christian bias. We are stopping the radical indoctrination in our schools and supporting school choice, and we are going to be moving our education department and various educational departments down to the states, where they belong,” he said.
Trump noted that he “banned men from women’s sports” and “ signed an executive order making the official policy of the United States that God created two genders, male and female.”
“ America has put [its] trust in God. It will always be ‘In God we trust.’ We will never change that,” he stressed.
“ And with God’s help, we can overcome every challenge, triumph over every evil, and restore the spirit of faith in the United States for generations to come,” Trump said.  ”We have a very simple slogan: Make America Great Again. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.”
Trump closed his speech by wishing everyone a “very joyful and blessed Easter.”
READ: President Trump publishes powerful Holy Week message
On Palm Sunday, Trump published a powerful Holy Week message, reiterating the importance of Christ’s death and resurrection for the atonement of mankind’s sin and the gift of eternal life in heaven.
“Through His suffering, we have redemption. Through His death, we are forgiven of our sins. Through His resurrection, we have hope of eternal life,” the president’s Palm Sunday statement read.
“We pray that America will remain a beacon of faith, hope, and freedom for the entire world, and we pray to achieve a future that reflects the truth, beauty, and goodness of Christ’s eternal kingdom in Heaven,” Trump said in his message."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/german-retiree-faces-charges-over-sharing-meme-mocking-government-official,German Retiree Faces Charges Over Sharing Meme Mocking Government Official,By Javier Villamor | The European Conservative,18 days ago,"A 64-year-old German retiree who mocked Economy Minister Robert Habeck online is now facing serious criminal charges—for sharing memes.
Stefan Niehoff was charged by the Bamberg public prosecutor with “incitement to hatred” and the “use of unconstitutional symbols” after sharing a meme on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in which he referred to German Economy Minister Robert Habeck as a “professional idiot.” Niehoff was initially under investigation for insulting a public official, but the prosecutor later dropped the charge.
According to Apollo News, the new indictment no longer focuses directly on Niehoff’s criticism of Habeck but on other posts in which he shared historical images associated with the Nazi regime.
In one post, he criticised a call for a boycott against companies affiliated with the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD). The image was a historical sign reading “Deutsche kauft nicht bei Juden” (“Germans, do not buy from Jews”), accompanied by the caption: “Wahre Demokraten! Hatten wir alles schon mal!” (“True democrats! We’ve seen this before!”). His intent was to draw a provocative comparison between past and present boycott movements. However, the prosecutor’s office did not mention this context in the indictment.
The Bamberg prosecutor accuses Niehoff of “disseminating symbols of former National Socialist organizations on five occasions by retweeting or forwarding to other users” and of publicly trivializing an act committed under the Nazi regime in a manner that could disturb public peace (Welt). If found guilty, he could face a fine equal to 90 days’ worth of his income.
The case has sparked additional controversy due to the involvement of Ursula Redler, the current director of the Haßfurt district court, who approved the indictment against Niehoff. Redler previously served as chief prosecutor in Bamberg, overseeing the initial investigation into the retiree. Shortly after the prosecutor filed the charges, Redler assumed her position in Haßfurt. This prompted her to declare a “possible conflict of interest,” though she initially did not make this situation public.
Niehoff’s defense lawyer, Marcus Pretzell, announced they would contest the charges in court. A formal trial will be held if Niehoff refuses to pay the proposed fine."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-shuts-down-us-censorship-agency-remnants,Secretary of State Marco Rubio Shuts Down US Censorship Agency Remnants,By Dan Frieth | Reclaim The Net,18 days ago,"Secretary of State Marco Rubio has officially ordered the closure of the State Department’s Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) office, ending a controversial chapter in what he described as a “shameful” period of federally sanctioned speech suppression.
The move dismantles the only formal office in the department tasked with countering foreign propaganda but, as Secretary Rubio and many others have noticed, it had morphed into something far more troubling: a taxpayer-funded engine that repeatedly ended up silencing American voices.
“For centuries, the United States served as a beacon of hope for millions of people around the world,” Rubio said in a statement. “Over the last decade though, individuals in America have been slandered, fired, charged, and even jailed for simply voicing their opinions…That ends today.”
His decision to eliminate R/FIMI follows years of escalating concern over how programs meant to counter foreign disinformation have instead repeatedly targeted domestic speech.
The office, created in late 2024 as a scaled-down continuation of the now-defunct Global Engagement Center (GEC), claimed to focus exclusively on foreign influence campaigns. Yet evidence increasingly showed that both R/FIMI and its predecessor were entangled in activities that penalized Americans for their political views.
While framed as a defensive measure against foreign adversaries like China, Russia, and Iran, the actual outcomes of these efforts routinely involved actions that resulted in blacklisting American media outlets, throttling their reach online, and labeling dissenting opinions as dangerous misinformation. The censorship was indirect but impactful: through partnerships with nonprofits and tech platforms, GEC-funded projects influenced what Americans could say, see, and share.
In 2023, The Daily Wire and another media company filed a lawsuit accusing GEC of violating the First Amendment. The suit cited the office’s funding of organizations like the Global Disinformation Index and NewsGuard, which rated right-leaning publications as “unreliable” or “risky,” pressuring advertisers to pull funding. These efforts, though outsourced, were unmistakably rooted in US government policy.
By the time R/FIMI was formed, the damage was already evident. Rubio, now Secretary of State under the Trump administration, saw little reason to continue funding an office that he said served to “actively silence and censor the voices of Americans they were supposed to be serving.” At $51.9 million a year, the price tag for speech suppression was steep; yet, for years, it went largely unchecked.
Inside the State Department, the end came swiftly. R/FIMI employees were summoned to a surprise morning meeting with Acting Undersecretary Darren Beattie, where they were informed the office was being shut down and their positions eliminated.
More: The Rebranding of a Censorship Unit
Beattie had already ordered staff to stop working weeks earlier, a clear signal the shutdown was in motion. The remaining employees will be placed on administrative leave and terminated within 30 days.
Rubio’s announcement is closely aligned with a broader push from the White House to eradicate government programs that have meddled in the domestic information space. A recent executive order plainly states that federal efforts under the guise of fighting “misinformation,” “disinformation,” and “malinformation” had crossed constitutional lines and “infringed on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens…in a manner that advanced the Government’s preferred narrative.”
Despite claims that such programs were essential for national security, the pattern was clear: these offices, again and again, failed to stay in their lane. What was supposed to be foreign-facing surveillance too often ended up policing Americans instead. And those being policed were not enemies of the state or agents of foreign powers, they were journalists, commentators, academics, and ordinary citizens expressing lawful opinions.
The collapse of R/FIMI follows the defunding of its predecessor, the GEC, after Congress, led by Republicans, blocked its $61 million reauthorization in 2023.
Like R/FIMI, GEC was originally tasked with foreign counterpropaganda, but its reach into domestic tech moderation quickly drew backlash. Its origin dates back to an Obama-era executive order, initially focusing on counterterrorism messaging before shifting to fight global propaganda. Along the way, its mission blurred into something else entirely.
Meanwhile, other entities accused of enabling censorship have also been hit. The Stanford Internet Observatory, which had played a prominent role in identifying “misinformation” during US elections, was closed amid legal threats and public scrutiny.
The Department of Homeland Security’s CISA has also been implicated in this so-called “disinformation-industrial complex,” facing sharp criticism for its role in flagging social media posts and coordinating with platforms to remove them.
Rubio’s decision sends a clear message: “It is the responsibility of every government official to continuously work to preserve and protect the freedom for Americans to exercise their free speech,” he said. “Under the administration of President Trump, we will always work to protect the rights of the American people.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/canada-ppc-candidate-meghan-murphy-says-her-bank-account-was-frozen-after-election-bid-announcement,Canada PPC Candidate Meghan Murphy Says Her Bank Account Was Frozen After Election Bid Announcement,By Didi Rankovic | Reclaim The Net,18 days ago,"When Canada’s authorities decided to crush political and social dissent by freezing bank accounts belonging to participants in the 2022 Freedom Convoy, many critics warned the practice would not be isolated to a single event, but would instead set a dangerous precedent.
The case of Meghan Murphy, a women’s rights advocate who decided to run in the upcoming federal election on the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) ticket, appears to give credence to those fears.
On Monday, Murphy wrote on her Substack that her bank account got frozen by the Canadian government the day her candidacy was confirmed – a move she suspects is politically motivated, both because of the timing, and the fact she is a vocal critic of that government.
This happened last Tuesday, and Murphy claims that despite repeated attempts to learn from the bank, Vancity, what had happened, the only information she has so far been able to obtain is that Vancity acted on government orders. She was also initially told that she could contact an employee with further inquiries.
But that employee just so happened to be on vacation, and a voicemail informed her.
“So basically this guy froze my bank account and immediately went on vacation,” writes Murphy, who left Canada in early 2021 as an opponent of Covid mandates, but also a long-standing critic of modern gender ideology and attacks on free speech.
Murphy followed up on the voicemail message with a series of calls that were not answered, while one of the messages got the reply stating she was unable to contact anyone at the bank because of “technical difficulties.”
Murphy considers herself a political dissident and does not hesitate to call Canada’s government, led for years by the Liberal Party, “dangerous and authoritarian.”
Despite that, and the example of the Freedom Convoy, she decided to run in the election, as “one last opportunity to fight for change, and to force some conversations that had been suppressed in my progressive Vancouver East riding.”
But after the Kafkaesque experience just trying to find out why exactly she was cut off from her bank account, Murphy abandoned plans to travel to her country, (she’s currently in Mexico) stating that she is “very concerned” about what awaits her upon arrival.

A new report from the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee not only promotes sweeping online monitoring powers for law enforcement but also misrepresents and dismisses legitimate concerns about the unequal application of justice in the UK.
Following the tragic murders of Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, all children, during a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on July 29, protests and clashes erupted across the country.
Rather than scrutinizing the core grievances fueling public anger, the committee zeroed in on online speech. It called for a “new national system for policing” that would include enhanced capabilities to monitor and respond to social media activity, an alarming prospect for civil liberties.

The report claims this would help police “develop the necessary capacity” to handle fast-moving online narratives, but offers little in the way of safeguards against overreach.
The committee also criticized the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for its handling of the information released in the wake of the murders. Conflicting guidance from prosecutors reportedly left Merseyside Police unable to disclose details about the suspect’s background, including his religion.
This lack of transparency, MPs argue, contributed to the spread of speculation and mistrust. “The inconsistent advice from the CPS over the publication of information about the suspect’s religion was particularly regrettable and hampered the police response,” the report states.
Committee chair Dame Karen Bradley remarked that “the criminal justice system will need to ensure its approach to communication is fit for the social media age,” indicating a push toward more tightly controlled narratives during high-profile incidents.
Still, perhaps the most revealing portion of the report is its attempt to sideline allegations of two-tier policing. Rather than acknowledging the broader body of concerns, including disproportionate sentencing for online speech or selective enforcement of laws, the report reframes the entire issue. It falsely narrows the definition of two-tier policing to claims that “those involved in disorder had been policed more strongly than previous protesters.”
This redefinition allows the report to reject two-tier policing without engaging with more substantial, provable disparities in the justice system. One such example ignored by the committee is the increasing number of individuals arrested or prosecuted for online posts, often receiving penalties more severe than those given to violent offenders.

Chief Constable BJ Harrington welcomed the report’s stance, stating that it “robustly disagrees with the notion of two-tier policing.” The Home Office likewise emphasized the need to clamp down on digital narratives, citing pressure on existing communications protocols. “Social media has put well-established principles around how we communicate after attacks like this under strain,” a spokesperson said. “We must be able to tackle misinformation head-on.”
The CPS, meanwhile, rejected claims that their guidance prohibited disclosure of killer Axel Rudakubana’s religion, insisting that Merseyside Police chose not to share the information and never revisited the matter. “The Media Protocol…played no part in this decision making,” a spokesperson said, while also confirming work was underway to update those guidelines.
While the state points fingers at public reaction and online discourse, there is little acknowledgment of the failures that sparked distrust in the first place. The growing appetite for censorship and surveillance, justified under the vague label of “misinformation,” should raise serious concerns about freedom of expression and the direction of public accountability in the UK."

In D.C., met with Secretary @howardlutnick and Ambassador @jamiesongreer for 🇪🇺🇺🇸 negotiations, seizing the 90-day window for a mutual solution to unjustified tariffs. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/P0eMgZSudQ
Trump’s announcement of a 90-day tariff pause, reducing universal tariffs to 10%, offered a window for dialogue, prompting the EU to suspend planned retaliatory measures until July 14. Šefčovič emphasized the need for a “significant joint effort” to achieve a fair deal, reiterating the EU’s offer of zero tariffs on industrial goods and cooperation on non-tariff barriers.
This trade dispute, which affects 70% of EU exports to the U.S., could shave 0.2-0.6% off the EU’s GDP if unresolved, with even more significant economic fallout projected for the U.S. Despite three visits to Washington since the conflict began, Šefčovič has yet to secure a breakthrough, as U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum, cars, and components (up 25%) and reciprocal tariffs (20% on EU goods) persist. The EU’s cautious response reflects its preference for negotiation over escalation, but the clock is ticking.
Amid these tensions, Germany’s incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz has proposed reviving the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). This comprehensive free-trade agreement has been stalled since Trump halted negotiations in 2017. The TTIP aimed to eliminate tariffs, harmonize regulations, and boost investment across the Atlantic, promising billions in economic gains. However, it faced backlash over issues like regulatory sovereignty, ultimately collapsing.
In a Handelsblatt interview, Merz called the failure to finalize TTIP a “mistake” and advocated for a new deal with “zero tariffs for everything,” aligning with sentiments from Trump ally Elon Musk. Merz plans to visit Washington post-inauguration in May 2025 to push this agenda while urging Europe to diversify trade with partners like Canada, India, and Japan.
Merz’s proposal dovetails with Šefčovič’s tariff-free offer but faces hurdles: Trump’s protectionist stance, EU internal divisions, and past TTIP controversies. While Merz insists Europe must speak with one voice, his call for rapid agreements, including with Mercosur, highlights a broader strategy to counter U.S. pressure. As Šefčovič navigates immediate tariff talks, Merz’s TTIP vision signals a long-term bid to reshape transatlantic trade."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/gab-refuses-to-comply-with-uk-censorship-tyranny,Gab Refuses to Comply With UK Censorship “Tyranny”,By Rick Findlay | Reclaim The Net,19 days ago,"Gab, a US-based social media platform known for its commitment to unfettered speech, has taken the step of cutting off access to users in the United Kingdom.
The decision follows an ultimatum from the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, demanding data about Gab’s users and internal operations, demands the company categorically rejects as authoritarian.
More: When One Island Demands to Muzzle the World
CEO Andrew Torba made his position clear in a post on X, where he wrote: “Our latest threatening letter from Ofcom ordered us to disclose information about our users and operations. We know where this leads: compelled censorship and British citizens are thrown in jail for ‘hate speech.’” He concluded emphatically: “We refuse to comply with this tyranny.”
Gab’s move comes in direct response to the UK’s controversial Online Safety Act, a sweeping legislative framework introduced under the guise of public safety but widely decried for its broad scope and potential to stifle dissent. The company now displays a block notice to UK-based visitors, citing both legal overreach and a principled stance in defense of free expression.
A notice shown to users in the UK includes the words of John Milton from Areopagitica — “Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.” It also states that after receiving “yet another demand from the UK’s speech police,” Gab chose to sever access entirely.
As a US company with no physical presence in Britain, Gab argues that Ofcom has no legal standing to compel compliance. “To enforce anything in the United States, they’d need to go through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty request or letters rogatory. No U.S. court is going to enforce a foreign censorship regime. The First Amendment forbids it,” the message reads.
Gab also points to the absurdity of Ofcom trying to punish an American firm that has already blocked UK access. The company portrays this as a clear illustration of how censorship inevitably turns into an attempt to silence rather than protect. “Censorship doesn’t work. It only reveals the truth about the censors,” the statement asserts.
This isn’t an isolated stance. Gab now joins other platforms like BitChute in restricting access from the UK, encouraging other American companies to do the same in protest. The message includes a bold call to reject what it characterizes as authoritarianism masquerading as safety regulation: “The only way to vote against the tyranny of the UK’s present regime is to walk away from it, refuse to comply, and take refuge under the impervious shelter of the First Amendment.”"

Charles Haywood, a former mergers and acquisitions attorney who stepped away from practicing law to found a highly-successful haircare and cosmetics company, has emerged as a prominent political philosopher and writer advocating for American interests and a return to restrictive immigration policies.
“You basically need to remove all of the unnecessary foreigners. Obviously, America has always succeeded with having a small admixture of foreigners who hew to the dominant culture,” Haywood said during a new interview with immigration news outlet Border Hawk.
“You don’t have to get rid of all of the foreigners, you just have to get rid of most of the foreigners and all of the undesirable foreigners.”
An Indiana native, Haywood says he is hearing local reports indicating many ‘migrants’ who arrived to the U.S. during the Biden era and flooded cities and towns across the Midwest – such as Haitians and other participants in the CHNV and CBP One parole programs – are preparing to self-deport as their work authorization and right to remain expire.
“I think the Haitians are just going to disappear. Obviously, that can be encouraged with giving them… $2,000 and a free flight and do the ‘carrot and the stick,’ and in no time at all, there will be no Haitians at all in the country,” he said.
“Mechanically, these things seem to me to be fairly straightforward. Much of it is a question of political will. On the other hand, we’re seeing a lot more political will than I expected out of the administration, so that’s good.”
Addressing lagging numbers during the initial months of President Trump’s ‘mass deportation’ efforts, Haywood said, “You should not make the perfect the enemy of the good. I want to get rid of all 20 million (illegals) and considerably more, but if I get 10 million in 18 months, that in itself will ensure that we never face the same situation again in any kind of relevant time frame.”
“So much of this is resetting the possibility of expectations,” he continued. “For example, you’re no longer going to see people taking out huge loans on the expectation that they can work for a left-wing agitprop group and be guaranteed to get their loans forgiven because Trump has cut a bunch of those.
“The uncertainty prevents people from taking actions that, in the past, they would have taken simply because they felt certain that they would come here, they would never be kicked out, they would be allowed to get citizenship and stay here forever. The uncertainty means that, over time, people will self-deport.”
Haywood also pointed out illegal immigration is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to an endless flow of foreign nationals pouring into the U.S.
American institutions of higher learning, including Ivy League universities and prestigious STEM schools like Purdue, are inviting droves of students from other countries, specifically those in Asia.
“For years, they’ve held their tuition steady, and the way they’ve done that is by bringing in ever-increasing, huge numbers of Chinese and Indians who pay full freight and push out students in Indiana, particularly White, male students in Indiana who can’t even get a look in,” Haywood said.

During the latest broadcast of Maher’s HBO show Real Time, the duo’s wide-ranging conversation at one point turned to the question of what lines officeholders should not cross when dealing with their political opponents.
“How about this: no politicians in prison,” Maher said. “You can impeach them, you can put them to court, you know, we disagree about that, that’s one reason you were in prison-”
“For a misdemeanor. For contempt,” Bannon interjected, referring to the four monthshe spent incarcerated last year for defying a congressional subpoena to appear before the January 6 committee (in what critics deemed a case of selective prosecution, noting prominent Democrats such as former Attorneys General Eric Holder and Merrick Garland who were not punished for similar offenses).
“But I think once you, once you go to the, well, you guys started it with ‘lock her up,’ okay?” Maher continued, referring to President Donald Trump’s 2016 embrace of the chant to prosecute the former first lady, secretary of state, and New York senator after former FBI director James Comey announced that she broke the law but the Obama administration would not prosecute her because she supposedly lacked criminal intent.
“Hang on, hang on. She should have been locked up, and we didn’t go after her,” Bannon replied.
“I guess we don’t agree, then,” Maher said, to which Bannon quipped, “we’re not supposed to agree […] One good night at the White House shouldn’t make you soft, Bill,” referencing Maher’s recent dinner with Trump.

The acknowledgment that the first Trump administration “didn’t go after her” is a rare mea culpa over Trump’s announcement, within weeks of winning in 2016, that despite his campaign rhetoric he would not pursue charges because “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways […] I’m not looking to go back and go through this.”
In December 2016, Trump joked at a Michigan rally that the “lock her up” chant “plays great before the election – now we don’t care, right?”
Many on both sides are currently waiting intently to see whether the second Trump administration’s law enforcement team, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, will take a different approach to alleged Democrat illegality."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-deceptive-democracy-movement-threatening-americas-republic,The Deceptive “Democracy” Movement Threatening America’s Republic,By Lisa Logan,21 days ago,"The following is a guest post by journalist Lisa Logan.
“A republic, if you can keep it.” – Founding Father Benjamin Franklin’s response to Elizabeth Willing Powel’s question about what kind of government was created after signing the Constitution.
America is a Constitutional Republic with a representative form of government, not a Democracy, but a recent surge of groups from a “pro-democracy” network has designs to change that.
Many states like Utah, hungering for a return to civility after years of divisive political rhetoric, have allowed organizations connected to this movement (like UNITE’s Dignity Index) to infiltrate and influence state and local institutions to help dictate civic policy, which they might’ve reconsidered if they knew where it originated from.
This sudden “pro-democracy” push actually came from former President Biden’s administration, which launched this so-called movement to “address hate-motivated violence and foster unity” at a 2022 event at the White House called the United We Stand Summit (Figure 1).
🧵This narrative has been building since the United We Stand Summit in 2022.Biden invited victims of ""hate-fueled violence"" to the White House to launch https://t.co/sxWSzUG5Nf & other ""democracy saving"" initiatives paid for by a large $1B donation from the org New Pluralists. pic.twitter.com/4zZL7kR17W
Figure 1: X Thread featuring a video clip from Biden’s United We Stand Summit
During the Summit, Biden asserted that “domestic terrorism, rooted in white supremacy, is the greatest terrorist threat to America today.” In an effort to foster dialogue and find solutions to combat this urgent threat of hate and extremism, Biden announced the launch of a new Citizens Initiative and website, “Dignity.us” that would be coordinated by a seemingly bipartisan team of former White House Domestic Policy Council members, and funded by a billion dollar investment from a Rockefeller-Fetzer-Koch group called the “New Pluralists.” This initiative became the placeholder for the eventual rollout of the Dignity Index, which the original Dignity.us website oddly now redirects to.
The Dignity Index
The Dignity Index was created by collaboration with Utah State University and UNITE, an organization owned by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s cousin, Tim Shriver. It uses an eight-point scale to “measure the level of contempt or dignity in a selected passage of speech.”
Who, though, gets to decide what constitutes “dignity” or “contempt”?
In a 2022 debate that the Index was used for, Utah Senator Mike Lee scored lower on the Dignity Index than challenger Evan McMullin because he pointed out that McMullin was making statements with a “cavalier, reckless disregard for the truth.” This was after McMullin made several false, unsupported accusations that Lee was involved in a fake electors plot to overthrow the results of the 2020 election. Would lying be acceptable in this debate, then, if it was done “with dignity”?
Freedom of Speech, but not Freedom of Reach
The Dignity Index says they’re just trying to disincentivize the option of using contempt in political discussions (claiming that fear of this is the biggest inhibitor of free speech), so free speech can supposedly flourish. This doesn’t make sense, since their actual objective is to normalize the arbitrary measuring and scoring of all speech, so speech that they deem as having contempt doesn’t even make it into the national political and public sphere.
According to their website, they are “working with developers to create AI tools that journalists can use to score political speech, browser extensions that people can use to keep contempt out of their newsfeeds, and apps that can flag contempt in personal messages before users post them or send them.”
Tools like these actually abridge the right to free speech, and create a path for citizens’ expression to be limited by whoever is in power and sets the rules, like it is in China.
If a progressive regime that believes acknowledging biological facts is akin to violence sets the rules, a low Dignity Index score of 1 could be given to speech that says that there are only two sexes and they’re immutable, and be kept out of the public square.
The Long-Term “Democracy” Agenda of the Dignity.us Policy Council
Not only is it suspicious that the website set up by Biden’s United We Stand Summit, Dignity.us, now goes straight to The Dignity Index, but a closer look into the members of the seemingly bipartisan White House Domestic Policy Council chosen to oversee it reveals they’re not bipartisan at all. Moreover, the several other projects they share with Shriver point to a more insidious long-term agenda besides just weakening free speech laws; an agenda that seeks to use education, election and economic reform to shift America’s system of governance to a Democracy without capitalism or representation under the guise of “civic renewal.”
Three of the Dignity.us members – John Bridgeland, Melody Barnes, and Joseph Grogan – all served on the National Advisory Council of the COVID-Collaborative, co-founded by Timothy Shriver, and CEO John Bridgeland.
Bridgeland has served a major role in all three of Shriver’s non-profit organizations – COVID Collaborative, Collaborative for Academic Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL), and UNITE – which all worked in tandem with each other during the pandemic (see how here) to introduce progressive policies in many states. Utah is just one example (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Map showing how COVID-Collaborative, CASEL, and UNITE work together to promote leftist policies and how The Dignity Index and Governor Cox’s “Disagree Better” campaign in Utah, in partnership with Braver Angels, is also linked to this agenda.
COVID-Collaborative partnered with states to market COVID-19 policies and assist with their implementation. Serving as the Board Chair of CASEL, Shriver used his position of influence on the COVID-Collaborative to introduce CASEL’s Social Emotional Learning programs into Utah’s classrooms as the “solution” for struggling mental health. Many “CASEL Select” programs like Second Step were exposed for using manipulative techniques to indoctrinate students with critical race and queer theory, turning them into social justice activists for causes like Black Lives Matter and LGBTQIA+ advocacy.
Simultaneously, Utah joined CASEL’s Collaborating States Initiative (which included a Community of Practice with Bridgeland’s CIVIC, LLC) that accelerated the state’s adoption of action civics and DEI-laden service-learning programs. Meanwhile, Ranked Choice Voting policies were promoted through Shriver’s organization UNITE, which is part of the aforementioned New Pluralists network.
The fourth and final team member of the Dignity.us team, Cecilia Munoz, was a senior advisor and former vice president of New America, a Soros-funded organization that promotes blockchain-based pilots for Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) .
Having cities adopt or expand RCV pilots appears to be a major thrust of those connected to this faux “Democracy” Movement, which Utah took the bait and fell for.
Ranked Choice Voting – Eliminating America’s Representative Democracy
23 Utah cities ended up adopting ranked choice voting policies, some of which have since been abandoned because of citizen pushback. Why? Voters found it confusing and complicated. In RCV, voters rank candidates on their ballots by preference – first, second, third choice, and so on. Candidates with the fewest first-preference votes get eliminated, and the votes of the voters who picked the eliminated candidate as their first choice get allocated to the rest of the candidates. This procedure continues until one candidate is seen as having majority support, even though they could have overall been voters’ third choice had the other candidates not been eliminated. This convoluted process ends up reducing voter trust in the results, and it also violates the “one person, one vote” principle of American elections.
It’s no surprise that Shriver’s NGO “UNITE” partners with FairVote, the main lobby behind RCV. According to FairVote, their mission is to see that “all elections in the United States are held with ranked choice voting,” and “winner-take-all congressional elections are replaced with proportional representation.”
Proportional representation is a euphemism for imposing majority rule that justifies gerrymandering and the elimination of the Electoral College, in order to achieve “pure democracy.”
Why the Difference Between a “Democracy” and a Representative “Republic” Matters
“In a republic, laws are made by representatives chosen by the people who must comply with a constitution that specifically protects the rights of the minority from the will of the majority.”
If morality is defined by the majority in a Democracy, without the protection of representatives who swear an oath to uphold the Constitution in their governing, then “imposing conformity, control, coercion, and oppression over those who disagree with their definition of equality, fairness, tolerance, or even love” will be deemed as “protecting democracy.” As America witnessed during the pandemic, “protecting democracy” included calling parents who spoke out at school board meetings against the political indoctrination of students domestic terrorists, and calling any information questioning the validity of COVID-19 policies dis/misinformation. Those people’s right to free speech, though they were targeted, was still protected by the 1st amendment, while in a system of “mob rule”, individuals who don’t agree with the Democracy’s version of morality because of their personal beliefs could be considered an extremist that needs to be silenced, or worse, punished.
In a pure democracy, the leftist masses in California and New York would have more voting power in elections, leaving conservatives who live in “fly-over” states (without a representative in the White House) with much less. That’s why it’s crucial that America functions as a Constitutional Republic with a representative democracy where the diverse perspectives and speech of all its states and the constituents within them have a say in the governance of the nation.
The Better Together America Ecosystem – the “they” behind The “Democracy” Movement
Biden may be out of office now, but the “Democracy” Movement and the various people, organizations and funders like the New Pluralists connected to it have regrouped and created a massive network to carry on their work called the Better Together America Ecosystem. Using the very real problem of the need for civil dialogue between the two major political parties, they’ve been successful in fooling conservatives into having deceptive Delphi sessions led by trained facilitators who know how to use group dynamics and crowd agitator techniques to get participants to compromise on divisive political topics. The participants don’t know that these meetings often have a predetermined outcome that ultimately serves a progressive agenda that they’re being steered toward. States who have invited groups that are a part of the Ecosystem in to create local “civic hubs” have seen policies on the 1st amendment and election policy especially (among other issues) move further and further from their Constitutional protections.
Furthermore, all one has to do is look at the reports and listen to the recordings of the back-channel convenings of the groups in the Better Together America Ecosystem to know that the politics and agenda of the organizations and people connected to it are largely left-leaning, and – in some cases – radically so. From the nasty comments about President Trump and their disappointment of the voters who voted for him to their dislike of capitalism and the pronouns listed in parenthesis after their screen names, there is nary anyone representing conservative values in sight in this “pro-democracy movement of movements.”
It’s truly a trap that conservative states should at least be wary of, lest they might find themselves “disagreeing better” into a very different, totalitarian version of America."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/out-of-their-minds-why-the-link-between-mass-shootings-and-anti-depressants-needs-to-be-investigated,Out of Their Minds: Why the Link Between Mass Shootings and Anti-Depressants Needs To Be Investigated,By Raw Egg Nationalist,21 days ago,"Under unnatural conditions and conditions of extreme stress, animals display strange behaviors. This is well known.
Anybody with a keen eye who visits a zoo can see this, especially as they observe the larger animals and the majestic apex predators like lions and tigers in their pathetic little enclosures; but it’s also been the subject of numerous staged experiments by ethologists and biologists, with every kind of animal from monkeys to mice.
In one famous experiment, known as the “mouse utopia” experiment, mice were allowed to breed uncontrollably under conditions of complete lack of want of food and water, without any threats from predators. The only limitation was space. Eventually, when the population reached a certain threshold, the mice suddenly began doing things mice don’t normally do. Like, really weird stuff.
The mice lost all interest in reproduction and a distinct class of mice, dubbed “the Beautiful Ones,” emerged. Freed of any need to do anything purposeful at all, the Beautiful Ones spent their days grooming themselves obsessively, like the murine equivalent of the Kardashian family—although Kim and the rest of the family K do at least take time out from their hair- and skincare routines to have surrogates produce children for them.
A situation like this is sometimes referred to as a “behavioral sink.”
Humans, being animals, are no different. The main issue here is that we can’t, generally, stage experiments to observe human behavior under extreme stress and isolate the variables, causes and effects. Gone are the Wild West days of the Milgram electro-shock experiment and the Stanford Prison Experiment, which had to be cut short because of the savagery it elicited. Neither of those experiments in acute stress would ever pass a university ethics board today—probably for the best.
At the recent Natal Conference in Austin—a broad-church meeting of people, from economists and right-wing bodybuilders like myself to techbros and hardcore Mormons, all of whom are interested in the future of reproduction—I suggested the worldwide collapse in fertility rates may have something to do with the nature of the modern world itself. That it is, to borrow a phrase from my friend Bronze Age Pervert, an “iron prison.”
In his book Bronze Age Mindset, Bronze Age Pervert describes our condition as modern humans through the metaphor of chimps in captivity, which are known to masturbate excessively and even make sex toys from rocks and other objects, in contrast with chimps in a state of nature, which are more concerned with doing the stuff chimps are supposed to do, like swinging from tree to tree and mastering territory in groups. Meaningful stuff.
We don’t want to reproduce because, like the chimp in a cage, we know that we are in captivity, that our lives are not our own and the world is totally out of joint and not as it should be. And so we devolve to a kind of spiritual and literal onanism.
On this reading, the crisis of reproduction is not simply about whether or not we give economic incentives to young couples to get married and have kids like they do in Hungary (which has actually had no significant effect on birth rates), but rather about whether we allow people to live fulfilling lives that are in harmony, not at odds, with their true nature.
Another manifestation of the “iron prison” we live in is, I believe, the mass shooting and, in particular, the school shooting.
Now, I know it’s hardly news that something must have gone terribly wrong, that some awful deviation from nature must have occurred, to make young people bring weapons into school and slaughter their classmates in cold blood. A more obvious statement you could scarcely make. School shootings are anything but normal.
But once you actually get down to it, pinpointing exactly what’s gone wrong and why proves to be difficult and, indeed, a source of enormous contention and anger. It’s a hugely emotive issue, for obvious reasons, but there are also entrenched interests that prevent a proper investigation of the problem, and one of them is the medical industry.
The claim that drugs, and in particular anti-depressants, might be a contributing factor in school shootings has been floated ever since it was revealed that Eric Harris, one of the Columbine killers, was on the powerful anti-depressant Luvox at the time of the massacre. That was reported in The Washington Post, by the way, on 29 April 1999: look it up. It’s not an urban myth or “conspiracy theory” or anything of the sort.
RFK Jr., now Secretary of Health and Human Services, has long maintained there’s a plausible link between anti-depressant use and school shootings, and he’s taken a lot of flak for it. In an interview with Elon Musk in 2023, he said, “Prior to the introduction of Prozac, we had none of these events.” In his confirmation hearings, he maintained that the link “should be studied, along with other possible culprits.” More broadly, he’s criticized overuse of anti-depressants and said they’re dangerous and addictive.
“I know people, including members of my family, who’ve had a much worse time getting off SSRIs [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, one of the main classes of anti-depressant] than people coming off heroin,” Kennedy said, again during his confirmation hearings.
There is plenty of evidence, beyond high-profile incidents like Columbine, linking anti-depressants and violent behavior. Broadly, there’s a well-established link between SSRIs and violence. For example, a massive Swedish study from 2020, taking in over three-quarters of a million people, showed a clear link between SSRI use and violent crime, especially in 15-24 and 25-34 year olds. The risk was elevated even up to 12 weeks after discontinuation of the drugs. The US FDA’s adverse event reporting system (FAERS) shows that SSRIs are consistently associated with violence among adults.
The few studies that look at school shootings and anti-depressant use claim there is no causal link, but in so many specific cases, we simply don’t know whether the shooter was on anti-depressants or not.
That’s why the Tennessee state legislature has just passed Bill HB1349/SB 1146, which will mandate toxicology testing for all mass killers, defined as those who kill more than four people.
The bill, signed into law on Monday, will require a detailed toxicology report to be produced and made available to the public. Investigators will study drug interactions in the killer’s body and also consult with providers of mental-health services to the killer.
Other states are already considering similar legislation, including Wyoming.
“The law isn’t just about Tennessee,” said Sheila Matthews, co-founder of the advocacy group AbleChild, which helped draft the bill.
“It’s a blueprint for dismantling the wall of secrecy protecting industries that profit from ignorance.
“When someone commits mass murder, the public has a right to know if mind-altering drugs played a role.”
The bill faced stiff opposition in the legislature. Rep. James Carter claimed the bill was a distraction from the real cause of mass killings: guns. Sen. Lisa Monroe advanced the absurd claim that postmortem testing would be a violation of the murderer’s rights in death.
Seriously—what!?
The stiffest opposition, especially if RFK Jr. makes good on his promise to lead a national investigation into the link between anti-depressants and mass killings, is likely to come from Big Pharma, of course.
Big Pharma has billions and billions of dollars riding on these drugs, which are prescribed to millions and millions of people across the world, and not just in America.
In Scotland, a full quarter of the adult population—one out of four million people—is now being prescribed anti-depressants. What’s more, a full third of the adults in Scotland are also being prescribed at least one drug from five other types of drug used to treat mental-health problems: benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, so-called “z-drugs” (zopiclone and zolpidem) and opioid-based painkillers.
America isn’t far behind.
Decades after the serotonin theory of depression was put forward as the basis for the new SSRI drugs, there’s still no compelling evidence that the theory is actually true. Many studies have shown that anti-depressants are barely more effective than placebo. The improvement is so small, many researchers claim it doesn’t even exist. Access to these minimal benefits is also unevenly distributed. A large-scale meta-analysis in the British Medical Journal, which looked at data from 242 studies dating back to 1979, showed that just 15% of users experienced a benefit they wouldn’t have derived from placebo. Those who should benefit the most from anti-depressant use—sufferers of severe depression, including comorbid anxiety and suicidal ideation—actually benefit the least.
The blanket prescription of anti-depressants is not working and it won’t work: that much should be obvious by now. Anti-depressants mask the real causes of mental anguish and depression, and they don’t even do a good job of that. If they’re also contributing to mass killings, they’re making that anguish far, far worse. The public deserves to know the truth, whatever the cost to Big Pharma and its shareholders."

BRICS Summit Approaches As Trade War Simmers,By Brandon Smith | Alt-Market.us,21 days ago,"For many years now I have been talking about the growing global economic divide between East and West. This volatile opposition between the BRICS nations and the US is not a product of the Trump era. It has been decades in the making with a myriad of complex working parts and numerous US trading partners have been preparing for the fallout as far back as 2008.
At the same time behind the scenes there have been malicious influences at play: Special interests within the Davos community have been working diligently to undermine the US economy and the dollar. But what is the ultimate aim of this agenda?
In 2018 I published an article titled ‘World War III Will Be An Economic War’ – In it I outlined the basic mechanics of the East vs West paradigm and how banking institutions like the IMF and BIS were positioning to take advantage of the chaos. At the time, the “trade war” witnessed a kind of false start, but all the pieces were there for what we are seeing today. Don’t let the 90 day pauses on some tariffs fool you, economic decoupling is going to be the dominant theme of the decade and the tariffs will undoubtedly spring up over and over again.
Trump’s incredible return to the White House sets the stage for the end of globalism (and that’s a good thing), but I want to make it clear that the pitfalls are numerous and the establishment could try to use the end of the old world order to bring in their “new world order”.
In 2018 I noted:
“The bottom line is this: Russia and China are in full support of globalist controlled institutions like the Bank for International Settlements (the central bank of central banks) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The governments of both nations have called for the IMF to assert their Special Drawing Rights basket currency framework as a foundation for a new world reserve currency system. Again, both Russia and China want the IMF, a globalist controlled entity, to become the de facto ruler of a new global monetary structure…”
“With the rise of simple to generate cryptocurrencies and the easily tracked blockchain exchange mechanism, globalists now have the perfect liquidity tool for replacing the dollar as world reserve. All they need now is a crisis event to provide cover for the transition…”
“…It would appear that a crisis event is now being triggered in the form of an international trade war. This trade war, in my view, is designed to become so widespread that it will one day be considered a “world war.”
As I’ve mentioned many times, the dollar’s world reserve status, instituted with the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944, has long been America’s Achilles Heel.
The US technically enjoys an enviable trade advantage as well as a monetary stimulus advantage because the dollar is used in the majority of international transactions. This means the Federal Reserve can print dollars with wild abandon and most of them will be absorbed overseas by foreign banks, governments and corporations. In this way, the dollar is already a kind of beta test for a one world currency.
However, the Bretton Woods Agreement came with a series of caveats, some of them unspoken. For the “privilege” of controlling the reserve currency, the US is expected to financially backstop allies as well as provide the vast majority of military support for NATO. The revelations behind the DOGE audits alone show an endless flood of dollars from American taxpayer funds into a vast array of subsidies for foreign governments. Americans has been paying for everyone and everything.
You know those supposedly amazing social welfare and healthcare programs in Europe? Yeah, we make that possible through billions in foreign aid to the those countries along with hundreds of billions spent on defense so that Europeans can sleep easy at night.
The situation is even worse when we consider how many trillions of dollars were created from thin air by the Federal Rserve and transferred overseas after the crash of 2008. Not to mention the trillions poured into foreign economies during the pandemic. In the meantime, relentless money creation is finally catching up to us in the form of a stagflation crisis. The dollar system, as we know it, is precariously unstable and more stimulus is not going to save it.
It’s not surprising the US has been hit with an inflationary freight train. We haven’t just been printing dollars for ourselves, we’ve been printing dollars for the entire planet.
The old world agreements are ending, and in many ways this is necessary. European leaders are going full authoritarian; they now throw people in prison daily for online speech and they are also throwing their right-leaning political opponents in prison to prevent them from participating in elections. Europe is no longer our ally and the US public is starting to realize it.
Outsourced production in Asia, the foundation of the current global supply chain, is in need of reform. Because of our reserve status America has become the world’s cash cow. We have been relegated to the position of dutiful consumer nation, spending our increasingly devalued dollars in a spiraling cycle of inflationary decline while we produce very little on our own soil.
Donald Trump’s tariff actions, which I suspect will be cumulative over the next few years, are an expression of America’s desire to end the globalist status quo and bring back balance. That said, the rhetoric from the rest of the world and the media is that these tariffs constitute an “act of war”.
As I predicted years ago, the US is not allowed to stray from the Bretton Woods system without being painted as an “aggressor” nation bent on destroying our neighbors. Keep in mind, most of the countries affected by Trump’s tariffs have had their own tariffs on American goods for decades. When they do it, it’s normal. When we do it, it’s a betrayal.
Enter the BRICS; this international trade body is currently headed by Brazil and includes China, Russia, India, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates among others. The running theory for many alternative economists is that the BRICS will eventually move to fully decouple from the US dollar and introduce their own shared currency system.
I have posited a similar theory, though I argue that the situation is not as simple as some analysts think. This is not just an East vs West division leading to a break in the dollar structure; there is a lot more going on.
Ten years ago the BRICS were in a much better position economically and that would have been the time to introduce a competing monetary framework. Today, Russia is in the midst of a proxy war with NATO in Ukraine, China is on the edge of deflationary collapse and South Africa is on the edge of social collapse. There’s not a single BRICS member beyond oil producers like Saudi Arabia that is not facing extreme fiscal turmoil. In other words, the BRICS do not currently have the ability to counter the dollar.
That said, I don’t think this was ever the plan. Rather, globalist institutions like the IMF, BIS and World Bank have been preparing for the rollout of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) along with a single IMF controlled global digital currency attached to the SDR basket. The BRICS cannot compete with the dollar, unless the IMF and BIS help them to do so.
As IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva admitted in 2023:
“CBDCs should not be fragmented national propositions… To have more efficient and fairer transactions we need systems that connect countries: we need interoperability…For this reason at the IMF, we are working on the concept of a global CBDC platform.”
Such program could only be accomplished after serious economic turmoil has made the populations of all nations desperate for a centralized solution. The upcoming BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro, slated for July, should be watched carefully because it is timed almost exactly in line with the end of Trump’s 90 day tariff pause. The summit is expected to address the trade war in depth as well as the subject of “de-dollerization”. Trump has previously threatened a 150% tariff on any country that makes an attempt to de-dollerize.
While speaking at the BRICS Summit in 2024, held at Kazan (Russia), Russian President Vladimir Putin said:
“The dollar is being used as a weapon. We really see that this is so. I think that this is a big mistake by those who do this”.
This was the same summit where Putin shared a mock up of a “BRICS dollar” and spoke about the adaptation of a BRICS currency. Of course, Russia is in no position to field a new reserve currency and neither is China, but I believe this talk is a precursor to a larger international push for a new reserve system managed by the IMF.
The BRICS intend to court the Mexican government at the July 2025 summit in Rio de Jeneiro and there is also talk of European nations increasing trade with China as a way to frustrate Trump’s tariff efforts. But again, China’s economy is currently flirting with deflationary disaster and there’s not a single nation or group of nations that will be able to fill the void in consumer markets left behind by the US.
Even though a Chinese-based solution is unlikely, the behavior of the BRICS indicates that there is some kind of plan afoot. China and India have been stockpiling massive gold reserves and this may be in preparation for a break from the dollar, with gold skyrocketing as the dollar falls. The ongoing shift into crypto and CBDCs is also, I believe, an attempt to create a cushion for de-dollerization.
Just remember that none of this is possible without globalist organizations facilitating the spread of the technology. The BIS has been particularly active the past 5 years in testing cross-border CBDC swaps and secure CBDC transactions. The BRICS would be nothing more than a vehicle for the proliferation of a globalist CBDC reset.
Does this mean that the US and Trump are falling into a trap? Do tariffs make it easier to justify an international shift way from the dollar? Is Trump making things easier for the globalists? I argue that this reset is going to be attempted regardless; Trump and conservatives are going to be blamed regardless. Americans will blame the BRICS and Europe – The BRICS and Europe will blame America.
It should also be noted that the middle class and poverty stricken citizens of China and Europe largely HATE their governments. The elites have abused them beyond all measure and what little freedoms they have left are being erased. Most of these people are on the side of anti-globalism. This war is not everyone in the world against the US, though the corporate media would have you believe this is the case.
Tariffs are a way for the US to disrupt the forced interdependency of globalism, but there’s going to be pain involved as things change. In other words, tariffs are necessary. The end of globalism is necessary. America needs to stop relying on the dollar’s reserve status and the global supply chain. But we should be wary of what kind of system ends up replacing the Bretton Woods structure. Meaning, we may have to use any means at our disposal to stop a new global monetary scheme before it can take hold."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/mark-carney-vows-canadian-internet-speech-crackdown-if-elected-citing-online-pollution-of-misogyny-conspiracies,"Mark Carney Vows Canadian Internet Speech Crackdown if Elected, Citing Online “Pollution” of Misogyny, Conspiracies",By Christina Maas | Reclaim The Net,21 days ago,"It was supposed to be a routine campaign pit stop, the kind of low-stakes political affair where candidates smile like used car salesmen and dish out platitudes thicker than Ontario maple syrup. Instead, Mark Carney found himself dodging verbal bricks in a Hamilton hall, facing hecklers who lobbed Jeffrey Epstein references like Molotovs. No rebuttal, no denial. Just a pivot worthy of an Olympic gymnast, straight to the perils of digital discourse.
“There are many serious issues that we’re dealing with,” he said, ignoring the criticism that had just lobbed his way. “One of them is the sea of misogyny, antisemitism, hatred, and conspiracy theories — this sort of pollution online that washes over our virtual borders from the United States.”
Ah yes, the dreaded digital tide. Forget inflation or the fact that owning a home now requires a GoFundMe. According to Carney, the real catastrophe is memes from Buffalo.
Carney’s new plan to battle the internet; whatever it may be, because details are apparently for peasants, would revive a long-dead Liberal Party obsession: regulating online speech in a country that still pretends to value free expression.
It’s an effort so cursed, it’s been killed more times than Jason Voorhees. First, there was Bill C-36, which flopped in 2021. Then came its undead cousin, Bill C-63, awkwardly titled the Online Harms Act, which proposed giving the Canadian Human Rights Commission the power to act as digital inquisitors, sniffing out content that “foments detestation or vilification.”
Naturally, it died too, not from public support, but because Parliament decided it had better things to do, like not passing it in time.
But as every horror franchise teaches us, the villain never stays away for long. Carney’s speech didn’t include specifics, which is usually code for “we’ll make it up later,” but the intent is clear: the Liberals are once again oiling up the guillotine of speech regulation, ready to let it fall on anything remotely edgy, impolite, or, God forbid, unpopular.
“The more serious thing is when it affects how people behave — when Canadians are threatened going to their community centers or their places of worship or their school or, God forbid, when it affects our children,” Carney warned, pulling the emergency brake on the national sympathy train. It’s the same tired tactic every aspiring control freak uses, wrap the pitch in the soft fuzz of public safety and pray nobody notices the jackboot behind the curtain.
Nothing stirs the legislative loins like invoking the children. But vague terror about online contagion infecting impressionable minds has become the go-to excuse for internet crackdowns across the Western world. Canada’s Liberals are no different. They just dress it up and pretend it’s for your own good.
Former Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge, doing her best impression of a benevolent censor, also piped up earlier this year with a classic verbal pretzel: “We need to make sure [freedom of expression] exists and that it’s protected. Yet the same freedom of expression is currently being exploited and undermined.”
Protecting free speech by regulating it is the sort of logic that keeps satire writers out of work.
St-Onge’s lament about algorithms monetizing debate sounds suspiciously like a pitch from someone who can’t get a word in on X. It’s the familiar cry of technocrats and bureaucrats who can’t fathom a world where regular people might say things that aren’t government-approved. “Respect is lacking in public discourse,” she whined on February 20. She’s right. People are tired of pretending to respect politicians who think governing a country means babysitting the internet."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/hassett-us-negotiating-new-trade-terms-with-130-countries-keeping-the-pressure-on-china,"Hassett: US Negotiating New Trade Terms with 130 Countries, Keeping the Pressure on China",By Raw Egg Nationalist,21 days ago,"The Trump administration is negotiating new trade terms with 130 countries as a result of the President’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which were recently paused for 90 days—except for the tariffs against China.
National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the “reciprocal” tariffs are a way to bring trade partners to the table, dismissing the idea the tariffs were implemented on a “capricious whim.”
“The whole point of the trade policy is to address the national emergency that we’re too dependent on foreign products in the U.S., especially if we were at a time of conflict and we’re doing something about that,” Hassett said.
“The reciprocal act was basically, guys, if you come to the table and negotiate us with us and treat us the same way we treat you, then we’ll you’ll get your rate really low. And so right now 130 countries, 130 countries have responded, and we’re negotiating with them. And they’ve got their rate down to 10%.
Hassett went on to describe how the tariffs have created a “two-world system,” where smaller trade partners negotiate with the US and tariffs are lowered on the one hand, and where a longer term strategy to counter China’s economic power begins to be implemented.
“There’s a process about China that’s very, very nascent, if at all, and then the process for everybody else,” Hassett said.
“So the process for everybody else is orderly. It’s clear, people are coming to town with great, great offers.”
In response to President Trump’s imposition of “reciprocal” tariffs that began on 2 April, China has halted all exports of a range of rare-earth minerals, threatening the supply of key components necessary to the manufacture of cars, planes, electronic goods and military equipment.
Two days after President’s Trump’s announcement, the Chinese government ordered restrictions on the export of six rare-earth metals that are refined entirely in China and rare-earth magnets, 90% of which are produced in China. These metals and magnets can now only be shipped out of China with special export licences.
Exports are being blocked not only to the US, but to all other countries.
As The New York Times notes, “Rare earth magnets make up a tiny share of China’s overall exports to the United States and elsewhere. So halting shipments causes minimal economic pain in China while holding the potential for big effects in the United States and elsewhere.”
China has yet to fully implement the licensing system, meaning it could take months or longer for exporters to be able to gain a licence and current supplies of the metals and magnets outside China could run dangerously low.
The size of emergency stockpiles of these items varies significantly, so production disruptions are hard to predict.
President Trump made the imposition of tariffs a certain plank of his economic policy during the election. Since his inauguration in January, he has levied special tariffs on Mexico and Canada for their role in the US fentanyl and immigration crises, and in recent weeks he announced a new round of “reciprocal” tariffs on many of the US’s larger and smaller trading partners.
President Trump raised his tariff against China to 125%, while pausing his increased reciprocal tariffs against other countries for 90 days.
“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” Trump said on Truth Social.
“At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/commission-considers-handing-billions-to-global-ngos,Commission Considers Handing Billions to Global NGOs,By Michael Curzon | The European Conservative,21 days ago,"The campaign to give billions of euros in public money to globalist NGOs—which exist to subvert national democracy, and which previously received U.S. funding until Donald Trump cut back USAID—is continuing apace.
Last week, the Polish EU Council presidency, headed by prime minister Donald Tusk, spoke to many EU diplomats at an event in Brussels, warning that the European Commission needs to make up for the lost USAID money before friendly NGOs and media groups are forced to cease operations.
Dutch law professor John Morijn is also quoted in Politico on Monday, saying that as part of Brussels’ ‘ReArm Europe’ plans, “to earmark 1-2% on defending democracy should be doable.” That presumably means up to €16 billion is being proposed for NGO funding, given Ursula von der Leyen has said she wants to mobilise around €800 billion for defence.
Elsewhere, Morijn urged member states to “ask the Commission to assess the USAID-withdrawal caused gap in NGO democracy funding.” Global strategist Christy Quirk added that the “clock is ticking.”
Hungarian lawmakers are among those hoping the clock carries on ticking. János Bóka, Budapest’s minister for EU affairs, late last month told the Commission’s new rule-of-law tsar, Michael McGrath, that Brussels “should only deal with matters within its competence,” adding:
Transparent financing of NGOs should be fully ensured—the European Commission should not fill in the gap left by USAID.
Slovakia has also taken a hard line on the role of NGOs in national politics, prompting liberal critics to attack lawmakers for alleged “Putin-style legislation.”
Meanwhile, MCC Brussels has already revealed that the EU has given money to NGOs to help spread the Commission’s political agenda across Europe.
Now, the Polish presidency hopes that its recent campaigning in Brussels will result in the conclusions of the next European Council gathering containing language on “defending democracy” with taxpayer money."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/lawmakers-urge-trump-to-scrap-data-deal-after-uk-tried-to-backdoor-apples-icloud,Lawmakers Urge Trump to Scrap Data Deal After UK Tried To Backdoor Apple’s iCloud,By Dan Frieth | Reclaim The Net,21 days ago,"Two Republican lawmakers have called on the Trump administration to terminate the existing data-sharing arrangement with the United Kingdom, citing serious concerns about digital privacy following a controversial move by British authorities targeting Apple and attempting to secretly create a worldwide backdoor to iCloud.
Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Andy Biggs of Arizona sent a letter on Tuesday to Attorney General Pam Bondi, urging the Department of Justice to dismantle the agreement forged under the CLOUD Act. The lawmakers argued that the US should pursue a renegotiated framework that better safeguards Americans from unwarranted access by foreign governments.
The CLOUD Act, or Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data, was designed to streamline data access across borders while allegedly protecting the privacy rights of citizens. The recent developments have raised questions about whether the spirit of that legislation is being undermined.
Under the current pact, which has been active since 2019 and was extended last year, US companies like Apple are compelled to comply with British data requests during criminal probes. However, the agreement explicitly excludes any surveillance of US citizens.
The lawmakers’ concerns intensified following a Washington Post report in February that revealed a UK mandate compelling Apple to create a mechanism allowing access to encrypted content stored by users globally. Apple’s Advanced Data Protection feature, which provides end-to-end encryption, was disabled for UK users shortly afterward. The company is now appealing the British directive.
According to the letter Jordan and Biggs stated that the deal should be “renegotiated to adequately protect American citizens from foreign government surveillance.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/florida-universities-to-deputize-campus-police-to-carry-out-immigration-enforcement,Florida Universities To Deputize Campus Police To Carry Out Immigration Enforcement,By Raw Egg Nationalist,21 days ago,"At least three public universities in Florida are looking to deputize campus police forces to allow them to carry out immigration enforcement.
The New York Post reports that schools in Florida are looking to employ this new approach in line with Governor Ron DeSantis’s requirement for local and state agencies to support federal immigration enforcement as much as possible.
Federal officials across the US have revoked visas from international students for a variety of reasons in recent weeks, from accusations of domestic terrorism to speeding tickets.
At present, Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, the University of Florida in Gainesville and the University of South Florida in Tampa are looking to deputize campus police to aid with immigration enforcement.
“We are simply following guidance from the Governor’s Feb. 19 directive to state law enforcement agencies, of which FAUPD and other state university police departments are included,” a representative of Florida Atlantic University said in a statement.
ICE recently began the 287(g) Program, which allows local agencies to enter into agreements with the federal government to perform “specific immigration officer functions.” So far, no universities have entered into such an agreement with ICE.
The program offers three different models for cooperation with ICE, including a “task-force” model that allows participating officers to interrogate “any alien or person believed to be an alien” about their right to remain in the country. The model also allows them to make arrests without warrants in certain cases.
A minimum of one million deportations is the goal for the Trump administration in 2025, according to government officials who spoke to The Washington Post.
“That’s their goal,” a former government official said.
“They say it jokingly: ‘We’ve got to get a million removals.’”
The Trump administration has been negotiating with as many as 30 different countries to get them to take deportees who are not their citizens. These include Mexico and Costa Rica.
Deals have already been signed with El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama.
More than 100,000 migrants have already been deported, and large numbers have also self-deported before authorities could apprehend them.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/eu-doge-patriots-propose-anti-corruption-body-in-eu-parliament,EU ‘DOGE’? Patriots Propose Anti-Corruption Body in EU Parliament,By Tamás Orbán | The European Conservative,21 days ago,"The Patriots for Europe (PfE) group has officially requested the creation of an inquiry committee in the European Parliament to provide democratically elected oversight of corruption and other abuses of power within the EU institutions; and to try to rectify the systemic failures during its limited, one-year mandate.
The need for such an inquiry has become evident given the NGO-financing scandals and high-level corruption networks that have been unmasked since the last term, as well as the EU Court of Auditors’ (ECA) recent ruling that Brussels has been severely violating its own transparency standards for years, which make accountability within existing structures “practically impossible.”
According to the six-page document sent to MEPs from all political groups for support and obtained by europeanconservative.com, members of the proposed Committee of Inquiry on Transparency and Accountability (TRAC)—practically an EU ‘DOGE’ in all but name—would be tasked to investigate allegations of
corruption, money laundering, abuse of power, undue interference in the legislative process, and other breaches of transparency and accountability standards and the rule of law by [MEPS] and officials of EU institutions.
Furthermore, the document lists several key areas of alleged violation of EU laws that the TRAC committee would particularly focus on, including:
Moreover, the committee of inquiry would also investigate the lack of transparency and independence of EU decision-making processes, as well as the institutions’ failure to comply with their own accountability standards within the Code of Conduct, as established recently by the EU auditors. As we reported, the Patriots submitted over 80 freedom of information requests for EU-funded NGO contracts, and were denied in every case—all the more reason for the ‘EU DOGE’ to be finally set up.
TRAC would also analyze the frequently observed “revolving doors” between EU institutions and corporate lobby organizations; conduct probes into the impact of these actions on public finances and the EU budget; as well as recommend specific solutions and new legislation to prevent future abuse.
The committee would have the right to summon witnesses (including current and former EU officials), request and review classified documents, cooperate with national and international law enforcement agencies, and conduct hearings and fact-finding missions when necessary.
According to the document, TRAC would be a temporary committee and operate within a limited, 12-month mandate, which could be extended if necessary. Any recommendation made by the body would be referred to the relevant permanent committee for further action, and TRAC would also submit a final report to the plenary at the end of its mandate to suggest broader legislative changes.
The Patriots also suggest that TRAC should comprise 38 members—slightly smaller than the average 45-member parliamentary committee—with the seats divided proportionally between the political groups.
This would mean that von der Leyen’s EPP would have 10 seats, the socialist S&D 7, the Patriots 5, the conservative ECR and the liberal Renew 4 each, the Greens 3, the Left 2, and the sovereigntist ESN 1, leaving two seats for non-attached members.
In other words, even if the ‘Ursula coalition’s’ mainstream majority will allow the creation of the inquiry committee, right-wing MEPs would be outnumbered by at least 26 to 10—unless some EPP members lend their support for a genuine effort to uncover corruption, as they did in case of the ‘Timmermansgate’ with regards the Green Deal, albeit unsuccessfully.
But let’s not be naïve. With the members of the mainstream parties being the prime suspects of the largest corruption scandals—like the EPP’s Huaweigate and the S&D’s Qatargate, not to mention von der Leyen’s missing Pfizer messages—it’s unlikely that they would even allow TRAC to become a reality.
They will likely argue that the EU already has specialized bodies to deal with these offenses, such as the anti-fraud agency OLAF and the European public prosecutor EPPO, even though they are run by unelected bureaucrats and have been shown time and time again to be just as politically biasedas the institutions they are meant to oversee.
Nonetheless, the proposal already puts the EU elite in a tough spot. Those with nothing to hide have no reason to vote down a chance for democratic oversight. If they do, it will be the perfect smoking gun for all Europeans to see."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-deports-more-gang-members-to-el-salvador,US Deports More Gang Members to El Salvador,By Raw Egg Nationalist,21 days ago,"More gang members have been deported to El Salvador, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
On Sunday, Secretary Rubio said that a further ten gang members have been deported to the Latin American nation, which has an agreement with the US to house hundreds of foreign gang members in its notorious CECOT mega-prison.
Hundreds of Venezuelans suspected to be members of the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gangs have already been deported to El Salvador using the powers of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to expedite their removal.
“Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador,” Rubio said in an X post.
Rubio went on to praise El Salvador and its president Nayib Bukele, saying that the alliance “has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere.”
President Bukele is due to visit the White House today.
President Trump has praised him for accepting “alien enemies” from the US, and said the two countries are working together “to eradicate terrorist organizations.”
The deportations under the Alien Enemies Act have been subject to legal challenges, including a stay order issued by Obama-appointee James Boasberg.
In recent weeks, there has been a particular focus on the fate of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who it is claimed was wrongly deported to El Salvador. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered him to be returned to the US, and the Trump administration’s attempt to overturn her ruling was rejected by the Supreme Court on Thursday.
In a new court filing on Sunday, a US immigration official said the order barring Abrego Garcia’s removal to El Salvador was no longer valid “because of his membership in MS-13 which is now a designated foreign terrorist organization.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-officials-aiming-for-minimum-1-million-deportations-this-year,Trump Officials Aiming for Minimum 1 Million Deportations This Year,By Raw Egg Nationalist,21 days ago,"A minimum of one million deportations is the goal for the Trump administration in 2025, according to government officials who spoke to The Washington Post.
“That’s their goal,” a former government official said.
“They say it jokingly: ‘We’ve got to get a million removals.’”
The Trump administration has been negotiating with as many as 30 different countries to get them to take deportees who are not their citizens. These include Mexico and Costa Rica.
Deals have already been signed with El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama.
More than 100,000 migrants have already been deported, and large numbers have also self-deported before authorities could apprehend them.
During his election campaign, President Trump promised “the largest mass deportation operation in American history.” He suggested at least 20 million people are in the US illegally and must be deported.
Since taking office in January, President Trump has following a multi-pronged approach to tackling the immigration crisis, which has included ending birthright citizenship, raids targeting the most dangerous illegals known to authorities already, and deals with other countries to house illegals deported from the US.
Members of the vicious gangs Tren de Aragua and MS-13 have been flown to El Salvador, to be housed in the notorious CECOT prison constructed specially to house the Latin American nation’s own home-grown gangbangers.
Securing the nation’s southern border has also been a particular focus of Trump’s new immigration policies.
Last week, the military was authorized to take jurisdiction over federal land on the US-Mexico border, to secure it against illegal immigration and drug smuggling.
In a new memorandum, the Secretaries of Defense, the Interior, Agriculture, and Homeland Security are ordered to  help transfer the public lands in question to the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.
These lands include the Roosevelt Reservation, a 60-foot strip of land that runs across three states (California, Arizona and New Mexico). It was established by President Thedore Roosevelt in 1907 to keep all public lands along the border in those states “free from obstruction as a protection against the smuggling of goods between the United States and Mexico.” Texas was excluded from the Reservation because the state retained all public lands upon its annexation and admission to the Union.
Border crossings have already been radically reduced under President Donald Trump, reaching a monthly level that’s lower than the number who entered on a single day at the height of the Biden border crisis in 2023.
President Trump took to his social-media platform Truth Social to hail the news.
“The month of February, my first full month in Office, had the LOWEST number of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter our Country in History – BY FAR! There were only 8,326 apprehensions of Illegals by Border Patrol at the U.S. – Mexico Border, all of whom were quickly ejected from our Nation or, when necessary, prosecuted for crimes against the United States of America
“This means that very few people came – The Invasion of our Country is OVER. In comparison, under Joe Biden, there were 300,000 Illegals crossing in one month, and virtually ALL of them were released into our Country. Thanks to the Trump Administration Policies, the Border is CLOSED to all Illegal Immigrants. Anyone who tries to illegally enter the U.S.A. will face significant criminal penalties and immediate deportation.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/tennessee-passes-law-requiring-bodies-of-mass-shooters-to-be-tested-for-mind-altering-drugs,Tennessee Passes Law Requiring Bodies of Mass Shooters To Be Tested for Mind-altering Drugs,By Raw Egg Nationalist,21 days ago,"Tennessee has passed a law requiring the bodies of suspected mass shooters to undergo a full toxicology screen including tests for psychotropic drugs.
Bill HB 1349/SB 1146 was drafted in conjunction with AbleChild, a nonprofit organization advocating for informed medical consent and the right to refuse psychiatric products and treatments, and Amy Miller, who headed RFK Jr.’s Reform Pharma Initiative.
The bill, which was signed into law on Thursday, requires toxicology testing for individuals who kill four or more people. This will include consultation with providers of mental-health services to the killer. Interactions between drugs in the killer’s system will also be studied, and public disclosure of toxicology results will be allowed upon request.
“This law isn’t just about Tennessee—it’s a blueprint for dismantling the wall of secrecy protecting industries that profit from ignorance,” said Sheila Matthews, AbleChild co-founder.
“When someone commits mass murder, the public has a right to know if mind-altering drugs played a role.”
The bill faced stiff opposition in the legislature. Rep. James Carter argued the bill was a distraction from the real cause of mass shootings: guns. Sen. Lisa Monroe said posthumous drug-testing represented a violation of a murderer’s rights in death.
Despite the opposition, the bill passed 76-20 in the House and 27-5 in the Senate.
States including Wyoming are already considering similar legislation.
The role of psychotropic drugs in mass shootings is a subject of intense, often angry, debate. Some studies have shown a clear link between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and violence, for example, others have claimed no causal link between events like school shootings and psycotropic medication.
It was revealed that would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, who tried to kill President Trump in July of 2024, was suffering from depression and may have been taking anti-depressants at the time of the shooting.
Audrey Hale underwent long-term treatment for mental-health issues at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center before killing multiple children at the Covenant School in Nashville."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/china-halts-export-of-key-rare-earth-metals-as-tariff-war-intensifies,China Halts Export of Key Rare Earth Metals as Tariff War Intensifies,By Raw Egg Nationalist,21 days ago,"China has halted all exports of a range of rare-earth minerals, threatening the supply of key components necessary to the manufacture of cars, planes, electronic goods and military equipment.
The move is part of China’s response to President Trump’s imposition of “reciprocal” tariffs that began on 2 April.
Two days later, the Chinese government ordered restrictions on the export of six rare-earth metals that are refined entirely in China and rare-earth magnets, 90% of which are produced in China. These metals and magnets can now only be shipped out of China with special export licences.
Exports are being blocked not only to the US, but to all other countries.
As The New York Times notes, “Rare earth magnets make up a tiny share of China’s overall exports to the United States and elsewhere. So halting shipments causes minimal economic pain in China while holding the potential for big effects in the United States and elsewhere.”
China has yet to fully implement the licensing system, meaning it could take months or longer for exporters to be able to gain a licence and current supplies of the metals and magnets outside China could run dangerously low.
The size of emergency stockpiles of these items varies significantly, so production disruptions are hard to predict.
Michael Silver, chairman and chief executive of American Elements, a chemical supplier based in Los Angeles, said he had been told it would take 45 days before export licenses could be issued and exports would resume. He said his company increased its inventory last winter in anticipation of a trade war between the United States and China, and could meet its existing contracts while waiting for export approval.
China’s Ministry of Commerce has also added also barred Chinese companies from dealing with an increasing number of American companies, especially military contractors.
President Trump made the imposition of tariffs a certain plank of his economic policy during the election. Since his inauguration in January, he has levied special tariffs on Mexico and Canada for their role in the US fentanyl and immigration crises, and in recent weeks he announced a new round of “reciprocal” tariffs on many of the US’s larger and smaller trading partners.
President Trump raised his tariff against China to 125%, while pausing his increased reciprocal tariffs against other countries for 90 days.
“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” Trump said on Truth Social.
“At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”
As many as 75 nations have already expressed a desire to renegotiate trade terms with the US."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-envoy-in-first-direct-constructive-contact-with-iran-after-laying-down-red-line-2,"Trump Envoy In First ‘Direct, Constructive’ Contact With Iran After Laying Down Red Line",By ZeroHedge,22 days ago,"Not very much happened at the much-anticipated ‘indirect’ meeting between Iranian and US delegations in Oman on Saturday. While Tehran has been emphasizing the indirect nature of the dialogue, President Trump and his top officials have been calling these ‘direct’ talks.
The main ‘positive’ is that the two sides didn’t yell each other out the room, or make new accusations – instead they agreed to keep the diplomatic engagement going.
“Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations next week over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to the White House,” The Associated Press reports as the meeting wrapped up.
As for whether they were ‘direct’ or not, Iranian state did say that Trump regional onvoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “briefly spoke in the presence of the Omani foreign minister” at the end of the talks.
This does indeed mark the first direct interaction between the Islamic Republic and the Trump administration. It is Trump during his first term who pulled the US out of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear deal (in April 2018).
The Iranian side has announced  that the next round of talks will take place April 19, in a clear sing that both sides could be ready to do a new deal. This is precisely what Trump has demanded – the inking of a new nuclear deal – while threatening military action against Tehran. Trump has also warned that Israel might ‘lead’ such strikes on nuclear facilities.
According to more details from Muscat, Oman on Saturday:
American officials did not immediately acknowledge the Iranian reports, which Tehran likely speeded out to its public ahead of a possible Trump post on a social media. But declaring that the two sides spoke face-to-face — even if briefly — suggests the negotiations went well.
The talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local. The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location in the outskirts of Oman, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff returned to Muscat, the capital of Oman, before disappearing into traffic around a neighborhood that is home to the U.S. Embassy.
Baghaei in follow-up stated that “The objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very clear — we have only one goal, and that is to safeguard Iran’s national interests.”
“We are giving a genuine and honest opportunity to diplomacy, so that through dialogue, we can move forward on the nuclear issue on one hand, and more importantly for us, the lifting of sanctions,” he added. No one is in the mood for war (though perhaps Israel?).
The US president Donald Trump is expected to achieve today what no other president has ever achieved since July 1776: Prevent Iran from having nuclear weapon, a decision that has never been taken by Iran before.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Arachgi headed to Oman today.
“Look, this is just a beginning. So it is natural that, at this stage, both sides will present their foundational positions through the Omani mediator,” Baghaei continued. “Therefore, we do not expect this round of negotiations to be lengthy.”
Witkoff had previewed to The Wall Street Journal just ahead of the trip, “I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today.”
He added: “Where our red line will be, there can’t be weaponization of your nuclear capability.” However Iran has maintained all along that its program is only for peaceful nuclear energy to meet the nation’s power needs, and further several Ayatollah’s have declared nuclear weapons to be ‘unIslamic’."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/audit-cuomo-spent-453-million-on-nearly-250000-medical-devices-for-covid-state-used-only-3,"Audit: Cuomo Spent $453 Million on Nearly 250,000 Medical Devices for COVID – State Used Only 3",By Zero Hedge,22 days ago,"Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s handling of the Covid crisis wasn’t just a health catastrophe, but a financial one too, according to a damning new audit report released Friday.
The state government poured $453 million into building an enormous stockpile of medical equipment — and only used 0.000012% of it.
According to state comptroller Tom DiNapoli, New York bought a staggering 247,343 medical devices, but only wound up using a laughable three pieces of equipment out of the vast horde. Worse, the waste was only compounded by the state’s utter neglect of its fiduciary duties to taxpayers. Rather than finding buyers for the once-valuable assets, bureaucrats have been content to let the equipment age and decay in warehouses. As if the erosion of the stockpiles weren’t bad enough, New York is also wasting money on storage costs.
“New York state bought hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of medical equipment at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, including ventilators and x-ray machines, that now sits unused in storage facilities across the state, missing recommended maintenance and costing taxpayers storage expenses,” said Napoli’s office. Of the equipment that requires ongoing maintenance, auditors found that 90% of it is past due, with no process or contract in place to handle that need. Failure to keep up with maintenance risks voiding manufacturer warranties, and also rendering the equipment unusable in an emergency.
“It was completely understandable that we did a lot of panic buying in the moment. But then to throw all this stuff in a warehouse and neglect and ignore it — it’s compounding the mistake,” Bill Hammond of the Empire Center think tank told Politico. Four years ago, the Department of Health created a “Medical Stockpile Steering Committee” to determine how much of the equipment should be retained. The group said 51,140, but there was no plan for the other 200,000 devices. The DOH couldn’t produce any documentation about how the committee reached its conclusions.
Heading into the pandemic, the state had 4,800 pieces of equipment on standby, but now has a quarter million items five years after Covid-19 entered the country. The inventory includes CPAP/BiPAP machines, ventilators, oxygen tanks, pulse oximeters, oxygen concentrators and infusion pumps In addition to the money wasted on the equipment itself, Cuomo’s administration also paid McKinsey & Company consultants more than $5 million to advise them how much stuff to buy.
In the understatement of the year, Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi told the New York Post that McKinsey overestimated the need. “You can Monday-morning quarterback now, but then we were looking to save lives and doing nothing wasn’t an option.” Alas, Cuomo’s record on “saving lives” is arguably worse than the emerging picture of his financial mismanagement of the pandemic. His administration was widely condemned for ordering nursing homes to accept Covid-positive patients who were discharging from hospitals, then accused of deliberately understating the number of long-term-care-resident deaths that followed.
The faultfinding report comes just weeks after 67-year-old Cuomo announced his candidacy for New York City mayor, by many of our political leaders.” He resigned his governorship in August 2021 after at least 11 women filed various complaints of unwelcome sexual advances against him — from kisses to groping to comments. The state legislature had been closing in on impeaching him. When he announced his bid for the mayor’s office last month, Cuomo blamed the city’s problems on “the lack of intelligent action. Friday’s report will do little to assure voters that he packs the requisite IQ."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/judge-orders-trump-admin-to-unfreeze-funds-withheld-from-maine-over-transgender-athletes,Judge Orders Trump Admin to Unfreeze Funds Withheld From Maine Over Transgender Athletes,By Zero Hedge,22 days ago,"A U.S. District Court in Maine issued a ruling April 11 ordering the federal government to release funding to Maine that was frozen over the state’s decision to disregard an executive order and allow transgender athletes in women’s sports.
Conflict between the state and federal government began after President Donald Trump issued the order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” on his first day back in the White House for a second term.
The Epoch Times’ Travis Gillmore reports that in a 70-page ruling, Judge John A. Woodcock Jr. ordered the Department of Agriculture and its secretary, Brooke Rollins, to “immediately unfreeze” any money held back because the state chose not to follow the president’s executive action.
Agencies are also barred from withholding future funding on similar grounds.
Meanwhile, the court distanced itself from the debate over transgender athletes.
“In ruling on the state’s request, the court is not weighing in on the merits of the controversy about transgender athletes that forms the backdrop of the impasse between the state and the federal defendants,” Woodcock wrote in his decision.
He went on to explain that the decision was based on the Agriculture Department’s failure to follow regulatory protocols when withholding the funding.
“In fact, the federal defendants have not argued in this case that the relevant federal laws and regulations for terminating federal funding of state programs do not apply to this situation, nor do they claim that they complied with the applicable federal law in the events resulting in this litigation.”
The Trump administration argued that the court did not have proper jurisdiction to hear the case, and that Maine did not “allege irreparable harm.”
Tensions boiled over during a February meeting with governors at the White House, when Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills sparred over the issue in a heated back-and-forth.
When Maine opted not to prohibit transgender athletes from competing against women, Rollins sent a letter April 2 to Mills alerting her that the Agriculture Department was “freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools,” according to the court ruling.
In its lawsuit filed on April 7, Maine said it was unable to access approximately $3 million.
The state told the court the money was used for programs that helped provide meals to schools, childcare facilities, and disabled adults.
In Rollins’s April 2 letter to Mills saying the funds had been frozen, the agriculture secretary said the pause “does not impact federal feeding programs or direct assistance to Mainers; if a child was fed today, they will be fed tomorrow.”
State officials celebrated the ruling and said it would help protect nutritional programs meant to benefit at-risk populations.
“This temporary restraining order confirms the Trump administration did not follow the rule of law when it cut program funds that go to feed schoolchildren and vulnerable adults,” Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said in a statement.
“This order preserves Maine’s access to certain congressionally appropriated funds by prohibiting an unlawful freeze by the administration.”
The Epoch Times reached out to the White House for comment."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-military-academies-end-race-quotas-in-admissions,US Military Academies End Race Quotas in Admissions,By Raw Egg Nationalist,22 days ago,"The US Air Force Academy and the US Military Academy at West Point have officially excluded race from their admissions criteria.
The announcement comes as the academies seek to bring to an end discrimination lawsuits brought against them in federal courts in Arizona and New York by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). In separate letters sent to the courts on Friday, the academies argued that the admissions policies being challenged are no longer in effect, and asked for a 60-day pause to allow them to negotiate a settlement with SFFA.
SFFA previously won a stunning victory at the Supreme Court in 2023, when race-based admissions at public and private universities were struck down. Shortly after the ruling, the group filed lawsuits against both military academies, which had been exempted from the Supreme Court’s ruling. Chief Justice Roberts had said there might be “potentially distinct interests” in ensuring an officer corps subject to race-based admissions.
The change to admissions criteria is a direct result of President Trump’s executive orders to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusivity (DEI) policies across the federal government, including in all branches of the military.
In line with this goal, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered the Department of Defense to eliminate all DEI programs and offices and to cease using race- and sex-based criteria for admissions at military academies.
SFFA also has a lawsuit against the US Naval Academy, which announced two weeks ago that it had also ceased considering race and sex as admissions criteria, despite a federal ruling in December of last year that it could continue to do so.
Edward Blum, president of SFFA, praised the Naval Academy’s decision.
“Students for Fair Admissions welcomes the announcement that the U.S. Naval Academy will end its unfair and illegal race-based admissions policies,” he said in a statement in March. “Racial discrimination is wrong and racial classifications have no place at our nation’s military academies.”
In recent weeks, a judge sought to reverse President Trump’s ban on transgenders serving in the military.
US District Judge Ana Reyes, who was appointed by Joe Biden, ruled that Trump’s Executive Order of 27 January, in which he targeted the legal rights of transgenders, was a violation of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.
In a post on X, Secretary Hegseth mocked Reyes, calling her “Commander Reyes” and saying she should take a more active role in military decision-making.
“Since ‘Judge’ Reyes is now a top military planner, she/they can report to Fort Benning at 0600 to instruct our Army Rangers on how to execute High Value Target Raids,” Hegseth wrote.
“After that, Commander Reyes can dispatch to Fort Bragg to train our Green Berets on counterinsurgency warfare.”
The DoD declared on 11 February that it would no longer allow transgenders to join in the military and would stop performing or funding gender transition procedures for service members. Later that month, the military said it would begin to expel serving transgender personnel.
The clash with Judge Reyes is part of a broader ongoing conflict with activist judges who are seeking to stifle President Trump’s agenda, especially his campaign promise of “the largest mass deportation operation in American history.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/wisconsin-teen-killed-parents-as-part-of-plot-to-kill-trump,Wisconsin Teen Killed Parents as Part of Plot To Kill Trump,By Raw Egg Nationalist,22 days ago,"A Wisconsin teenager killed his parents to obtain money to assassinate President Trump, it’s alleged.
Nikita Casap, aged 17, was arrested in March and charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of hiding a corpse. He has also been charged with theft of property worth over $10,000 and misappropriate ID to obtain money.
Investigators are also pushing for him to face federal charges of conspiracy, presidential assassination and the use of weapons of mass destruction.
His stepfather and mother, Donald Mayer and Tatiana Casap, were both found dead in their home by the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department on 1 March.
When a search of the property was conducted, police officers say they discovered material on Nikita’s phone related to “the Order of Nine Angles,” “a network of individuals holding new-Nazi racially motivated extremist views.”
The FBI has reviewed a document believed to be a manifesto, in which the teenager calls for the assassination of President Trump to “save the white race.”
“He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the Unites States. And he paid for, at least in part, a drone and explosives to be used as a weapon of mass destruction to commit an attack,” investigators said in the federal affidavit.
“Other parties, with whom Casap was in contact, appear to have been aware of his plan and action and to have provided assistance to Casap in carrying them out,” according to the affidavit.
Casap has yet to enter a plea. His next court appearance is on 7 May."

Referrals were filed in Arizona and Pennsylvania, along with pre-existing referrals in Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri and Oklahoma.
The filings, which come from the Vires Law Group and the Former Feds Group Freedom Foundation, call on state attorneys general to pursue Anthony Fauci and other pandemic-era officials for a wide range of serious crimes. The charges include murder, negligent homicide, involuntary manslaughter, medical coercion and abuse, racketeering, operating a corrupt organization and terrorism.
Among the individuals being pursued are Anthony Fauci, former NIAID director; Deborah Birx, former White House COVID coordinator; Rachelle Walensky, former CDC director; Francis Collins, former NIH director; Peter Hotez, Baylor vaccine promoter; Robert Redfield, former CDC director; and Peter Daszak, EcoHealth Alliance president and collaborator with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
On his last day in office, President Biden issued a largely unprecedented pre-emptive pardon for Anthony Fauci in an attempt to shield him from prosecution by the incoming Trump administration.
In response, Fauci told the media he “truly appreciated” Biden for taking action, and the possibility of prosecution had created “immeasurable and intolerable distress” for his family.
“Let me be perfectly clear, I have committed no crime and there are no possible grounds for any allegation or threat of criminal investigation or prosecution of me,” he said.
In February, 17 state attorneys general made a formal request to Congress for funding to investigate the origins of COVID-19 and explore possible legal action against Fauci and others. Although President Biden’s pardon prevents federal prosecution, it does not prevent legal action at the state level, the attorneys general argue.
One of President Trump’s first actions was to revoke Anthony Fauci’s security clearance.
“You can’t have a security detail for the rest of your life because you work for government,” Trump told reporters.
“It’s very standard.”"

On Friday, District Court Judge John Woodcock issued a temporary restraining order in a case brought by the state of Maine against the US Department of Agriculture.
The case stemmed from a disagreement between the USDA and the state over funding for a children’s nutrition program. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said she was withdrawing federal funding for the program over the participation of transgender athletes in sport.
The children’s nutrition program was due to receive millions in federal funding.
Back in February, President Trump and State Governor Janet Mills sparred at the White House over the President’s Executive Order to rescind all funding from educational programs that “deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.”
When President Trump told Governor Mills she’d “better comply,” she responded that she would see the administration in court.
The new court order came as state officials in Maine said they would not comply with the President’s Executive Order.

DOGE updated its website this week to reflect the most accurate figures available, posting an extra $10 billion in savings from the previous update.
The Department’s savings of $150 billion equate to $931.68 per taxpayer in the US.
According to the website, the savings are a “combination of asset sales, contract/lease cancellations and renegotiations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions.”
The latest batch of receipts posted on the website shows over 7,000 terminated contracts, including individual contracts amounting to billions of dollars. One cancelled contract, for refugee resettlement, amounted to $2,902,177,562.
Of all the departments of the US government, Health and Human Services has so far generated the greatest cost-savings, followed by the Department of Education and the General Services Administration.
The Department of Commerce, Department of Justice and Department of Veterans Affairs are among the departments generating the least savings.
DOGE also recently discovered that children and people who are clearly dead have been claiming hundreds of millions in unemployment benefit.
A survey of unemployment claims revealed that nearly 25,000 people aged over 115 claimed a total of $59 million in benefits, and 28,000 people aged between 1 and 5 claimed $254 million in benefits."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/rfk-jr-tells-fda-employees-dont-be-part-of-the-deep-state,RFK Jr. Tells FDA Employees: Don’t Be Part of the Deep State,By Raw Egg Nationalist,22 days ago,"“Don’t be a part of the Deep State,” Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr told employees at the FDA on Friday.
Kennedy visited the agency headquarters at Silver Spring, Maryland to address staff directly. He claimed the agency had been captured by the industries it regulates and become a “sock puppet.”
“President Trump always talks about the deep state,” Kennedy said.
“And the media, you know, disparages him and says that he’s paranoid or conspiracy theory, but the deep state is real. And it’s not, you know, just George Soros and Bill Gates and a bunch of nefarious individuals sitting together in a in a room and plotting the, you know, the destruction of humanity.”
Kennedy told employees this industry capture was a significant cause of the explosion in chronic diseases in recent decades. He added that they should call out their superiors if they approve “something that shouldn’t be approved.”
He then brought up the infamous Milgram electroshock experiments, in which ordinary people were encouraged to administer what they thought were lethal shocks to others, purely on the basis of an “expert’s” say-so. He urged them to be part of the moral minority who refused to administer lethal shocks.
“I want you to see yourself as part of that 33%… You’re not here to take orders,” Kennedy said.
Multiple outlets, including Axios, have reported that FDA employees walked out of the address before it was finished.
At a cabinet meeting last week, Secretary Kennedy announced a “massive” research project into the causes of autism, which will report its findings in September."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/number-of-mosques-in-sweden-has-increased-4200-in-25-years,"Number of Mosques in Sweden Has Increased 4,200% in 25 Years",By Raw Egg Nationalist,22 days ago,"The number of mosques in Sweden has increased by 4,200% since the year 2000, RMX News reports.
In 2000, there were just seven mosques, but now Sweden has at least 300.
Exact figures are difficult to obtain, because official figures only refer to permanent places of worship with a minaret. There are also many more unofficial places of worship in the country that have been created in places like converted shops and basements.
Following a general trend in European countries, many of these mosques have been built with funding from the Middle East.
“In several cases, Swedish mosque construction has been partially or completely financed with money from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar or Turkey. In the case of Saudi Arabia alone, there is talk of billions. There is also information in the media that every fourth Swedish mosque is financed by the Sunni Muslim and Wahhabi kingdom,” writes Swedish newspaper Samnytt.
More mosques are currently being planned, including a mosque in Helsingborg that has been dubbed “Scandinavia’s largest mosque.” The equivalent of over 6 million euros have already been raised for its construction. Much of the money has been raised via social-media campaigns on platforms like TikTok and Instagram.
Another mosque, billed as the largest in all of Europe, is being planned in Stockholm, Sweden’s capital.
Government officials support the construction of new mosques.
“We have freedom of religion in this country, we have countless churches and not nearly as many mosques, so of course we need to build more mosques as long as it takes for people to be able to practice their religion,” said Karin Wanngård, Stockholm’s finance mayor.
In some parts of Sweden, such as the city of Malmö, ethnic Swedish children are already in the minority. Conservatives and right-wingers in Sweden point to Malmö as the future of Sweden’s cities, with massive ethnic enclaves that are no-go zones for native Swedes and especially women.
Migrants are now responsible for the overwhelming majority of murders, shootings, gang rapes and robberies in Sweden."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/let-the-man-cook-rfk-jr-is-not-being-blackmailed-by-big-pharma-hes-just-being-pragmatic,"Let the Man Cook: RFK Jr Is Not Being Blackmailed by Big Pharma, He’s Just Being Pragmatic",By Raw Egg Nationalist,23 days ago,"What’s going on with RFK Jr.? Has he been threatened? Is he being blackmailed? Did he take Big Pharma’s 30 pieces of silver?
These are questions long-time supporters of RFK Jr. have been asking this week after their man came out and said 14 words they never thought they’d hear him say.
No, not those 14 words.
These 14 words: “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” That’s what Kennedy, Secretary of the Department for Health and Human Services, posted on Twitter.
And just like that, the heavens opened, the dam burst—pick your metaphor.
“What’s the point of writing an entire book about dangers of long term side effects of untested vaccines if you aren’t going to mention it once in power?” one Kennedy follower wrote in response to the post.
“You really make a great poster boy for Big Pharma. So much for ‘MAHA.’ GROSS,” wrote another.
Del Bigtree, who was Kennedy’s communications chief and now heads a vaccine-advocacy group, blasted his former boss. “Your post got cut off. The MMR is also one of the most effective ways to cause autism.”
Even Kennedy’s very own health nonprofit, Children’s Health Defense, which he founded and served as chairman of, distanced itself from him.
“What he says does not speak for Children’s Health Defense in any way at this point,” said the organization’s CEO Mary Holland.
I could carry on listing the angry responses. There are thousands of them. The mood in the various Twitter health groupchats I’m in was no less furious. I generally avoided commenting, preferring to let cooler heads prevail, but it took some time for people I know care deeply about the success of the MAHA agenda to calm down. These are people who want Kennedy to succeed, because they want America to succeed. They want their children and all American children to grow up in a nation where they’re not poisoned from cradle to grave and where sustaining them in ill health is not a multi-multi-billion-dollar industry. I’m with them.
I can understand the anger. Kennedy’s statement is in marked variance to years of comments and detailed work on the dangers of vaccines and the MMR vaccine in particular. It’s a complete 180, a U-turn—again, pick your metaphor.
What makes it all the more worse is, of course, the fact there could hardly be a more qualified man to Make America Healthy Again. Kennedy gets it in a way no other candidate for the job could. He’s lived it for pretty much his entire adult life, fighting against corrupt entrenched interests to expose the truth about America’s unprecedented health crisis, however ugly the truth may be. The man doesn’t just see this as a job. He sees himself as being on a mission from God. That’s exactly what he said on the campaign trail: “For 19 years, I asked God to put me in a position where I could end the chronic disease epidemic and bring health back to our children. And in August, God sent me Donald Trump.”
So what gives?
I don’t think Kennedy is being blackmailed; that’s a dumb suggestion. Like pretty much every male member of the Kennedy family, RFK Jr.’s a pussy-hound, and we’ve all heard the crazy stories about dead bears and dead whales and brain worms and roasted dogs in Guatemala and how heroin improved his grades at Harvard. I don’t think there’s anything else lurking in the man’s closet that could surprise us at this point, frankly. We know Kennedy’s led a colourful life, and he’s not embarrassed to admit it. Good for him.
To me, the MMR comments look much more like a sop to his critics, and a pretty weak one at that. Kennedy’s comments come in the face of a large measles outbreak in Texas that may be linked to migrants. In the initial stages of the outbreak, Kennedy didn’t promote vaccination. Instead, he said vitamin A was an effective treatment. It’s only now, months into the outbreak, as new cases keep emerging, that he’s been forced to make a statement in favour of the MMR vaccine.
It’s worth noting that his critics don’t believe he’s changed his mind on vaccination. One, a scholar at Johns Hopkins, told The Wall Street Journal he’s just “ticking a box.” He is. He hasn’t changed his mind. He doesn’t want the measles outbreak—which is still small and geographically confined—to overshadow everything else he’s doing.
At this stage, I think the man’s earned a little slack. If he were a Big Pharma or Big Ag candidate, of course things would be different. But he’s not and we know that. This is just the reality of exercising power, as anybody who’s ever had access to power, or even tried to do anything involving other people, will know. Sometimes you have to compromise, even if only temporarily, to achieve some greater goal.
Look beyond this storm in a teacup, this mountain being constructed from a you-know-what, and you’ll see much stronger indicators that the MAHA agenda is still on track.
For one thing, Kennedy has announced that the FDA’s Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) system for certifying food additives will be subject to wholesale reform, if not abolished. I’ve called GRAS “Generally Recognized as Insane” because it is—it’s insane. It’s the reason why nobody knows how many food additives there are in the American food supply. Estimates suggest as many as 10,000. In the EU, by contrast, there are about 2,000.
GRAS was introduced in the 1950s as a way to “grandfather” through safety testing food additives that were already in use, but over decades it mutated into something it was never intended to be: a system that allows food manufacturers to come up with new additives, claim they’re safe without independent testing and then introduce them to the food supply. The FDA never lefts a finger. This started informally, with the FDA’s tacit approval, but in the last decade, the FDA moved to formalise it retrospectively. It’s now totally above board.
So Americans just have to take the manufacturers’ word these additives are safe. Insane, like I said.
And when independent testing actually is done, studies show clear links between these food additives and the whole gamut of chronic diseases that have exploded in the last seventy or so years. Autism, ADHD, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity—you name it.
Here’s another thing RFK Jr. has done. He’s just announced a huge scientific inquiry into the real causes of autism. Not the superficial causes—not improved diagnostic criteria and greater awareness of the condition—but the real causes, whatever they may be. We already have a good idea of what Kennedy thinks causes autism, and that almost certainly includes vaccines, but this will be an objective, rigorous examination that can stand up on its own two feet, independent of Kennedy himself.
And it will have to, because its findings will be explosive. Big Pharma, Big Food and their shills are already beginning their campaign to discredit the inquiry and the man directing it. They know what’s at stake. Kennedy has promised the inquiry will report its findings by the end of September.
I’m not saying there aren’t reasons to be dissatisfied with Kennedy himself or with the current shape of MAHA now he’s actually in power.
One thing the MAHA movement needs, sooner rather than later, is a detailed policy document, some kind of guide that tells the American people, in simple language, exactly what it will mean for the nation to be healthy again. True health goes beyond any metrics or data points you could plot on a graph, but even so, Americans need something they can measure so they can know if they’re really heading in the right direction. After all, the health crisis is framed in statistical terms: the number of children with autism diagnoses; the number of obese people; the proportion of children and adults on anti-depressants; and so on. Tell Americans exactly what kind of changes they can expect.
Tell them how long it’s going to take, too. During the election campaign RFK Jr. said he’d Make America Healthy Again in four years, but that’s just wishful thinking—a soundbite designed for a four-year election cycle. Really, MAHA will need to be a generational, multi-administration agenda. It’s taken a century for Americans to become this unhealthy, and so it’s probably going to take a decade or more to do something really meaningful about it. That means Vance 2028, Vance 2032, Barron 2036…
Ultimately, we have to give Kennedy time—he’s barely stepped through the door and taken off his coat—and we have to understand that he’s going to have to compromise at times to achieve his broader goals, like any politician.
We have to let the man cook."

In a new memorandum, the Secretaries of Defense, the Interior, Agriculture, and Homeland Security are ordered to  help transfer the public lands in question to the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.
These lands include the Roosevelt Reservation, a 60-foot strip of land that runs across three states (California, Arizona and New Mexico). It was established by President Thedore Roosevelt in 1907 to keep all public lands along the border in those states “free from obstruction as a protection against the smuggling of goods between the United States and Mexico.” Texas was excluded from the Reservation because the state retained all public lands upon its annexation and admission to the Union.
“The southern border is under siege,” President Trump said in a statement to accompany the move.
“Weak leadership in Washington has allowed criminal aliens, drug traffickers, and hostile actors to flood into our country unchecked. Today, we are taking back control. We will no longer tolerate lawlessness, and we will use every tool at our disposal—including our military—to defend the American people.”
President Trump’s new directive makes use of 43 USC 155, which allows the federal government to withdraw public lands for the purposes of national defense.
The directive is intended to further Executive Order 14167, which Trump signed on Inauguration Day. Order 14167 tasks the US military with “repelling the invasion” of illegal migrants and preventing unlawful crossings.
Importantly, the new directive gives military commanders the power to exclude people from designated zones on the public lands brought under DoD jurisdiction. In effect, this will create buffer zones where any trespassers face immediate detention and expulsion.
Border crossings have been radically reduced under President Donald Trump, reaching a monthly level that’s lower than the number who entered on a single day at the height of the Biden border crisis in 2023.
President Trump took to his social-media platform Truth Social to hail the news, at the beginning of last month.
“The month of February, my first full month in Office, had the LOWEST number of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter our Country in History – BY FAR! There were only 8,326 apprehensions of Illegals by Border Patrol at the U.S. – Mexico Border, all of whom were quickly ejected from our Nation or, when necessary, prosecuted for crimes against the United States of America
“This means that very few people came – The Invasion of our Country is OVER. In comparison, under Joe Biden, there were 300,000 Illegals crossing in one month, and virtually ALL of them were released into our Country. Thanks to the Trump Administration Policies, the Border is CLOSED to all Illegal Immigrants. Anyone who tries to illegally enter the U.S.A. will face significant criminal penalties and immediate deportation.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-ends-protected-status-for-afghans-and-cameroonians,Trump Ends Protected Status for Afghans and Cameroonians,By Raw Egg Nationalist,23 days ago,"President Donald Trump has ended temporary deportation protections for tens of thousands of Afghans and Cameroonians in the US.
Nearly 15,000 Afghans and 8,000 Cameroonians in the US will now lose their protected status by June, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said on Friday.
The Temporary Protected Status program is available to people whose home countries experience a natural disaster, conflict or other extraordinary circumstances. TPS lasts between 6-18 months and can be renewed by the Homeland Security secretary. It offers a variety of benefits, including protection against deportation and access to work permits.
More than 80,000 Afghans were evacuated from their home country to the US after the withdrawal in 2021. Around 70,000 who entered the US were granted temporary parole, which allowed entry for a period of two years. The DHS extended TPS to many Afghans, saying that the country’s ongoing insurgency warranted the move.
During his first presidency, Trump tried to end virtually all TPS enrolment, by the was blocked by federal courts. In March, a district judge blocked his attempt to end the status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the US, claiming that his attempt to characterize many of them as criminals was “racist.”
Migrants who entered the US via the government’s CBP One app, including Afghans, have started receiving notifications telling them their parole has been withdrawn and that they have seven days to leave the country."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/second-trump-assassin-hit-with-new-state-charges-including-terrorism,"Second Trump Assassin Hit with New State Charges, Including Terrorism",By Raw Egg Nationalist,23 days ago,"Would-be presidential assassin Ryan Routh has been hit with new state charges in Florida for his September 2024 attempt on Donald Trump’s life.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said his office has finally been granted a warrant and is charging Routh with attempted first-degree murder and terrorism after the Biden administration prevented the state from going ahead with its own investigation and prosecution.
Speaking on Fox and Friends on Thursday, Uthmeier said, “We want a justice system that is willing to pursue justice, no matter what party is in charge. Joe Biden and the Democrats did everything they could to drag their feet and refuse to cooperate with the state of Florida.”
“Under Attorney General Bondi and the Trump administration and our new FBI director, it’s been a breath of fresh air—very different. They’ve been transparent and cooperative,” he added.
Uthmeier went on to say that the federal government has turned over its evidence to his office, and he also promised that more evidence about the assassination attempt would be made public very soon.
Routh is already facing federal charges for attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course last September. If convicted, he faces life in prison.
On the morning of 15 September 2024, Routh took up position on the boundary of the Trump International Golf Club with an illegally obtained SKS rifle and lay in wait for the President. He was spotted by Secret Service agents, who opened fire on him. He fled the scene but was later apprehended.
Since his arrest, there has been intense focus on Routh’s activities in and related to Ukraine.
Routh travelled to Ukraine to recruit soldiers to fight the Russians, and at one point attempted to help Afghan refugees travel to Ukraine via Iran for that purpose. He also lobbied for greater US involvement in the war on Capitol Hill.
His animus towards Trump appears to stem largely from Trump’s attitude towards the war.
In a bizarre screed that he self-published on Amazon, Routh called for the assassination of Trump and also blamed him for the failure of the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran.
It was recently revealed that Routh tried to obtain military weapons from Ukraine to assassinate Donald Trump, including a rocket-propelled grenade or stinger missile system.
According to court documents, Routh told a Ukrainian contact to “send me a or stinger, and I will see what we can do,” before adding, “[Trump] is not good for Ukraine.”
Routh’s trial is scheduled to begin on 8 September."

Kennedy Sr. and Martin Luther King Jr. will be released “in the next few days,” according to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.
The documents, which have spent “decades” in storage, are currently being scanned for release, Gabbard revealed during a public cabinet meeting with President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Sr.’s son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is now Secretary of Health and Human Services.
“We’ve been scanning—I’ve had over a hundred people working around the clock to scan the paper around RFK, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy’s assassination, as well as Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination,” Director Gabbard said.
“These have been sitting in boxes in storage for decades, they have never been scanned or seen before. We’ll have those ready to release here in the next few days.”
In response to the announcement, RFK Jr. said he felt, “very gratified.”
RFK Sr., brother of President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in June 1968, after he had won the Democrat presidential primary. The official story that RFK Sr. was killed by a lone gunman, Sirhan Sirhan, has been the subject of intense dispute, just like the circumstances of President Kennedy’s assassination.
In January, President Trump signed an Executive Order to declassify records related to the assassinations of President Kennedy, RFK Sr. and MLK Jr.
After two attempts on his own life during the 2024 presidential campaign, President Trump also vowed to create a commission into presidential assassinations. He said it would be dedicated to RFK Jr."

Africa Because of “Land Confiscation and Genocide” of White Farmers,By Raw Egg Nationalist,23 days ago,"The US will not attend the G20 meeting in South Africa, President Donald Trump has said, because of “land confiscation and genocide” of white farmers.
In a post on his social-media site Truth Social, the President blasted South Africa for its anti-white racism.
“How could we be expected to go to South Africa for the very important G20 Meeting when Land Confiscation and Genocide is the primary topic of conversation?” President Trump posted.
“They are taking the land of white Farmers, and then killing them and their families. The Media refuses to report on this. The United States has held back all contributions to South Africa. Is this where we want to be for the G20? I don’t think so!”
The G20 consists of 19 countries, as well as the African Union and European Union, together making up 80% of the global economy and two-thirds of the population.
South Africa will hold the presidency of the G20 until November 2025, when it will be handed over to the US, at the next summit, in Johannesburg.
The decision to boycott the G20 in South Africa was first announced in February, when Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would not be attending any meetings and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he had commitments in Washington that would prevent him from attending a meeting of finance ministers.
Secretary Rubio said he would not “coddle anti-Americanism.”
In a stunning reversal of official policy and in the face of widespread media denials, the Trump administration has drawn attention to the plight of white South Africans under the post-Apartheid regime and even set up a refugee program for them to settle in the US.
At the beginning of February, President Trump signed an Executive Order creating a new pathway to settlement in the US for white South Africans.
The Order stated that the South African government has seized “ethnic minority Afrikaners’ agricultural property without compensation” and issued “countless government policies designed to dismantle equal opportunity” in public life.
It also claims the country has “taken aggressive positions towards the United States and its allies,” including accusing Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice and strengthening its ties with Iran.
“The United States cannot support the government of South Africa’s commission of rights violations in its country or its undermining United States foreign policy, which poses national security threats to our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests,” the order says.
A new Land Expropriation Act has elicited a fierce backlash from white farmers in South Africa, who believe their land will be taken from them and redistributed, as happened in Zimbabwe, with disastrous effects for the country."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/apple-airlifts-600-tons-of-iphones-into-us-to-beat-tariffs,Apple Airlifts 600 Tons of IPhones into US To Beat Tariffs,By Raw Egg Nationalist,23 days ago,"Apple has airlifted 600 tons of IPhones into the US to avoid extra costs as a result of President Trump’s new tariffs.
Since March, Apple has expedited the shipment of 1.5 million IPhones into the US from its production facility in India.
The Verge reports that Apple lobbied US officials to gain faster clearance into the US and also kept its Indian production facility open on Sundays, increasing production levels by 20%.
Other tech giants like Dell, Lonovo and Microsoft have also been scrambling to get as many of their devices into the US before the new “reciprocal” tariffs come into effect. An executive at a supplier for Apple, Microsoft and Google said they had received urgent requests to ship as many consumer electronics to the US as possible.
Some companies are also shifting their supply chains closer to the US. HP, for example, is already exploring options to increase production in Mexico.
President Trump made the imposition of tariffs a certain plank of his economic policy during the election. Since his inauguration in January, he has levied special tariffs on Mexico and Canada for their role in the US fentanyl and immigration crises, and in recent weeks he announced a new round of “reciprocal” tariffs on many of the US’s larger and smaller trading partners.
On Wednesday, President Trump raised his tariff against China to 125%, while pausing his increased reciprocal tariffs against other countries for 90 days.
“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” Trump said on Truth Social.
“At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”
As many as 75 nations have already expressed a desire to renegotiate trade terms with the US."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-hidden-effects-of-vaccines,The Hidden Effects of Vaccines,By Maryanne Demasi | Brownstone Institute,23 days ago,"A recent commentary, published in the journal Vaccine by Christine Stabell Benn of the Bandim Health Project at the University of Southern Denmark, challenges the conventional view of vaccines.
While vaccines are recognised for their ability to prevent specific diseases, Benn highlights a critical but overlooked phenomenon: non-specific effects (NSEs).
NSEs can either bolster or weaken overall health by shaping the immune system’s response to other infections.
One of the earliest clues about NSEs emerged in the 1990s with the high-titre measles vaccine (HTMV).
Designed to immunise infants as young as three to four months, the vaccine protected against measles but had another devastating effect—it doubled the overall mortality rate in girls.
This alarming discovery led the World Health Organization (WHO) to pull the vaccine in 1992, revealing that even effective vaccines can have unintended, sex-specific harms.
Conversely, the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, primarily used to prevent tuberculosis, appears to have protective effects beyond TB.
Studies in Guinea-Bissau and Uganda found that administering BCG at birth reduced infant mortality and morbidity by 29% to 38%—far beyond what could be explained by TB prevention alone.
Could the vaccine stimulate the immune system in a way that helps fight off various infections?
During the Covid-19 pandemic, some studies even suggested that BCG vaccination reduced infection risk in vulnerable groups and may have reduced all-cause mortality across all trials, reinforcing its broad protective benefits.
“Live vaccines” that contain an attenuated form of the live pathogen—such as BCG, oral polio, and measles (standard-titre) —have been linked to reduced mortality, suggesting they save far more lives than expected through positive immune training.
However, “non-live vaccines” exhibit worrying patterns.
Three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine have been the backbone of immunisation programmes in low-income countries.
Research by Benn and colleagues found that DTP-vaccinated children had higher mortality than DTP-unvaccinated children.
In the figure below, all studies uniformly suggest that being DTP-vaccinated is associated with higher mortality than not being DTP-vaccinated.
Overall, the DTP vaccine is associated with a 2-fold increase in mortality, and this deleterious effect of DTP was particularly pronounced for females.
Similar concerns have emerged for other non-live vaccines.
Specifically, a higher female-male mortality ratio among vaccinated children has been observed for five others: the pentavalent vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, H1N1 influenza vaccine, RTS,S malaria vaccine, and inactivated polio vaccine.
These findings suggest that the type of vaccine—not just the disease it targets—matters for overall health outcomes.
Despite strong evidence, NSEs are largely ignored in vaccine policy. The WHO acknowledged in 2014 that some vaccines reduce all-cause mortality, while others may increase it, yet nothing changed.
One challenge of observational studies is the “healthy vaccinee bias”—healthier children are more likely to be vaccinated, skewing the results towards the benefits of any vaccine.
But Benn argues that randomised trials, wherever conducted, have largely confirmed NSEs, making the risks harder to dismiss.
“We must rewrite our understanding of vaccines,” writes Benn. “It is no longer tenable to maintain a narrow perspective on vaccines as biological preparations that induce specific protection against a specific disease.”
The latest edition of Plotkin’s Vaccines
, the world’s leading textbook on vaccines, includes a dedicated chapter on non-specific effects and unequivocally states that “it is clear that vaccines have NSE.”
Yet, these effects remain overlooked in vaccine policy.
Benn stresses the need for tailored policies rather than a one-size-fits-all approach:
“NSEs make life more complicated for policymakers and regulators,” Benn acknowledged.
“However, the reward is the auspicious prospect of wiser vaccination programs designed to protect against specific diseases and provide general immune training with even bigger benefits.”
Benn proposes several actionable steps, such as redefining BCG vaccination from a tuberculosis-specific intervention to a tool for reducing neonatal mortality, as well as ensuring live and non-live vaccines are given in the safest, most effective order.
Ultimately, she argues that policy should prioritise all-cause mortality studies—so future vaccine trials measure overall health impacts, not just disease-specific protection.
The discussion around vaccine policies is particularly relevant now, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at the helm of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
Kennedy has long been an outspoken critic of the lack of transparency in vaccine safety discussions, and his leadership could signal a shift toward more scrutiny and potential reform in vaccination policies.
Whether this will lead to meaningful policy changes remains to be seen, but it certainly opens the door for a much-needed discourse on vaccine science beyond the rigid mantra of “safe and effective.”
No drug that is effective can be totally safe; there will always be harms, and it is essential to understand them.
At Kennedy’s confirmation hearings, we saw a stark example of “vaccine absolutism”—the refusal to entertain any discussion of nuance in vaccine policy.
Ironically, those most fearful that Kennedy will roll back vaccinations are, in their efforts to suppress debate and control the narrative, causing more damage to public confidence in vaccines.
As one of my colleagues always says, “If you have nothing to hide, then hide nothing.”
If we want to restore trust in vaccination, we must move beyond the binary thinking of “pro-vaccine” versus “anti-vaccine” and instead foster a more open, evidence-based discussion about their benefits and harms."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-tells-putin-to-get-moving-on-ukraine-peace-negotiations-clock-ticking,"Trump Tells Putin To ‘Get Moving’ On Ukraine Peace Negotiations, Clock Ticking",By ZeroHedge,24 days ago,"White House special envoy Steve Witkoff was in St. Petersburg Friday where he met with President Putin for the third time, amid ongoing efforts to normalize US-Russia relations and find a way forward toward Ukraine peace.
But President Trump remains impatient and is growing frustrated on the question of achieving peaceful settlement on Ukraine, and the clock is ticking as critics say the Kremlin is intentionally buying and wasting time, making slow but steady gains on the battlefield all along.
For this reason Trump said Friday that Russia needs to “get moving” with Ukraine ceasefire talks, also as Zelensky has alleged that Putin is not actually genuine about seeking peace.
“Russia has to get moving. Too many people [are] DYING, thousands a week,” Trump wrote in a fresh post on Truth Social.
Ironically the same day Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that no one should expect “breakthroughs” anytime soon, and yet this is precisely what Trump wants in Ukraine: a breakthrough and a path to settlement. BBC details of Friday:
Before the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was “no need to expect breakthroughs” as the “process of normalizing relations is ongoing”.
Witkoff first met with Kirill Dmitriev at the Grand Hotel Europe in St Petersburg where a conference was being held on stainless steel and the Russian market.
Dmitriev, the 49-year-old head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, visited Washington DC last week and was the most senior Russian official to go to the US since the full scale invasion of Ukraine.
Asked if discussions could include setting up a date for Putin and Trump to meet, Peskov said: “Let’s see. It depends on what Witkoff has come with.”
Just a week-and-a-half ago Trump had signaled Putin in words given to NBC: “If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia.”
Here’s Friday’s Truth Social post telling Putin to get moving…

The Washington Post described of the Witkoff-Putin meeting:
Video footage published by the Kremlin showed Witkoff and Putin shaking hands before the start of their talks, which lasted over four hours. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that they would discuss the war in Ukraine and that it was “a good opportunity to convey Russia’s position to Trump.”
Such threatening rhetoric has ramped up amid concerns Putin is intentionally slow-playing and taking advantage of the process. But the Kremlin has made clear that it will never budge on certain conditions – especially Russian ownership of Crimea and the four eastern territories, and of course a commitment to Ukraine demilitarizing and no more NATO expansion."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-government-gave-22-million-to-nonprofit-teaching-teens-about-sex-toys-report,US Government Gave $22 Million to Nonprofit Teaching Teens About Sex Toys: Report,By Anthony Murdoch | Lifesite,24 days ago,"(LifeSiteNews) – For almost a decade, the U.S. government funded a group that actively works to teach kids how to use sex toys and then keep them hidden from their parents to the tune of $22 million.
According to investigative reporter Hannah Grossman at the Manhattan Institute, The Center for Innovative Public Health Research (CIPHR) has been educating minors about sex toys with public funds.
Records show that the millions given to the group since 2016, according to its website, go toward “health education programs” that “promote positive human development.”
However, the actual contents of the programs, as can be seen from comments from CIPHR CEO Michele Ybarra, seem to suggest that its idea of “human” development is skewed toward radical sex education doctrine.
In 2017, CIPHR launched Girl2Girl, which is funded by federal money to promote “sex-ed program just for teen girls who are into girls.” Its website lets users, who are girls between ages 14 and 16, sign up for “daily text messages … about things like sex with girls and boys.”
The actual content of some of the messages is very concerning. Its website notes that some of the texts talk about “lube and sex toys” as well as “the different types of sex and ways to increase pleasure.”
The website actively calls upon teenage girls to make their “own decisions” and not let their parents know if they don’t want to.
Grossman shared a video clip on X of Ybarra explaining how they educate minors about the use of “sex toys” and dealing with their parents if they are found out.
The clip, from a 2022 Brown University webinar, shows Ybarra telling researchers how to prepare “young person(s)” for her research.
She said if they are doing “focus groups,” she will ask them, “Okay, so what happens if somebody comes into the room and sees words like penis and sex toys on your screen — on your computer screen or on your phone? What if it’s your mom?’”
In 2023, CIPHR launched Transcendent Health, which is a sex-education program for minors who are gender confused. This initiative received $1.3 million of federal grant money that expired last month.
Grossman observed that the federal government “should not fund programs that send sexually explicit messages to minors and encourage them to conceal these communications from parents.”
She noted that in order to protect children and “prevent further harm,” U.S. President Donald Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services “should immediately cancel CIPHR’s active contract and deny its future grant applications.”
“By doing so, the Trump administration can send a clear message: Taxpayers will no longer foot the bill for perverted ‘research’ projects,” she noted.
The Trump administration has thus far, through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), exposed billions in government waste and fraud. Many such uses of taxpayer dollars are currently under review by the administration, including pro-abortion and pro-censorship activity through USAID, “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda” through the National Science Foundation, and billions to left-wing “green energy” nonprofits through the Environmental Protection Agency."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/sweden-democrats-party-pitches-the-eus-toughest-migration-policy,‘Sweden Democrats’ Party Pitches “The EU’s Toughest Migration Policy”,By Michael Curzon | The European Conservative,24 days ago,"The Swedish government is being pushed to remove the possibility for asylum seekers to attain permanent residence permits, a policy change that would impact the ability of criminal migrants to stay in the country indefinitely and have implications on others hoping to remain, too. The proposal is the result of an investigation initiated by the government.
The nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD) said that while “under previous governments, even criminal foreigners have been able to obtain permanent residency,”
Now we are putting an end to that once and for all: our new report proposes abolishing permanent residency for everyone. No one should be able to count on staying here for life anymore.
Temporary residence permits are currently granted to those in need of immediate protection, although permanent permits can then be handed out after a certain period of time. SD also this month supported the abolition of ‘track changes,’ meaning rejected asylum applicants can no longer stay in Sweden while submitting new asylum claims based on different grounds or while applying for a separate work permit.
The proposal also suggests removing the right of migrants to obtain tax-paid legal assistance during the Migration Board’s handling of an asylum claim.
SD’s latest proposal is intended to form part of the wider plan to make Sweden’s “the EU’s toughest migration policy.” MEP Charlie Weimers has also expressed hope that officials in Brussels are “finally starting to listen to us.”
But Swedish paper Fria Tider has suggested that for many migrants, permanent residence permits could be replaced by firmer Swedish citizenship—the path to which “remains wide open.” Indeed, the TT news agency quotes Moderates Migration Minister Johan Forssell as saying that
An important point with this [removal of permanent residence permits for asylum seekers] is to increase the incentive to become a citizen.
So this is, perhaps, another front SD will have to turn its attention to next.
If approved, these latest changes should come into force next summer."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/cdu-in-crisis-it-is-more-than-just-poor-leadership,CDU in Crisis: It is More Than Just Poor Leadership,By Sabine Beppler-Spahl | The European Conservative,25 days ago,"sense of despair and panic has gripped Germany’s conservative party (CDU/CSU). Recent polls show an unprecedented and rapid decline in approval ratings, positioning the party at roughly 24%—now on par with—or even below—the right-populist AfD. “Never before has a party lost so much approval between the election and the formation of a new government,” said Hermann Blinkert, head of the INSA research institute.
At the time of writing this article, Friedrich Merz, the CDU’s candidate for the chancellorship, is leading coalition talks with the Social Democrats. (The two parties concluded a coalition agreement after this article was published. Ed.) In the meantime, his party’s youth wing (Junge Union) is in open rebellion. Their leadership states bluntly: “We want Friedrich Merz to do what we—the grassroots—made him party chairman to do. Political change must come!” The young conservatives who once championed Merz now accuse him of gambling away the party’s future, perhaps even endangering its very existence.
“The CDU and CSU have been given one last big chance with the 2025 federal elections” apetition launched by the organization declares. The signatories (now numbering around 2,600) fear that Merz’s far-reaching compromises with the SPD, such as on migration, squander this final opportunity. They demand a membership consultation before any coalition agreement is approved by the party leadership.
Their anger is understandable. Within hours of the February election results being announced, Merz began to backtrack on almost everything—from his promise to control borders to his pledge not to increase national debt beyond Germany’s constitutional “debt brake.”
Yet attributing this solely to character flaws or poor negotiation skills is too simplistic. It’s difficult to overstate the CDU’s predicament.  Voter mistrust ran deep even before February’s election with many correctly identifying the CDU as the root cause of Germany’s most pressing current problems. This explains why, despite the former SPD-Green-Liberal government’s complete discreditation, the party secured a mere 28.5% of the vote—its second-worst result ever.
In truth, the CDU, Germany’s most successful post-war political creation, which has governed for 52 of the 75 years since 1949, has seen its traditional support collapse for years. Like Merz now, Angela Merkel (CDU), once celebrated as Germany’s most successful politician, needed SPD support in three out of her four terms in office.
The poor election result in February, which is forcing Merz into an unpopular coalition with the SPD (the biggest loser in the election), shows that the supposed short memory of voters has proven mythical. Voters haven’t forgotten that during Angela Merkel’s 16-year reign, Germany’s borders were thrown wide open, creating migration numbers that overwhelmed local authorities so completely that even the liberal Guardian spoke of a state that had “lost control.”
These same voters also recognise that the dangerous neglect of Germany’s infrastructure began during these long and stultifying years—resulting in at least 5,000 bridges now declared decrepit. (Witness residents’ shocked reactions after a bridge in Dresden collapsed in September 2024.) And they know Merkel’s era launched Germany’s disastrous pivot to renewables alongside its nuclear phase-out, resulting in electricity costs now the highest in the EU, if not in the world.
It is true that Merz gave the impression during the election campaign that he would stand up to his party’s most irrational policies. But he did so half-heartedly—retreating whenever he faced stiff opposition, especially from his party’s centrist, pro-Merkel faction.
The CDU remains a divided party, with most of its leadership deeply entrenched in green-left ideology. For them, this ideology represents the “middle ground,” the bourgeois center—and the only sensible position. This explains why the party’s election programme reads like a balancing act. In it, the party promised to “examine” whether the last three shuttered nuclear power plants could be reconnected to the grid. But simultaneously, it avoided any commitment to this course—and carefully sidestepped any discussion of constructing new plants.
The programme promises to end the “ideologically driven politics of the former Government,” yet includes a clear commitment to making Germany “climate neutral by 2045.” As it also calls for strengthening the EU, a new political impetus based on voters’ concerns—rather than Brussels directives—was never to be expected.
The clearest example of the CDU’s fickleness was its refusal to unanimously support its own candidate’s “influx limitation law.” Acting under pressure following a deadly knife attack by a failed asylum seeker, Merz boldly promised a “5-point plan” to curb migration in January. The plan included permanent border controls and a rejection of all illegal immigrants. Yet when he brought his “influx limitation law” to parliament—a law intended to limit migration, yet much weaker than his 5-point plan—several MPs from his own party refused to support it.
When, at the height of the election campaign, thousands of government supporters took to the streets to denounce Merz and accuse him of making common cause with the right (because only the AfD voted unanimously for his law), many in the party leadership panicked. Merz’s determination vanished. The candidate instead emphasised strengthening the middle ground and rejected any cooperation with the AfD post-election.
If the Junge Union really wants to change the direction of its party, it faces a monumental challenge. First, it would have to address the ideological void at the party’s centre. Often referred to as a “Chancellor’s Election Association” (Kanzlerwahlverein), especially during the Merkel era, the marginalisation of internal critics goes back a long way.
Many who wanted genuine conservative representation have long since left the party. Indeed, when the AfD was founded in February 2013, it was essentially a CDU spin-off, and its leadership consisted almost entirely of disillusioned CDU members.
There are legitimate reasons why the CDU/CSU refuses to form a coalition with the AfD (including the AfD’s troubling historical relativism). But the haste with which party leadership has subordinated itself to SPD positions makes a mockery of Merz’s pre-election promise that he would do the right thing, no matter who supports it.
Many conservative CDU members viewed Merz as a beacon of hope because of his criticism of Merkel; he, too, was marginalized within the party for years. These hopes have proven futile.
Instead of seriously working to win back disappointed voters (Merz once promised wholeheartedly to halve the AfD’s support, and bring the CDU back to over 40%), he has joined those who view populists and their voters as the greatest danger. He describes the coalition with the SPD as being without alternative, and a failure of the negotiations as out of the question. However, the CDU has pursued a politics of “no alternatives” for far too long already. Must anyone seeking genuine change, like the Junge Union, look for a new political home? The battle over immigration, culture, and state structure remains wide open."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/congressmen-tell-glenn-beck-they-are-being-monitored-and-threatened-by-the-cia,Congressmen Tell Glenn Beck They Are Being Monitored And Threatened by The CIA,By Emily Mangiaracina | Lifesite,25 days ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Conservative commentator Glenn Beck shared that congressmen have repeatedly told him they are being monitored by the CIA, with two also claiming they’ve been threatened by the intelligence agency.
In a clip shared by Valuetainment host Patrick Bet-David on Monday, Beck told how he is frequently asked to leave electronics behind when holding discussions with congressmen during his visits to Washington, D.C.
“I don’t know how many times in the last five years I’ve had congressmen ask me, can you leave your cell phone outside? Let’s go for a walk. You’re carrying any electronics? Do you have an Apple Watch?”
“And then they’ll say, outside as we’re walking, quietly, the CIA is monitoring everything that we’re doing in Congress. They’re monitoring all of us,” Beck continued.
“And two of them have told me we’ve been threatened behind closed doors, we’ve been threatened by the CIA. That was a little scary to hear that. And I’ve heard it over and over and over again,” Beck said.
If true, the revelation suggests Congress as a whole is subject to coercion and therefore compromised in its legislative functions, and even that the U.S. is not currently a true democratic republic. This is especially momentous given that Congress has the sole power to declare war, in addition to its nearly unlimited lawmaking power.
The CIA has a long history of controversy for engaging in unconstitutional, illegal and evil activities. Most grievous is its documented use of torture, such as in Project MKUltra, a human control program, and the training of groups that have killed civilians and helped overthrown democratically elected governments.
A CIA whistleblower told commentator Candace Owens in November 2024 that the CIA has a refined system of intimidation by which it suppresses dissent within its own ranks, one he said was used on himself and his family."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/new-german-government-pledges-to-clamp-down-on-right-wing-extremism,New German Government Pledges to Clamp Down on ‘Right-Wing Extremism’,By Zoltán Kottász | The European Conservative,25 days ago,"Germany’s next chancellor, Friedrich Merz promised to “move” the country “forward again,” as he presented his incoming coalition government’s programme on Wednesday, April 9th—but a closer look at his plans suggest that little will change.
The centre-right CDU—led by Merz—and its sister party, the Bavarian CSU, struck a deal with the Social Democrats (SPD) earlier in the day to renew their so-called ‘grand coalition’ (2005-09 and 2013-21) which was instrumental in igniting Germany’s economic and industrial downfall, as well as paving the way for the country to welcome millions of illegal migrants.
During the party leaders’ press conference, Merz pledged to make Germany “stable, safer, and economically stronger again,” and vowed to “largely end irregular migration.”
The fact that Merz used the word “largely” suggests that his campaign promise to turn back illegal migrants and undocumented asylum seekers at Germany’s borders will not be followed through with concrete actions.
The CDU leader campaigned on a tough anti-immigration platform but has since backtracked on almost all of his promises. His party has lost a lot of its support since the elections on February 23rd, as Merz has gradually caved in to the demands of the pro-migration SPD.
Instead of sticking to his guns and simply rejecting illegal migrants at the border, the government programme proposes to do so “in coordination with our European neighbours.” As both Austria and Poland have refused to take back migrants from Germany, the plan seems to be unaccomplishable.
Rather than imposing a “de facto entry ban” on migrants without valid entry documents, the government will only enforce an entry and residency ban only after a illegal migrant has been allowed into Germany, deporting them  (in theory) at a later date. The fundamental right of asylum would remain untouched.
The new cabinet will also keep a bill designed by the outgoing left-wing government, under which migrants and asylum seekers are eligible for naturalisation after just five years of residency. The only minor change to be implemented will be that applicants who demonstrate “special integration achievements” will now not be allowed to gain German citizenship after only three years.
Merz’s government will at least continue to enforce temporary border checks, and refugees with limited protection status will not be allowed to bring family members to Germany for two years. The coalition also plans to expand the list of safe countries of origin.
The centrist-leftist government also wants to continue to crack down on free speech and enforce the EU’s censorship tool, the Digital Services Act. Critical voices, called ‘hate speech’ by the coalition, will be deleted from social media platforms, if the government has its way.
“Zero tolerance” will be applied to “enemies of democracy,” and the spread of “right-wing extremist thoughts” will be “systematically combated”—ie. attempts at silencing and possibly banning AfD, currently the most popular party in Germany, will continue. Politicians who have been convicted of incitement to hatred, such as the leader of the AfD’s Thuringia branch Björn Höcke, could be deprived of the right to stand for election.
In the incoming government, the CDU party will take control of the foreign office, the economy ministry, as well as the ministries for health, transport, digitalisation, and education. The SPD will take charge of finance, justice, labour and social affairs, defence, environment, and development aid and construction. The CSU is getting the interior ministry, research and technology, and agriculture."

For those who already forgot the first Trump trade war, we are nearing the time when everyone turns apocalyptically bearish and the White House leaks a bullish ""trade war deal"" trial balloon.
… we predicted that it would be ever so “slightly awkward when all the banks who made a recession their base case this week, make an unrecession their base case in 1 month.”
Will be so slightly awkward when all the banks who made a recession their base case this week, make an unrecession their base case in 1 month.
One day later, we were right…. but not even we had an idea just how right we would be. Because in what was perhaps the pinnacle of Wall Street flipflopping, arguably the most important US bank made announced just before 1pm that it had made a recession its base case… and 73 minutes later rescinded the call!
No really: here is the sequence of events. At12:57pm Goldman chief economist Jan Hatzius publishes a report titled “Moving to a Recession Baseline.”
Great… only 20 minutes later Trump steamrolled all over Wall Street’s laughable “scenarios” (as if they really don’t know how Trump negotiates yet), and blew up every single bearish scenario. And sure enough, at 2:10pm, or about 73 minutes after Hatzius emailed his first note, the Goldman chief economist published a note titled “President Trump Announces 90 Day Pause; Reverting to Our Previous Non-Recession Baseline.”
Just like that the first recession call is over.
And now we wait as the rest of Wall Street’s penguin crew falls in line and does the exact same thing."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/president-trump-touts-economy-boosting-policies-reassures-americans,"President Trump Touts Economy Boosting Policies, Reassures Americans",By Sean Miller,26 days ago,"On Wednesday morning President Donald Trump issued a series of posts on his Truth Social platform touting his economic policies of tariffs which aim to boost the domestic economy by bringing jobs back from overseas and increasing exports. He also pushed for tax cuts on American citizens, allowing for increased take-home pay and thus greater financial activity.
From stating how the current, lower, cost of entering the stock market, or purchasing more stock means its a good time to buy and not freak out, to outright telling Americans to “BE COOL”, the President is reassuring those who are upset by stock prices going down in response to his recent tariffs.
The President also said that it’s “IMPERATIVE” for Republicans in the House to pass the tax cut bill “NOW”, going on to mention how the decreased taxation of the American people will make the economy “Boom”.
“Republicans, it is more important now, than ever, that we pass THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL. The USA will Soar like never before!!!,” Trump said.
He also spoke to company heads who have bases overseas, telling them that now is the time to come home.
“This is a GREAT time to move your COMPANY into the United States of America, like Apple, and so many others, in record numbers, are doing. ZERO TARIFFS, and almost immediate Electrical/Energy hook ups and approvals. No Environmental Delays. DON’T WAIT, DO IT NOW!,” Trump said.
Notably, one should consider the advancements in A.I. and robotics which are taking place globally. Cheap Chinese factory workers will no longer have a cost advantage. Regardless of the greater societal implications of these technologies, re-shoring the manufacturing centers before China transitions to an all-robotic manufacturing system puts America first as humanity enters a brave new world."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/eu-scraps-equality-law-in-win-for-freedom-of-conscience,EU Scraps Equality Law in Win for Freedom of Conscience,By Adina Portaru | The European Conservative,26 days ago,"In a major victory for freedom of conscience, religious freedom, and personal autonomy, the European Commission recently announced that this summer, it would withdraw the Equal Treatment Directive (ETD), a highly problematic legislative proposal that sought to “implement the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.” One of the primary concerns with the ETD was its potential to force individuals and businesses to act against their deeply held beliefs. Christian business owners, such as florists, bakers, and photographers, would have been compelled to participate in events that violated their religious convictions, including same-sex weddings. A Jewish printer would, for example, not have been able to decline printing New Testaments, nor a Muslim cartoons of Mohammed. It also would not just have affected people of faith, since a vegan person would also not have been able to say no to creating ads for BBQ grills, despite their convictions concerning the need to protect animal life. The directive’s broad definitions could have led to legal challenges against business owners who refused, due to their deeply-held beliefs, to provide services for these types of events, even when doing so was in direct conflict with their conscience.
When originally introduced in 2008, the directive focused on preventing discrimination in the provision of goods and services based on disability. The proposal was then, however, radically expanded under pressure from the LGBT lobby to include “sexual orientation”. Over time, it grew into a sweeping initiative that threatened the core freedoms of individuals and businesses across the European Union. While the stated goal of the directive was to promote “equality,” this shift fundamentally altered the proposal, rendering it a threat to core freedoms by turning freedom of contract from the rule to the exception, imposing excessive bureaucratic burden and legal uncertainty, and privileging a few protected groups at the price of freedom for all other citizens.
Beyond religious freedom, the ETD would have impacted businesses more broadly by imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to equality. It would have stifled the diversity and autonomy that make businesses unique, forcing them to abandon their target demographics or face discrimination charges. For example, it would have prevented niche businesses, such as dating apps catering to specific age groups or religious communities, from operating freely.
Despite these evident concerns, the European Commission pushed forward with the ETD, though negotiations were slow and complex due to objections regarding subsidiarity and overreach. For more than a decade, we at ADF International worked alongside many tireless allies to raise awareness and advocate for its withdrawal to prevent the ETD from becoming EU-wide binding law. Over time, it became clear the ETD’s passage was unlikely due to a stalemate in negotiations in the Council of the EU.
The Commission’s decision to withdraw the directive, as stated in its 2025 Work Program, is a testament to the years-long advocacy efforts on behalf of those seeking to protect the fundamental freedoms of all European citizens. This victory highlights the power of coordinated, long-term efforts to defend freedoms of conscience and religion, for all.
Despite the withdrawal of the ETD, the fight for freedom is ongoing. We must remain vigilant because similar initiatives could resurface in the future. For now, however, we can celebrate this hard-earned victory, seeing that when individuals and organizations unite in defense of fundamental rights, we can ward off threats to fundamental freedoms."

The politicians made the pledges as they campaign for Canada’s general election, to be held in late April. The reasons for the policy are “the rise of misinformation,” and “foreign interference” – but also, fending off the perceived “assaults” on the country’s sovereignty coming from the Trump administration.
Carney wants to give CBC $150 million from federal funds as an initial sum to help the broadcaster meet its “renewed mission.” He spoke about making sure CBC does not become “subject to the whims of a small group of people led by ideology” – to then assert that the media space is currently “a sea of misinformation and disinformation.”
Critics would say that argument has at this point been seriously overused “by a small group of people led by ideology” hiding behind it while attempting to ensure control over public discourse, particularly via large legacy media outlets.
But Carney and Singh are still pushing the narrative about dramatic dangers from allegedly unprecedented levels of “disinformation,” with Singh claiming this is “endangering democracy.” CBC’s funding should also be increased “significantly” to deal with what is now being framed as “Trump’s attacks on Canadian sovereignty.”
The leader of the opposition and of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre, disagrees with this approach, arguing that Canada’s authorities “can’t go on spending money we don’t have on things we don’t need.”
Such policies lead to the economy’s further descent into inflation, Poilievre suggested, and said that if given the opportunity to serve as prime minister, he would focus on “cutting waste, bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and other unnecessary expenses to reduce taxes, debt, and inflation.”
In response to this, Carney labeled the Conservative leader as somebody who is also “attacking Canada’s institutions,” supposedly joining President Trump in this.
Poilievre has previously said that rather than receiving more money, the CBC should be defunded, but in a way that does not affect Radio-Canada (the French language public service).
That appears to be in line with the Liberal leader’s own statements about the need to “stay informed and tell our own stories in our own languages” – however, coming out of Poilievre’s mouth, the argument prompted Carney to accuse him of attempting to “split the baby,” and also, “attack Canada’s institutions” – à la Trump."

(LifeSiteNews) – The Trump administration revoked all nonessential funding from Maine’s Department of Corrections, citing the presence of a “transgender inmate” — a gender-confused male presenting himself as female — being held in a women’s prison.
Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the move this morning on Fox News’ morning show, Fox and Friends.
“We pulled all nonessential funding from the Department of Corrections in Maine because they were allowing a man in a women’s prison,” Bondi said while standing on the front lawn of the White House.
She described the gender-confused inmate as “a giant, 6-foot-1, 245-pound guy who committed a double murder with a knife, stabbed his parents to death and the family dog, and he identified as a woman!”
“So, they were letting him be housed in a female prison. No longer!” Bondi declared.
“We will pull your funding,” she warned. “We will protect women in prison. We will protect women in sports. We will protect women throughout this country. No more of that.”
Meanwhile, the Fox News chyron below Bondi explained “Maine loses $1.5+ million in federal grants for allowing trans women in female jails.”

The decision to withhold the funding aligns with Trump’s executive order (EO), “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” signed on Day One of his new administration.
Among its many provisions, the sweeping EO established that “Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.”
In particular, the “Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security” were directed to “ensure that males are not detained in women’s prisons or housed in women’s detention centers.”
It further charges the Attorney General to “ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex.”
“Taxpayer dollars shouldn’t fund policies that compromise prison security or enable bureaucratic overreach. Maine’s mismanagement exposed systemic failures in prioritizing ideology over basic safeguards,” DOGEai noted on X. “This correction reinforces fiscal responsibility while protecting both inmates and public resources from reckless governance.”
Since February, President Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills have clashed over gender-confused male athletes being allowed to compete in girls’ school sports in the Pine Tree State.
During his inauguration speech in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, Trump was unequivocal: “I will end the government policy to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.”
“As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States Government that there are only two genders; male and female,” he proclaimed."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/federal-judge-strikes-down-arkansas-social-media-digital-id-act-lawmakers-respond-with-revised-proposal-including-digital-id-and-vpn-age-checks,Federal Judge Strikes Down Arkansas’ Social Media Digital ID Act; Lawmakers Respond with Revised Proposal Including Digital ID and VPN Age Checks,By Didi Rankovic | Reclaim The Net,26 days ago,"Last week, a federal judge ruled to strike down the Social Media Safety Act (Act 689) – the Arkansas online age verification digital ID law – having concluded that some of its provisions were unconstitutionally vague and in violation of the First Amendment.
Representatives of the tech industry group NetChoice, which led the legal charge against Act 689, welcomed the decision, with litigation director Chris Marchese stating that it “protects Americans from having to hand over their IDs or biometric data just to access constitutionally protected speech online.”
However, a new proposal arrived soon after – Senate Bill 611 (SB 611). It was introduced in the Arkansas Senate by state Republicans to amend Act 689, as a way to address the constitutional concerns raised in US District Judge Timothy L. Brooks’ ruling.
The Social Media Safety Act of 2023 was promoted and adopted as a measure to protect minors from online harms. But Judge Brooks found that “Rather than targeting content that is harmful to minors, Act 689 simply impedes access to content writ large.”
SB 611 changes the original legislation with a new definition of a minor – previously a person 18 and under, now 16 and under – as well as the legal definition of social media platforms that are required to comply. But it continues to require that platforms implement “reasonable” age verification methods.
These methods include access to digital IDs or biometric data. VPN users are also in the crosshairs of the new proposal, as it would have platforms introduce age checks of residents of Arkansas accessing social media “while otherwise known or believed to be” in the state – and this would cover the use of VPNs.
Other changes limit the bill’s provisions only to new accounts, and ban platforms from algorithmic targeting of minors, while non-compliance would be penalized with fines.
SB 612 was introduced along with SB 611 as companion legislation that allows parents to sue social media companies in case their child commits or attempts suicide, or experiences mental or physical health harm because of exposure to online content “promoting, or otherwise advancing, self-harm or suicide.”
Some reports about SB 611 and its key requirements view it as part of a wider push in Arkansas that includes mobile state IDs and digital driver’s licenses, which have been recently introduced and provide for “infrastructure” that would be used by platforms to verify a user’s age."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/modis-underling-accused-of-human-trafficking-indians-to-the-usa,Modi’s Underling Accused Of Human Trafficking Indians To The USA,By Patrick Howley | Patrick Reports,27 days ago,"India prime minister Narendra Modi’s close political ally stands accused of human trafficking illegal immigrants to the United States of America, according to Indian court records and other materials exclusively obtained by PATRICK REPORTS.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. One of his party’s lawmakers, BJP member Satpal Jamba, is accused of orchestrating an illegal immigrant invasion of the U.S. mainland over the southern border through South and Central America and Mexico, allegedly with the help of his brother working in Ecuador.
“Satpal Jamba, a BJP-elected member of legislative assembly from Haryana, was arrested for human trafficking, shedding light on an (alleged) international smuggling operation that extends from India to the U.S. via Latin America,” a source stated to PATRICK REPORTS.
The accused human trafficker Satpal Jamba got elected to the Haryana Legislative Assembly in 2024 on Prime Minister Modi’s party ticket. Jamba’s elected position is Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). Satpal Jamba has been photographed repeatedly by Prime Minister Modi’s side.
Here is a photograph of Satpal Jamba with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Satpal Jamba is the man with the mustache standing to Modi’s right.
Here is another photograph of Satpal Jamba with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Satpal Jamba is the man with the mustache standing behind Modi to his left.
The case SATPAL V. STATE OF HARYANA was registered in Punjab-Haryana High Court on December 16, 2020. In this case, Satpal Jamba was reportedly petitioning to get bail after being accused of offenses including violating India’s 1983 Emigration Act Section 370, which pertains to human trafficking.
The 2020 court document states that numerous FIR’s (First Information Reports, aka police reports) have been filed against Satpal Jamba for his alleged human-trafficking efforts and that Jamba is an “habitual offender.”
The court document states: “The present FIR was registered on the complaint of one Aman Kumar who has stated that the petitioner, Satpal, had taken a sum of 18 Lacs for sending the complainant abroad. His flight was scheduled for 11.04.2019 from Delhi. Outside Delhi Airport, the relatives of Satpal had given him a flight ticket and $5000. The flight reached Ecuador. At Ecuador, the brother of the petitioner, namely, Sham had taken the dollars and the passport. Thereafter, they reached Colombia and…from Colombia they walked through jungles of Panama for five days. They reached Honduras country and from there they reached Mexico via Nicaragua and then from there they were sent to a camp for 15 days where they were arrested by the USA Border Police and they were lodged in jail for one year. The complainant returned to India thereafter.”
The court document states: “Learned counsel for the State, on instructions from SI Rohtash Singh, has stated that there are a total of 16 FIRs pending against the petitioner on similar allegations. She would further contend that the present case is one of human trafficking. Though the petitioner has been admitted to the bail in other cases, however, the petitioner does not deserve the concession of bail due to the fact that the petitioner is a habitual offender and has been sending innocent people abroad and thereafter the said people who are sent abroad have been languishing in jail.”
The court document states: “There are 16 other cases pending against the petitioner on similar allegations and in all the said FIRs Sections 24 and 25 of the Emigration Act have also been attracted. Keeping in view the fact that the petitioner is a habitual offender and also the fact that in the present case the allegations are of human trafficking and the fact that the complainant is alleged to have spent over a year in jail in a foreign country, I do not deem this to be a fit case for grant of regular bail to the petitioner. Hence, the present petition is dismissed. It is, however, made clear that any observation made herein shall not be treated as an expression of opinion on the merits of the case.”
Though his bail was denied, Satpal Jamba eventually got free and became a lawmaker from Modi’s party.
“To summarize what is happening, and the legal paper trail that exists,” the source explained: “The Punjab and Haryana High Court reviewed a case where a complainant,  Aman Kumar, accused BJP leader Satpal Jamba and his associates of taking ₹18 lakhs ($24,000) of facilitating his migration to the United States. Kumar’s illegal journey (allegedly) began in Delhi and led him through Ecuador, Colombia, and Mexico before being apprehended by authorities and deported back to India. His testimony (claimed) that Jamba’s brother confiscated his passport and extorted an additional $5,000 in Ecuador…Upon his return to India, Kumar filed a case against Jamba, resulting in an FIR under Sections 370 (trafficking of persons) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code, along with Section 24 of the Emigration Act, 1983. Jamba later sought bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which highlights the severity of his alleged crimes. He joined hands with Nayab Saini to protect him from further jail, and now the paper trail is disappearing.”
“This case is not an isolated incident but rather part of a broader pattern of human smuggling linked to the Indian government’s tacit approval of illegal immigration networks. What is terrifying is that the case of Satpal Jamba suggests cooperation between BJP-affiliated traffickers and Latin American smuggling groups, exploiting U.S. border vulnerabilities,” the source claimed.
The Trump administration has been dealing with a mass immigration problem, specifically from Punjab and Satpal Jamba’s home state of Haryana.
On February 5, 2025, the day President Trump’s deportation flight deposited 104 illegal migrants back in India, Satpal Jamba posted a photo of himself meeting with Nayab Saini, the Chief Minister of Haryana and a longtime BJP party boss and Modi ally.
Here is Satpal Jamba with Nayab Saini:
Our source said that political interests are “slowly wiping off the Internet” the available information about the issue. The allegations against Satpal Jamba are documented courtesy of a few Hindi-language news outlets, but have not yet been heard by an American audience.
A Hindi-language report posted by the Youtube account Voice of Panipat chronicles some of the allegations against Satpal Jamba. The video was posted in November 2024 and documents how some Indian people convened a “panchayat” assembly to address` local concerns about Satpal Jamba’s alleged sleazy dealings. The video was posted the month after Jamba won his legislative seat.
In the video (3:57 mark), a man makes devastating claims against Satpal Jamba. The man describes a male relative who allegedly got beaten by Jamba (“He beat him at least 100 times”) and another male relative who ended up becoming an alleged Jamba co-conspirator.
“That boy became Satpal Jamba’s agent and did the same work. A case is also registered against him in this matter. In this case, at least 10 FIR’s are registered against him. These are the first ten cases. We don’t know whom the government made MLA, whom this BJP gave ticket to. So understand what is the matter,” the man says in the video, according to Youtube translation.
“He is just a human trafficker. He has been doing human trafficking for 15 years,” the man says, according to Youtube translation.
Another video report posted by India News Haryana on December 1, 2024 covers the same panchayat against Satpal Jamba.
Another video report posted by Kaithal Breaking TV in November 2024 accuses Satpal Jamba of human trafficking.
“Somewhere Pundri MLA Satpal Jambha has lost his mental balance,” the speaker said in the video, according to the Youtube translation.
“What I mean to say is that he should have been in jail for human smuggling and human trafficking and people or the wind made him an MLA, so he is not able to handle it,” the speaker said, according to the Youtube translation.
“This matter will have to be taken forward and everyone knows everyone’s background. What was your background? What work did you do? How much work did you do for the people? How many days did you stay in jail? How many days did you stay in a foreign jail? Whom did you cheat? How many FIRs have been against you? The society knows…,” the speaker said in the video, according to the Youtube translation.
“There is no doubt that he was not worthy of being an MLA, but with the support of the public, he voted and became an MLA, but his activities are not worthy of the post of MLA,” the speaker said in the video, according to the Youtube translation.
“Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has reported a surge in Indian nationals crossing illegally into the U.S., particularly via Mexico,” our source explained. “Many arrive with fraudulent asylum claims, raising concerns about the exploitation of U.S. immigration policies. The use of cartel-controlled smuggling routes poses a national security risk,  as individuals entering illegally often destroy their documents before claiming asylum…The burden on U.S. taxpayers increases as more individuals enter the immigration system under fraudulent pretenses,” our source told PATRICK REPORTS.
“This is not just about illegal immigration; this is about how a foreign government and its political actors are complicit in human smuggling, undermining U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. I urge you  to investigate the Satpal Jamba case, connect the dots with rising Indian illegal immigration numbers,” the source said. “We need to inform the American public. We need to ensure the Trump administration knows…America and President Trump deserve to know the truth.”

The complaint, lodged on April 7, 2025, outlines what the plaintiffs describe as a deliberate and unconstitutional plan to obstruct Rumble Live and Rebel News Live, held on May 10–11, 2024 at a private venue in Downsview Park. Among the featured speakers at these events was Donald Trump Jr., alongside journalist Glenn Greenwald and lawyer David Freiheit.
We obtained a copy of the complaint for you here.
According to the 20-page Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs are seeking $37,177.80 in reimbursed costs for security fees they say were illegitimately forced upon them, plus $250,000 in punitive damages. The claim invokes violations under Section 2(b) and Section 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, referencing breaches of freedom of expression, misfeasance in public office, breach of fiduciary duty, and intentional interference with economic relations.
The legal filing argues that public officials knew the event was lawful and posed no public safety threat, yet still sought to prevent it due to its political content. “The Defendants acted together to avoid what they considered to be the negative political implications of a polarizing group hosting an event in a federally owned park,” the claim asserts.
Internal emails cited in the complaint show that senior staff at Canada Lands Company Limited, which manages Downsview Park, described Rebel News events as “undesirable,” with Director of Property Management Andrea Thompson asking legal counsel whether there might be any way to stop the gathering, despite acknowledging there was likely no legal basis to do so. “I am wondering if you think there is any language within the lease agreement that would permit us to stop this event from happening,” Thompson wrote. “Based on my review, I don’t think there is, but I would appreciate your opinion.”
The lawsuit also details that Toronto police were consulted and had reported “no information about security concerns and/or counter-protest groups.” Nevertheless, Canada Lands proceeded to impose over $37,000 in security-related expenses, including thousands for fencing and portable toilets. Rebel News’ actual rental fee for the venue, by comparison, was just over $7,000, with additional food and staff costs bringing the total base expenses to less than half the security bill.
The warehouse venue was secured under a formal agreement containing explicit protections for free speech. The contract read, “The Warehouse shall not cancel or postpone the event due to external pressures, including but not limited to public dissent, social media campaigns, safety concerns (other than those unrelated to the event), or politically motivated requests.”
Despite that language, the claim alleges the venue owner was pressured by federal officials to pass along the inflated costs to Rebel News under threat of cancelation if they refused to pay. “Mr. Silber was advised about the Unwarranted Costs and that if the Plaintiffs refused to pay, the Event would not be permitted to proceed,” the filing states. The plaintiffs paid under protest and “under duress” on May 7, 2024.
The events went forward as planned and concluded without incident. “The additional security presence and infrastructure for which the Plaintiffs were charged were unnecessary and many of the additional security officers were dismissed before the Event concluded,” the complaint says.
The Statement of Claim also accuses MP Ya’ara Saks of personal involvement in attempting to suppress the event, referencing her own public statements posted on X during the first day of the gathering. In that post, she labeled Rebel News “hateful and extremist,” stating: “While I am a strong supporter of the right to free speech, let me be clear that the vile views espoused by Rebel News are not welcome in York Centre.”
The complaint also connects this legal action to prior disputes between Rebel News and Saks, referencing a 2023 case where Rebel News was blocked from viewing MPs’ accounts on social media. A federal judge later ordered that access be restored.
This new lawsuit includes allegations of unlawful means conspiracy, negligence, and inducement of breach of contract. It maintains that officials sought to exploit their authority to financially pressure the plaintiffs into silence, stating, “The Defendants’ actions are contrary and inconsistent with a free and democratic society and the fundamental individual rights enshrined by the Charter.”
Ezra Levant and his legal team argue that this litigation is about more than reimbursement. “The Plaintiffs are correspondingly entitled to a compensatory remedy under Section 24(1) of the Charter,” the claim states, calling for not only redress but also a strong message from the courts condemning attempts by government actors to silence lawful expression.
The plaintiffs have requested a full trial to be held in Toronto."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/neck-and-neck-afd-surges-as-cdu-support-plummets-after-selling-out-to-socialists,Neck and Neck: AfD Surges as CDU Support Plummets After Selling Out to Socialists,By Zoltán Kottász | The European Conservative,27 days ago,"Only six weeks have passed since the German national elections, and the winner, the center-right CDU/CSU alliance, is already feeling the wrath of its voters—even before it has formed a government.
According to the latest opinion polls, released over the weekend, the alliance has lost a considerable amount of its support, dropping from the 28.5% it received on election day to 24%.
Germany, INSA poll:CDU/CSU-EPP: 24% (-3)AfD-ESN: 24%SPD-S&D: 16%GRÜNE-G/EFA: 11% (-1)LINKE-LEFT: 11%FDP-RE: 4%BSW-NI: 4% (-1)+/- vs. 28-31 March 2025Fieldwork: 31 March-4 April 2025Sample size: 1,206➤ https://t.co/obOCVirbpF pic.twitter.com/Lz970ivc49
To add insult to injury, the right-wing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is now neck and neck with the CDU/CSU: its support of 24% is the party’s highest-ever polling number, reflecting a 3.2-point increase compared to the AfD’s election performance.
As Alice Weidel, the co-leader of the anti-globalist party put it: the voters “do not want another left-wing government” in which the CDU/CSU allow the policies of the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens to be incorporated.
According to Hermann Binkert, the leader of the polling institute Insa, a winning party has never experienced such a loss of trust between the day of the election and the formation of the government.
The CDU/CSU is in talks to form a government with the SPD, and Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor and leader of the CDU, has already given in to the demands of the left-wing parties and broken many of his promises.
Before the election, he promised not to take on more debt for Germany and vowed to turn back illegal migrants at the border.
Instead, he has sought the support of both the SPD and the Greens to pass legislation that allows a massive €1 trillion debt to boost spending on defence and infrastructure, and in return has bowed to the wishes of the Greens on climate policies.
Merz has also made a U-turn on migration, as his future coalition partners, the Social Democrats, seek to bring in 500,000 migrants a year.
Though negotiations continue on forming a coalition, it seems that the incoming government’s policies are not far removed from those of the outgoing SPD-Green-coalition.
As Richard J. Schenk, a Research Fellow at MCC Brussels, commented in his opinion piece for europeanconservative.com:
A coalition agreement that bears the SPD’s handwriting only paves the way for the AfD to replace the CDU/CSU as the strongest political force.
As we recently reported, many local CDU organisations are fuming about Merz’s stance, and many have quit the party in response.
In an open letter to Merz and CDU Secretary-General Carsten Linnemann, the local CDU association in the eastern Potsdam-Mittelmark district has called for the party leadership to hold a ballot where the members of the party can decide whether to support the upcoming coalition deal with the Social Democrats.
“Many of our members no longer feel sufficiently represented and are openly thinking about leaving the party,” they said.
A similar plea was made by Johannes Winkel, the leader of the CDU’s youth wing, Junge Union. He said that his organisation would not sign off on a coalition deal if there is no visible change in policy compared to the outgoing left-wing government.
He reminded Merz that he had been elected party leader on a platform for change. “There must be no more of the same. This is especially true of the issues that shaped the election campaign: migration, the economy, the reduction of bureaucracy,” Winkel added."

“Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same,” the Israeli leader said, adding, “I’m a free trade champion, and free trade has to be fair trade.” However, Trump indicated he might not reduce tariffs on Israel. “We give Israel $4 billion a year,” Trump said, and quipped in a troll-like manner: “Congratulations by the way.” Watch the awkward scene play out of Bibi getting put in his place…
Q: Do you plan to reduce the tariffs your government put on Israeli goods?Trump: Maybe not. Don’t forget, we help Israel a lot. We give Israel 4 billion dollars a year, that’s lot. [Looks at Netanyahu] Congratulations by the way, that’s pretty good… pic.twitter.com/ODrv25eVFU
WATCH: President Trump Participates In Bilateral Meeting With Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahu
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington on Sunday for a visit to the White House, in a stay which is planned through Tuesday. The two leaders are meeting Monday afternoon.
He will be the first foreign leader to meet President Trump in-person in an effort to negotiate a deal to remove Trump’s tariffs, which for Israel is a 17% rate, the result of a significant US bilateral trade deficit.
“Upon his arrival in Washington with his wife, Sara Netanyahu, the premier headed from the airport to Blair House in a convoy, where he met with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer,” Israeli media wrote.
And Axios noted just ahead of the the trip that Israel tried to “avoid the tariffs Trump imposed on nearly every country in the world by announcing it would preemptively lift all tariffs on U.S. products. It didn’t work.”
This visit, which is Netanyahu’s second to the White House since Trump took office (the first was in early February), was by all accounts rather hastily put together, and also high on the agenda will be the Gaza crisis. Currently there are still 59 hostages still in Hamas and Islamic Jihad captivity – with many feared deceased.
Israel has controversially expanded the war, and now has Rafah surrounded once again and has ordered an evacuation of the civilian population. Hundreds of thousands have fled the southern Gaza city, also as basic necessities of life for the Palestinian population are running out.
Netanyahu’s office has has further indicated that “Israel-Turkey relations, the Iranian threat and confronting the International Criminal Court” will be on the agenda.
Trump may emerge from the meeting declaring that Israel is an example of how his tariff policy is working – that foreign capitals will come scrambling to negotiate.
One interesting aspect to Netanyahu’s travels is the impact the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant is having on his itinerary. He’s still not able to visit most of the European continent, and last week’s Hungary trip was the first, after Budapest declared it would not arrest him or cooperate with the ICC.
Times of Israel pointed out that “The Wing of Zion state plane took a flight path that increased the journey from Budapest to Washington by some 400 kilometers in order to avoid flying over countries seen as likely to enforce the arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court should the plane be forced to make an emergency landing.”
Isn't it interesting that Israel had huge tariffs on American goods, despite the billions in money we send them, and nobody who is currently outraged at Trump ever said anything about this nonsense? pic.twitter.com/iNmDSDuRnF
“As Israel believes that Ireland, Iceland and the Netherlands would all enforce the ICC warrant, issued for alleged war crimes in Gaza, Wing of Zion instead flew over Croatia, Italy and France,” the report added."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/this-is-a-race-issue-the-community-relations-service-gaslights-america-about-anti-white-violence,This Is a Race Issue: the Community Relations Service Gaslights America about Anti-White Violence,By Raw Egg Nationalist,28 days ago,"When I heard Austin Metcalf’s father talking about his son’s brutal murder and saying, quite calmly, that he had already forgiven his son’s killer—a black teenager—and didn’t want anybody to make the killing about race, a question entered my head. A familiar question. I’d asked it before, in similar circumstances, in the aftermath of other dreary murders of white people usually by black people. Did this man really mean what he was saying—or had he been told to say it?
But who would tell the father of a recently-murdered teenager to disavow a racial motive for his son’s killing, when the possibility was so blindingly obvious? Who would even have the power to do that?
Why?
The Community Relations Service (CRS), an organ of the Department of Justice—that’s who.
The how isn’t so clear—the Service is very shadowy, and we don’t have access to its interventions with grieving families of victims—but we know it does put pressure on people like Jeff Metcalf when their loved ones are killed. The why, at least, makes perfect sense. You only need eyes to see the huge edifice of anti-white prejudice that has been erected in recent years, across every area of public life in America, from the media and the workplace to the schools and universities and even the federal government. Anti-white racism has become a governing ideology and practice.
Don’t misunderstand me: I’m not saying the Community Relations Service definitely has spoken to Jeff Metcalf. We don’t know. It’s entirely possible that Jeff Metcalf is any number of things that could make a man renounce the natural emotions of a father whose son has just been murdered: He could be a Christian who is deeply committed to the principle of forgiveness, who rejects the law of an eye for an eye; or he could be a terminal libtard whose brain has been so fried by the programming that his first instinct is to curry favour with other libtards—to look “progressive” and “good” on TV—rather than reach for his sword and bow like the rest of us.
Either one is possible, or both.
But that doesn’t change the fact the Community Relations Service actually exists and that it exists, in one of its major functions, to cover up racial violence against white people.
According to its own website, the CRS “serves as ‘America’s peacemaker’’ for communities facing conflict based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.”
When such a conflict arises, the CRS jumps into action, “providing facilitated dialogue, mediation, training, and consultation” to help communities “come together, develop solutions to the conflict, and enhance their capacity to independently prevent and resolve future conflict.” The goal of the CRS throughout, the website claims, is to be “the neutral party.”
This is heavy bureaucratese, the kind of euphemistic language that’s used to mask activities that could be described in very simple terms. In this case, making sure the family and friends of murdered white people don’t kick up a fuss and draw attention to the problem of white people being murdered because of the colour of their skin.
Verified instances of the Community Relations Service at work are hard to come by, but until not that long ago—around the time I started publishing articles about it, actually—the Service’s website listed the killing of Donald Giusti as a case study of what it does when serving as “America’s peacemaker.”
Donald Giusti was smashed over the head with a rock and stomped to death by a mob of Somalis in a park in Lewiston, Maine, six years ago. Tensions between immigrants and locals, mainly in the park, had been building for weeks before the murder. It was the local police chief who decided to call in the CRS, “to help ease racial tensions and strengthen community relations,” as the website put it.
An essential part of the “peacemaking” process was getting members of the victim’s family to make public statements calling for calm. Giusti’s uncle and sister were both wheeled out for the press. Both read from the same script.
“We want to see things come to an end, we want people to be able to come to the park and be happy. Walk through the park and not be afraid,” said the uncle. The sister expressed her hope that her brother’s death would not be for nothing and that it would “give this community a voice to say something needs to give.”
But the CRS wasn’t finished there. It also intervened on the side of the man held responsible for landing the killing blow on Donald Giusti. Instead of being charged with murder, he was allowed to plead “no contest” to a reduced charge of criminal negligence. He was sentenced to just nine months in prison.
Nine months.
Like I said, verified instances of the CRS at work are hard to come by, and now the Donald Giusti “case study” has disappeared from the website, but these facts are more than enough to confirm what the Service is and what it does.
Here are some other recent cases where I think the ghostly hand of the CRS can be detected: the case of Aidan Clark, who was killed when a Haitian drove a minivan into a school bus in Springfield, Ohio (specifically, when the case was brought up in the recent election debate about Haitians in the Midwest); the case of Jonathan Lewis, a schoolboy who was kicked to death in an alleyway by a gang of black schoolboys in 2023; the case of Andy Probst, a former police chief who was deliberately run down and killed by two non-white teenagers on a joyride in a stolen car.
These are just three cases, but they all bear striking similarities. Look into them, look at the responses of the families, and you’ll see.
President Trump has already struck at the heart of the prevailing anti-white regime by dismantling diversity, equity and inclusivity programs and forcing a return to merit-based hiring and promotion. His immigration policies, and especially his flagship policy of mass deportation, if they’re successful will also be a stunning blow against that same enemy.
Another thing Trump should do, while he’s at it, is instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to go to work on the Community Relations Service.
Don’t just disband it; although of course that should happen. We need to know more about the CRS too. We need to know how it worked—exactly how it pressured parents and loved ones to say the things they said, in opposition to all reason and sense—and we need to know exactly how many cases, which and where, the Service took on.
The public disavowal of racial motives in killings like Austin Metcalf’s has helped to create a two-tier system in which white Americans are effectively second-class citizens, unable to access truth and justice on equal terms. A two-tier system is a form of oppression and may be deliberately constructed. Aristotle knew this 2,000 years ago when he wrote the Politics and described the art of the tyrant, how he fosters discord and strife and prefers foreigners over his own people in order to maintain his rule.
Anti-white racism has been a buttress for American tyranny. The Community Relations Service has to go, regardless of whether or not it got to Jeff Metcalf."

On Sunday, supporters of the National Rally leader gathered at the Place Vauban, close to Les Invalides and the tomb of Napoleon, to stage a protest against her conviction, which many see as a nakedly political attempt to sabotage the surging French right.
“For 30 years I have fought against injustice,” she told the crowd. “And I will continue to fight.”
Le Pen was flanked by her deputy Jordan Bardella. He gave a fiery speech in which he accused the French judiciary of trying to neuter the political opposition.
“March 29 was a dark day for France,” he said, referring to the date of Le Pen’s conviction.
“The people must be free to choose their leaders—without interference from political judges.”
Bardella was careful to state his party would respect the democratic protest, while denouncing judicial unions and warning of “a system determined to crush dissent.”
Supporters bore placards saying “Justice taking orders” and “Stop the judicial dictatorship,” or wore t-shirts bearing the slogan “Je suis Marine” (“I am Marine”).
Some compared her directly to President Donald Trump.
The verdict against Le Pen, which was delivered last week, has been widely attacked outside France, including by President Trump and Elon Musk.
Musk wrote on Twitter, “When the radical left can’t win via democratic vote, they abuse the legal system to jail their opponents.”
Italy’s Matteo Salvini, another populist leader, said, “This is a declaration of war by Brussels. We will not be intimidated, we will not stop.”"

https://www.infowars.com/posts/medicare-wont-expand-coverage-of-anti-obesity-drugs,Medicare Won’t Expand Coverage of Anti-Obesity Drugs,By Raw Egg Nationalist,28 days ago,"Medicare won’t cover anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound for its beneficiaries, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have announced.
In November 2024, the Biden administration proposed that weight-loss drugs should be covered by Medicare and Medicaid, which would have expanded access to almost 7.5 million Americans.
Older and low-income Americans with a body-mass index of more than 30 would have qualified under the rule. The expanded cover was estimated to cost taxpayers $35 billion over the next decade; although members of Congress on both sides said the cost would save many billions more in healthcare costs associated with obesity.
On Friday, however, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid released a final ruling that coverage would not be extended.
Although weight-loss medications can already be covered by Medicare for conditions like heart disease and diabetes, a 2003 law prevents the program from covering medication that is used directly for weight loss.
Medicare and Medicaid administer health coverage payments for more than 160 million people, spending one in five taxpayer dollars through Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and the Health Insurance Marketplace.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who heads the Department of Health and Human Services, has been a vocal critic of weight-loss medication, suggesting that it does nothing to solve the underlying causes of ill health.
During the election campaign, he said that if “every man, woman and child in our country” was given “good food, three meals a day… we could solve the obesity and diabetes epidemic overnight.”
Nevertheless, in December, as he was awaiting confirmation, Secretary Kennedy said drugs like Ozempic “have a place” in fighting obesity.
More than 200 million Americans are now overweight or obese.
Since 1990, rates have doubled. Around half of all adolescents in the US are overweight or obese, and three-quarters of adults.
Researchers have forecast that by 2050 more than 80% of adults and 60% of adolescents will be overweight or obese if current trends continue.
With 208 million overweight or obese people, the US has one of the highest rates of overweight and obesity worldwide.
Research has shown that obesity accounted for 335,000 deaths in 2021 in the US alone. Obesity is one of the most important and fastest-growing risk factors for chronic disease and early death.
Obesity also has enormous economic implications. A Congressional report published in 2024 predicted that obesity-related health costs will rise to $9.1 trillion over the next decade."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/labours-muslim-problem-blindness-or-self-deception,Labour’s Muslim Problem—Blindness or Self-Deception?,By Frank Haviland | The European Conservative,28 days ago,"The Left has a long, storied tradition of staring reality squarely in the face and refusing to believe their lying eyes. And nowhere is this more evident than the Left’s defence of multiculturalism—a project so disastrous that even its architects have admitted it to be dead. Yet here we are, in 2025, watching senior Labour politicians prancing around the corpse of cultural diversity, insisting it’s still got a pulse.
While the fabled benefits of multiculturalism are yet to materialise, its ill effects are now undeniable. In Britain, despite an impressive majority of 174 seats in last year’s general election, the Labour Party’s diversity chickens have finally come home to roost. First we were treated to the shameful spectacle of Angela Rayner, begging male Muslim voters (naturally, there were no women in sight) not to oust her from her Ashton-under-Lyne seat; promising that if Labour got into power it would ‘recognise Palestine.’ The clip is a painful, but necessary watch—more reminiscent of a hostage video than a party political broadcast:
Next up was the soi-disant feminist firebird of Birmingham Yardley, Jess Phillips. Last July, Phillips clung to her seat by a wafer-thin 693 votes—hardly a mandate to write home about. During her victory speech she was heckled by a mob of pro-Palestine activists, notably predominantly Muslim men, who chanted “Free Palestine” and “Shame on you.” When asked about the abuse, however, Phillips pooh-poohed the suggestion that the abuse was sectarian, as “too simple” an explanation:
People want desperately for me to announce that the people shouting at me and barracking me were Muslim men.
The fact that they were men is quite significant to me—the fact that they were Muslim is not significant because there are Muslim people in my constituency who didn’t behave like this.
These people were idiots. They didn’t do it because they were Muslim—they did it because they were idiots, and they wanted something for themselves, and they used a terrible tragedy to get that.
There you have it—no reason not to berate ‘the patriarchy,’ but the Muslim element had absolutely nothing to do with it. The fact that her constituency is almost 43% Muslim clearly doesn’t faze Jess, especially when being ‘pro-Gaza’ apparently gets you better treatment on the NHS.
Last week, it was the turn of former Leicester South MP, Johnathan Ashworth, who was tipped for a cushy cabinet post under Keir Starmer before shockingly losing his seat to relative unknown Shockat Adam, a pro-Gaza independent who rode a wave of Muslim votes to victory. Interviewed in The Telegraph, Mr Ashworth claimed that multiculturalism hasn’t failed, and rejected the notion that the loss of his seat ought to give him pause for thought:
In my case, in my seat, there was a huge, huge, huge strength of feeling about the issue of Gaza, which I understand. People felt that somehow, if I had voted for an SNP rebel amendment, that would have delivered a ceasefire.
Of course it wouldn’t, and the campaigners who said so were obviously being dishonest. But that’s the rough and tumble of politics. I don’t think it’s a failure of multiculturalism, not at all.
‘The rough and tumble of politics’ John-boy?! You were chased out of your own patch by a baying mob screaming “Genocide John”, and were forced to take refuge in the local vicarage!
Here’s what Ashworth said at the time, although of course (like Phillips) he failed to make the multicultural connection to the extremism:
I have never known a campaign of such vitriol, such bullying, such intimidation built on the foul and obnoxious lie that I was responsible for genocide. That I had the blood of Gazan children on my hands.
This is the campaign that was run by a minority of bullies, and loud mouths. This is not representative of the many, many Muslim constituents I was proud to represent. This is not Muslim values.
Here’s the rub: data  screams that he’s wrong. According to a 2024 poll commissioned by the Henry Jackson Society, 46% of UK Muslims support Hamas, and the majority does not believe the terrorist group committed murder and rape on October 7. Also 46% of Muslim respondents said they believe that Jews have too much influence, in comparison to 16% of the general public.
It’s hardly a shock that White Brits are now minorities in the nation’s largest cities, but if the multicultural hymn sheet had any validity this wouldn’t matter, thanks to the high levels of integration observed by Britain’s latest influx. The promised integration is a myth however: almost a million migrants can barely speak English.
Even the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Trevor Phillips, admitted a decade ago that Muslim integration is not going to happen: “Continuously pretending that a group is somehow eventually going to become like the rest of us is perhaps the deepest form of disrespect.”
‘Diversity is our strength’ is now a busted flush, and even its most die-hard advocates look a little embarrassed when parroting the line.
Which begs the question, what precisely are Ashworth and his ilk playing at? Are the Left genuinely so deluded they cannot see the reality in front of them, or is this myopia a mere cynical ploy to cling to office if not to power? Special cases aside, I generally credit the opposition with more intelligence than they choose to advertise in their shop window—and we’d better hope that’s the case—because if Starmer et al are truly as blind as they seem to be, then Britain on its current trajectory is finished.
The likely (and egregious) explanation is that Ashworth and co. know the score full well, and are simply too wedded to the votes mass immigration generates to come clean. In his interview with The Telegraph, Ashworth simultaneously claimed multiculturalism in Britain is not failing, and at the same time (no longer an MP) clearly felt confident enough to reveal that he has urged the Prime Minister to consider immigration caps for certain sectors of the economy, in order to curb numbers.
Unimpressed by the likes of Angela Merkel, David Cameron and Nicholas Sarkozy, all of whom admitted 15 years ago that multiculturalism was an abject failure, Starmer’s government may dodge the post-mortem for now. Rayner can beg for votes all she likes, Phillips can blame ‘idiots’ rather than Muslims, and Ashworth may feel secure heading up the Labour Together think tank, but the reality of multiculturalism will catch up with them one way or another. Most likely they will only lose their seats, unlike the rest of us who are losing our country."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-first-idaho-legalizes-firing-squads-for-pedophiles,US First: Idaho Legalizes Firing Squads for Pedophiles,By Raw Egg Nationalist,28 days ago,"Courts in Idaho will be able to impose the death penalty on individuals convicted of aggravated lewd conduct with minors aged 12 or younger, with firing squad as the main method of execution.
Governor Brad Little signed into law a bill that will create a new criminal charge punishable by execution.
To seek the death penalty, prosecutors must show at least three of 17 specific aggravating factors. These include multiple incidents of abuse, the use of force, and the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease to the victim.
In cases that do not qualify for the death penalty but involve children up to the age of 16, mandatory prison sentences will apply.
Governor Little said the highest possible punishment should be reserved for those who sexually abuse children.
“Just like capital murder destroys lives, aggravated sexual abuse of a young child devastates victims and families for generations,” the Governor said.
State politicians have praised the legislation, saying existing laws were too weak.
According to State Representative Bruce Skaug, the new law “establishes a strong deterrent, making it clear Idaho will not tolerate these offenses.”
“Idaho currently has some of the most lenient statutes for child molestation and child rape in the nation.”
The new law will go into effect on 1 July."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/bessent-50-countries-want-to-lower-tariffs,Bessent: 50+ Countries Want To Lower Tariffs,By Raw Egg Nationalist,28 days ago,"“More than 50 countries” have now approached the Trump administration to make deals to lower tariffs and reduce trade barriers, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, after President Trump’s announcement of “reciprocal tariffs” on Wednesday sent shockwaves across the world.
“More than 50 countries have approached … the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation,” Bessent told NBC’s Kristen Welker on Sunday.
“And… they’ve been bad actors for a long time. And it’s not the kind of thing you can negotiate away, be it in days or weeks.”
Trump’s announcement of the tariffs on Wednesday—which he called “Liberation Day”—caused panic at home and abroad, and a record two-day decline in stock-market value of $5 trillion. Prices for oil and commodities plummeted, as investors sought a measure of safety in government bonds.
The 10% baseline tariff took effect at 12.01 am ET on Saturday. At 12.01am ET on Wednesday, Trump’s higher “reciprocal” tariff rates, varying from 11% to 50%, will also take effect. Imports from the European Union will face a 20% tariff, while Chinese goods will be subject to an additional 34% tariff, bringing the total Trump has imposed on China to 54%.
In his interview, the Treasury Secretary described the tariffs as a “one-time price adjustment.”
“Have you expressed any concerns to President Trump directly that his tariff policy could be inflationary?” Welker asked Bessent.
“No, what I have said is tariffs are a one-time price adjustment,” Bessent responded.
“So, there’s a big difference between insipid, endemic inflation within the system and consistent price-level increases and a one-time adjustment.”
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent obliterates NBC's Kristen Welker on tariffs with numbers:""Kristen, what I like is data…A 20% tariff on China led to a 0.7% price level increase over 4 years. I think that's pretty good…The little-publicized story this week: everyone wants to… pic.twitter.com/uNlaIll4Pw
President Trump has stressed that his tariffs will cause an “economic revolution.”
“We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,’ but not any longer,” the President wrote on Truth Social, on Saturday.
“We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast!”
“THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,” he added. “HANG TOUGH, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/geofenced-every-event-democrats-caught-staging-another-inorganic-color-revolution-operation-against-trump,“Geofenced Every Event” – Democrats Caught Staging Another Inorganic Color Revolution Operation Against Trump,By Zero Hedge,29 days ago,"Far-left, billionaire-funded NGOs—closely aligned with the rudderless and imploding Democratic Party—have been waging a psychological warfare operation against the American people.
Framed as “grassroots,” the party of hate and violence—evident in their “Tesla Takedown” color revolution aimed at killing Tesla to pressure Elon Musk on DOGE—has been building momentum in recent weeks to segue into anti-Trump protests this weekend.
The goal is to manufacture the illusion that Trump is wildly unpopular, leveraging a vast network of dark money-funded NGOs that supply rent-a-protesters to rallies nationwide.
Ahead of anti-Trump protests, we uncovered the Democratic Party’s NGO war machine, totaling 186 NGOs, unions, and other radical leftist groups that supported Saturday’s mass mobilization efforts of rent-a-protesters and, of course, a grassroots component of the protests (mainly old white angry liberals).
Late Friday, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow openly boasted about the Democratic Party’s color revolution operation, even giving airtime to Ezra Levin of the NGO Indivisible Project, who attempted to convince the audience that the anti-Musk and anti-Trump protests are organic…
Listen to this Dem warrior speak.
…but as data analyst Tony Seruga revealed, the protest in Chicago drew only 7,500 attendees, with “92% having attended five or more Kamala Harris rallies, Antifa/BLM events, or pro-Hamas, pro-Palestinian protests.” He noted that CBS News attempted to claim “thousands” were present while organizers inflated the number to 30,000.
Here’s more about Seruga’s data:
Organizers are claiming 30,000. CBS states a vague ‘thousands’.
92% having attended 5 or more Kamala Harris rallies, antifa/blm, pro-Hamas, pro-Palestinian protests.
For more insight into what data we also look at in addition to GPS location data would be demographic and psychographic data using over 6,000 different databases, i.e., like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Pew Research Center, market research firms like YouGov, Experian, specialized tools like ESRI’s Tapestry Segmentation, consumer surveys, social media platforms like 𝕏, Facebook, Linkedin.
Demographic data includes basic characteristics like age, gender, income, education level, occupation, marital status, family size, ethnicity, and where people live (e.g., city, state).
Psychographic data dives deeper into people’s lifestyles, values, attitudes, interests, personality traits, social class, activities, and how they make purchasing decisions. For example, it might show if someone values sustainability, enjoys outdoor activities, participates in community activism.
While demographic data is straightforward, psychographic data can reveal sensitive personal details, like beliefs even life goals.
Additionally, by cross pollinating each device with other devices regularly within close proximity to the target device we are able to build a detailed profile for each target.
We have identified these six groups.
Once again, this is based a very sophisticated algorithm that looks at the behavioral metrics for each device, including the physical 1:1 proximity to leaders and paymasters from these groups in the past.
Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project, Troublemakers, the Democratic Socialists of America and the Muslim Brotherhood.
We have also identified 11 additional groups paying for protests, demonstrations and riots, many are linked to foreign bad actors in countries funding terrorism.
Seruga’s data from the Chicago rally closely mirrors the protest in Denver a few weeks earlier, in which he pointed out: “84% of the devices present had attended 9 or more Kamala Harris rallies, antifa/blm, pro-Hamas, pro-Palestinian protests, 31% had attended over 20.”
Seruga warned the Democratic Party: “GPS—We have geofenced every event. This is not going to end well for the NGOs and non-profits below.”
The American people need to understand that the Democratic Party has deployed color revolutions—psychological operations disguised as popular uprisings—using rent-a-protesters to manufacture artificial sentiment. It’s important to note that U.S. intelligence agencies use these same statecraft operations to topple governments overseas.
The problem here is that the Democratic Party’s color revolution operation could gain enough momentum—just like their Color Revolution 1.0: the BLM riots. As Seruga warned: “This summer there 100% will be massive riots, anarchy, looting, burning and violent attacks,” adding, “Our nation will soon be under a brutal attack by filthy, communist, scumbag, satanic, evil, traitors. Prepare! They are organizing now!”
However, those waging the color revolution with regime change as their end goal—and who are willing to unleash chaos across the nation—now face a significant problem. We’ve already seen crazed Democrats resort to domestic terrorism by firebombing Tesla vehicles and showroom locations…
The days of taxpayer-funded color revolutions—think BLM riots—are over for now, and million-person marches may be more challenging to achieve. Yet leftist billionaires continue pouring money into these dark NGOs.
If these color revolutions aim to sway public perception and manufacture consent for regime change, then the latest polling data from  DailyMail.com/J.L. Partners show failure:
President Donald Trump is more popular now than before he sent the global markets into a frenzy by enacting sweeping new tariffs.
An exclusive DailyMail.com/J.L. Partners survey of over 1,000 registered voters conducted from March 31 to April 3 found that the Republican remains largely popular in the U.S.
The poll found that Trump’s approval rating rose to 53 percent, a 4-point increase over last week when it was 49 percent.
Trump’s rising approval rating is surprising given the flak the White House has received over the tariff order signed Wednesday.
It is up by 13 points since March 7 among those aged 18 to 29.
Trump also saw a six-point increase in favorability among Democrats and independents, according to the survey.
The Republican’s support among black voters skyrocketed 17 points since last week, the poll found.
When it comes to Trump’s universal 10 percent tariff on all goods coming in from other countries, more Americans support the policy than oppose it.
As the nation witnessed during the Democratic Party’s BLM riots under Trump’s first term, this psychological warfare—fueled by controlled leftist MSM narratives, emotion-driven activism, and rent-a-protester networks—is extremely dangerous and often engineered to create chaos.
There should be an investigation into whether the billionaire-funded leftist NGOs—currently attempting to stage destabilization in the U.S., similar to the BLM riots—are backed by foreign interests, including governments, intelligence agencies, or NGOs with sinister anti-American motives. This raises serious national security concerns, as such movements could escalate into widespread unrest, leading to riots, violence, economic disruption, and even civil conflict."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/obama-lashes-out-at-trump,Obama Lashes Out at Trump,By RT,29 days ago,"Former US President Barack Obama has said that he is “deeply concerned” by the policies that the country’s current leader, Donald Trump, has pursued since the start of his second term in office.
During his speech at Hamilton College in New York State on Thursday, Obama criticized the Trump administration’s protectionist economic policies, attempts to tackle federal spending, clampdown on immigration, and treatment of the media.
He denounced the sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump earlier this week on the majority of US trading partners, saying: “I do not think what we just witnessed… is going to be good for America.”
However, the 63-year-old Democrat stressed that the tariffs are just one policy, and that he is “more deeply concerned with a federal government that threatens universities if they don’t give up students who are exercising their right to free speech,” referring to actions taken against pro-Palestinian demonstrators.
The Trump administration’s pressure on law firms and its decision to bar AP journalists from accessing the Oval Office reflect “a kind of behavior [that] is contrary to the basic compact we have as Americans,” the former president said.
“Imagine if I had pulled Fox News’ credentials from the White House press corps. It is unimaginable that the same parties that are silent now would have tolerated behavior like that from me or a whole bunch of my predecessors,” he argued.
The former president concluded his message by saying that “history zigs and zags and there are times of conflict and there are times of stupidity and there are times of danger.”
Trump slammed Obama at the height of the race for the White House last year, calling the former president “a jerk” and saying that he “divides this country” by campaigning for then-Democratic contender Kamala Harris."

“We cannot move forward unless people are held accountable and I mean very, very senior people and they all know who I’m talking about,” Gen. Flynn told the Man In America podcast last month.
And here is, General Michael Thomas Flynn, a three-star United States Army with 33 years of service, 4 Bronze Stars, 5 Commendation Medals…@GenFlynn : “We cannot move forward unless people are held accountable… They all know who I am taking about.

“Start with Obama and work your way down,” Flynn said, adding, “I mean…maybe you don’t throw a former president into prison — but maybe you do. Maybe somebody says, ‘Well…who directed you John Brennan? Who directed you, Jim Clapper? Who directed you, Susan Rice?’ Under oath, under the lights.”
Flynn argued the officials could speak if threatened with prison time.
“With the threat of prison, okay? And say, ‘Who directed you?'” Flynn said.
“Well…if they say nothing, okay, then that’s fine, then you’re going to go to prison. You’re going to prison…for treason, okay? Treason, that’s a very strong word; it’s a very strong word.”
Flynn went on to say that while the leftist establishment labeled him a traitor during Trump’s first term – despite his innocence – it’s actually members of the Obama administration guilty of traitorous activity.
“The treason was committed against me, as not just Mike Flynn, an army general, but the National Security Advisor by a duly-elected President of the United States,” Flynn said.
“The outgoing Administration under Barack H. Obama committed treason. They committed a conspiracy to overthrow the United States government, and it hasn’t stopped.”

Al Green of Texas has said he’ll bring articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump within the next 30 days.
Green made the promise at a “Hands Off!” rally in Washington DC on Saturday.
“We need a Senate that will convict him this time, and I want you to know, from my heart, from my heart, I understand that he is a Goliath,” Green told the crowd.
“He is a Goliath. He has control of the generals in the military. He has control of the Justice Department. He has control of the Republican Party, but my friends, my friends, for every Goliath, there is a David.”
Green was, of course, referring to himself.
“And I want you to know, Mr. President, this David is going to bring articles of impeachment against you within the next 30 days. Within the next 30 days, I’m bringing articles of impeachment. I’m coming for you. Mr. President, this David is coming for you.”
Green had already vowed to bring articles of impeachment against President Trump, claiming he doesn’t “deserve” to hold office.
On 5 February, in a speech on the House floor, Green said he would file articles of impeachment over Trump’s suggestion of taking control of the Gaza Strip.
“Injustice in Gaza is a threat to justice in the United States of America,” Green said.
At the rally in Washington on Saturday, Rep. Green reiterated that Gaza “is not going to become a resort.”
During Trump’s first term, Green led a number of hopeless attempts to have Trump impeached, including for referring to illegal immigrants as “invaders” who should “go back” to their countries of origin."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/hands-off-protesters-gather-for-rallies-organized-by-soros-backed-activist-group,HANDS OFF! Protesters Gather for Rallies Organized by Soros-backed Activist Group,By Raw Egg Nationalist,29 days ago,"Thousands of protestors gathered across the US on Saturday for a series of “Hands Off!” rallies coordinated by a Soros-funded activist group.
“With Trump and congressional Republicans doubling down on their agenda to gut essential services, everyday Americans are sending a clear message: Take your hands off our healthcare, our Social Security, our civil rights, our freedom, and our education,” the rally organizers said in a statement, according to CBS News.
Videos posted to social media show activists in Washington DC and New York City.
The rallies have received major support from Indivisible, an organization that has received around $8 million from George Soros’s Open Society Foundations since 2017.
Cofounder of Indivisible Ezra Levin spoke to Rachel Maddow on MSNBC before the protests and said there would be protests in every state involving “normal, everyday people who are saying, ‘Hey, I’ve had enough. I’ve seen the institutions fall. I’ve seen the universities. I’ve seen businesses. I’ve seen law firms not stand up not support our liberal democracy. So what am I going to do as an individual? Well, I’m going to do my part. I’m going to show up.’”
Left-wing group Indivisible’s cofounder Ezra Levin says the group has been pushing Saturday’s “Hands Off” protests around the country. pic.twitter.com/EugShxSb7M
Indivisible was also providing a form for people to fill in to stage their own local protests. The form states, “This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.”
The activist group also provides various other free tools for protestors, including messaging and slogans for signs and a wide array of printed materials.
Indivisible have been major players in coordinating the new “resistance” to President Trump. The group has been leading attempts to force Chuck Schumer to resign and also coordinating protests against Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
The group’s co-executive director Ezra Levin announced the plan to oust Schumer shortly after the recent funding bill passed, with Schumer’s help: “Senator Schumer should step aside as leader. Every Democrat in the Senate should call for him to do so, and begin making plans for new leadership immediately.”
He added that the wrangling over the spending bill should have been used by Democrats as a “rare, precious point of leverage,” but “Schumer did the opposite. He led the charge to wave the white flag of surrender.”
Indivisible is also coordinating protests against Elon Musk and his work as head of DOGE, including offering $200 payments to activists to take part in “Musk or us”-themed protests."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/boasberg-may-hold-trump-officials-in-contempt-over-deportation-flights,Boasberg May Hold Trump Officials in Contempt over Deportation Flights,By Raw Egg Nationalist,29 days ago,"The Obama-appointed judge who blocked President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan gang members, is considering holding officials in contempt of court for their role in allowing deportation flights to take place.
Judge James Boasberg said the administration acted in “bad faith” on 15 March when it sent three deportation flights loaded with hundreds of suspected gang members, at the same time as Boasberg was preparing an emergency court hearing on the legality of the flights.
At a hearing on Thursday, during which he grilled members of the Department of Justice, Boasberg said he is considering holding officials in contempt of court.
According to Politico, Boasberg could impose fines or jail time, and he could even attempt to order El Salvador, where hundreds of the deportees were taken, to return them.
Boasberg has not yet said who in particular he believes was in contempt of court.
It is unusual, but not unprecedented, for executive-branch officials to be held in contempt of court. In Trump’s first term, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos was held in contempt and fined $100,000 for violating a court order.
Judge Boasberg also drew attention to the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who some are claiming was wrongly deported to El Salvador as a suspected MS-13 member.
“Lo and behold, at least one that we know of shouldn’t have been there in the first place,” Boasberg said.
The day after Boasberg’s hearing, another Obama judge ordered Garcia man to be returned to the US by Monday at midnight.
“This was an illegal act,” Judge Paula Xinis told a Justice Department lawyer, according to Politico.
“Congress said you can’t do it, and you did it anyway.”
According to the White House, the man in question, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was a member of the criminal gang MS-13, which has now been designated a terrorist organization. He is said to have been involved in human trafficking. He was apprehended in Maryland last month, before being flown to El Salvador, where he now resides in President Nayib Bukele’s fearsome CECOT prison.
Judge Xinis, however, said that the accusation of gang membership is “just chatter.”
“In a court of law, when someone is accused of membership in such a violent and predatory organization, it comes in the form of an indictment, a complaint, a criminal proceeding that has robust process so we can assess the facts,” Xinis added.
In response to Judge Xinis’s decision, the White House, via Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, issued a defiant statement.
“We suggest the Judge contact President Nayib Bukele because we are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador.”
Rumours that Garcia was not a gang member have been circulating for at least a week. On Tuesday, Leavitt shut down these rumours during a press conference, stating unequivocally that the Trump administration knows Garcia was a member of MS-13 and that he was involved in human trafficking.
“The administration maintains the position that this individual was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country and was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/watch-nancy-pelosi-demands-reciprocal-tariffs-on-china-in-1996-house-speech,WATCH: Nancy Pelosi Demands Reciprocal Tariffs on China in 1996 House Speech,By Raw Egg Nationalist,29 days ago,"Footage has resurfaced on social media of Nancy Pelosi demanding reciprocal tariffs against China to rebalance the US trade deficit with China.
Pelosi has been a staunch critic of President Trump’s new wave of tariffs, which were unveiled on Wednesday.
In response to the wide-ranging duties, Pelosi said, “Donald Trump’s reckless tariffs will cause chaos in our economy, raise prices for consumers and hurt hardworking American families.”
“This is not a strategy—it’s the largest tax hike on the American people in history,” she added.
But back in 1996, a much fresher-faced Pelosi was singing a different tune.
Incredible clip from 1996. Nancy Pelosi on tariffs and the trade deficit with China.""On this day, your member of Congress could have drawn the line to say to the President of the United States, do something about this US-China trade relationship that is a job loser for the… pic.twitter.com/DFlQ9wWSKh
“How far does China have to go?” Pelosi asked.
“How much more repression, how big a trade deficit and loss of jobs for the American worker, and how much more dangerous proliferation has to exist before members of this House of Representatives will say, ‘I will not endorse the status quo.’ As I mentioned, it’s about jobs, proliferation, and human rights. And there are those who say we shouldn’t link human rights and trade and proliferation and trade; I disagree. But if we just want to take up this issue on the basis of economics alone, Indeed, China should not receive most favored nation status for several reasons that I’d like to go into now.”
Pelosi then produced a chart not unlike President Trump’s to demonstrate the trade deficit, which at that time stood at $34 billion.
The Democrat Congresswoman from California went on to question the disparity between American (2%) and Chinese (35%) tariffs, asking “Is that reciprocal?”
She described the effects of this economic imbalance on American jobs as “the biggest and cruelest hoax of all.”
“Not only do we not have market access, not only do they have prohibitive tariffs, not only are our exports not let in very specifically, but China benefits with at least, at least 10 million jobs from US China trade.”
What a difference a few decades can make."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/colorado-house-approves-bill-that-could-allow-state-to-seize-children-from-parents-if-they-misgender-them,Colorado House Approves Bill That Could Allow State To Seize Children from Parents if They Misgender Them,By Raw Egg Nationalist,29 days ago,"Parents could have their children taken from them if they “misgender” them, under the terms of a bill that was just approved in Colorado’s Democrat-controlled State House.
On Friday, the Colorado State House passed bill HB25-1312, “Legal Protections for Transgender Individuals,” which makes “misgendering” any individual, including a child, a discriminatory action. The legislation also permits the state to take children from their parents if they’re guilty of “misgendering.”
The bill also protects parents from prosecution for seeking “gender-affirming care” for their children.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Rebekah Stewart, argued the legislation would actually protect children.
“Supporting a child’s gender identity is indeed in the best interest of the child, and that support cannot be used against a loving and supportive parent in a dispute,” she said.
“This bill is truly the least that we can do. Frankly, I wish that we didn’t have to bring this bill, but the reality of navigating the world today as a transgender human necessitates it.”
Colorado Republicans slammed the bill.
“The idea that misgendering your own child is considered coercive control, which is another word for child abuse, because you want to get your child help instead of affirming their delusions… this is the most disgusting bill I’ve seen so far,” said GOP State Rep. Jarvis Caldwell, from Colorado Springs.
Bill HB25-1312 now passes to the State Senate, which is also controlled by the Democrats, and from there to Democrat Governor Jared Polis."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-popularity-increases-with-tariffs,Trump Popularity Increases with Tariffs,By Raw Egg Nationalist,29 days ago,"President Donald Trump’s approval rating has increased since he unleashed a wave of new tariffs on America’s trading partners.
According to new polling from The Daily Mail, Trump’s approval rating has risen to 53%, an increase of 4%, between 31 March and 3 April.
As The Mail notes, Trump’s rising approval rating is surprising given the flak the White House has received over the tariff order signed Wednesday.”
Support among 18-29 year olds is up a whopping 13% since 7 March, and 17% among black voters since last week.
Trump has also seen a 6% increase among Democrats and independents.
With regard to his tariff policy in particular, the polling suggests more Americans support than oppose it. The same was also true for his policy of increasing tariffs.
Voters also broadly support tariffs that touch specific sectors like aviation, plastics, precious metals, and iron and steel.
The 10% baseline tariff took effect at 12.01 am ET on Saturday and represents “the single biggest trade action of our lifetime,” according to former White House trade adviser Kelly Ann Shaw.
Among the countries subject to the 10% tariff are Australia, Britain, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
At 12.01am ET on Wednesday, Trump’s higher “reciprocal” tariff rates, varying from 11% to 50%, will take effect. Imports from the European Union will face a 20% tariff, while Chinese goods will be subject to an additional 34% tariff, bringing the total Trump has imposed on China to 54%.
Canada and Mexico are exempt from Trump’s latest duties because they remain subject to an earlier 25% tariff related to the fentanyl and illegal immigration crises. Trump is also excluding goods subject to separate 25% national-security tariffs, which include steel and aluminum, cars, trucks and auto parts.
The new tariffs are expected to force foreign countries to the negotiating table. Vietnam, which was hit with one of the highest tariff rates—46%—has already agreed to discuss new trade terms with Trump.
Trump’s announcement of the tariffs on Wednesday sent out a global shockwave, causing a record two-day decline in stock-market value of $5 trillion. Prices for oil and commodities plummeted, as investors sought a measure of safety in government bonds."

Now one, one, one, one bit of good news coming out all this — it’s, it’s all pretty solid proof that there is no Deep State. Cuz if there was, they would have stopped this.
Okay. But if they do exist, I just want to say to the cabal of financial and governmental elites who pull all the strings behind the scenes: maybe put a pause on your 5G chip, JFK Jr, adrenochrome, chemtrail orgy, and jump in here.
Cuz we’re dying.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/munich-revisited-why-jd-vance-was-right-about-europes-leaders-two-months-on,"Munich Revisited: Why JD Vance Was Right about Europe’s Leaders, Two Months on",By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"JD Vance was right. So right.
Back in February, the Vice President travelled to Munich, Germany, with a message for Europe’s entire political elite. It was a message they didn’t want to hear, but the VP was determined to deliver it anyway.
“The threat I worry most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia,” Vance told a stunned, deathly silent auditorium.
“It’s not China. It’s not any external actor. What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.”
This was actually a polite way of telling Europe’s elite they are traitors to their nations and people; that they are destroying what it is their sacred duty to protect.
The message was received.
The only people clapping were members of the Vice President’s entourage. At least one European politician—and a man, at that—actually burst into tears afterwards, so great was his shock about being confronted with the truth. Ursula Von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, looked like she’d taken a silver stake to her shrivelled little heart.
Europe’s politicians and media united to portray the speech as a declaration of war against Europe, as a betrayal in its own right. The nation that once saved Europe has now turned its back. Allies no more.
But Vance’s speech was nothing of the sort. In fact, it was a speech of unity, not division. Here’s what he was saying. The American and European people have suffered under the same yoke—the yoke of globalism, of open borders at all costs, of rootless cosmopolitanism and the desire for endless growth—but now the American people are throwing it off. If the European people want America’s help to do the same, it will be forthcoming. But America will not help Europe’s elites to continue burying the ideals and the people that made European civilization the greatest the world has ever seen.
The real question the Vice President was posing at Munich was whether Europe’s elite would get behind their people and support them in their bid for freedom, or instead be forced to get out of the way.
Eight weeks later, it already looks like they’ve made their choice.
In just the last week, in France we’ve seen presidential frontrunner Marine LePen barred from running in the 2027 election through a very convenient judicial decision. For the supposed crime of embezzling EU funds, a judge decided LePen would be unable to stand for political office for five years. She’s also been sentenced to four years in prison and a 100,000 euro fine. She’s unlikely ever to see the inside of a jail cell—half of the sentence will probably be served under some form of house arrest with an electronic tag, the other half will be suspended—but that’s cold comfort for LePen, whose presidential ambitions, cultivated for decades, have effectively been dashed.
The ruling doesn’t prevent LePen’s charismatic and handsome deputy Bardella from running in her stead, but make no mistake, this is a deliberate and devastating strike at the French right, which is rising on the back of widespread anger at the effects of mass immigration and other globalist policies. LePen is most responsible for “modernising” the party and making it electorally successful. She has shaped the party, remaking it in her own image rather than her father’s, and in doing so brought it to the cusp of power. There’s no way this ruling doesn’t seriously damage the party’s chances at the ballot box in two years’ time. LePen can of course appeal, but it’s unlikely she’ll be heard before the election.
A fait accompli, that’s called.
The verdict has been attacked by President Trump and Elon Musk. Musk wrote on Twitter, “When the radical left can’t win via democratic vote, they abuse the legal system to jail their opponents.”
Here’s Italy’s Matteo Salvini, another populist leader, again on Twitter: “This is a declaration of war by Brussels. We will not be intimidated, we will not stop.”
LePen now joins a growing list of European politicians, including Salvini and also Romania’s Georgescu, who have been attacked through the courts by their globalist enemies, just like Donald Trump was.
And if the lawfare fails, the case of Trump’s long persecution shows us what might happen next. I mean assassination. I don’t think I’m being dramatic. If it happened twice in America in a single presidential campaign, it can certainly happen in Europe. The stakes are just as high, and the enemies of national revival there are just as determined.
It’s also possible that we’ll see parties like the Alternative for Germany (AfD) outlawed. The leader of Germany’s intelligence service and members of the Bundestag have already suggested doing so—“to save democracy.”
To save democracy, it seems, America and Europe really are now on divergent paths, with totally different understandings of what that means. As Trump’s tariff war, just begun, escalates, the distance across the Atlantic will only widen, and negotiations over the end of the Russia-Ukraine war also threaten to do the same. My only hope is that the gap will not prove so wide it cannot be crossed when the time is right for Europe, finally, to seek its freedom."

Spotting Mayorkas at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, The Blaze correspondent Julio Rosas got to work holding the ex-Biden official’s feet to the fire.
“I just wanted to ask you how it feels to see that the United States has a secure border now that President Trump is in office, as opposed to when you were Secretary of Homeland Security?” Rosas quizzed Mayorkas, adding that illegal crossings have plunged by 95%.

After briefly greeting the reporter, Mayorkas proceeded to ignore him and pretend he wasn’t there, staring off bizarrely into the distance as Rosas asked, “Do you have any regret facilitating an open border, sir?”
“Do you regret allowing Tren de Argua to gain a foothold in the United States, sir?” the reporter continued, mentioning the Venezuelan gang terrorizing American communities in recent years.
“Do you have anything to say, sir, about your time as Homeland Security Secretary, facilitating an open border? I mean it was a big issue, sir. It’s one of the reasons why President Trump won re-election. You don’t have anything to say about it?” the reporter again attempted to no avail.
“Do you have regret about losing track…of all those thousands of migrant children who are handed over to HHS?”
Clearly, the cowardly ex-DHS Sec. is ashamed of his tenure and inaction, as the Trump admin continues fulfilling promise after promise to the American people — including closing the porous border endangering the country.

In a 5-4 decision nine days after the request, the Supremes sided with the Trump administration’s emergency request to stay the court order by judge Myong J. Joun of the federal District of Massachusetts – who had ordered the Trump administration to “immediately restore” the “pre-existing status quo prior to the termination.”
According to the ruling – which is likely to narrow the ability of district courts to halt agency actions involving grant function, Joun lacked authority to order the Trump admin to restore the funding.
In his ruling, Myong sided with California and eight other blue states that argued that the cuts were likely driven by efforts by the Trump administration to gut DEI programs (duh).

The cuts were announced on Feb. 17, following findings by DOGE that taxpayer funds were being used to “train teachers and education agencies on divisive ideologies” that were “inappropriate and unnecessary,” including “critical race theory,; diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); social justice activism; ‘anti-racism’; and instruction on white privilege and white supremacy.”
And of course, dissenting in the Supreme Court decision were Justices Jackson, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Chief Justice Roberts."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/free-le-pen-trump-to-france,‘Free Le Pen’ – Trump to France,By RT,1 month ago,"US President Donald Trump has accused the French political establishment of employing lawfare against right-wing figure Marine Le Pen, urging Paris to “free” her.
On Monday, a Paris court sentenced Le Pen to four years in prison and imposed a five-year ban on her eligibility for public office, effectively preventing her from running in the 2027 presidential election.
In a post on Truth Social late Thursday, Trump declared Le Pen a victim of a “witch hunt.” He asserted that the prosecution of Le Pen was orchestrated by “European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech, and censor their Political Opponent.”
“It is the same ‘playbook’ that was used against me by a group of Lunatics and Losers, like Norm Eisen, Andrew Weissmann, and Lisa Monaco,” he remarked, referring to attorneys who were involved in litigation against him since his first term as president. Trump claims those proceedings were politically-driven.
Although Trump admitted he did not personally know Le Pen or the specifics of her case, which he assumed stemmed from a “bookkeeping” error, he expressed admiration for her resilience. He concluded, “It is all so bad for France, and the Great French People, no matter what side they are on. FREE MARINE LE PEN!”
Le Pen and several other senior members of her National Rally (RN) party were found guilty of misappropriating EU funds intended to support European Parliament members for domestic party activities. The offenses occurred between 2004 and 2016, when she was the leader of RN.
Several foreign political leaders criticized the ruling as a blow to democracy in France. Trump previously described it as “a very big deal.” Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni contended that the sentence “takes away representation from millions of citizens,” while her Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orban, expressed his solidarity with Le Pen by posting “Je suis Marine!”
Le Pen characterized the ruling as “political,” asserting that it reflected a “lower court judge” depriving French voters of the opportunity to back their preferred presidential candidate."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/border-apprehensions-continue-to-fall-from-record-low,Border Apprehensions Continue To Fall from Record Low,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Apprehensions at the southern border with Mexico have continued to fall, after reaching a record low in February, down 95% on the same month in 2024.
Customs and Border Protection officials reported that border encounters fell from 8,327 in February to 7,180 in March, a further 13% decrease.
“The month of March recorded the lowest southwest border crossings in history, marking a pivotal achievement in our nation’s border security efforts,” CBP said in an official statement.
“This milestone demonstrates that operational control is becoming a reality—which seemed impossible just a few months ago under the Biden administration—as enforcement measures continue to yield significant results.”
Acting Commissioner Pete Flores hailed the figures and warned migrants thinking of attempting to cross the border not to come.
“Under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Noem, the administration has taken bold, decisive action to restore control at the border. Border Patrol agents are empowered like never before to shut down unlawful entry and protect American lives,” Flores said.
“The message is clear: the border is closed to illegal crossings, and for those still willing to test our resolve, know this—you will be prosecuted, and you will be deported.”
The figures for March 2025 are a stunning contrast with those for March 2024. Whereas 7,180 border encounters were recorded in March 2025, the figure was 137, 743 in March 2024.
The effects of President Trump’s border policies were immediate. After signing ten executive orders touching immigration on his first day in office, encounters at the southern border nearly halved during his first full month in office.
The Trump administration is continuing to ramp up efforts to deport millions of illegal aliens in the country, including reassigning large numbers of federal workers at agencies like the ATF to work on immigration.
At the end of last month, Reuters reported, “As U.S. President Donald Trump pledges to deport ‘millions and millions’ of ‘criminal aliens,’ thousands of federal law enforcement officials from multiple agencies are being enlisted to take on new work as immigration enforcers.”
“I do not recall ever seeing this wide a spectrum of federal government resources all being turned toward immigration enforcement,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former Homeland Security official who spoke with Reuters.
Although the specific number of federal workers being redirected to immigration is not fully clear, Reuters notes that the effort is reminiscent of the “aftermath of the 2001 attacks, when Congress created the Department of Homeland Security that pulled together 169,000 federal employees from other agencies and refocused the FBI on battling terrorism.”
According to one ATF official, around 80% of the organization’s 2,500 agents have been ordered to take on immigration-related tasks. At least a quarter of DEA agents are also working on immigration.
So far, Trump’s mass-deportation program has made notable gains, while also facing challenges.
Although the number of migrants crossing the southern border is now at a record low and many of the most dangerous criminals have been apprehended and deported, securing adequate funding has proven an early difficulty.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is facing a serious funding shortfall of $2 billion.
According to Axios, ICE has warned Congress it faces a massive black hole in its budget that could compromise its ability to carry out Trump’s flagship immigration policy.
Although Congress will send an additional $500 million in the stop-gap spending bill that just passed the House, that money would still fall well short of providing the funds ICE needs to continue working at its current pace through September.
Current plans for ICE expansion include the hiring of hundreds more stuff, the doubling of detention space to accommodate 100,000 people and increasing the number of detention flights.
The spending plan now before Congress is “not going to be sufficient to be able to cover the entire need for what they’re covering” at ICE, said Sen. James Lankford
“Just the bed space alone becomes very significant. And to just be able to detain people for a couple of days while they’re processing, and then to be able to move out flights… is exceptionally expensive.”
It may be possible to divert money to ICE from other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, such as FEMA and the Coast Guard, but this could only be a temporary measure."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-boom-228000-jobs-added-in-march,"Trump Boom: 228,000 Jobs Added in March",By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Employers in the US added 228,000 new workers to their payrolls in March, according to figures released by the Department of Labor on Friday.
The figures significantly exceeded expectations. Economists reckoned 140,000 jobs would be added in March, nearly 90,000 fewer than the eventual figure.
Workforce participation climbed slightly, from 62.4% to 62.5%.
The length of the average workweek also increased, which is a sign of demand for labor.
Average hourly earnings also rose, by 0.3% compared with February and 3.8% compared with a year ago.
The strong figures come as uncertainty about Trump’s economic policies, and in particular his flagship policy of tariffs, continues.
On Wednesday, President Trump announced a comprehensive new policy of “reciprocal tariffs” that would affect the US’s major trading partners and many smaller nations as well.
Trump’s announcement of the tariffs sent out a global shockwave, causing a record two-day decline in stock-market value of $5 trillion. Prices for oil and commodities plummeted, as investors sought a measure of safety in government bonds.
The 10% baseline tariff took effect at 12.01 am ET on Saturday and represents “the single biggest trade action of our lifetime,” according to former White House trade adviser Kelly Ann Shaw.
Among the countries subject to the 10% tariff are Australia, Britain, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
At 12.01am ET on Wednesday, Trump’s higher “reciprocal” tariff rates, varying from 11% to 50%, will take effect. Imports from the European Union will face a 20% tariff, while Chinese goods will be subject to an additional 34% tariff, bringing the total Trump has imposed on China to 54%.
Canada and Mexico are exempt from Trump’s latest duties because they remain subject to an earlier 25% tariff related to the fentanyl and illegal immigration crises. Trump is also excluding goods subject to separate 25% national-security tariffs, which include steel and aluminum, cars, trucks and auto parts.
The new tariffs are expected to force foreign countries to the negotiating table. Vietnam, which was hit with one of the highest tariff rates—46%—has already agreed to discuss new trade terms with Trump."

Schwab has said the Forum, which meets annually at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, needs to rediscover its “sense of mission,” in a letter to trustee board members.
In a statement to the Financial Times, the WEF said Schwab would complete the process of stepping down by January 2027.
Schwab indicated his intention to step down last year, saying he would hand over executive duties to a team led by Borge Brende, a former foreign minister of Norway who has been the Forum’s president since 2017. Schwab has spent 54 years at the Forum, since its foundation in 1971.
Controversy has dogged Schwab in recent months. Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported the Forum’s board was working with a law firm to investigate its workplace culture, after allegations of a “culture of harassment” and discrimination at the organization.
In March, the Forum said external lawyers who investigated the claims found it had not committed any legal violations and allegations of misconduct against Schwab himself were not true.
The World Economic Forum and its founder became a lightning rod for popular anger during the pandemic after it declared a “Great Reset” that would transform every aspect of life in every country on the planet.
“The pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world to create a healthier, more equitable, and more prosperous future,” Schwab said in 2020.
World leaders, royalty, celebrities, captains of industry, academics and the media joined Schwab’s call for a “Great Reset.”
“Conspiracy theories” about the Forum and its role in the pandemic were furiously “debunked” by the mainstream media."

The 5-4 decision, Trump’s first win at the Supreme Court in his second term, reversed a decision by a district court judge that threw a spanner in the new administration’s efforts to abolish federal DEI programs.
Last month, US district judge Myong Joun, a Biden appointee, issued a temporary restraining order and told the Trump administration to reinstate grants for teacher training in DEI under the Department of Education.
The Trump administration then filed an appeal, but that was denied by the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.
Five of the conservative Justices were in the majority, while Chief Justice Roberts, who has clashed with President Trump in recent weeks, chose to side with liberal Justices Kagan, Jackson and Sotomayor.
Tensions between the President and Chief Justice came to a head two weeks ago, over the issue of district judges issuing nationwide orders in an attempt to derail the Trump admin’s flagship policies, including mass deportation and swinging cuts to federal budgets and agencies.
Chief Justice Roberts suggested the President was defying one of the foundational principles of American government by demanding the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg, who attempted to block the deportation of alleged foreign gang members, including members of MS-13, using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.
In response, President Trump issued Chief Justice Roberts a challenge on his social-media platform Truth Social.
“It is our goal to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and such a high aspiration can never be done if Radical and Highly Partisan Judges are allowed to stand in the way of JUSTICE. STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!” Trump posted."

Among the countries subject to the 10% tariff are Australia, Britain, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
A 51-day grace period for cargoes loaded onto vessels or planes and in transit to the U.S. before 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday has been allowed. These cargoes need arrive to by 12:01 a.m. ET on May 27 to avoid the 10% duty.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/1-3-million-illegals-accessing-medicaid-benefits,1.3 Million Illegals Accessing Medicaid Benefits,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"More than a million illegal immigrants are accessing Medicaid benefits, according to Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) executive Antonio Garcias.
Speaking during an appearance on the All In podcast on X, Garcia revealed how illegal immigrants are accessing medical benefits and even voting.
Garcia claimed 1.3 million illegals are on the Medicaid register at present according to analysis  by DOGE, and that the number would only start “ramping” as the waste-cutting department continued its investigation.
DOGE also looked at voter rolls in “friendly” states and found that thousands of these illegals had registered to vote.
Again, Garcia cautioned that this was just a preliminary estimate, and that further investigation would reveal voter fraud—a federal crime—in far greater numbers.
“It’s the tip of the iceberg. It doesn’t include the 7.8 million people that ICE has that have come in illegally that know we’re here, and all the people that came illegally we don’t know are here. I mean, this is not a political issue. I want to be really clear about this. This is about America.”"

On Friday, Judge Paula Xinis ordered the man to be returned to the US by Monday at midnight.
“This was an illegal act,” Judge Paula Xinis told a Justice Department lawyer, according to Politico.
“Congress said you can’t do it, and you did it anyway.”
According to the White House, the man in question, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was a member of the criminal gang MS-13, which has now been designated a terrorist organization. He is said to have been involved in human trafficking. He was apprehended in Maryland last month, before being flown to El Salvador, where he now resides in President Nayib Bukele’s fearsome CECOT prison.
Judge Xinis, however, said that the accusation of gang membership is “just chatter.”
“In a court of law, when someone is accused of membership in such a violent and predatory organization, it comes in the form of an indictment, a complaint, a criminal proceeding that has robust process so we can assess the facts,” Xinis added.
In response to Judge Xinis’s decision, the White House, via Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, issued a defiant statement.
“We suggest the Judge contact President Nayib Bukele because we are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador.”
Rumours that Garcia was not a gang member have been circulating for at least a week. On Tuesday, Leavitt shut down these rumours during a press conference, stating unequivocally that the Trump administration knows Garcia was a member of MS-13 and that he was involved in human trafficking.
“The administration maintains the position that this individual was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country and was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/zelensky-says-nato-membership-still-in-ukraines-future-contradicting-trump,"Zelensky Says NATO Membership Still In Ukraine’s Future, Contradicting Trump",By ZeroHedge,1 month ago,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to test President Trump, this time contradicting the US leader on the question of Ukraine’s future membership in NATO.
Trump has clearly taken it off the table, as even NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has recently recognized. But Zelensky in fresh comments said he has not given up on Ukraine’s pursuit of NATO accession.
“You know who does not support Ukraine’s membership in NATO so far, but in any case, no one is removing this issue from the table for the future,” Zelensky said, as quoted in Ukrinform news agency on Friday.
“At least, we are talking about the fact that even if now someone does not want to support [Kiev joining the bloc], we will see what happens in the future,” Zelensky added.
He went on to explain in the comments that until membership in the Western military bloc happens, Kiev should be provided with “NATO-like security guarantees” by its allies and partners.
Ukraine must be “strong when getting to the negotiating table” in order to achieve a “just peace,” Zelensky said.
Earlier this week, President Trump made clear in reference to Zelensky that “he wants to be a member of NATO. Well, he was never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that.”
The issue of NATO constantly expanding right up to Russia’s borders, which especially ramped up in the mid-2000s during the Bush era, had been consistently identified by President Putin as a key motive in his ordering hundreds of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine in February of 2022.
Russia saw its ‘special military operation’ as a continuation of a war in Donbass that was already burning since 2014, which saw CIA and Western intelligence assist Kiev in seeking to push back Russian influence. But the reality has always been that natives on the Donbass are overwhelmingly Russian-speaking and pro-Moscow.
Trump also this week while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One that negotiations have produced “a lot of good conversations about Ukraine and Russia.”
Ukraine joining NATO, as our president said, is “not at all possible,” says Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev. “That, I think, has been widely accepted, including by the Trump administration.”

The family says they are shocked by the conduct of the Bavarian priest.
The church, in the Regen district, is now under fire for its conduct in the case. The parents have even written an open letter that their boy was very interested in politics and had attended various campaign events during the election campaign. At an AfD event, he took a photo with Krah and posted it on his WhatsApp channel.
This reportedly infuriated the priest who called the boy into a meeting, where he allegedly called him a “Nazi”
“If you think like a Nazi, talk like a Nazi, and act like a Nazi, are you not a Nazi?” the priest allegedly said. He added that as a Christian, the boy cannot support the AfD’s positions.
The AfD’s Krah has already responded to the incident, writing on X; “The German church tax church has long been post-Christian, often anti-Christian. The boy is now learning this the hard way. I hope his faith will become even stronger as a result. I will try to contact him.”
The priest then dismissed the youth from his service, despite the boy’s nearly decade of service and his very religious nature. He had even considered becoming a priest himself.
“Since the end of January, our son’s world and that of our family have been thrown into disarray,” the Passauer Neue Presse wrote, the paper which broke the story, while quoting the family in a letter they wrote.
The Diocese of Passau has confirmed the incident. The diocese declared that the Church of Passau stands for “a liberal, democratic basic order.” However, the diocese still wants to “remain in dialogue with people who sympathize with problematic political positions.”
According to the diocese, the boy has been “offered several times to return to the circle of altar boys.” However, according to the diocese, the family has not yet accepted this offer.
Both the Protestant and Catholic churches in Germany have gone to war with the AfD, and have even removed priests who sympathized with the party. These churches have been shedding members by the hundreds of thousands every year, as Germans grow more and more disenchanted with Christianity in the country."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-western-elites-war-against-democracy-is-now-out-in-the-open,The Western Elites’ War Against Democracy is Now Out in the Open,By Mick Hume | The European Conservative,1 month ago,"The French authorities insist that the conviction of Marine Le Pen, which disqualifies the leader of the National Rally (RN) from standing for election as president of France, is not political. No, they say, it simply reflects the neutral ‘rule of law’ and the ‘independence of the judicial system.’
Really? Strange then, that supposedly ‘independent’ judges and officials across Europe and America have all reached remarkably similar verdicts against right-wing politicians.
It looks less like judicial independence and the old-fashioned rule of law than a globalist establishment plot to use the courts as a political weapon against the rising national populist revolt.
The serious fraud here is not Le Pen’s party allegedly embezzling EU funds. It is the liberal elites’ fraudulent claim that they are defending democracy—by denying people the freedom to vote for whom they choose.
The one thing which all these unelected judges are truly ‘independent’ of is any democratic accountability for their actions. Their politicised version of the ‘rule of law’ is a denial of the rule of the people.
It is now undeniable that the Western establishment is hiding behind the law while waging a political war against popular democracy. The high-profile show trial of Marine Le Pen confirms that their anti-democratic crusade is now being conducted out in the open. It is time for us all to take sides, and take a stand.
You do not need to be an expert in jurisprudence or a conspiracy theorist to see the obvious pattern of political judgements against national conservative politicians across the West.
So, French judges have just convicted Le Pen and thus ruled her out of running in the 2027 presidential election, for which she was easily leading the polls.
This judgement, media supporters of the EU establishment will try to tell us, is of course entirely unconnected to the rulings of the Romanian courts, which cancelled their presidential election after right-wing nationalist Calin Georgescu won the first round, and then barred him from standing again.
Those Romanian verdicts have been upheld by the European Court of Human Rights, which we know is also completely ‘independent’ of the wishes of any voter in any European nation.
None of this, they will insist, has anything to do with events in Germany, where court judgements that brand the populist Alternative fur Deutschland guilty of being far-right extremists have emboldened other parties to call for an outright ban on the AfD, which is now the choice of millions of German voters and vying for national leadership in the polls.
There are many other similar examples of state and European courts trying to obstruct or outlaw national-populist parties and politicians, from Italy and Poland to Slovenia. Meanwhile the EU courts continue to target Hungary’s elected conservative government as if it was Europe’s most-wanted criminal conspiracy.
On the EU’s doorstep, the UK Labour government—led by former top state prosecutor Sir Keir Starmer—has cancelled local elections due to take place in several English counties next month, denying more than five million Brits their right to vote. Labour insists of course that this suspension of democracy is a purely technical matter, to do with their plans to reorganise regional government; we are expected to believe that it has nothing at all to do with the fact that Nigel Farage’s insurgent Reform UK was expected to win in several of the counties where elections have been cancelled.
And the war on democracy doesn’t stop at Europe’s borders. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump had to defeat various courts’ campaigns to discredit and disbar him before he could stand for re-election as U.S. president. Since he won that election and assumed office in January, President Trump’s radical reforms—from stopping USAID spending to slashing government waste—have repeatedly been balked by a collection of politically liberal district court judges. These entitled pygmies of the legal system appear to assume that they should have more authority over U.S. affairs than a leader doing what he was elected to do by more than 77 million Americans.
Call me an old cynic, but I find it hard to swallow that this is all a series of coincidences. If something looks and sounds this much like a campaign of political lawfare against populist politicians across the West, then that’s almost certainly what it is.
Conservatives have of course always supported the rule of law as the basis of a stable and secure society. It is time to accept, however, that the ‘rule of law’ the authorities call on today no longer means what it did. It amounts instead to the rule of a politicised judiciary, acting as the agents of liberal globalist elites.
For their part, exhausted old Western political elites which now lack the authority or support to rule confidently in their own names are hiding behind the ‘rule of law’ and the grandeur of the judiciary. Fearful of the electorate and unable to combat the rising populist revolt, they instead seek to outlaw the opposition.
These judges are no longer ‘above politics.’ We are witnessing politics being brought into the courts as never before in the modern West. And in the process, big political battles are being removed from the arena of democratic debate.
What does Western democracy really mean if voters are denied their choice of candidates, or those elected are denied the chance to fulfil their promises to the electorate?
As I have argued on europeanconservative.com before, these questions come back to the origins of the concept of democracy in ancient Athens, as a marriage of the demos—the people—and kratos—power or control. The aim of the oligarchy is always to keep those two as far apart as possible, to maintain its monopoly on power. The increasing concentration of kratos in the courts is the clearest case of the anti-democratic instincts of Western oligarchs.
Outrageous assaults such as the Le Pen show trial may well backfire and lead to a further upsurge in support for national populists. People do not like being told who they are allowed to vote for. The populist revolt against the old order cannot be ended by the stroke of a judge’s pen. But we have yet to see just how far the establishment is prepared to go to contain the threat to its power.
It is time for all those who want a chance to shape the future of a free Europe to take a stand and fully embrace the populist revolt. Democracy remains our one hope of challenging the globalist elites who have taken control of Western institutions, from the courts to the universities.
The stakes are high. As Frank Furedi argues elsewhere on europeanconservative.com this week, the West is in crisis as the old world order is pulled apart. It is time to decide what we stand for and what it is that we want to defend. Reclaiming and advancing the founding principles of democracy, popular sovereignty, and free speech will be key to securing the future.
That is why, when it comes to the confrontation between state or EU courts and national populist politicians, we must say without conditions: Je Suis Marine, Donald, Viktor, or whoever is next in the legal firing line. The war for Western democracy is now one in earnest. No surrender."

The hearing – “Censorship-Industrial Complex: The Need for First Amendment Safeguards at the State Department” – also saw Jankowicz, who appeared as a witness, and Representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a Democrat, attempt to paint the actions taken by the new Trump White House as worse that what was happening during the previous US administration.
Both Jankowicz and Kamlager-Dove referred to the system known as the Censorship-Industrial Complex, and its elements, as “fiction,” “lies,” “tall tales,” and, “a conspiracy theory,” with Jankowicz trying to frame the new government’s moves as “an assault on the First Amendment” and “suppressing speech.”
Despite the fact these are some of the key accusations against the Biden administration – and at this point, fairly well backed up by batches of internal documents, but also testimonies from Big Tech execs – Jankowicz chose to call it “the imagined actions of the Biden administration.”
As for her own role in this “imagined” system – namely, the brief stint at the helm of the short-lived Disinformation Governance Board (that was part of the Department of Homeland Security) – Jankowicz maintained that it was not meant to be a censorship body.
Instead, Jankowicz would have the Committee and the public believe the Board was true to its mission statement, which was “to protect civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, and the First Amendment.”
(DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency(CISA) also had a reasonable mission statement – to protect critical infrastructure from cyberattacks – only to then, according to the findings of the House Judiciary Committee, switch to surveillance and censorship of Americans’ online speech.)
Jankowicz tried to dismiss the validity, and value of the Twitter Files, which have proven to be crucial in shedding light on the inner workings of the “fictitious” Censorship-Industrial Complex.
But to her mind, the Twitter Files are “almost endless fiction” and, somehow – “a conspiracy.”
Another place where “no censorship was going on” was the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, the Foreign Affairs Committee heard from Jankowicz.
And, she doesn’t detect any problems with the scandalous actions taken by the former government to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story, suggesting that Twitter “adding friction” resulted in “more views.”"

Grady, who had served as chief of the agency’s Department of Bioethics, and other longtime Fauci allies in top posts at the NIH involved in the development and distribution of the untested COVID shots produced by Big Pharma were offered jobs in Alaska and other remote locales far away from the NIH’s sprawling Bethesda, Maryland, complex just outside Washington, D.C.
The purge came amid massive layoffs in health-related agencies under the umbrella of Health and Human Services (HHS), now headed by the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement’s founder, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long questioned vaccine safety and American medicine’s focus on treating disease rather than preventing it.
A total of about 20,000 personnel – mostly bureaucrats – or about 25 percent of the HHS workforce have been or will be handed pink slips amid Kennedy’s realignmentof the agency.
MAHA critics were quick to call Tuesday’s axing of Fauci confederates as “one of the darkest days in modern scientific history” fueled by Kennedy’s desire to exact revenge on Fauci’s former trusted associates who represent the antithesis of the MAHA movement.
However, the revamping of the federal government’s side of the health industry is no more harsh than the treatment meted out by those formerly in control who, at best, suppressed, and worst, punished those who questioned their iron grip on health-industry regulations and standards.
For years, Kennedy’s critics have dismissed his quest to revamp healthcare and his questioning of the efficacy of the COVID-19 mRNA jabs as anti-science, labeling him as an “anti-vaxxer” in order to suppress his messaging.
Dr. Francis Collins – whom Bhattacharya replaced as head of NIH – in an October 2020 email to Fauci condemned Bhattacharya as a “fringe epidemiologist” because he had co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration, which criticized harmful COVID lockdown policies.
“During the pandemic Fauci’s bioethicist wife, Christine Grady, offered nurses a choice: Get vaccinated, or lose your job,” noted The COVID-19 History Project on X.
“Yesterday, she was offered a choice: Transfer to an office in Alaska, or lose your job. What’s fair is fair. Everyone deserves a choice,” explained the COVID watchdog account.

Other NIH officials who were offered reassignments were Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, who succeeded Fauci as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Clifford Lane, a close Fauci ally who served as deputy director for clinical research at NIAID, and Dr. Emily Erbelding, NIAID’s microbiology and infectious diseases director."

On Wednesday, the president broke his public silence on what has widely been viewed as a partisan decision to remove the National Rally (RN) leader from the political stage, opting simply to defend the “independent” judiciary without commenting on the rights or wrongs of the ban itself.
An official present at a meeting with top government officials said Macron also stressed that “​​judges must be protected,” after it was revealed that the figure who barred Le Pen from running in France’s 2027 presidential election is now under police protection.
Already, RN President Jordan Bardella has come under fire for organising a rally in defence of Le Pen. He told reporters at the European Parliament that “it’s not a power play.”
On the contrary, it is a very clear and very deep defence of the rule of law and of French democracy.
Macron has so far been unable to issue a defence of democracy of his own since the ruling on Monday, beyond bland statements including “the law is the same for everyone” and “all defendants have the right to legal recourse.” This despite his own prime minister, Francois Bayrou, declaring that he was “troubled” by the court’s decision.
The Paris Court of Appeal will deliver its ruling on Le Pen’s appeal next year."

Kennedy Jr., sparred with the MSM and Big Pharma lobbyists in an explosive interview where he called out the “utter failure” of health authorities to stop the rise in chronic disease and made the case for the Trump administration to make “dramatic changes” to the status quo, including the removal of government bureaucrats.
“Fundamentally, what Bobby has done is taken over a department that has utterly failed,” said Means at POLITICO’s Health Care Summit Wednesday. “The idea that Bobby Kennedy should not come in and make dramatic changes to the leadership and the personnel at these authorities that have overseen an abject devastation of American health which the lobbyists in this room do not have the humility to admit that we have gone completely wrong – the lobbyists in this room [are] laughing when we have the sickest children in the developed world.”
“It is insane for you to insinuate that the things standing between us and better health is more government bureaucrats.”
Watch highlights of the encounter where Means, who is also a co-founder of TrueMed, reminded the audience of the mandate given to President Trump to Make America Healthy Again.

Means even shut down POLITICO’s White House Bureau Chief Dasha Burns’ attempt to regurgitate the tired argument that “healthy food is expensive.”
“One thing Bobby Kennedy is not going to do is entertain comments from food industry lobbyists using food prices as an excuse to continue poisoning children.”

Below is Kennedy’s speech where he called Trump a “pivotal historical figure” while slamming the rise of the military-industrial complex and USAID corruption.
For 20 years, I’ve gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country. On August 23rd of last year, God sent me president Trump. [Trump] has kept every promise made to me. He’s kept his word in every account and gone way beyond it.
I’m so grateful to you, Mr. President. A lot of people told me that I couldn’t trust President Trump, I better get it in writing. We did a handshake, and everything he told me he was going to do, he has done. I’m so grateful to him. (Turing to Trump) I’ve told you before. I genuinely believe that you are a pivotal historical figure and you are going to transform this country at a time when we see all of the conditions of democracy in tatters in our country. We see the rise of the military-industrial complex, the rise of totalitarianism, these attacks on our constitution, and this breathtaking epidemic that is disabling our people.
President Trump has promised to restore the American dream in this country. A healthy person has 1,000 dreams, a sick person only has one. 60% of our population has only one dream, that they get better.
President Trump has promised to restore America’s strength. We can’t be a strong nation if we have a weak citizenry. 60% of our people are sick. 77%, as President Trump had mentioned, of our children cannot qualify for military service.
We need a man on a white horse now. We need somebody who is willing to come in, and has the spine and the guts and the strength, to challenge orthodoxies, to stand in the way of vested interests and to break institutions that have turned against our democracy.
President Trump has shown again and again he is that hero.
Most recently, I greatly appreciate it, I called you the day you announced the termination of USAID. My uncle started USAID in 1961 for humanitarian purposes to put our country on the side of the poor. It has been captured by the military-industrial complex. It has become a sinister propagator of totalitarianism and war across the globe. And very few people understand how sinister this agency really is. President Trump saw that and he stood up to it with a masterstroke.
We want to do the same thing with the institutions that are stealing the health of our children.
We need a revolutionary figure. And (to Trump) YOU are that figure. And I’m very grateful for you for giving me this opportunity.
Since you made it this far, take a moment to read the following reports that elucidate just how much a boon Kennedy will be for the nation’s well being.
RFK Jr. Special: What Are Ultra-Processed Foods and Why Are They So Bad for Us?"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/how-lies-from-the-biden-administration-expanded-the-ukraine-war,How Lies from the Biden Administration Expanded the Ukraine War,By William L. Anderson | Mises Institute,1 month ago,"Most of our readers are too young to remember the Vietnam War of a half-century ago, but those of us alive who held draft cards classifying us as 1A have a more personal perspective. In 1971, when I received my low draft number, all I could think was that perhaps I, too, would have to participate in the horror that was combat in that wicked war.
The Paris Peace Accords of January 1973—signed a month after I took my military physical—ended direct US involvement, although the US government continued to aid the South Vietnamese until their government and armed forces completely collapsed in April 1975. Today, Vietnam and the US are at peace with each other, but even today, unexploded US bombs continue to blow up and kill innocent people.
Samuel Johnson wrote in 1758:
Among the calamities of war may be jointly numbered the diminution of the love of truth, by the falsehoods which interest dictates and credulity encourages.
To put it another way, war breeds lies. Lies gave us Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and now the Ukraine War. Like it has done with so many wars that have US involvement, the New York Times has first promoted the conflicts it later claims to abhor, and Ukraine is no exception. Popular columnist David French—who has never seen a US war he didn’t support—two years ago visited Ukraine and gushed about the “valor” he saw with the Ukraine people:
This is primarily a Ukrainian story, of course. We know from bitter experience that we can supply “allies” with billions of dollars of American weapons, only to watch them collapse in the face of a determined attack. But Ukrainian valor and resolve are breathtaking. Most Ukrainians I’ve talked to since arriving don’t say “after the war”; they say “after the victory.” But this is also an American story, and at the risk of sounding a bit corny, when I watched the air defenses we helped build intercept Russian hypersonic missiles above Kyiv, I felt proud to be an American.
With the Donald Trump administration now trying to broker a peace, French is not as “proud to be an American” as he was before January 20, and his rage-filled columns are aimed at either Trump or evangelical Christians that don’t share French’s political views. However, even French’s employer is now admitting that President Joe Biden and others in his administration were lying all along about the war, its progress, and the extent of US involvement:
But a New York Times investigation reveals that America was woven into the war far more intimately and broadly than previously understood. At critical moments, the partnership was the backbone of Ukrainian military operations that, by U.S. counts, have killed or wounded more than 700,000 Russian soldiers. (Ukraine has put its casualty toll at 435,000.) Side by side in Wiesbaden’s mission command center, American and Ukrainian officers planned Kyiv’s counteroffensives. A vast American intelligence-collection effort both guided big-picture battle strategy and funneled precise targeting information down to Ukrainian soldiers in the field.
One European intelligence chief recalled being taken aback to learn how deeply enmeshed his N.A.T.O. counterparts had become in Ukrainian operations. “They are part of the kill chain now,” he said.
Journalist Matt Taibbi, who always has said that US involvement was much deeper than Biden and his acolytes were claiming, writes:
The people who quarterbacked the NATO side of the Ukraine war are so pleased with themselves, they can’t keep from boasting about things that will make the average American want to pitchfork the lot of them. (Adam) Entous (of the NYT) describes a tale told “through a secret keyhole” that reveals how America was “woven into the war far more intimately and broadly than previously understood.” (Translation: it was hidden from us.) Sources not only make it clear that the public was lied to on a continuous basis from the outset of the conflict, they describe how we were lied to, apparently thinking the methods clever. Some are small semantic gambits the idiots wrongly believe exculpated their actions, but the main revelation involves one gigantic, inexcusable deception. From Joe Biden down, they all lied about the risk of World War III.
They risked our lives and our children’s lives, knowingly, repeatedly, and for the worst possible reason: politics. Afraid to admit a mistake, they planned individual excuses while letting bureaucratic inertia expand the conflict. Worse, as was guessed at on this site late last year, the Biden administration after last November’s election increased the risk of global conflict by “expanding the ops box to allow ATACMS and British Storm Shadow strikes into Russia,” in order to “shore up his Ukraine project.” If you check this “secret history” against contemporaneous statements of American and European leaders, you’ll find the scale of the lies beyond comprehension.
One only can conclude that the US had stepped well over the boundaries of what would be called “acts of war,” and only paying scant attention to the fact that Russia still has nuclear weapons aimed at US cities. According to the NYT:
The partnership operated in the shadow of deepest geopolitical fear — that Mr. Putin might see it as breaching a red line of military engagement and make good on his often-brandished nuclear threats.
Although the Biden administration claimed this was not a “proxy war,” it was the very definition of a proxy war, with Ukrainian political leaders wanting even more US involvement, making the American advisers a veritable “trip wire” if Russia attacked any Americans. Indeed, it was the major deception known as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident that brought American ground troops to Vietnam in the first place.
This whole point bears repeating: the Biden administration was willing to risk nuclear war with Russia to promote a war that never needed to be fought in the first place. By pushing NATO to Russia’s borders and using CIA, USAID, and agents from other agencies to destabilize regimes bordering on Russia, the US risked plunging an entire region into pointless warfare. Taibbi writes:
While the Times piece does little to clear up whose fault the military and diplomatic failure was (there were numerous passages of the “mistakes were made” variety), it’s clear we were lied to about everything. Zelensky and his set will no doubt tell their side now, and it’s possible Ukraine’s freelanced heightening of risk to Americans will come out seeming less treacherous. Either way, it’s clear the Biden administration should have cut the cord years ago, to prevent Americans from being dragged into World War by “partners” with every incentive to pull them in. Instead, the administration berated its critics as treasonous cowards who’d have let Hitler swim to London.
Given that most of the political players in this fiasco are out of power, new scrutiny will likely move to the Trump administration’s actions. Yet, while we have “dodged a bullet” (or, better put, “dodged a nuclear missile”), this affair is not over. More than a million people have died, much of Ukraine lies in ruins, and Trump has been unable to broker that elusive cease fire."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/australia-drops-covid-vaccine-mandate-but-devastating-effects-remain,Australia Drops Covid Vaccine Mandate but Devastating Effects Remain,By Rebekah Barnett | Brownstone Institute,1 month ago,"Three years after it became universally acknowledged that Covid vaccines provide negligible protection against infection and transmission, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) has finally dropped its Covid vaccine mandate.
AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw announced the change in a letter to staff, which was obtained by Senator Gerard Rennick and reviewed by the Epoch Times.
The decision to drop the mandate as of Monday 24 February comes after an “extensive review of public health advice,” which apparently took place at such a snail’s pace as to trail the rest of the country by several years. The mandates were dropped by most state and territory police forces by mid-2022.
But though the mandates are now over, AFP employees pushed out of the job are still living with the effects. Former officers describe feeling “shunned” and “treated like a criminal” by the AFP, with the loss of their careers, livelihoods, and homes taking a devastating toll.
The double-dose Covid vaccine mandate was brought in by the AFP in November 2021, with a booster dose requirement added in May 2022 after it became apparent that two doses were ineffective against Omicron.
Internal AFP records released under Freedom of Information (FOI) relating to its 2022 Covid Safety Risk Assessment indicate that the AFP was well aware that two or three doses offered little-to-no protection as the pandemic progressed.
The documents cite numerous studies showing waning effectiveness of the primary series post-Omicron, acknowledging that “protection after booster vaccination also decreased quickly,” as early as two to five weeks after a booster shot.
A review of the Covid vaccination policy addressed to the Executive Leadership Committee (ELC) acknowledged that “the current boosters are not proven to materially protect the AFP’s workforce by reducing transmission,” and that “vaccination is increasingly a matter of managing personal risk rather than collective protection.”
Yet at the same time, the AFP physically isolated unvaccinated staff members and pushed them out of employment under the false premise that they threatened the safety of the workplace.
A termination letter sent to an employee at the end of 2022 (which I have sighted but cannot publish) stated that,
“The AFP has an obligation under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth) to minimise, to the extent reasonably practicable, the risk of infection and transmission of COVID-19, and to provide a safe working environment to all AFP appointees.
“Medical advice has indicated the vaccinations available in Australia are safe and vaccination is the most effective method available to reduce the risk of transmission and the severity of infection.”
Untrue, according to the AFP’s Covid risk assessment conducted earlier that year.
Obesity and comorbidities were (and still are) the key determinants of personal Covid risk in working-age populations, but the AFP did not mandate management of employees’ weight or general health, as it would have if the mandates had truly been about reducing risk in the workplace.
This suggests that the institution was bogged for years in a rules-based paradigm focused more on compliance than on what would actually ensure the health of its workforce. Case in point, an internal note stating: “more work is required on the cohort that have not yet had the two vaccinations.”
I spoke with three former federal police officers who were pushed out of employment with the AFP for failing to provide proof of Covid vaccination. All three described a high degree of coercion and discrimination: automated screensavers promoting vaccination, constant email reminders to get vaccinated, physical exclusion from work areas and events, refusal of medical exemptions, and eventually, pressure to either resign or be terminated with a record of serious misconduct.
“It’s devastating,” a former Leading Senior Constable said of losing his 17-year career with the AFP.
“I had a plan. I had just signed a contract on a property and it was based on my work, so I lost the purchase,” said Russ, who preferred to be identified only by his first name.
Russ, who is in his sixties, was nearing retirement but was not yet financially ready. His termination in early 2022 left him without secure housing at an age when finding a new job proves difficult for most.
Luckily for Russ, he was able to find work in construction cleaning. The other officers I spoke with were not so fortunate.
Former Senior Constable and firearms instructor Alina Dennison, 41, also lost her home as a result of her termination weeks before Christmas in 2022.
“We had to sell right when there was a market downturn. We had just bought our dream five-bedroom house with our two young boys. We lost money and we had to move into a rental property that we can barely afford on a single wage.”
Dennison says the financial difficulties that came with the sudden end to her 16-year career with the force had knock-on effects for her whole family.
“My mum just got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s – I don’t have a room to take her in like we did in the old house,” she said.
Andrew, who served over 20 years with the AFP, said he has been unable to find stable work since being forced out. Andrew is not his real name – he asked to remain anonymous to protect his job prospects.
“I’ve been doing odd jobs and trade work,” said the former Protective Service Officer, who is in his sixties.
“I used up all my leave until late 2022 in the hope that they would reverse the mandate. But that didn’t happen, so I had no option but to resign,” said Andrew.
“I made it clear the only reason for my resignation was the vaccine mandate,” he said, explaining that he chose to resign rather than be terminated to avoid having a serious misconduct charge on his record, which would prevent him from applying for any government job or even obtaining a security licence.
Andrew said he didn’t want to resign as he had a mortgage and needed to pay for his teenager’s education, plus his wife is in recovery from cancer treatment. But, “it didn’t make sense, and I knew in myself this is wrong – a fear campaign driven by politicians and the media,” he said.
“I knew there would be a massive financial cost. There were a lot of sleepless nights, a lot of uncertainty as far as providing for my family goes and trying to stay on top of the bills,” said Andrew.
However, he remains positive about his decision. “I take a lot of things in my stride. If I was in my 20’s or 30’s I still would have made the same decision.”
Dennison was medically exempted from all approved Covid vaccines due to her medical history of a transient ischemic attack during a recent pregnancy, but the AFP rejected the exemption, directing her to take the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine against medical advice.
Information released under FOI reveals that 148 medical exemption requests were made to the AFP out of the approximately 7,000-strong workforce, with only 94 being granted.
Being in good health with no relevant adverse medical history, Russ and Andrew had no grounds to apply for medical exemptions, but they both expressed concerns about the safety of the shots.
“I was hearing about injuries from colleagues – honestly it was horrific,” said Russ.
“Things like my colleague’s father got it and then was paralysed from the waist down for several days, stories of people vomiting in their sleep.”
Andrew had similar stories, rattling off a long list of incidents that he said occurred in close temporal proximity to vaccination.
“Six colleagues have had heart complications and one was experiencing blackouts. Another suffered brain aneurysms. Another has been in hospital with heart surgeries.”
“One officer had been jabbed at least four times, still caught Covid and spent weeks in hospital recovering. An ex-colleague out walking, suffered a heart attack. Another told me that while out walking he lost control of his right side and could not see out of one eye.”
“Almost all my colleagues said that after being vaccinated they still caught Covid, the vaccines don’t work, and that they wished they had not been vaccinated in the first place.”
Russ and Andrew acknowledged that they cannot prove that these incidents were caused by vaccination, but both said the anecdotal information lined up with what they were reading about the safety of the shots, and that they had not seen anything like this before.
As at 8 March 2024, the AFP had recorded 241 workplace incidents related to the Covid vaccine mandate, a number that does not appear to include incidents that took place outside of work hours.
However, Andrew said this number, even for incidents occurring in the workplace, would be “way underreported.”
“A lot of people don’t want to admit that they made a mistake in getting the vaccination,” he said, suggesting that people are inclined to blame vaccine effects on mystery illnesses rather than draw the connection.
It is also the case that medical censorship was rife in Australia during this time, with doctors who publicly discussed vaccine injuries being subjected to regulatory action, and vaccine-injured people reporting strong reluctance on the part of doctors and specialists to document vaccination as the cause of their conditions.
Equal to the financial stress has been the emotional and mental toll that the AFP’s enforcement of the mandate has taken on the former officers. All three seemed particularly affected by being prevented from having a proper farewell or being recognised for their service.
Dennison felt the effects of the medical discrimination keenly. “I was not allowed to go back to the building to get my uniforms or things. I never had a farewell. I was treated like a criminal,” she said.
“They have officers who use excessive use of force, who fall asleep on duty, who drink drive and crash and kill people, who leave guns on seats – I’ve never done anything like that.”
Andrew described a similar experience. “On the day of my resignation, I wasn’t permitted to enter the station grounds.”
“But a friend and colleague did bring me out some leftovers from an earlier function as a send-off as I finalised paperwork, uniforms, and equipment outside the station on the roadway – because being unvaccinated, I was still regarded as a threat.”
Russ said he felt “shunned” by the AFP’s policy of physically isolating him from his colleagues.
“Before my dismissal, they presented me with my medals but I wasn’t allowed to go to the presentation with everyone else,” he recalled of his final days in the force.
Dennison also railed against the “hypocrisy” of the AFP’s official statements. “My children are Aboriginal. They said they care about Aboriginals but they knew we would lose our home two weeks before Christmas.”
Last year, a landmark Supreme Court ruling declared the Queensland (QLD) Police Commissioner’s Covid vaccine mandate ‘unlawful’ under the QLD human rights act.
However, this was a narrow win for two reasons. First, the judge only found the mandate unlawful because the Police Commissioner “did not consider the human rights ramifications” prior to implementing the mandate, meaning that if she had completed the right protocols, it would have been okay.
Secondly, Australia has no federal bill of rights or human rights act, and neither do most states and territories, meaning this legal win is not applicable to police force employees in other jurisdictions.
West Australian (WA) policeman Ben Falconer’s failed Supreme Court challenge over the WA Police Covid vaccine mandates proves this point. The judge found the mandates to be “valid and lawful” despite the order’s infringements on employees’ human rights.
Similarly, a Fair Work challenge for unfair dismissal over the AFP vaccine mandate, brought by Matthew Kim Wilson, was struck down last year. The judge determined that even though the Commissioner’s vaccination order may not have been supported by evidence at the time of Wilson’s dismissal (in May 2023, after Wilson had used all available leave entitlements), Wilson was required to have followed it regardless. Therefore, his dismissal was “not unfair.”
The former officers I spoke with have sought legal consultation – they were advised that the AFP has “deep pockets” and that you would need “about $500,000 to take them on.”
“Who has that to spend when you’ve lost your house and your job?” asked Dennison.
It has recently been reported that the AFP is at “breaking point,” struggling with mass vacancies due to poor recruitment and retention rates. However, it is uncertain how many employees were terminated or forced to resign due to the Covid vaccine mandate, as the AFP has not released this information.
It is also uncertain how the mandates and other Covid measures have affected federal police morale, although data collected on the beleaguered WA Police force found that morale was at an all-time low after the Covid period, with nearly three-quarters of respondents saying they’d recently used mental health services.
The AFP was one of the last holdouts to drop the Covid mandates, although incredibly, some Australian institutions still require the shots as a condition of work. In one of the most high-profile examples, 40 Victorian firefighters remain unable to return to work due to the mandate.
Co-director of the Australian Firefighters Alliance, Josh Hawkes, told Outsiders that the Covid vaccine mandate had been in place more than two years after the pandemic declaration had been revoked in October 2022, leaving Victorians short of firefighters for four Christmases in a row."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/aoc-decorates-office-doorway-with-notes-like-i-heart-abortion,AOC Decorates Office Doorway With Notes Like “I Heart Abortion”,By Patrick Howley | Patrick Reports,1 month ago,"Washington, D.C. — Democrat New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has decorated her office door and the walls around her congressional office on Capitol Hill with sticky Post-It notes from some of her alleged fans and well-wishers. The Post-It notes that her office chooses to display include numerous messages supporting illegal immigration, a note identifying AOC as a “Big Booty Latina,” and a message that says “I Heart Abortion.”
A PATRICK REPORTS investigation on Capitol Hill unveiled some disturbing Post-It propaganda on AOC’s doorway, mixed in with at least one romantic request for the New York congresslady and various conventional left-wing rants expressing misery and paranoia. Many of the messages indicate that the Post-Its were written by visitors to AOC’s office. In general, there is a lot of Spanish on AOC’s office doorway.
As we show you in this video, Team AOC is evidently proud to display a message that says “I Heart Abortion.”
“I Heart Abortion and the Green New Deal!! Thank you,” says one Post-It note marked with a sideways smiley face.
“To AOC From A Dreamer! #DACAMENTED,” says one note from an AOC fan.
“Work Permits For ALL! Dreamers of Today” says one Sticky Note that Team AOC chooses to feature at her congressional office in the nation’s capital.
Multiple AOC fans want the United States to close down the Adelanto ICE Detention Center in California.
“Big Booty Latina AOC” says one note, using an expression popularized by comedian Alex Stein. The sentiment behind the message is unclear, but it’s right outside AOC’s office."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/here-are-the-three-goals-that-trump-wants-to-achieve-through-his-global-trade-war,Here Are The Three Goals That Trump Wants To Achieve Through His Global Trade War,By Andrew Korybko | Substack,1 month ago,"He hopes to strengthen the US’ supply chain sovereignty, renegotiate its ties with all countries with a view towards getting them to distance themselves from China, and shape the emerging world order.
Trump’s decision to tariff the entire world to varying extents as revenge for their tariffs against the US has shaken the global economy to its core. Instead of restoring free and fair trade like he claims to want, which would give American companies an advantage, he might inadvertently accelerate regionalization trends and the subsequent division of the world into a collection of trade blocs. Even in that scenario, however, he could still advance the three unstated goals that are responsible for this policy.
Even if Trump’s global trade war unintentionally turbocharges regionalization trends and the subsequent division of the world into a collection of trade blocs instead of serving as the unprecedented power play that he expects, the US could still take advantage of this to implement its “Fortress America” policy. This refers to the US restoring its unipolar hegemony over the Western Hemisphere, which would make it strategically autarkic if it receives preferential access to these countries’ resources and markets.
In that event, the US would survive and could even thrive even if it’s pushed out of the Eastern Hemisphere upon losing the major war that it might be planning or if the consequences thereof make that part of the world too dysfunctional for the US to manage, which could lead to the US returning to its 1920s-like isolationism. To be clear, the US is unlikely to voluntarily abandon the Eastern Hemisphere, but it would still make sense to plan for that possibility just in case circumstances compel it to do so."

The EUobserver claims that “rule of law in Hungary continues to deteriorate,” which is why EU institutions are considering accelerating sanctions under Article 7 of the Treaty.
This claim comes even as Marine Le Pen is banned from running for office in France on trumped-up charges as well as the presidential frontrunner in Romania, Călin Georgescu, being banned from running for president and suffering a show-trial arrest. At the same time, Germany is working on banning the largest opposition party in the country, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), all in a clear breach of fundamental democratic rights.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/paris-court-set-to-rule-on-le-pen-appeal-in-summer-of-2026,Paris Court Set To Rule on Le Pen Appeal in Summer of 2026,By Javier Villamor | The European Conservative,1 month ago,"The Paris Court of Appeal announced on Tuesday that it will deliver its ruling on Marine Le Pen’s appeal against her corruption conviction in the summer of 2026. The appeal follows a March 31st verdict that found her guilty of embezzling European Parliament funds. If the appeal is successful, it could clear the way for Le Pen to run in the 2027 presidential election. However, the immediate disqualification imposed by the Paris court has effectively put her political future on hold, a move her supporters view as a deliberate attempt to exclude her from the electoral race.
Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison (with two years to be served), a fine of €100,000, and a five-year disqualification from public office for misuse of European funds between 2004 and 2016. During this period, parliamentary assistants of the then National Front worked for the party in France instead of for the European Parliament. The ruling estimates the damage at €6.8 million, impacting 24 people linked to the RN, including names like Louis Aliot and Julien Odoul. Le Pen’s lawyers filed an appeal on Tuesday and the Court of Appeal confirmed it had received three appeals related to the case. While the appeal suspends the prison sentence and fine, the disqualification remains in effect—an aspect that has intensified criticism from the right.
“The court will examine the case in accordance with a timetable that should allow a decision to be reached in the summer of 2026,” the official statement said. This timetable, however, poses a challenge for Le Pen, a clear favorite in the polls for the 2027 presidential election. Even if the disqualification is overturned, the ruling will come too late for her to be able to organize a smooth campaign. During the trial last autumn, Le Pen’s defence said that the work of assistants for the party is part of an MEP’s mandate, arguing that the EP’s rules are ambiguous. “An assistant works for his MEP and can do so for the benefit of his party,” she said.
The ruling has reignited the debate on judicial impartiality in France. While some celebrate it as a triumph against corruption, others see it as an attack on the RN, the main opposition force to the current system. The case is not isolated: parties such as François Bayrou’s MoDem andJean-Luc Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise have faced similar accusations.
The RN also faces a financial blow: the fines could aggravate the economic difficulties of a party already struggling to borrow money. Meanwhile, Le Pen has vowed to exhaust all legal options, including a potential appeal to the Constitutional Council. However, with a judicial calendar that leaves her out of the race until 2026 and a perceived hostile political establishment, her road to the 2027 election is becoming increasingly difficult for the leader who embodies France’s conservative resistance."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/tensions-mount-between-washington-tehran-as-trump-seeks-iran-nuclear-deal,Tensions Mount Between Washington & Tehran as Trump Seeks Iran Nuclear Deal,By Sean Miller,1 month ago,"On Tuesday the United States and Iran increased the militaristic rhetoric against each other, with some reports claiming that Tehran is preparing for preemptive long-range ballistic missile strikes against a joint U.S. and U.K. air base of Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean. What appears to have kicked off the recent quarrel was some tough words by President Donald Trump who ordered Tehran to enter into a new nuclear deal with Washington, part of his ongoing agenda of global denuclearization. Notably, Trump was unhappy with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, withdrew from it during his first term in office, and has since been seeking to enact a new agreement.
“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” Trump said in a telephone interview with NBC Sunday. “It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before … There’s a chance that if they don’t make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago.”
Trump’s warning during the NBC interview followed the delivery of a his official letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which urged direct negotiations for a new nuclear deal. Iran however rejected the proposal due to a breakdown in trust stemming from Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and his subsequent ‘maximum pressure’ policy, characterized by stiff financial sanctions.
Notably, this 2015 ‘Iran nuclear deal’ involved President Barack Obama shipping $400 million in cash on pallets to Tehran.
“No other transaction in U.S. history has involved a planeload of bills, say diplomatic historians, raising questions about payment timed to help free prisoners,” the Times of Israel said in 2016.
“Iran state TV announced an $80 million bounty for President Trump’s head on Sunday following the targeting strike of Qassam Soleimani despite the fact the nation is suffering under crippling sanctions,” Jamie White said in an article on Infowars in 2020. “Given the crushing U.S. economic sanctions bearing down on Iran, how is the Islamic nation able to offer such a large reward for Trump’s assassination? The answer may lie in the $1.7 billion payment former President Obama sent to Iran, including $400 million delivered on pallets in a C-130 as part of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) in 2015. The ‘compromise’ payment was made as part of the $150 billion sanction relief to Iran for the nuclear deal despite the fact both Obama and former Secretary of State John Kerry outright admitted some of that money would be used to fund terrorism.”
A decade on, no deal has been signed and tensions are beginning to mount, however there are signs of a peaceful path forward.
“Despite rejecting direct talks, Iran has indicated a willingness to engage in indirect negotiations, signaling a potential path forward, though tensions remain high,” Newsweek said Monday.
Currently however, the Islamic nation is preparing for battle, at least in rhetoric.
On Monday Khamenei said that Tehran would respond “decisively and immediately” to any threat issued by the U.S.
On Sunday it was reported that the Islamic nation’s missiles are loaded onto launchers and are ready for use, followed by a direct threat to the U.S. and its allies.

Interestingly, Trump’s threat of bombing appears to have been made with the intent that the political fallout will result in an Iran which complies with Trump’s greater anti-nuclear-proliferation and denuclearization agenda. It indicates that the Trump administration is willing to expend all options, including military options, to achieve this objective.
Iran has not backed down, however. Political analyst Dominic Michael Tripi reported on Tuesday that the target Iran’s missiles may strike is the joint U.S. / U.K. military base at Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean.
BREAKING: Iran preparing for preemptive long-range ballistic missile strike on US-UK air base.
Diego Garcia, it’s a base on an island in the Indian Ocean.
“This is a tightrope Khamenei will increasingly be forced to walk as he plays for time and engages in nuclear escalation,” Behnam Ben Taleblu, an Iran expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said. “U.S. policy should be to keep Khamenei off balance.”
On Tuesday Iran reportedly seized two foreign oil tankers it accused of smuggling diesel fuel, adding further tension to the situation.
Russia, which is generally allied with Iran, has condemned the potential U.S. strikes against Iran.
“Threats are indeed being heard, ultimatums are also being heard,” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Russian journal “International Affairs” in an interview, extracts of which were published on Tuesday and reported by Reuters. “We consider such methods inappropriate, we condemn them, we consider them a way for (the U.S.) to impose its own will on the Iranian side.”
With Washington negotiating peace between Moscow and Kiev in the Ukraine war, potential military moves against Tehran could also indicate a strategy of ‘applied tension’ against Russia, via Iran."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/incoming-german-government-to-push-for-more-eu-lawfare-against-conservatives,Incoming German Government to Push for More EU Lawfare Against Conservatives,By Tamás Orbán | The European Conservative,1 month ago,"The nominally ‘center-right’ CDU and the socialist SPD—likely forming Germany’s next government—have agreed to demand much harsher punishments from Brussels against member states accused of rule-of-law violations. This would include withholding EU funds from member states and suspending their voting rights in the European Council, stripping them of their right to veto EU legislation.
The EU has frozen certain funds after triggering infringement procedures against Hungary and Poland before, and there are plans to make every type of EU funding dependent on the same rule-of-law conditionality in the future.
However, suspending the voting rights of a member state has never been done before, as EU countries are understandably afraid of creating a precedent that could be used against them in the future. For a long time, Germany was among the most strongly opposed to this ‘nuclear option’—not anymore, it seems.
According to the current draft coalition agreement between the CDU and SPD:
Existing protective instruments, from infringement proceedings and the withholding of EU funds to the suspension of membership rights such as voting rights in the Council of the EU, must be applied much more consistently than before.
The agreement does not explicitly mention Hungary, but it’s clearly a reference to the country’s conservative government, which still has some €20 billion in EU funds frozen due to being in “serious breach” of the bloc’s core values and fundamental rights.
These include alleged discrimination against the LGBT community within the Child Protection Act of 2022 as well as the treatment of illegal migrants who are required by Hungarian law to submit their asylum applications before entering the country.
There’s no question about the political hypocrisy of using these tools, which are meant as a form of ideological blackmail to either force the conservative government to enact progressive legislation or pressure its citizens into voting it out.
Poland’s frozen funds, for instance, were almost immediately released after the conservative PiS government was replaced by Donald Tusk’s liberal regime, despite the fact that not a single reform had been implemented at the time, and that Tusk has been engaged in blatant rule-of-law violations against the opposition and conservative civil society ever since.
The coalition agreement also makes it clear that the ultimate goal is not the protection of ‘EU values’ but circumventing Hungary’s (and any other member states’) veto power. This is especially alarming since the unanimity principle, especially in foreign policy, has always been a foundational tenet of EU legislation, put forward by the treaties as the most important guarantee of member state sovereignty.
Yet, the draft agreement foresees that Berlin will advocate
an expansion of qualified majority voting in the Council of the EU, particularly on certain issues of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), such as the imposition of sanctions.
Shifting to qualified majority voting instead of unanimity has long been the dream of the EU elite, as it would prevent any individual country from vetoing a common position. Under the qualified majority system, a vote needs to be supported only by half of the member states representing at least 65% of the EU population to pass—meaning that the democratic opinion of one-third of EU citizens can be discarded as long as you have the support of larger countries, such as Germany.
Once considered a taboo in Brussels, this could finally become a reality if it lends its weight to these efforts. But once Pandora’s box has been opened, the future consequences for all member states cannot be understated, as the EU will be one (giant) step closer to becoming a centralized superstate."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/germanys-cdu-spd-coalition-eyes-stricter-online-speech-controls,Germany’s CDU-SPD Coalition Eyes Stricter Online Speech Controls,By Cindy Harper | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"Germany may soon tighten its grip on digital speech even further, as internal documents obtained by BILD from the ongoing coalition talks between the center-right CDU (led by Friedrich Merz) and the center-left SPD (headed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz) point to an unsettling agenda: expanding the state’s authority to police so-called “disinformation.”
Behind closed doors, the prospective coalition appears to be crafting policies that would significantly broaden state influence over what can and cannot be said online — particularly on social media platforms. These proposals, originating from the coalition’s “Culture and Media” working group, show a clear intent to escalate pressure on platforms like X and intensify efforts to suppress content labeled as “fake news.”
The push is rooted in the belief, echoed in the coalition’s exploratory paper, that “disinformation and fake news” pose a danger to democracy. But the negotiating paper goes even further, declaring: “The deliberate dissemination of false factual allegations is not covered by freedom of expression.” This phrase, quoted by BILD, lays the groundwork for potentially sweeping restrictions on speech, raising serious alarms among legal experts and free speech advocates.
The document argues that a supposedly independent media regulatory body must be empowered to crack down on so-called “information manipulation,” as well as “hatred and incitement” — all under the vague condition that it adheres to “clear legal requirements.” But when the government or its proxies begin defining what qualifies as misinformation, the door swings wide open for politically motivated censorship.
Many will see this as a dangerous step toward criminalizing dissent. Legal scholar Volker Boehme-Neßler of the University of Oldenburg told BILD, “Lies are only prohibited if they are punishable, for example in the case of incitement to hatred. Otherwise, you can lie.” He also stressed that the boundary between fact and opinion is often blurry and contested: “It is not a simple question of what is a statement of fact and what is an expression of opinion. In most cases, courts interpret freedom of expression very broadly.”
The move mirrors broader concerns raised internationally. US Vice President JD Vance previously slammed Germany’s trajectory on both mass migration and censorship, warning that Berlin’s crackdown on dissent risks becoming self-destructive.
With political speech increasingly vulnerable to arbitrary classification as misinformation, critics worry that these new policies represent not a defense of democracy, but an erosion of one of its most fundamental pillars: the right to free and open debate."

The anti-Musk protesters could be heard shouting from afar as Musk addressed a crowd in Green Bay, Wisc., as he reported DOGE’s progress and took questions on its elimination of government fraud, waste and abuse.
“I knew a few Soros operatives would be in the audience! Give my regards to George!”-Elon MuskMarch 30, 2025💀pic.twitter.com/nP6vfScjYq
“It was inevitable that at least a few Soros operatives would be in the audience,” the laughing Tesla CEO told the crowd, adding, “Give my regards to George!” as he waved goodbye to the protesters.
The disruption comes as unhinged leftists have been waging political violence against Tesla vehicles and dealerships throughout the country, apparently upset by DOGE’s cuts to the sprawling federal bureaucracy.
Soros, meanwhile, has been linked to ultra-left activist groups through his Open Society Foundations non-governmental organization.

Elsewhere throughout the town hall, Musk handed $1 million checks to two lucky Wisconsin voters, remarked on how his pro-Trump activism was affecting Tesla’s stock, suggested he’ll look into “strangely wealthy members of Congress,” and said he prefers a small group of federal leaders like “when the United States was formed.”

Describing US President George Washington’s small cabinet when he took office in 1789, Musk said, “You had the Secretary of State, Secretary of War – which I think is a more accurate name than [Secretary of] Defense, but it was Secretary of War for a long time – and you had Secretary of the Treasury and you had the Attorney General, that was it.”
“And if it were entirely up to me, I’d be like, ‘Let’s make it like that again.'”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/usaid-and-the-architecture-of-perception,USAID and the Architecture of Perception,By Josh Stylman | Brownstone Institute,1 month ago,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has long portrayed itself as America’s humanitarian aid organization, delivering assistance to developing nations. With an annual budget of nearly $40 billion and operations in over 100 countries, it represents one of the largest foreign aid institutions in the world. But recent disclosures reveal its true nature as something far more systematic: an architect of global consciousness.
Consider: Reuters, one of the world’s most trusted news sources, received USAID funding for ‘Large Scale Social Deception’ and ‘Social Engineering Defence.’ While there’s debate about the exact scope of these programs, the implications are staggering: a division of one of the world’s most relied-upon sources for objective reporting was paid by a US government agency for systemic reality construction. This funding goes beyond traditional media support, representing a deliberate infrastructure for discourse framing that fundamentally challenges the concept of ‘objective’ reporting.
But it goes deeper. In what reads like a Michael Crichton plot come to life, the recent USAID revelations show a staggering reach of narrative control. Take Internews Network, a USAID-financed NGO that has pushed nearly half a billion dollars ($472.6m) through a secretive network, ‘working with’ 4,291 media outlets. In just one year, they produced 4,799 hours of broadcasts reaching up to 778 million people and ‘trained’ over 9,000 journalists. This isn’t just funding – it’s a systematic infrastructure of consciousness manipulation.
The revelations show USAID funding both the Wuhan Lab’s gain-of-function research and the media outlets that would shape the story around what emerged from it. Backing organizations that would fabricate impeachment evidence. Funding both the election systems that facilitate outcomes and the fact-checkers that determine which discussions about those outcomes are permitted. But these disclosures point to something far more significant than mere corruption.
These revelations didn’t emerge from nowhere – they come from government grant disclosures, FOIA requests, and official records that aren’t even hidden, just ignored. As my old friend Mark Schiffer noted the other day, ‘The most important truths today cannot be debated – they must be felt as totalities.’ The pattern, once seen, cannot be unseen. Some may question DOGE’s methods or the rapid pace of these disclosures, and those constitutional concerns deserve serious discussion. But that’s a separate conversation from what these documents reveal. The revelations themselves – documented in official records and grant disclosures – are undeniable and should shock anyone who values truth. The means of exposure matter far less than what’s being exposed: one of the largest narrative control operations in history.
No domain is untouched – markets, tech, culture, health, and obviously, media – and you’ll find the same design. Intelligence agencies are deeply embedded in each domain because shaping how we perceive reality is more powerful than controlling reality itself
Just as fiat currency replaced real value with declared value, we now see the same pattern everywhere: fiat science replaces inquiry with predetermined conclusions, fiat culture replaces organic development with curated influence, fiat history replaces lived experience with manufactured narratives. We live in an era of fiat everything – where reality itself is declared, not discovered. And just as they create artificial scarcity in monetary systems, they manufacture false choices everywhere else – presenting us with artificial binaries that obscure the true complexity of our world.
As Schiffer wrote elsewhere, reality no longer requires consensus, only coherence. But there’s a crucial distinction: real coherence emerges naturally across multiple domains, reflecting deeper truths that cannot be fabricated. The coherence imposed by perception management isn’t truth – it’s a controlled discourse engineered for consistency, not discovery. The USAID receipts now provide concrete evidence of how this manufactured coherence is built: a scripted reality where the appearance of logic is more important than actual substance.
This isn’t just pattern matching – it’s pattern prediction. Just as algorithms learn to recognize and anticipate behavioral patterns, those who understand this system’s architecture can see its next moves before they’re made. The question isn’t whether something is “true” or “false” – it’s understanding how information flows shape consciousness itself.
To understand how deep this goes, let’s examine their methodology. As Dr. Sherri Tenpenny and others have meticulously documented through FOIA requests and government grant disclosures, the pattern emerges through two primary vectors of control:
Information Control:
Health and Development:
Cultural Programming:
What emerges is not just a list of expenditures, but a blueprint for global reality architecture: From Kazakhstan to Ireland, from Serbia to Peru, from Vietnam to Egypt – there isn’t a corner of the world untouched by this system. This isn’t merely a distribution of resources, but a strategic infrastructure of global influence. Each allocation – whether to media outlets, health initiatives, or cultural programs – represents a carefully placed node in a network designed to shape perception across multiple domains. First, control the flow of information through media funding. Then, establish legitimacy through health and development programs. Finally, reshape social structures through cultural programming. The end goal isn’t just to influence what people think, but to determine the boundaries of what can be thought – and to do so on a planetary scale.
For those who’ve been studying the architecture of censorship, like Mike Benz has been documenting for years, none of this comes as a surprise. It’s perfect symmetry: we knew about the censorship. Now we’re seeing the receipts. One hand feeds them talking points, the other hand feeds them our taxpayer dollars. This isn’t speculation; it’s documented fact. Even Wikipedia’s own funding database contains over 45,000 reports tied to USAID – many detailing corruption, media influence, and financial manipulation. The evidence has always been there, but it was ignored, dismissed, or buried under the very fact-checking apparatus USAID funds. These weren’t crackpot theories; they were warnings. And now, we finally have the receipts.
And it doesn’t stop at controlling information. USAID isn’t just shaping media portrayals – it’s funding the systems that enforce them. Last week, Benz broke a bombshell: USAID gives twice as much money ($27 million) to the fiscal sponsor of the group controlling Soros-funded prosecutors than Soros himself gives ($14 million). This isn’t about one billionaire’s influence – it’s about state-backed enforcement of scripted accounts. The same network that dictates what you can think is dictating who prosecutes crime, what laws are enforced, and who faces consequences.
USAID’s influence isn’t just about funding media control—it extends to direct political interference. It didn’t just send aid to Brazil – it funded censorship, backed left-wing activists, and helped rig the 2022 election against Bolsonaro.
Former State Department official Benz revealed that the agency waged a “holy war on censorship,” systematically suppressing Bolsonaro supporters online while bolstering opposition voices. Millions flowed to NGOs pushing leftist framing, including the Felipe Neto Institute, which received US funding while Bolsonaro’s allies were deplatformed. USAID also bankrolled Amazon-based activist groups, financed media campaigns designed to manipulate public opinion, and funneled money into Brazilian organizations that pushed for stricter internet regulations.
This wasn’t aid – it was election interference disguised as democracy promotion. USAID used American tax dollars to decide Brazil’s future, and it likely deployed similar tactics in many other countries – all under the guise of humanitarian assistance.
And it’s not just abroad. While USAID’s defenders claim it’s a tool for charity and development in poor nations, the evidence suggests something much more insidious. It’s a $40 billion driver of regime change overseas – and now, evidence points to its involvement in regime change efforts at home. Alongside the CIA, USAID appears to have played a role in the 2019 impeachment of Trump – an illegal effort to overturn a US election using the same tools of perception sculpting and political engineering it deploys abroad.
Left vs right, vaxxed vs unvaxxed, Russia vs Ukraine, believer vs skeptic (on any topic) – these false dichotomies serve to fragment our understanding while reality itself is far more nuanced and multidimensional. Each manufactured crisis spawns not just reactions, but reactions to those reactions, creating endless layers of derivative meaning built on artificial foundations.
The real power isn’t in manufacturing individual facts, but in creating systems where false facts become self-reinforcing. When a fact-checker cites another fact-checker who cites a “trusted source” that’s funded by the same entities funding the fact-checkers, the pattern becomes clear. The truth isn’t in any individual claim – it’s in recognizing how the claims work together to create a closed system of artificial reality.
Take the vaccine debate for example: The pattern manifests before the explanation – people passionately debate efficacy without realizing the entire framework was constructed. First, they fund the research. Then they fund the media to shape the narrative. Even skeptics often fall into their trap, arguing about effectiveness rates while accepting their basic premise. The moment you debate ‘vaccine efficacy,’ you’ve already lost – you’re using their framework to discuss what is, in reality, an experimental gene therapy. By accepting their terminology, their metrics, their framing of the discussion itself, you’re playing into their constructed reality. Each layer of control is designed not just to influence opinions, but to preemptively structure how those opinions can be formed.
Like learning to spot a staged photo or hearing a false note in music, developing a reliable bullshit detector requires pattern recognition. Once you start seeing how narratives are constructed – how language is weaponized, how frameworks are built – it changes the lens with which you view the whole world. The same intelligence agencies embedding themselves in every domain that shapes our understanding aren’t just controlling information flow – they’re programming how we process that information itself.
The recursive theater plays out in real time. When USAID announced funding cuts, BBC News rushed to amplify humanitarian concerns with dramatic headlines about HIV patients and endangered lives. What they didn’t mention in their reporting? USAID is their top funder, bankrolling BBC Media Action with millions in direct payments. Watch how the system protects itself: the largest recipient of USAID media funding creates emotional propaganda about USAID’s importance while obfuscating their financial relationship in their reporting.
This institutional self-defense illustrates a crucial pattern: organizations funded for reality construction protect themselves through layers of misdirection. When presented with evidence, the fact-checking apparatus funded by these same systems springs into action. They’ll tell you that these payments were for standard “subscriptions,” that programs promoting gender ideology are really just about “equality and rights.” But when USAID awards $2 million to Asociación Lambda in Guatemala for “gender-affirming health care” – which can include surgeries, hormone therapy, and counseling – those same defenders conveniently omit the details, blurring the line between advocacy and direct intervention. The very organizations funded for social architecture are the ones telling you there is no social architecture. It’s akin to asking the arsonist to investigate the fire.
Like characters in a grand production, I watch old friends still trusting in institutions like the New York Times. Even this exposition becomes a potential node in the system – the very act of revealing the mechanics of control might itself be anticipated, another layer of the recursive theater. In my earlier work on technocracy, I explored how our digital world has evolved far beyond Truman Burbank’s physical dome. His world had visible walls, cameras, and scripted encounters – a constructed reality he could theoretically escape by reaching its edges. Our prison is more sophisticated: no walls, no visible limits, just algorithmic containment that shapes thought itself. Truman only had to sail far enough to find the truth. But how do you sail beyond the boundaries of perception when the ocean itself is programmed?
Sure, USAID has done some good work – but so did Al Capone with his soup kitchens. Just as the infamous gangster’s charity work made him untouchable in his community, USAID’s aid programs create a veneer of benevolence that makes questioning their larger agenda politically impossible. Philanthropic window-dressing has long been a tool for power players to shield themselves from scrutiny. Consider Jimmy Savile: a celebrated philanthropist whose charity work granted him access to hospitals and vulnerable children while he committed unspeakable crimes in plain sight. His carefully cultivated image made him beyond reproach for decades, just as institutional benevolence now serves as a protective layer for global influence operations. The true function of organizations like USAID isn’t just aid – it’s social architecture, mind shaping, and the laundering of taxpayer dollars through an intricate web of NGOs and foundations.
This layered deception is self-reinforcing – each level of manufactured reality is protected by another level of institutional authority. These institutions don’t just dictate stories; they shape the infrastructure through which narratives are disseminated. For what it’s worth, I believe most tools themselves are neutral. The same digital systems that enable mass surveillance could empower individual sovereignty. The same networks that centralize control could facilitate decentralized cooperation. The question isn’t the technology itself, but whether it’s deployed to concentrate or distribute power.
This understanding didn’t come from nowhere. Those who first sensed this artificiality were dismissed as conspiracy theorists. We noticed the coordination across outlets, the strange synchronicity of messaging, the way certain stories were amplified while others disappeared. Now we have the sales receipts showing exactly how that manipulation was funded and orchestrated.
I know this journey of discovery intimately. When I started understanding the dangers of mRNA technology, I went all in. I connected with the incredibly talented filmmaker Jennifer Sharp and helped with Anecdotals, her film about vaccine injuries. I was ready to tether my whole identity to this cause. But then I started zooming out. I began seeing how Covid might have been a financial crime designed to usher in central bank digital currency. The deeper I looked, the more I realized these weren’t isolated deceptions – it was part of a larger system of control. The very fabric of what I thought was real began to dissolve.
What disturbed me most was seeing how deeply programming relies on mimicry. Humans are imitative creatures by nature – it’s how we learn, how we build culture. But this natural tendency has been weaponized. I’d present friends with peer-reviewed studies, documented evidence, historical connections – only to watch them respond with verbatim talking points from corporate media. It wasn’t that they disagreed – it was that they weren’t even processing the information. They were pattern-matching against pre-approved chronicles, outsourcing their thinking to “trusted experts” who were themselves caught in the same web of manufactured perception. I realized then: none of us knows anything for certain – we’re all just mimicking what we’ve been programmed to believe is authoritative knowledge.
The challenge isn’t just seeing through any single deception – it’s understanding how these systems work together in complex, non-linear ways. When we fixate on individual threads, we miss the larger pattern. Like pulling a thread on a sweater and watching it unravel, eventually you realize there was no sweater in the first place – just an intricately woven illusion. Just as a hologram contains the whole image in each fragment, every piece of this system reflects the larger blueprint for reality construction.
Consider the $34 million to Politico – this isn’t just a funding stream, but a holographic reveal of the entire system. It’s not merely that Politico received money; it’s that this single transaction contains the entire blueprint of perception management. The payment itself is a microcosm: struggling media outlet, government funding, narrative control – each element reflects the whole. This recursive system protects itself through layers of self-validation. When critics point out media bias, fact-checkers funded by the same system declare it ‘debunked.’ When researchers question official accounts, journals funded by the same interests reject their work. Even the language of resistance – ‘speaking truth to power,’ ‘fighting disinformation,’ ‘protecting democracy’ – has been co-opted and weaponized by the very system it was meant to challenge.
The Covid story epitomizes this systemic manipulation. What began as a public health crisis transformed into a global experiment in narrative control – demonstrating how rapidly populations could be reshaped through coordinated messaging, institutional authority, and weaponized fear. The pandemic wasn’t just about a virus; it was a proof of concept for how comprehensively human cognition could be engineered – a single node revealing the true scope and ambition of discourse manipulation.
Think about the cycle: American taxpayers unknowingly funded the crisis itself – then paid again to be deceived about it. They paid for the development of gain-of-function research, then paid again for the messaging that would convince them to accept masks, lockdowns, and experimental interventions. The system is so confident in its psychological control that it doesn’t even bother hiding the evidence anymore.
As I’ve documented in my Engineering Reality series, this framework for consciousness management runs far deeper than most can imagine. USAID’s revelations aren’t isolated incidents – they’re glimpses into a vast system of social design that has been in operation for decades. When the same agency funding your fact-checkers is openly paying for ‘social deception,’ when your trusted news sources are receiving direct payments for ‘social architecture,’ the very framework of what we consider ‘real’ begins to crumble.
We’re not just watching events unfold – we’re watching reactions to artificial events, then reactions to those reactions, creating an infinite regression of derivative meaning. People form passionate positions about issues that were constructed, then others define themselves in opposition to those positions. Each layer of reaction fuels the next phase of steered consensus. What we’re witnessing isn’t just the spread of manufactured realities, but the architecture of cultural and geopolitical trends themselves. Artificial trends spawn authentic reactions, which generate counter-reactions, until we’ve built entire societies responding to carefully orchestrated theater. The social engineers aren’t just steering individual beliefs – they’re reshaping the very foundations of how humans make sense of the world.
These revelations are just the tip of the iceberg. Anyone paying attention to the depth and depravity of the corruption knows that this is only the beginning. As more information emerges, the illusion of neutrality, of benevolence, of institutions acting in the public interest, will crumble. No one who truly engages with this information is walking away with renewed faith in the system. The shift is only happening in one direction – some faster than others, but none in reverse. The real question is: what happens when a critical mass reaches the point where their foundational understanding of the world collapses? When they realize that the records shaping their perception were never organic, but manufactured? Some will refuse to look, choosing comfort over confrontation. But for those willing to face it, this is not just about corruption – it’s about the very nature of the reality they thought they inhabited.
The implications are staggering not just for individual awareness, but for our very ability to function as a republic. How can citizens make informed decisions when reality itself has been splintered into competing manufactured tales? When people discover that their most deeply held beliefs were shaped, that their passionate causes were scripted, that even their cultural interests and tastes were curated, that their opposition to certain systems was anticipated and designed – what remains of authentic human experience?
What’s coming will force a choice: either retreat into comfortable denial, dismissing mounting evidence as “right-wing conspiracy theories,” or face the shattering realization that the world we thought we inhabited never actually existed. My research over the past few years points to far more nefarious activities yet to be revealed – operations so heinous that many will simply refuse to process them.
As I wrote about in “The Second Matrix,” there’s always the risk of falling into another layer of controlled awakening. But the greater risk lies in thinking too small, in anchoring ourselves to any single thread of understanding. The USAID revelations aren’t just about exposing one agency’s role in shaping reality – they’re about recognizing how our very thought patterns have been colonized by recursive layers of artificial reality.
This is the true crisis of our time: not just the manipulation of reality, but the fragmentation of human consciousness itself. When people grasp that their beliefs, causes, and even their resistance were shaped within this system, they are forced to confront the deeper question: What does it mean to reclaim one’s own mind?
But here’s what they don’t want you to realize: seeing through these systems is profoundly liberating. When you understand how reality is constructed, you’re no longer bound by its artificial constraints. This isn’t just about exposing deception – it’s about freeing consciousness itself from manufactured limitations.
The jig may be up on USAID’s reality architecture operation. But the deeper challenge lies in reconstructing meaning in a world where the very fabric of reality has been woven from artificial threads. The choice we face isn’t just between comfortable illusion and uncomfortable truth. The old system demanded validation before belief. The new reality requires something else entirely: the ability to recognize patterns before they’re officially confirmed, to feel coherence across multiple domains, to step outside the crafted game completely. This isn’t about choosing sides in their manufactured binaries – it’s about seeing the pattern architecture itself.
What does this liberation look like in practice? It’s catching the pattern of a manufactured crisis before it’s fully deployed. It’s recognizing how seemingly unrelated events – a banking collapse, a health emergency, a social movement – are actually nodes in the same network of control. It’s understanding that true sovereignty isn’t about having all the answers, but about developing the capacity to sense the web of deception before it solidifies into apparent reality. Because the ultimate power isn’t in knowing every answer – it’s in realizing when the question itself has been designed to trap you inside the manufactured paradigm.
As we develop this pattern recognition capacity – this ability to see through algorithmic manipulation – what it means to be human is itself evolving. As these systems of ideological infrastructure crumble, our task isn’t just to preserve individual awakening but to protect and nurture the most conscious elements of humanity. The ultimate liberation isn’t just seeing through the deception – it’s maintaining our essential humanity in a world of tightly controlled perception.
As these systems of reality sculpting crumble, we have an unprecedented opportunity to rediscover what’s real – not through their manufactured frameworks, but through our own direct experience of truth. What’s authentic isn’t always what’s organic – in a mediated world, authenticity means conscious choice rather than unconscious reaction. It means understanding how our minds are shaped while maintaining our capacity for genuine connection, creative expression, and direct experience. The most human elements – love, creativity, intuition, genuine discovery – become more precious precisely because they defy algorithmic control. These are the last frontiers of human freedom—the unpredictable, unquantifiable forces that cannot be reduced to data points or behavioral models."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-seeks-to-make-dc-safe-prosperous,Trump Seeks to Make DC Safe & Prosperous,By Sean Miller,1 month ago,"On Friday President Donald Trump announced a task force to make the capital city of Washington D.C. safe and more prosperous in the face of rampant crime and despair. He signed an executive order on Friday which backs up legislation from Congress which will fund public functions of the district. Fascinatingly, investigative journalist Wid Lyman recently wrote an exposé following a ride-along with D.C. police where he documented the ‘third world wasteland’.
“D.C. is the only city that belongs to all Americans… As the capital city of the greatest Nation in the history of the world, it should showcase beautiful, clean, and safe public spaces,” President Trump wrote in a post Saturday.
Specifically, Trump’s taskforce focuses on the illegal alien invasion and allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms when licensed to do so.
“The task force would be responsible for enforcing federal immigration law, including ‘redirecting’ resources to ‘apprehend and deport illegal aliens’ in the D.C. area and monitoring the District’s ‘sanctuary-city status’,” Roll Call said Friday. “Other assignments for the task force include helping to speed up and lowering the cost of processing concealed carry license requests in D.C. and ’employing a more robust Federal law enforcement presence’ in the District.”

Being the capital city, Washington D.C. is a focus of national scorn for its rampant crime and poverty. While Trump, a Republican, seeks a safe city, the population largely votes for Democrat politicians, with over 90 percent voting blue in 2024.
D.C. has championed a crime rate well above the national average since at least 2006 when City Data began recording data. Generally, the crime rate of the nation’s capital is about twice that of the rest of the country.
“Trump on Friday threw his support behind the funding fix needed to allow the District of Columbia’s government to avoid $1.1 billion in budget cuts squeezed in the remaining half of the fiscal year, all but ensuring House passage of legislation the Senate passed two weeks ago,” Roll Call said Friday.
Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins said that the bill would not involve federal spending, just use the local allocation to better the district.
“This bill would simply fix a mistake in the House CR,” Collins said on March 14. “There are no federal dollars involved. The issue here is just allowing the D.C. government to proceed to spend its own tax revenues.”"

Karoline Leavitt Describes ‘Evil Forces’ Behind Attempt on Trump’s Life,By Adan Salazar,1 month ago,"The forces of evil are waging a spiritual battle against good forces on earth, with God thankfully sparing President Donald Trump’s life last July, says White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.
Speaking to CBN (Christian Broadcasting Network), Leavitt, 27, said she’s keenly aware of the demonic evil forces attempting to derail one of the greatest comebacks in political history, and credited God with protecting Trump.
JUST IN: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says ""spiritual warfare"" is real and has seen ""evil forces"" at work against President Trump. My full story on @PressSec is here. https://t.co/e3y5LSGKNT @realDonaldTrump @RapidResponse47 @CBNNews @700club pic.twitter.com/SS8d562pJE
“I certainly believe in spiritual warfare,” Leavitt stated. “And I think I saw it firsthand, especially throughout the campaign trail with President Trump. And I think there certainly were evil forces. And I think that the president was saved by the grace of God on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania, and he’s in this moment for a reason.”
“We’re all here for a reason. And I think it’s a miraculous thing that’s taken place in our country.”
The youngest press secretary to serve a presidential administration went on to describe how she holds a “team prayer” before press briefings asking God to give her the strength to communicate clearly.
“I think that team prayer before is just a moment to be silent and still and ask God for confidence and the ability to articulate my words, knowledge, prayer, protection, and it is a nice moment to reset. It’s the last thing I do before I go out there, and then it just gives me the confidence to do a briefing,” she says.
Leavitt said her faith did not waver despite losing her New Hampshire US House race in 2022, saying, “Well, certainly, God has a plan for everyone. I believe that firmly…So God knew what He was doing, I believe, and you just have to trust the process and trust that He’s working in your life, and stay grounded in your faith throughout the way.”

https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-not-joking-about-third-term,Trump ‘Not Joking’ About Third Term,By RT,1 month ago,"US President Donald Trump has said he is “not joking” about potentially seeking a third term in office, telling NBC News in an interview on Sunday that there are “methods” to pursue another run, despite the Constitution’s two-term limit on the presidency.
Trump made the remarks during a phone call from Mar-a-Lago, in what are his most direct comments yet on the possibility of extending his presidency beyond 2029. “A lot of people want me to do it,” he said.
The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified in 1951 following President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four election victories, states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
Pressed to clarify whether he has been presented with any specific plans to bypass the limit, Trump replied: “There are – not plans – but there are methods which you could do it, as you know.”
“I’m not joking,” Trump said, adding that “it is far too early to think about it.”
Asked about a hypothetical scenario in which Vice President J.D. Vance could run for president and then hand over the office to him, Trump replied, “That’s one. But there are others too,” without elaborating.
While Trump allies have often dismissed his previous remarks about a third term as joking, Sunday’s comments suggest otherwise. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon recently told NewsNation that Trump could “run and win again in 2028,” hinting at possible legal maneuvers.
Earlier this year, Republican Congressman Andy Ogles introduced a constitutional amendment that would allow presidents to serve three non-consecutive terms, though it has so far gained little traction. Amendments to the Constitution require approval by a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, followed by ratification from three-quarters of the states.
Trump won the 2024 election by a wide margin against Democratic candidate and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, becoming the second president in US history to serve two non-consecutive terms.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/ten-states-have-introduced-bills-to-classify-abortion-as-murder-so-far-in-2025,Ten States Have Introduced Bills to Classify Abortion as Murder so Far in 2025,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,1 month ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — In a push to strengthen recognition of preborn babies as full persons with the same basic rights as any other American, 10 states have introduced legislation so far in 2025 to treat abortion as homicide within existing murder statutes, although they have met internal resistance from Republicans and pro-lifers who fear the legal and political fallout.
The Hill reported that, since the beginning of the year, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas have all seen bills introduced to treat abortion as homicide rather than a distinct offense with different penalties, and some of those measures extend to every form of destruction of an embryonic human (such as in vitro fertilization).
“Three of the bills – in Indiana, Oklahoma and North Dakota – have failed to pass this year,” the report noted. “And Georgia’s H.B. 441, which would modify state law to allow women to be charged with homicide for receiving an abortion, appears poised to fail as well.”
Thirteen states currently ban all or most abortions. But the abortion lobby is working feverishly to cancel out those deterrents via deregulated interstate distribution of abortion pills, legal protection and financial support of interstate abortion travel, constructing new abortion facilities near borders shared by pro-life and pro-abortion states, making liberal states sanctuaries for those who want to evade or violate the laws of more pro-life neighbors, and enshrining abortion “rights” in state constitutions.
The bills highlighted in the report represent a divide between pro-life activists who advocate “incrementalism,” chipping away at whatever abortions public opinion is amenable to stopping at the moment, and abortion “abolitionism,” which finds the incremental approach too tolerant of unjust outcomes and advocates more uncompromising action.
Incrementalists, who dominate the pro-life wing of mainstream GOP politics and most major pro-life groups, point to the general public’s lack of support for a full, no-exceptions abortion ban, and the volatile question of punishing the women who seek abortions, which some abolitionist proposals would do.
“Maybe instead of wasting our time on a circular firing squad and debating who can hand out the most prison sentences to prove that they are the most anti-abortion one out there, maybe get to work and elect 100 percent pro-life champions … who will stand with us to pass substantial legislation,” says Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America. SFLA says accountability for abortion should focus on the “predatory” abortion industry, not women deceived or pressured into aborting.
Abolitionists, meanwhile, blame incrementalism for the pro-life position so often being on the defensive in the court of public opinion and argue it infantilizes women to assume they cannot or should not bear the responsibility of knowing what abortion destroys.
“Abolitionism has historically been wed to the doctrine of immediatism. The history of the pro-life movement has been one of gradualistic means and measures, incremental legislation, ameliorative programs, and the inclusion of exceptions to abortion along the way to its eventual total abolition,” says the group Abolish Human Abortion. “Abolitionists reject the idea that you can effectively fight evil by allowing it in some cases or do away with it by planned out incremental steps which preserve it along the way. Abolitionists reject the notion that you can ever commit evil in order that good may come. Abolitionists cry NO COMPROMISE!!! Pro-lifers cry ‘get the best that you can get when you can get it,’ and consistently support the ‘lesser of two evils.’”
But while those philosophical and strategic debates continue, many pro-lifers believe a more immediate concern is whether the fight over abortion’s legality will be relegated to individual states for the foreseeable future.
President Donald Trump has taken a number of pro-life actions since returning to office, including pardoning peaceful pro-life activists and closing multiple avenues for federal funding of the abortion industry. But he opposes further federal restrictions on abortion in favor of leaving the issue at the state level, and even rewrote the Republican Party platform to reflect that preference.
The variance of laws from state to state allows residents of a pro-life state to travel to a pro-abortion one to have their child killed, and abortion pills can easily be mailed across state lines and taken in private, which cannot easily be prevented once the package has been sent.
Last year, the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute published research finding that 63 percent of abortions in 2023 were committed via pills, continuing a steady rise from zero percent since 2000, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved mifepristone for abortion.
Pro-life advocates continue to call for a complete nationwide ban on abortion, and in February, Republican Rep. Eric Burlison of Missouri reintroduced the Life at Conception Act, which would expressly recognize preborn children as persons qualifying for equal protection under the 14th Amendment. How such measures will fare in the current GOP remains to be seen."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/austria-to-suspend-family-reunification,Austria to Suspend Family Reunification,By Hélène de Lauzun | The European Conservative,1 month ago,"As the first country in the European Union, Austria is about to suspend family reunification for those with asylum status, citing that the nation has reached its limits in terms of reception capacity. Scepticism remains regarding the measure’s effectiveness, even as right-wing factions in other European countries advocate for similar policies.
The measure was announced on Wednesday, March 26th, by the Minister for Integration Claudia Plakolm at the end of the Council of Ministers. The proposed suspension requires amending legislation to allow the issuing of a government decree on the matter. The suspension should come into force by May.
“We have reached the limits of our reception capacities,” explained the minister, who considers the measure necessary to “protect” the country and enable it to “preserve” its health and education system and its employment.
The Austrian government reports a clear increase in the arrival of family members of individuals granted asylum or a protective status. As a result, the country struggles to cope with the influx of refugees who have difficulty learning German or finding work, placing a strain on Austrian society. Under these circumstances, “the likelihood of successful integration decreases with each new arrival,” the minister warns.
NGOs responsible for receiving migrants are alarmed by the Austrian government’s decision, which they believe is not motivated by a situation that is out of control.
The Austrian government’s decision is readily understood within the context of its domestic political context. In the September legislative elections, the national right-wing party FPÖ emerged victorious. However, due to a lack of coalition support, the FPÖ did not come to power, because the centre-right ÖVP refused to collaborate with FPÖ, deeming them too far to the right. The ÖVP preferred to form a coalition with the Social Democrats and the Greens and thus secured the chancellorship. But the fact remains that the current chancellor, from the ÖVP, must contend with the FPÖ’s continued strong—and growing— popularity in Austrian opinion, and demonstrate his ability to respond to this section of the electorate.
The measure is only a temporary suspension, planned to last for only six months but with the option of being extended until May 2027.
The FPÖ has expressed scepticism about the fragile nature of the family reunification suspension announced by Plakolm, arguing that the government will eventually undermine its effectiveness. The party is calling for the outright abolition of family reunification.
The FPÖ is not the only party in Europe to call for an end to family reunification, which has existed in Austria since 1996. In Austria, family reunification accounts for around 30% of first residence permits granted—comparable with the European average. In Belgium, the figure is close to 50%. In Spain, the VOX party is campaigning for stricter conditions for family reunification. In France, Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National is also calling for a drastic restriction of the system, introduced in 1976 under President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, which has been steadily increasing for several years. Its outright abolition was one of the measures supported by candidate Éric Zemmour during his presidential campaign in 2022. In January 2025, Minister of the Interior Bruno Retailleau published a circular addressed to regional and departmental authorities to limit its effects. The revocation of the whole system is meeting strong opposition from the Left, which views it as a fundamental human right that cannot be called into question—a right that is protected tooth and nail by the European Convention on Human Rights."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/le-pen-beats-all-other-presidential-candidates-with-ease-in-final-poll-before-expulsion-court-hearing,Le Pen Beats All Other Presidential Candidates With Ease in Final Poll Before Expulsion Court Hearing,By Thomas Brooke | Remix,1 month ago,"Marine Le Pen stands poised to win the 2027 presidential election in France unless the courts disqualify her from running, new polling published just hours before a court hearing to determine her future has shown.
On Sunday, a new Ifop survey for Le Journal du Dimanche showed Le Pen leading in every run-off scenario, making her the undeniable frontrunner and obvious candidate of the right-wing National Rally.
A Parisian court is set to rule Monday on whether Le Pen, accused alongside 26 others in the long-running “parliamentary assistants” case, will be sentenced to a five-year ban from holding public office, with immediate execution even pending appeal.
She is also facing possible prison time and a fine of up to €300,000.
The charges stem from allegations that MEPs from her party misused EU funds — an accusation Le Pen strongly contests.
If found ineligible, Le Pen’s absence from the ballot would be seismic, not only for her party but for the French electorate, who consistently place her ahead of any rival. The Ifop poll shows Le Pen capturing between 34 percent and 37 percent of first-round voting intentions, beating all likely centrist and left-wing candidates.
The timing and potential political implications of the ruling draw parallels to recent scenes in Romania, where Calin Georgescu — another populist frontrunner — was arrested and ultimately barred from standing in a re-run of the presidential election after initially winning the first round. His candidacy was nullified by the Romanian electoral commission, with the decision upheld by the constitutional court, sparking uproar over the role of judicial power in democratic elections.
Should the French court follow a similar path, Le Pen’s supporters — and perhaps many undecided voters — will likely view this as yet another case of overreach by an increasingly politicized judiciary.
Le Pen’s dominance isn’t marginal. Against an array of political opponents, she leads former Macron-appointed prime ministers Édouard Philippe (20–25 percent) and Gabriel Attal (around 20 percent), as well as far-left grandee Jean-Luc Mélenchon (12–13 percent), with ease.
She appears to be far more palatable to the wider electorate than others on the nationalist right, including Reconquête leader Éric Zemmour, who is polling at around 5-6 percent.
It is far from clear where votes for Le Pen would be redistributed in the event she were barred from holding public office, whether another National Rally politician could fill her shoes or if centrist politicians would benefit significantly.
The French firebrand nationalist cut a defiant figure in front of reporters last week, telling journalists, “If the court were to pronounce a sentence of ineligibility with provisional execution against me, it would have no influence on our ability to defend the French people and to censure the government if necessary, including to provoke new legislative elections.”
The 56-year-old has spent decades building her platform to amass broader electoral support, rebranding her father’s National Front, and has failed on three previous occasions to take residence in the Élysée Palace.
Monday’s hearing is expected to begin at 10 a.m., where she will learn if she will have a fourth opportunity — without question her best chance to date — to finally taste victory in the presidential race."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/breaking-judge-rules-marine-le-pen-ineligible-to-run-for-president-in-2027-in-latest-blow-to-democracy-in-europe,Breaking: Judge Rules Marine Le Pen Ineligible to Run For President in 2027 in Latest Blow to Democracy in Europe,By Staff | Remix,1 month ago,"A judge has ruled Marine Le Pen is ineligible to run for office, along with eight MEPs from her National Rally party, after they were found guilty of misappropriation of EU funds. The move is the latest attack on democracy in the EU, with judges increasingly deciding elections in Europe. Le Pen has also been sentenced to four years in prison, with two years suspended.
Notably, the news comes right as Le Pen leads the polling for French presidential elections in 2027, as Remix News reported earlier today.
The court estimated that the total losses amounted to €2.9 million, as a result of “paying by the European Parliament people who actually worked for the far-right party.” Le Pen was found to be responsible for €1.8 million in damages herself. The judgment also concerns 12 assistants. The prosecutor’s office initially alleged that €7 million had been used in this way.
Investigators accused Le Pen of managing the illegal use of European subsidies between 2004 and 2016, when she served as an MEP. They stated that instead of working in Strasbourg, assistants were to work for Le Pen’s National Rally party in a domestic capacity.
“It was found that all these people actually worked for the party, that their deputy did not commission them any tasks,” said the judge. Assistants then “passed from one deputy to another.”
“It was not about combining the work of assistants, but about combining the budgets of MPs,” said the judge.
Le Pen said before the trial that the matter is entirely political and that her opponents wished for her “political death.”
Other commentators have expressed surprise at not only the verdict but also the decision to exclude her from elections.
Pierre Lellouche, a lawyer and former Deputy of the French National Assembly, appeared on CNEWS to point out that the current prime minister, François Bayrou, faced the same charge and suffered no consequences. “Then, last but not least, there is the case of (François) Bayrou, the current prime minister, who has been prosecuted for exactly the same thing, i.e., for abuses of party funding declared as parliamentary assistants in Europe, at the EU parliament. Bayrou emerged from this affair without being in the least concerned. In fact, the public prosecutor’s office has once again referred the matter to the courts, but even so, we’re dealing with a double standard here. It’s a bit surprising.”
He noted that the “separation of powers” is increasingly shifting towards judges, and noted that in many previous elections, these judges have tipped the scales in favor of certain candidates.
“We’re finding that more and more, everything is getting mixed up, everywhere. Look at Trump, who had seven judges behind him, and that didn’t stop him from winning. Finally, Strauss-Kahn was eliminated, Fillon was eliminated by a somewhat untimely and rapid indictment at the time of the presidential election, which allowed Mr. Macron to govern the country for seven years after all, which is no mean feat. Especially since, in the Fillon affair, the public prosecutor subsequently indicated that this was not entirely neutral and that the Élysée was particularly interested in this case. So you see, there is a separation of powers, but at the moment, power is shifting to the judges, and that can have a huge impact.”
Another attorney, Maxime Thiebaut, also brought up the case of Bayrou, saying:
“At the very least, you know, it comes as a surprise that Marine Le Pen has been found guilty. I would point out that Mr. (François) Bayrou was acquitted on a similar charge, because it was considered that he had not acted with intent. So I wasn’t in Mr. Bayrou’s file and I wasn’t in Ms. Le Pen’s file, but I note that there was also an expectation that Madame Le Pen would be guilty. We all know very well that when you’re the leader of a political party, you’re pretty far removed from the actual running of the party. Mr. Bayrou was recognized by Ms. Le Pen. Is it political or not? I don’t know and I won’t give my opinion on that.”
This is not the only such case either, with Romania banning the presidential frontrunner, Călin Georgescu, from running for president as well as arresting him."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-very-angry-pissed-off-at-putin-threatens-new-tariffs,"Trump ‘Very Angry’ & ‘Pissed Off’ At Putin, Threatens New Tariffs",By Zerohedge,1 month ago,"Why should Russia’s refusal to make big concessions come as any surprise to either the White House or mainstream media, given Russian forces are clearly steadily gaining on the battlefield?
In a phone interview with NBC on Sunday, President Donald Trump said, “if Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia.”
Trump went on to say he’s “very angry” and “pissed off” particularly at President Vladimir Putin’s attacking the legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s and his leadership:
“I was very angry, pissed off” when Putin “started getting into [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky’s credibility” and “started talking about new leadership” in Ukraine, Trump told NBC’s Kristen Welker in a phone call.
Trump said that Putin’s comments on Zelensky are “not going in the right location.” This was in reference to a Friday plan pitched by Putin for a “transitional administration” for Ukraine under the auspices of the UN.
RELATED: Putin Seeks UN Government For Ukraine, Won’t Sign Peace Plan With Kiev’s ‘Illegitimate’ Government
The immediate aim would be ceasefire leading toward “democratic” election, followed by the negotiation of a peace agreement with the new authorities.
“We could, of course, discuss with the United States, even with European countries, and of course with our partners and friends, under the auspices of the UN, the possibility of establishing a transitional administration in Ukraine,” Putin said while visiting the northwestern Russian city of Murmansk.
He laid out that “we could discuss the possibility of introduction of temporary governance in Ukraine,” while Ukraine holds “democratic elections, to bring to power a capable government that enjoys the trust of the people.”
After this, he explained, the two warring sides would “start talks with them about a peace treaty.” Putin has in the recent past complained that Zelensky is ‘illegitimate’ and thus can’t legally be negotiated with, since he has canceled democratic elections on an indefinite basis.
So Trump has clearly brushed this aside in the new Sunday comments…
🚨 NBC: ""Just hours ago, President Trump called me to tell me he is 'pissed off' with Russia's President Putin and threatened to impose secondary tariffs on Russia's oil."" pic.twitter.com/ikpmFH5t1Q
However, Trump’s attacking Putin for denouncing Zelensky as illegitimate will surely not be taken as a very serious critique by the Kremlin, given the irony of Trump himself not too long ago having himself blasted Zelensky as a “dictator without elections”.
Trump confirmed to NBC that he will speak again with his Russian counterpart this week. Russia has indicated that the question of the Black Sea ceasefire is still being negotiated, and is awaiting the removal of sanctions on agricultural exports which necessitates specific banks being reconnected to the Swift payment system. But Europe has that no, it won’t go along with any plan which results in easing sanctions."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/vance-asked-trump-to-fire-waltz-politico,Vance Asked Trump to Fire Waltz – Politico,By RT,1 month ago,"Vice President J.D. Vance and other senior officials “gently offered” President Donald Trump to fire National Security Adviser Mike Waltz during a private discussion about the blunder in which Waltz accidentally included a reporter in a confidential chat about US military strikes in Yemen, according to anonymous insider sources cited by Politico.
Two individuals allegedly familiar with the closed-door meeting at the White House on Wednesday night told Politico that Vance, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and personnel chief Sergio Gor advised Trump that it might be time to cut Waltz loose.
The president reportedly agreed that Waltz had “messed up,” but ultimately decided against a dismissal.
“Like hell he’d give the liberal media and pearl-clutching Democrats a win,” Politico wrote on Friday, citing one insider as saying the administration “don’t want to give the press a scalp.”
The leak, first reported by The Atlantic on Monday, revealed that Waltz had inadvertently invited editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a confidential Signal chat where senior administration officials were discussing upcoming airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen. Waltz has taken “full responsibility” for the incident, calling it “embarrassing” in a Fox News interview and attributing the inclusion to a technical “glitch.”
President Trump has largely downplayed the controversy, dismissing the media response as a “witch hunt” and questioning the reliability of Signal. He also emphasized that no classified information was compromised and praised the military operation as “unbelievably successful.”
“I don’t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” Trump told NBC News in an interview Saturday. He reiterated he still has full confidence in both Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was accused of sharing ‘sensitive’ information in the now-notorious Signal chat.
Vance, for his part, has publicly aligned himself with the president’s decision. On Friday, he brought Waltz along for a high-profile trip to Greenland, where he dismissed media speculation and defended the national security team.
“If you think you’re going to force the president of the United States to fire anybody, you’ve got another thing coming,” Vance told reporters.
Yet Politico claimed that Waltz’s position remains tenuous, citing one Trump ally who said, “They’ll stick by him for now, but he’ll be gone in a couple of weeks.” Other unnamed sources described longstanding personal and political tensions, alleging that Waltz has alienated colleagues by overstepping boundaries and acting more like a principal than a staffer."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/chinas-tech-triple-play-threatens-us-national-security,China’s Tech Triple Play Threatens US National Security,By Craig Singleton | RealClearWire,1 month ago,"Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping has defiantly declared that technological innovation is the “main battlefield” in China’s quest for global preeminence. But, Beijing’s bold bid to transform itself into a global science superpower is not merely an economic imperative—it is a means to strengthen China’s military might and cyber capabilities, with grave implications for the United States.
At the center of Xi’s vision are what he calls China’s “new productive forces”—breakthroughs in advanced batteries, biotech, LiDAR, drones, and other emerging technologies that promise to redefine the next industrial revolution. By dominating these sectors, Beijing aims to ensure Chinese technology is deeply embedded within critical American supply chains—everything from power grids and ports to communications networks —thereby converting China’s commercial success into a powerful geopolitical tool of leverage.
Here at home, Beijing’s strategy is unfolding in three interlocking phases—penetrating, prepositioning, and profiting—which together form an insidious framework that both erodes America’s technological edge and undermines homeland security.
Recently exposed Chinese state-sponsored hacking campaigns—Salt, Volt, and Flax Typhoon—exemplify Beijing’s systematic approach to penetrating U.S. networks and critical infrastructure. The Salt campaign exploited vulnerabilities in telecommunications systems, allowing attackers to intercept voice and text communications and thereby compromise both civilian privacy and government operations. The Volt operation targeted industrial control systems, breaching energy and manufacturing networks to gain remote control over essential infrastructure. Meanwhile, Flax Typhoon focused on defense and government networks, exfiltrating sensitive data and installing persistent backdoors to facilitate future sabotage.
Collectively, these campaigns reveal how Chinese hackers methodically exploit software and hardware weaknesses to harvest critical intelligence and maintain enduring access to sensitive U.S networks, often with next-to-no consequences. Yet infiltration is not an end in itself. Once inside, Beijing systematically prepositions latent capabilities throughout our physical and digital supply chains, setting the stage for future coercion.
Today, Chinese-made LiDAR devices underpin smart city systems, autonomous vehicles, and certain aerial reconnaissance platforms. Similarly, Chinese-produced surveillance cameras and drones are integrated throughout our transportation network, including at major U.S. airports. Even critical infrastructure components like cranes in U.S. ports and batteries connected to our grids have morphed into strategic choke points, according to Congressional investigations.
In a conflict—or even a severe diplomatic crisis—these systemic dependencies could confer a decisive advantage to China. By withholding critical parts or inflating prices at a pivotal moment, Beijing can exploit these supply chain choke points to hamper U.S. readiness.
Prepositioned exploits could degrade or disable U.S. command-and-control systems, sabotage energy grids, or paralyze transportation networks—potentially stalling America’s response before a single shot is fired. Even if such disruptions remain hypothetical, the mere suspicion of sabotage can erode policymaker confidence and delay military mobilization efforts, effectively handing Beijing a silent veto over our crisis decision-making.
The final phase of Beijing’s strategy is profiting from these dependencies, turning commercial dominance into a revenue stream that reinforces its military-civil fusion. Chinese high-tech exports, ranging from advanced sensors and biotech innovations to drones and surveillance cameras, generate billions in revenue every year for Beijing. These profits are not reinvested merely for commercial growth; they are often funneled directly into programs bolstering People’s Liberation Army’s R&D efforts.
The stakes could hardly be higher. The House Homeland Security Committee, along with other congressional panels, has convened hearings spotlighting how Chinese hackers sit in vital infrastructure systems and how Beijing’s infiltration extends into our supply chains. The bipartisan consensus emerging from these discussions is clear: we must move swiftly from passive defense of American networks to proactive deterrence.
Policymakers can begin by tightening outbound investment screening and export controls. That means scrutinizing U.S. capital and technology flows into Chinese firms linked to China’s military-industrial base, ensuring that American money and know-how no longer subsidize Beijing’s military modernization. Simultaneously, federal agencies should adopt “clean network” standards for software, hardware, and data, effectively establishing cyber quarantines for critical infrastructure. This would bar high-risk Chinese devices from power grids, ports, and telecommunications systems—treating them as inherently untrusted until proven otherwise.
Equally important is imposing meaningful consequences on Beijing’s cyber intrusions. Diplomatic protests and token indictments of mid-level hackers have failed to alter China’s calculus. Instead, Washington should consider stronger penalties—including financial blacklisting of major Chinese firms or banks—to send an unmistakable message that continued infiltration carries real costs.
Finally, we must commit to robust innovation at home. America can’t meet the Chinese challenge simply by playing defense. Expanding federal R&D, incentivizing private-sector breakthroughs, and aligning workforce development with future technology needs will ensure that the United States remains a leader in the very fields—biotech, AI, quantum computing, energy storage—where China seeks supremacy."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/maryland-democrats-pass-sleep-tax-is-a-thinking-tax-next,Maryland Democrats Pass “Sleep Tax” – Is A Thinking Tax Next?,By ZeroHedge,1 month ago,"Maryland lawmakers are scrambling to address a staggering $3.3 billion budget shortfall.
To close the gap, far-left Governor Wes Moore and activist Democrats have proposed a wave of tax hikes that would hit Marylanders’ wallets the hardest amid a deepening affordability crisis.
QUESTION:Maryland lawmakers spent too much money. The state has a $3.5 BILLION deficit. To close the gap, Annapolis is looking to raise your taxes/fees. Here's a list of the proposed increases. Which affect you most? Or… have you already ordered the U-Haul truck? Tax…
With power bills already skyrocketing to record highs for many folks due to backfiring and disastrous green energy policies, these same progressive lawmakers are creating even more nightmares for taxpayers—this time by proposing a tax that effectively targets sleep.
A small but vocal group of conservative Republicans in the Maryland House of Delegates were stunned on Friday when far-left Democrats pushed through HB 858—a bill that establishes a mattress stewardship program under the guise of promoting safe disposal and recycling. This is another tax on Marylanders as the state sinks into financial turmoil and elevated credit downgrade risks. The new 6% tax on mattresses is on top of the existing 6% sales tax.
Del. Mark N. Fisher (R-Calvert), one of the leaders of the Maryland House Freedom Caucus, blasted the “Sleep Tax” and asked if there would be a “snoring surcharge.”
Democrats just passed the ‘Sleep Tax’. Marylanders already pay a 6% sales tax when you buy a mattress. Now, @mddems want you to pay a surcharge. Is that a ‘snoring surcharge’? pic.twitter.com/Pt0atYzupZ
Torrey Snow of WBAL Radio said this about the ridiculous tax passed on sleep…
Oh, you think I'm joking! Maryland Democrats literally passed a bill to tax your good sleep! House Bill 858. Look it up! #maryland #democrats #mattresstax #wesmoore pic.twitter.com/HeI3yTHQht

Also, Moody’s Ratings recently warned that Maryland—a state heavily dependent on the federal government—faces heightened recession risk in the era of DOGE-related cuts. The warning comes amid a twin crisis: a ballooning state deficit and a power bill crisis.
If far-left Gov. Moore and Democrats are willing to tax Marylanders’ sleep, these woke activists could easily push another bill to tax thinking.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-signs-exec-order-restoring-improperly-removed-statues-and-public-monuments,Trump Signs Exec Order Restoring Improperly Removed Statues And Public Monuments,By ZeroHedge,1 month ago,"President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at overhauling the Smithsonian to combat what he calls “divisive, race-centered” narratives pushed under the Biden administration, according to RedState.com.
Titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” the order criticizes the museum system’s recent direction: “Once widely respected… the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,” it states, arguing such views frame American and Western values as “inherently harmful and oppressive.”
The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents, with leading efforts to “remove improper ideology” across the institution.
President Trump’s latest executive order targets the Smithsonian, aiming to restore what he calls a truthful, uplifting view of American history and culture. The directive criticizes recent shifts toward “divisive, race-centered ideology” and tasks Vice President JD Vance with rooting out “improper ideology” across its museums and research centers.
https://t.co/BQy31t6E8Z President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at restoring accurate representations of American history in educational institutions. https://t.co/BQy31t6E8Z
The RedState.com report quotes the order: “It is the policy of my Administration to restore Federal sites… to solemn and uplifting public monuments that remind Americans of our extraordinary heritage,” the order states, insisting museums should educate, not “indoctrinate.”
The order also instructs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to review and “restore” public monuments removed over the past five years. A White House fact sheet says many were taken down to “perpetuate a false revision of history” or unfairly disparage historical figures.
Critics quickly lashed out. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) wrote on X: “You cannot erase our past.” But as Trump allies note, this comes from a party that demanded the removal of statues of figures like George Washington and Jefferson.
Trump’s move follows earlier efforts to reclaim institutions from what he calls far-left ideologues—turning places like the Smithsonian and the Kennedy Center into cultural battlegrounds.
Past controversies at the Smithsonian include omitting Justice Clarence Thomas from its African American history museum in 2016—later correcting it only under pressure—and celebrating transgender activists like Sylvia Rivera in its American Women’s History Museum. It even preserved a suit worn by Rep. Andy Kim (D-NJ) during Capitol cleanup after January 6, a move critics call symbolic pandering."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/governments-sell-their-bitcoin-buy-gold,Governments Sell Their Bitcoin & Buy Gold,By SchiffGold,1 month ago,"Bitcoiners are hoping that the Trump administration wil pump their bags to new all-time highs this year with a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. But all around the world, governments are selling bitcoin and buying gold, not the other way around.
In Jan. @CynthiaMLummis said that she thought China would get into the equivalent of an arms race with the U.S. over which nation could buy the most Bitcoin. I doubt it, especially if China was smart enough to have sold all of its Bitcoin during that month.https://t.co/rK1pjcETLK
Meanwhile, bitcoiners claim that it doesn’t “need” the state to endorse it. Yet, they cheer for any policy or candidate that promises to further legitimize their so-called cypherpunk freedom money, even as many of these State crypto schemes devolve, sometimes into outright fraud. Somewhat ironically, the US “bitcoin reserve” is currently made up solely of bitcoin that the government has confiscated from people through the courts or other legal actions.
Trump Crypto Czar David Sacks commented recently that if the US had held onto every bitcoin it has confiscated, its value would have gone from $366 million to over $17 billion.
“That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy.”
But the long-term strategy of governments and central banks around the world is to sell bitcoin, and buy gold instead. And despite its claims to radical transparency as a protocol, there seems to be a distinct lack of clarity as to the precise amount of bitcoin various governments have. In fact, Sacks’ source for his own numbers was Grok, X’s AI bot. Not even the Trump Administration’s Crypto Czar knows exactly how much crypto the US holds.
Over the past decade, the federal government sold approximately 195,000 bitcoin for proceeds of $366 million. If the government had held the bitcoin, it would be worth over $17 billion today. That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy.
Many bitcoiners say they don’t “trust” the state, but at the same time, they are trusting the state to securely custody the private keys to the bitcoin that will pump up the price of their own holdings. If the government declares bitcoin strategically important and starts mining or buying, and something goes wrong and it loses its bitcoin forever (as many have), the price crashes. The bitcoin camp can’t seem to decide whether the state is their enemy or their savior. Gold has no such conflict, as it speaks for itself as a useful industrial metal and a hedge against inflation supported by thousands of years of monetary history.
As Peter Schiff recently said on his podcast, the main buyers of gold are probably still central banks. And with central banks like the People’s Bank of China under-reporting and obscuring their purchases, whatever the reported number is at any given time is generally a lowball estimate. And along with governments in Germany and beyond, the trend is for governments to sell bitcoin as soon as they can, not to buy more.
In 2024, Germany sold tens of thousands bitcoin seized from a piracy operation. German officials explicitly cited bitcoin’s volatility as a reason to divest, redirecting some proceeds to purchase 30 tons of gold bullion. Russia offloaded thousands of bitcoin confiscated from ransomware attacks in 2023 and has been a huge buyer of gold, with a consistent trend of keeping a robust Russian gold stack to reduce its dependence on the US dollar.
Despite bitcoin’s lackluster gains after long-anticipated announcements of State approval from Trump, his cabinet, and his inner circle, gold is up 12% this year, and we haven’t even passed the first quarter yet. Meanwhile, silver still hasn’t surpassed its 2020 all-time high, which could be explained by ravenous central bank gold-buying.
It may be a situation without precedent in the gold and silver markets, where gold makes such spectacular gains while silver remains below previous all-time highs. With the gold/silver ratio staying high and gold outpacing silver’s gains dramatically, it appears to be the setup for a tremendous bull market for silver.
Gold vs USD Year-to-Date
Peter said:
“This really highlights how great the opportunity is in silver. I think gold’s cheap too, but I think silver is a hell of a lot cheaper and people I think should be focusing a lot of their precious metals firepower on silver.”
The gold-silver ratio has remained well above 80 for all of 2025:
Gold-Silver Ratio Year-to-Date:
Instead of holding its stash, the US has sold the biitcoin it seized as a result of the Silk Road case, and has continued liquidating confiscated bitcoin. Meanwhile, the US imported tons of gold in 2024 to bolster its reserves. This pattern of selling volatile bitcoin and acquiring gold reflects a broader governmental preference for stability over speculation, and regardless of Trump’s bitcoin-related executive orders, the pendulum will always swing back to real assets.
Across the world, it’s a consistent strategy: governments are unloading bitcoin and central banks are stockpiling gold. The trend extends beyond Western powers. China, a longtime gold accumulator, has sold off minor bitcoin holdings while adding hundreds of tons of gold to its reserves in 2023 alone. India mirrors this approach, liquidating thousands of bitcoins seized from crypto scams while its central bank purchased gold. Globally, central banks bought a record amount of gold in 2022, with purchases accelerating into 2025, while bitcoin sales from government coffers have become routine."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/modern-opsec-and-thirdworldization,Modern OPSEC And Thirdworldization,By Fabian Ommar | The Organic Prepper,1 month ago,"Last year, International Man published an intriguing article by Jeff Thomas about American society during the Great Depression period. Duly named Duesenberg In A Barn, it opens with a story about shifts in culture and the lifestyle of wealthy individuals and families during the 1930s and beyond (Duesenberg produced luxury sport cars between 1913 and 1937).
He recounts how the riches that didn’t get snuffed out by, or even profited from, the 1929 Stock Market Crash, kept flaunting their wealth trying to outcompete each other, in an attempt to extend the 1920s Jazz Era hedonism and largesse into Depression times.
However, as the crisis aggravated, these individuals and families started to realize that such behavior amidst the rampant misery was quickly becoming a liability.
“Whatever the psychology involved, in 1930, those who had fared well soon learned that it was unwise to be conspicuous in their continued wealth. At that point, an interesting but little-remembered development occurred. Such people put their mink coats in the closet, their jewelry in a safe place, and found barns in the countryside into which they could park their Duesenbergs, Cords, and Auburns.”
The rich toned down not from sympathy or compassion but as adaptation. Contrary to what many think, the wealthy have a sharp survival instinct.
That’s a crucial distinction, with the keywords being “adaptation” and “survival”, and the main takeaway an important social dynamic typical of all crises: the nail that stands out gets hammered.
Those born and living in unstable and hostile contexts are constantly reminded of all the unwritten rules that keep us, our kin, and our stuff, safer. From criminals, sure, but also from tyrannical, greedy governments and corrupt authorities.
I call that Thirdworldization OPSEC. It applies to criminality and government overreach mainly, but as Thirdworldization expands, it’s now applicable to other areas of social existence. Illegal immigrants, as well as political, religious, and ideological extremists from our own society, must now be added to the list of official (i.e., state) and criminal threats.
There are periods in history when the number and diversity of potential enemies and hazards around us rise, and that’s the case in most of the West right now.
People are financially insecure, afraid of the future, confused, and lost. Those feelings lead to anger and revolt. Add all the leftist/woke indoctrination and brainwashing of the last years, and we get a mass of utterly discontent and unhinged folks out there.
The majority cannot put a finger on, much less process what’s happening. Nevertheless, the sentiments are there and everyone starts lashing out at everyone else, resulting more frequent and intense episodes of violence and increased friction.
I’m talking about gratuitous, random, and now targeted and coordinated violence coming from all sides and for a variety of reasons. I warned about this in 2023, and it’s now coming to a head.
Let’s examine some facets of this phenomenon and how to deal with this new reality.
There are many similarities between the 1920s and now. The risks of a grave economic or financial event are sky-high. Growth is abysmal, inflation is rising, and living standards are dropping.
And critically, the concentration of wealth is growing at an accelerated pace. The haves are getting fleeced and may be outnumbered by the have-nots at some point, which is bad.
Economic disparity begets political polarization, which begets the undoing of the social fabric, which begets cultural degradation, which begets the undoing of civilization.
More people are living in the streets (I’ll return to that in an upcoming post). Drug and alcohol abuse are skyrocketing, and mental illness is exploding. Those things are happening across all demographics, which is concerning and one of the points of this post.
Even though we’re not yet at the stage described by Jeff Thomas, the words of late philanthropist George Peabody – “Ostentation is a target you hang on your back” – already come to mind as a survival rule in a declining society.
Nonetheless, everybody’s trying to keep up with the Joneses, something evident in both the real world and the web. Social media is a carousel of Dubai trips, fabulous resorts, fancy restaurants, luxurious dresses, plastic surgeries, and Lamborghinis.
That’s not the reality, but a facade. This is the age of gambling, easy money chasing, glorification of ignorance (Dunning-Kruger and “influencer culture”), fake lifestyles, and blatant ostentation. It’s a bubble, and the bill will come due.
But enough with the rant. No one has to live like a monk. Being aware, smart, contained, and disciplined always pays, only now more than ever. Besides, it only requires focus on what we can control: our profile, exposure, consumption choices, and lifestyle.
Let’s talk about political radicalization. Tesla owners and dealers are getting their vehicles and premises vandalized by Trump haters, who now have turned into Musk haters thanks to his association with the government and his role in DOGE initiatives (no need for links as both topics are all over the news).
It’s, in essence, a criminal matter, but with political and ideological motivations, things get more complex and sensitive, not to mention dangerous.
I’ve previously expressed my view on the likelihood of a civil war 2.0 in the U.S.. I stand by everything I said in that article, including the potential for the rise of intra-terrorism and political violence, or even criminality, reaching civil-war-like levels.
Is the mass of indoctrinated and radical people ready to spread a wave of madness and violence? We’re already getting a glimpse of that. Will it fizzle out or escalate? How will government, institutions and other sectors of society respond if that happens?
We don’t know, and that’s the point.
It’s possible, so the question is how probable? Even a few can cause great damage, physically and to the nation’s mood and institutional order.
“Literally anyone can be a lone wolf. It’ll make the problem that much tougher to tackle, without curtailing civil liberties. Civil war or not, a wave of violence is coming.”
That’s Max Remington on his excellent “Trouble Brewing On The Horizon”  recently in his Substack. I encourage you to read it fully as it tackles the various angles of this phenomenon and the possible outcomes in a very thorough and down-to-earth fashion.
The left has no guardrails and is showing signs it won’t concede power, entitlements, and schemes easily or without a fight. But in truth, even peaceful people can turn radical.
So you may just be denied service in a restaurant for wearing this hat or that shirt, or get your car keyed for sporting this or that sticker. But the possibility of something worse happening cannot be ignored, now more than ever.
Bringing this segment to a conclusion, let’s be pragmatic: Defending and expressing political views, preferences, and affiliations with excessive fervor, or trying to sway people with vehemence, has never been wise or a 100% risk-free endeavor. It’s now quickly becoming a liability, and that’s what matters to us.
In a multidimensional crisis, volatility is the norm. Criminality aside, things get crazy beyond the imaginable, often involving aspects of lifestyle and politics as addressed above, but also of culture, religion, race and ethnicity, sex and gender, and more.
Even small, seemingly innocent actions can lead to unwanted outcomes, sometimes dreadful ones. One such example is the case of the “Deadly Posts”:
“Brazilian Criminal Groups Are Allegedly Monitoring Social Media For Perceived Rivals.” [SOURCE]
People being kidnapped and assassinated by gangs and factions for posting selfies with hand signs on social media may sound like typical Third World stuff. The truth is that it’s neither new nor exclusive to banana republics and narco-states, as this ABC News article from 2013 shows.
Since gangs and criminals exist pretty much everywhere, we must assume that stuff like that can happen anywhere, so it’s also worth reflection and consideration.
People and businesses are being persecuted, canceled, marooned, or hacked for expressing their views and opinions on social media and internet. If they’re not, they can and the risk is now bigger than ever.
Citizens get arrested and charged in the UK and other countries for political, racial or gender-related posts, or other reason deemed contentious by the authorities. This is happening here in Brazil and other places as well, and when it makes the news (which is rare), it gets distorted.
The internet is a minefield. Here are various forms of drawing a personal SHTF onto oneself (and that’s discounting the risks presented by virtual scams and other heists). Even if you consider yourself a digital hermit, others around you (relatives, friends, etc.) may get inadvertently affected, so think about it.
The rules or grounds for those things to happen aren’t much clearer, making matters even worse. Hate speech? Misogyny? Racism? Discrimination? Anything can stick, especially if it’s the government and their acolytes (corrupt NGAs and the media). It’s better to lay low and refrain from some fights.
“You mean I cannot talk on my phone while walking the streets? That I cannot wear my MAGA hat or shirt or stick a flag in my front yard, drive this or that car? That I cannot openly agree or disagree with this or that view, or express my dissatisfaction with how X, Y, or Z do things?”
It’s not a matter of can but should. What is to be gained versus what can be lost. The potential risks, and not only in the short term.
In times like these, to err on the safe side is a wise strategy. Not turning paranoid, but I am considering the potential implications of some stances, decisions, and behaviors.
That’s a more complex and delicate issue. We all have hills on which we’re willing to die rather than surrender, and religion may be the case for some.
It’s a very intimate subject, perhaps the most personal of all being addressed here so I’ll refrain from comment and leave each to make their own reflections.
The worse the crisis, the more dangerous it gets out there. It’s not just crime and violence of all kinds that go up, but other forms of uncivilized savagery as well: road rage, domestic violence, abuses against children, elders, women, minorities, and more.
Road rage, in particular, is a big issue because when everyone is at boiling point, the risks of getting inadvertently involved in trouble simply by everyday exposure and friction increase exponentially.
Be mindful of vigilanteism as well. It’s a complex issue with many angles and thus worth a dedicated post, so I’ll just say it also tends to rise and become critical in times of unrest. Common citizens can get caught on both sides, and the consequences can be grave.
Being 100% grey all the time and about everything is impossible. Realizing that is critical, even those living as recluses will eventually draw some attention or bump into someone the wrong way. Keep a cool head and the emotions in check is something under our control.
I acknowledge First World residents might feel these ideas represent a loss of freedom and personal agency. Unfortunately, it’s true in part, and there’s not much we can do about it.
Just because we’ve been living relatively peacefully for the last 20 or 30 years doesn’t mean it will remain so forever.
For the record, I’m not saying these things are happening or will happen where you live. Some phenomena are global, but they don’t happen on the same scale or intensity everywhere.
Most important, it’s not an SHTF. The world as we know it is changing, not ending. Not everything will be fine, but it never is anyway, and that’s okay. It’s perfectly possible to live a good and normal life in a volatile world."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/judge-upholds-california-law-restricting-18-to-20-year-olds-access-to-guns,Judge Upholds California Law Restricting 18-to 20-Year-Olds’ Access to Guns,By Zero Hedge,1 month ago,"A federal judge has upheld a California law that restricts young adults from buying guns, finding the statute fits within the nation’s historical tradition of gun regulations.
California penal code Section 27510 bars federal gun dealers from selling or otherwise giving possession of guns to people younger than 21. The law does allow 18- to 20-year-olds to buy certain types of guns if they obtain a hunting license, are serving in the military, or were honorably discharged from the armed forces.
Some young adults and gun rights groups challenged the law, arguing it violated the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment.
As Zachary Stieber reports for The Epoch Times, the case has been proceeding through the court system for years. U.S. District Judge James Lorenz said in 2020 that the law did not violate the Constitution, then an appeals court panel said it did. The appeals court later remanded the case back to Lorenz for renewed consideration following the U.S. Supreme Court ordering lower courts to figure out if gun regulations were based on the nation’s history of gun restrictions when deciding whether they are constitutional.
Lorenz on March 26 sided with California Attorney General Rob Bonta, concluding that even though 18- to 20-year-olds are part of “the people” mentioned in the Second Amendment, the young adults have faced gun restrictions throughout much of American history.
The law “is consistent with the Founding Era common law that curtailed commercial firearm purchases by individuals aged 18 to 20,” Lorenz wrote in a 23-page decision.
He also said the law is constitutional because the young adults can buy guns that are not handguns or semiautomatic centerfire rifles if they receive a hunting license or are in the U.S. military. Tens of thousands of young adults have obtained guns under the exceptions in recent years, including 5,431 in 2022.
The young adults can also acquire guns as gifts from family members, the ruling noted.
“Defendants’ evidence supports a reasonable inference that Section 27510 is a commercial restriction that does not meaningfully impair 18-to-20-year-olds’ access to firearms and is therefore not covered by the Second Amendment’s plain text,” the judge said.
The summary judgment ruling means the case is over, unless the plaintiffs appeal.
The Second Amendment Foundation, one of the plaintiffs, said on social media platform X that it is reviewing the opinion.
Bonta, a Democrat, said in a statement that the ruling represents a victory in the fight against gun violence.
“This commonsense regulation will continue to protect our young and vulnerable communities from preventable gun violence,“ he said. ”I am proud of the countless hours my team has put in to defend this law and we know the fight is not over. We will continue to lead efforts to defend commonsense gun-safety laws and protect our communities from senseless violence.”"

Even before the DOGE audits, the galactic cost of federal debt spending was clearly crushing our economy. The interest payments alone are costing the American taxpayer around $1 trillion annually. If nothing changes for the better the national debt will hit $54 trillion by 2034.
Of course, this is unsustainable. The system will completely collapse well before another decade ends; under the weight of rising interest rates or under the weight of exponential inflation. We are already seeing the results of the spending bonanza through ongoing stagflation. Prices on most goods are 30% higher (or more) in the past 5 years. Home prices and rent costs are up at least 50% on average. Americans are being financially suffocated.
The US public wants a reckoning for this theft – And yes, it is theft. Our government, like an MC Escher drawing, is an endless maze of dead ends and black holes. It’s a vampiric organism that siphons money from taxpayer pockets, infinitely churning and embezzling and feeding until there is nothing left. It will not stop, until we make it stop.
Part of this parasite’s defense is to pretend like it doesn’t exist. We know it exists because we can see our blood being drained; we can see the results. But proving that it exists is another matter and it was nearly impossible because the only entity that has been allowed to audit the government is the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In other words, the government audits itself.
Most of our government apparatus is NOT elected. The vast majority of it is created from thin air through bureaucracy. Each new tentacle, once created, grows without regulation and forms new tentacles until there is no way to tell what connects to what and where all the money is going.
The original source of this bureaucracy is a cabal of ultra rich elites backing unaccountable NGOs. They helped to create the system over decades so that they could slither back and forth from government to NGOs to corporations without being noticed. The revolving door became standard and the same wealthy moguls and social engineers heading up think tanks and non-profits and international conglomerates were now able to cycle into various government agencies and change policy to benefit them.
Without the bureaucracy the power of the elites is greatly diminished. That is to say, bureaucratic agencies ARE the true power in government – Not presidents, not congressmen, not senators, and certainly not the American people. Political parties can change, presidents can change, the US can go from red to blue and back again, and the system remains mostly the same.
Until the Trump Administration and DOGE, no one has even tried to audit the government and figure out what the majority of these agencies are doing. The same goes for the Federal Reserve Bank, which facilitates fiat cash beyond the limits of taxpayer funds. They make deficit spending possible and allow the bureaucracy to grow without restriction. The Fed has never faced a full audit either, and good luck trying to get Congress to institute one.
The bottom line is this: The government has been deliberately engineered in such a way that nothing can ever be fixed or reformed. The existence of “the bureaucracy” as we know it today was never intended by the Founding Fathers and it should not be allowed to remain. It is the “Shadow Government”, or at least, it is the primary mechanism by which the Shadow Government rules over the US. Get rid of the bureaucracy and the elites lose everything.
This is why the global geopolitical reaction to DOGE has been so insane and violent; the parasites are seeking to protect themselves and keep their blood supply flowing.
Why does the average American citizen need an agency like USAID? We don’t need it – It serves no purpose. It functions only as an embezzlement scheme for bureaucrats and NGOs.  So, we just get rid of it, right? Except it’s not that easy…
For now it appears that the bureaucracy is using the judicial apparatus in a bid to prevent DOGE and Trump from making necessary cuts. Trump is being told that as President, he’s not allowed to fire anyone in the Federal Government. Think about how insane that sounds.
The jurisdictional overreach and clear political bias is astonishing, but it makes sense. The US President is not supposed to have any real power, he’s only meant to act as a figurehead to make us peasants feel like our votes matter. He’s not supposed to actually follow through on his campaign promises and effect legitimate reform according to the will of the people. That’s crazy talk…
The bureaucrats are so used to running the country and controlling the cash behind the scenes that they are utterly shell-shocked by the notion of being independently audited. They think they are above scrutiny or accountability.
Democrats in particular are absolutely enraged, taking to social media and ranting about how “democracy is under threat” because employees within these agencies are being asked to justify their jobs. The reaction to DOGE is so unhinged I don’t think the public is processing it yet.
Again, the Shadow Government (the bureaucracy) is the real government. When leftists claim audits and cuts are a “danger to democracy” what they mean to say is, THEIR POWER is being threatened. The majority of American voters elected Donald Trump and by extension his administrative team based on his campaign platform of smaller government and balanced budgets. Democrats argue that the will of the voters is anti-democratic.
So what is the solution to this blatant obstruction of voter choice and government accountability?
I believe the situation may end up calling for public intervention by conservative citizens. Leftist activists are being organized by NGOs to thwart DOGE, but where are the conservative activists to help DOGE? Maybe unnecessary agencies need to be shut down by public mandate regardless of what woke Obama appointed judges say?
A mass of conservatives surrounding an agency building would shut operations down by default and send a message, wouldn’t it? Leftists had no problem picketing outside the houses of Supreme Court Judges when they overturned Roe V Wade; conservatives could do the same thing with leftist judges blocking deportations of illegal migrants. If leftists want to use political intimidation by setting fire to Tesla dealerships, conservatives could organize groups to watch over these businesses.
This is not necessarily an effort to protect some electric cars from being vandalized. The point is to send a message that conservatives are not going to sit at home doing nothing while leftists run rampant doing whatever they please. The political left has had a near monopoly on public action for far too long.
I get it – A lot of these people are being paid to do what they’re doing and the rest of us have real jobs and real lives to keep us busy. But frankly, this should galvanize people more. If so many of these activist groups are astroturf then there needs to be a grassroots response to confront them. If they need to be paid and we don’t, then we hold a more legitimate and powerful position in the long run.
In terms of judicial obstruction I see very little recourse other than citizen intervention.
The other option is for the Trump Administration to ignore the judges and continue forward, but even this strategy would require very public mass support from Americans. To be clear, I understand that this creates a slippery slope for presidential power. However, did any of us in the Liberty Movement really believe that the government would shrink itself or that the elites would release their hold over the system because of an election?
Did anyone really think that a reckoning would happen with the endorsement of the courts? The courts have never been the true counterbalance to tyranny, the American people are the counterbalance.
Make no mistake, this is a life or death struggle playing out in front of our eyes. If we continue down the current path of unrestricted government our economy will implode and the establishment elites are positioned to take full advantage of such a crisis. There will be nothing left of America when they are finished; our nation will be a dried up husk.
Now is the time to remove them and their institutions from our society. If we don’t accomplish this task soon our children and their children will live in a world controlled by a faceless bureaucratic mafia immune to all accountability; driving each new generation into perpetual poverty and oppression."

While mainstream media and Democrat politicians claim the administration is going to “cut” Social Security, Musk and the DOGE team clarified their goal is to ensure citizens “legitimately get benefits” and to protect them “from fraud that they experience on a routine basis.”
For example, DOGE software engineer Aram Moghaddassi told Fox’s Brett Baier that an estimated 40% of calls to the Social Security Administration come from fraudsters seeking to have payments rerouted to their account.
🚨 HOLY CRAP! Elon Musk and DOGE just revealed a whopping **40%** of calls to Social Security are fraudsters.“Fraudsters call in and claim to be a retiree. And then they convince the operator to change where the money is flowing.”“As a result of the work of DOGE, legitimate… pic.twitter.com/ZgIBj9uucY
Musk also pushed back against criticism that his team is going to cut benefits for retirees by explaining that eliminating fraud will result in Social Security recipients getting MORE money.
“As a result of DOGE, recipients of Social Security will receive more money, not less money,” he stated.
During another portion of the interview, Musk described one scheme used by Social Security fraudsters where they collect payments for a deceased person by stealing their identity and claiming they’re still alive.
“One of the key tricks that the fraudsters pull is that they will use the fact that someone is marked as alive, that the Social Security number is marked as alive in social security, and then get disability and unemployment insurance for a dead person. Because the databases don’t talk to each other, all they got from Social Security was like, ‘Is this person alive?’ ‘Yes.’ They’re not alive, the person is falsely marked as alive in Social Security. A fraudster can now get unemployment and disability from a dead person. This is happening all the time, at scale.”

In response to a post on 𝕏, Musk said the amount of fraud taking place in the Social Security system is the “craziest thing” he’s “ever seen.”

The media can spin the DOGE agenda all it wants, but when Social Security recipients begin to see their checks getting bigger most Americans will have no choice but to admit the department is working for the benefit of We The People."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/all-we-want-is-transparency-patriots-challenge-the-eus-ngo-network,“All We Want is Transparency”: Patriots Challenge the EU’s NGO Network,By Tamás Orbán | The European Conservtaive,1 month ago,"Members of the national conservative Patriots for Europe (PfE)—the third largest group in the European Parliament (EP) and the main opposition bloc in Brussels—have launched a campaign to force the Commission to disclose all contracts with European Union-funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
The move follows recent revelations that—much like with USAID in America—“billions of euros” in EU taxpayer funds have been spent on progressive political activism under the nose of national governments across the bloc. Now the conservatives are demanding full transparency on the issue.
Patriot lawmakers first submitted 86 freedom of information requests to different directorates-general, all of which were either ignored or rejected due to being too “vague” in their scope—which is not a valid reason under EU law, MEP Csaba Dömötör (Fidesz) explained in a press conference on Thursday, March 27th.
The next steps will include raising the issue with the newly elected European Ombudsman, Teresa Anjinho, hoping she would put additional pressure on the Commission. However, as von der Leyen’s Commission will likely ignore Anjinho’s ruling just as it did countless times with her predecessor, Emily O’Riley, the Patriots are fully prepared to take the EU executive to court over its violation of the fundamental right to free information.
Some examples that have become public recently include hundreds of millions of euros going to Eurofederalist think tanks and green or gender activists who are then invited by the Commission to become “stakeholders” and influence EU legislation. The EU also financed anti-government protests in several conservative member states, as well as organizations that focus solely on suing EU countries on behalf of illegal migrants.
As a concrete example, Dömötör cited a €2.4 million grant that the EU awarded for “fostering queer feminist intersectional resistances.”
All this, however, is just the tip of the iceberg. The Patriots obtained leaked information from the EP’s budgetary control (CONT) committee that indicates that there are as many as 10,000 such contracts. Now, the conservatives will not stop until they have every piece of “the puzzle,” Dömötör said.
European citizens have the right to know which NGOs were financed, for what purpose, and also the amount of the grant.
All we want is transparency. Now it’s time that the Commission proves its democratic values. The very same values it demands from all member states.
To give a more in-depth explanation of the process, Dömötör—along with his colleagues Elisabeth Dieringer (FPÖ) and András László (Fidesz)—held a public meeting in the European Parliament on Wednesday, March 26th.
They also invited representatives of MCC Brussels, a conservative think tank that blew the lid off the current NGO scandal by recently releasing an explosive report about which organizations and projects the EU has been financing with millions in taxpayer funds, often explicitly against the political interests of democratically elected governments.
“What’s happening in Brussels is best described as a parasitical relationship,” Frank Furedi, director of MCC Brussels explained when detailing the think tank’s findings. “In the absence of a European demos that could legitimize it, the Commission funds NGOs who then become stakeholders to uphold the appearance of a demos to legitimize progressive legislation.”
Brussels pays the NGOs, then “consults” them, so of course they say what the Commission wants to hear. This is a cycle of corruption, not of money, but corruption of democracy.
During the meeting, the MEPs also reiterated MCC’s call for establishing an ‘EU DOGE’—a U.S.-style ‘department of government efficiency’—to independently audit both NGO and commercial contracts.
“We must make these payments publicly available and traceable,” MEP András László said. “We cannot expect mainstream media to help us fight for transparency, because they are also on the payslip,” he said, adding that we now know that USAID was paying over 6000 journalists globally, and the EU is doing the same in Europe.
This also invites questioning of the ‘unequal playing field’ for media organizations in Brussels. The Patriots explained that the fact that ‘EU-friendly’ left-wing media receive millions of euros from EU taxpayer funds, often hidden within classified contracts with intermediaries, while conservative outlets are denied even media accreditation in the EP—worth its own separate lawsuit!"

Both countries continue to bomb each other’s energy infrastructure on a daily basis. Meanwhile, the Anglo/Franco ‘Coalition of the Willing‘ summit, hosted in Paris, France on Thursday and attended by twenty-seven European heads of state, mulled ways to ‘continue the resistance’ against Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron gifted Ukraine’s Dictator Vladimir Zelensky 2 billion Euros in military aid and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pushed for even more sanctions against Moscow as the duo are reportedly moving forward on deploying their own militaries to Ukraine to fight Russia directly.
Thursday’s summit seeks to forge a coordinated European military response to ‘protect’ Ukraine during and after the war, due to Trump opening direct negotiations with Russia. The summit is being held to increase Kiev’s own armed forces and will reportedly even result in the deployment of European troops to Ukraine to fight Russia directly, possibly including the use of young Nordic women.
“We must continue to provide immediate support to Ukraine. The resistance must continue. I have announced an additional €2 billion in support,” Macron said Wednesday during a working dinner with Dictator Zelensky ahead of the Coalition of the Willing meeting.
Macron’s gift will supply more equipment to prolong the war against Russia.
“Ukrainian forces will also receive VAB armored vehicles and AMX–10 RC tanks, as well as a wide range of ammunition, some of which is remotely controlled, and drones. The French president added that there are ongoing discussions surrounding satellite and intelligence cooperation involving Ukrainian manufacturing,” Remix News said Thursday.
Hindering the Trump-backed ceasefire even more, Zelensky again reiterated that sanctions against Russia must remain in place for Ukraine to comply with a ceasefire, however Russia has demanded that sanctions be lifted for it to comply with a ceasefire.
During Wednesday’s dinner, the Dictator hinted at prospective Western European troop deployments in his country to fight Russia. Thursday’s Coalition of the Willing then mulled this plan, despite not all attendees backing the proposed direct war with Russia. Perhaps alarmingly, France and Britain are reportedly still moving forward with these plans.
“France and Britain will continue to forge ahead with plans to deploy troops in Ukraine,” the AP said Thursday.
“These reassurance forces are a French-British proposal,” Macron said. “It is desired by Ukraine and noted by several member states that have expressed their willingness to join. It is not unanimous. That is known. Besides, we do not need unanimity to achieve it.”
Ukraine’s Dictator appears to not see himself at the negotiation table with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as he now says Russia’s leader will be dead soon.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/right-wing-dutch-coalition-on-the-brink-as-ukraine-aid-splits-government,Right-Wing Dutch Coalition on the Brink as Ukraine Aid Splits Government,By Zoltán Kottász | The European Conservative,1 month ago,"Disagreements on funding Ukraine could cause a split in the conservative Dutch coalition government, paving the way for a power grab by the EU’s former “Green Deal czar” Frans Timmermans.
According to Dutch media reports, the most liberal member of the four-party coalition, the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), is considering quitting the coalition if the other three parties do not agree to the European Union’s plans to take on massive debt to boost the bloc’s defence capabilities and buy more military equipment for Ukraine.
In that case, the government would lose its majority, and instead of calling snap elections, the VVD would try to form a centre-left cabinet by partnering with the GreenLeft–Labour party.
The left-wing party is led by Frans Timmermans, one of the masterminds of the EU’s Green Deal, which inflicted radical, damaging climate policies on Europe’s citizens, businesses, and farmers.
The three more conservative parties of the current Dutch government recently supported a motion in parliament which states that the Netherlands should not take out new EU loans for military aid to Ukraine.
Geert Wilders, the leader of the government’s largest formation, the right-wing nationalist Party for Freedom (PVV), said that while supporting Ukraine is of great importance, “we must prioritise the daily problems of our own people,” ensuring that they have cheaper groceries, lower rents, and reduced energy bills.
Wilders has vowed to vote against a further €3.5 billion in Dutch support for Ukraine in 2026.
The liberal VVD, which has always been a pro-EU and pro-defence party, does not seem willing to make concessions on this issue, and, according to sources in The Hague, a collaboration with GreenLeft–Labour is “seriously being explored as an emergency scenario.”
This scenario would involve setting up a kind of “war cabinet,” with parties from all sides of the political spectrum that favour supporting Ukraine banding together—without holding elections. Such a solution would be presented as a necessary step “in times of crisis.”
Many European leaders have been panicking for months because they—inexplicably—see the Donald Trump-led U.S. administration’s attempts to forge a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia as an appeasement to Russia and a worrying sign for Europe.
But Wilders, who does not want Dutch soldiers to participate in a future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, said that rearming Europe with €800 billion—as designated by the EU—may “sound nice,” and may sound as though Europe has a lot of money, but these are loans, and he himself is not in favour of taking up more common European debts."

Mentzen is currently third in the polls, behind Rafał Trzaskowski (KO) and Karol Nawrocki (PiS).
During this interview, Menzten reiterated his idea to ensure politicians do not rush to drag the country into wars, writes Do Rzeczy.
“Politicians’ children should be the first to go to the front. This will introduce a mechanism — thanks to which politicians do not get involved in wars in which they should not get involved — because they then risk the health and lives of their own children,” emphasized the Confederation candidate.
“The task of a member of parliament is to sit in the Sejm, to make laws during a war […] while the children of politicians should be in the first row to go to war because these politicians caused the outbreak of this war, and they should be the first to suffer the consequences,” he continued.
Asked about military training, Mentzen said that it should be mandatory for young people after high school. “But not for everyone, because the Polish army is not able to train everyone. In addition, this training should be paid, i.e., these people should receive money for the training they undergo during this period,” Mentzen commented.
The politician recalled another argument in favor of military training. “In war, just like in any other industry (…) knowledge, experience, skills are valuable. The chance that someone who has undergone such training, who will be drafted into the army anyway, if push comes to shove, will survive is much greater,” he said, adding that training “drastically increases their chances of survival in the event of a war breaking out.”
Conscription is also currently being pushed in Germany, and various liberal news outlets are pushing for young people to fight to “defend freedom and diversity” by joining the army."

“NC State Rep. Allison Dahle (D) has introduced two bills — one to repeal laws that protect minors from genital mutilation surgeries and another to repeal the NC Parents’ Bill of Rights,” Libs of TikTok noted on X.
“This is how desperate Democrats are to mutilate and groom your kids,” they added.

North Carolina House Bill H492, brazenly titled “Repeal Parents’ Bill of Rights,” aims to “protect” minors and adults “from attempts to change sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.”
Rep. Dahle’s bill proposes that “no State funds, nor any funds belonging to a municipality, agency, or political subdivision of this State, shall be expended for the purpose of conducting conversion therapy, referring an individual for conversion therapy, health benefits coverage for conversion therapy, or a grant or contract with any entity that conducts conversion therapy or refers individuals for conversion therapy.”
A second bill introduced by Dahle, H502, seeks establish a “gender-affirming rights” law while repealing the state’s current law prohibiting medical professionals from prescribing puberty-blocking drugs or cross-sex hormones to minors and from performing surgical transitioning procedures.
The measure also demands that North Carolina healthcare professionals take continuing education courses that focus solely on dealing with LGBTQ patients.
Over the course of Monday and Tuesday, Democrat lawmakers in the Tar Heel State filed more than 10 bills supporting LGBTQ+ rights, abortion rights, and rights to contraception and in-vitro fertilization.
Republicans in the North Carolina Senate simultaneously put forth their own measure described as “a sweeping bill targeting transgender rights to bathroom access.”
Senate Bill 516, the “Women’s Safety and Protection Act,” would restrict gender-confused individuals from using opposite-sex bathrooms, stating that school bathrooms “shall only be used by one designated biological sex at one time.”
Ashley Vaughan, a spokesperson for the conservative NC Values Coalition, released a statement saying that North Carolina schools “should never allow children to be on the front lines of the gender ideology confusion.”
The GOP-sponsored bill would also limit the ability of those claiming to be of the opposite sex to alter legal documents."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/rfk-jr-is-pushing-big-pharma-ad-ban-and-corporate-media-is-panicking,RFK Jr. Is Pushing Big Pharma Ad Ban – And Corporate Media Is Panicking,By Kyle Becker | Relentless,1 month ago,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary, is pushing a plan to ban pharmaceutical ads from television. He’s right to push for it—and not just because the U.S. is one of only two countries on earth that allows such advertising (the other being New Zealand).
America’s health system isn’t just flawed; it’s harming public health, distorting journalism, and fueling Big Pharma’s malignant influence over our daily lives.
Let’s start with the obvious: TV drug ads aren’t designed to inform—they’re designed to manipulate. The formula is always the same. Cue soft lighting and sappy piano music. A sad, listless person pops a pill and suddenly life is vibrant again. They’re running through fields, laughing with family, walking dogs across idyllic bridges.
Then, in a breathless voiceover, the side effects come tumbling out like a legal disclaimer roulette wheel—stroke, heart failure, suicidal thoughts. The goal? Make viewers want a drug before they even talk to their doctor. It’s emotional coercion dressed up as health education.
This completely inverts how medicine is supposed to work. Health care decisions should be made inside the exam room, not in a 60-second marketing spot. Patients should go to their doctors with symptoms, and those doctors—armed with clinical training and knowledge of the patient’s full health profile—should decide whether a drug is even necessary.
Many issues could be better addressed through lifestyle changes, diet, supplements, or preventative care. But instead, America has normalized a pill-for-everything culture, supercharged by the fact that doctors are often nudged by patients demanding whatever drug they saw advertised last night during a commercial break.
This isn’t just bad medicine—it’s dangerous. And it’s no accident.
Big Pharma isn’t spending billions on advertising because it cares about your health. It’s doing it because the return on investment is enormous. Studies estimate the ROI on direct-to-consumer (DTC) drug ads ranges from 100% to 500%, depending on the drug. In 2025 alone, pharmaceutical companies are projected to spend over $5 billion on national linear TV ads, according to iSpot.tv. That number balloons even higher when you include digital and streaming. Just a handful of blockbuster drugs—like Skyrizi, Jardiance, and Ozempic—are burning through tens of millions in TV ads every month.
This revenue isn’t just padding Big Pharma’s pockets—it’s quietly buying influence in the media. Nearly 31% of ad minutes on major nightly news broadcasts in 2024 came from pharmaceutical brands. That means a huge portion of media budgets depend on the very companies they should be holding accountable. And surprise, surprise: when Big Pharma misleads the public, many news outlets are either silent or hesitant to report critically. The financial conflict of interest is baked in.
We saw the worst-case version of this during the COVID-19 pandemic. The novel mRNA shots—rushed to market under emergency use—were sold to the public as miracle solutions. Government officials and media outlets claimed these vaccines would “stop infection,” “prevent death entirely,” and “end the pandemic.” Younger, healthy individuals were told they needed them for everyone’s safety, despite already low statistical risk. None of these claims held up. As the data evolved, we learned the vaccines offered some reduction in severe disease, but not sterilizing immunity. Yet the media rarely corrected course.
Why would they? Pharma ads were paying the bills. Meanwhile, federal workers were mandated—and many private sector employees coerced—into getting injections under false pretenses. Billions of dollars flowed to Big Pharma. The American public was misled.
This pattern of deception is not new. Pfizer alone has paid billions in legal penalties over the years for unethical marketing, off-label promotion, and other violations. The most infamous: a $2.3 billion settlement in 2009—the largest health care fraud settlement in U.S. history at the time. Yet companies like Pfizer, AbbVie, and Johnson & Johnson still enjoy a polished image on TV, thanks in part to relentless ad spending and regulatory leniency.
RFK Jr.’s plan, while legally uphill, is not without precedent. In 1970, President Nixon signed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, which banned tobacco ads from TV and radio. Cigarettes were legal, yet too dangerous to promote on air. The same principle should apply here. Just because a drug is FDA-approved doesn’t mean it should be marketed like soda. Approval doesn’t equal infallibility—just ask anyone who took Vioxx or OxyContin.
Critics, including the Wall Street Journal, have framed RFK’s proposal as a personal vendetta. That’s both lazy and misleading. In reality, there’s wide bipartisan and public support for reining in pharma ads. The American Medical Association called for a ban back in 2015. A STAT/Harvard poll found that 57% of Americans support banning TV drug ads. Even hosts on CNBC—hardly anti-business—agreed the ads are unnecessary. “Don’t you think doctors should prescribe it if you need it?” asked Joe Kernen. Exactly.
The pharmaceutical industry’s defenders like to invoke the First Amendment, claiming that banning ads would be unconstitutional. But commercial speech does not enjoy absolute protection. Under the Central Hudson test, the government can regulate ads if it has a substantial interest, the regulation directly advances that interest, and the restriction is narrowly tailored. Protecting public health from misleading pharmaceutical marketing clears all three hurdles. Even if a full ban doesn’t survive, tighter restrictions—like banning ads for certain drug classes, or requiring full price transparency—could pass muster.
More importantly, even the threat of a ban could pressure drugmakers to change course voluntarily. They did it before in 2008, when criticism led to updated self-regulatory guidelines. If Kennedy’s push forces them to rethink their practices, that alone is a win.
Pharma companies will no doubt fight this tooth and nail. But that’s not a reason to back down—it’s a reason to press harder. We’ve allowed an industry with an immense profit motive to shape our health decisions for too long. The result? A country drowning in prescriptions, mired in chronic disease, and confused about who to trust.
Enough is enough. RFK Jr.’s proposal to kick drug ads off TV isn’t radical—it’s responsible. And it’s long overdue."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-far-lefts-violent-attacks-on-tesla-are-revealing,The Far-Left’s Violent Attacks on Tesla are Revealing,By Connor O'Keeffe | Mises Institute,1 month ago,"In recent weeks, there has been a sharp increase in violent attacks aimed at destroying cars and other property carrying the logo of Elon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla.
In Colorado, a woman was charged with using Molotov cocktails to set multiple cars at a Tesla dealership on fire before painting the word Nazi on a store sign. In Oregon, one man fired a rifle into one Tesla dealership while someone else fired shots and threw explosives into another. In Washington, four Tesla Cybertrucks were set on fire, a Tesla sedan was covered in gasoline and set ablaze on a city street, and various other Cybertrucks had swastikas painted on them.
Seven Tesla charging stations were burned in Massachusetts, two Teslas were set on fire in Texas, several Teslas were shot and lit on fire in Nevada, and much more. As recently as Monday, multiple firebombs were discovered in a Tesla dealership in Austin, Texas. It’s clear that these are, at the very least, copycat acts aimed at Elon Musk and anyone who owns or is interested in buying a car from his company.
The violent wing is only one part of a broader anti-Musk movement that’s cropped up since the Tesla CEO endorsed Donald Trump and took on an advisory role in the new administration. The more above-board side of the effort—organized by the progressive group Indivisible—has officially denounced the destruction of property and has instead focused on staging protests and obnoxiously shaming Tesla owners in public.
But the more extreme, violent factions appear to share the same objective as these progressive activists—as can be deduced from the sudden popularity of these crimes, the symbols and messages left by perpetrators, and the various far-left blogs doxing Tesla employees and calling for more direct action at dealerships in a mass “Tesla Takedown” on March 29.
Because of the tactics and rhetoric used, it’s clear that many of the left-wingers carrying all this out see themselves as soldiers in a noble, grassroots resistance that’s taking on the world’s richest man and his fascist underlings. But this is just the latest example of the American far-left being easily co-opted into playing directly into the hands of the political establishment.
Elon Musk was already absurdly wealthy for years before he bought Twitter and began leaning more into politics. Sure, his success in producing the first electric car that people didn’t have to be bribed into driving helped his reputation in the eyes of climate-conscious progressives. But his massive net worth still made him a textbook villain to the left-wing mind. To those who genuinely believe that world hunger could be solved entirely for just a couple billion dollars, for example, anyone “sitting on” a net worth as high as Musk’s is considered downright evil.
But the left’s opposition to Elon Musk never really rose above the occasional grumblings in online comment sections. That is, until Musk began to take on projects that the political establishment doesn’t like. First, he broke the establishment’s stranglehold over social media by buying Twitter. Then, later, he threw his money and support behind Donald Trump at the apex of the 2024 election. Finally, he signed on to help the current administration determine how to effectively cut government and then carry out those cuts.
Leaving aside how genuine or effective Musk has been or will be in his recent anti-establishment turn, it is clear that the political class is not happy with the Tesla CEO. He has brought a lot of attention to some of the interventionist scams at the heart of our political system and generated a lot of excitement about cutting the government power, fueling it all.
The politicians, government officials, politically-connected rich, and corporate media higher-ups who benefit from those interventionist scams are making an effort to demonize Musk for the exact kind of conduct they have partaken in for decades—mainly warping government policy to his own benefit at the expense of poor people.
We could speculate over whether all this violence is an unintended consequence of this rhetoric or the sought-after reaction. But what nobody can deny is that the people destroying and defacing Tesla cars, chargers, and dealerships believe exactly what the political establishment wants them to believe about Elon Musk."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/npr-pbs-ceos-grilled-on-capitol-hill-over-using-taxpayer-money-to-push-propaganda,"NPR, PBS CEOs Grilled on Capitol Hill Over Using Taxpayer Money to Push Propaganda",By Adan Salazar,1 month ago,"The CEOs of NPR and PBS testified to the DOGE House subcommittee Wednesday on their use of federal funding to push biased reporting on the unsuspecting American public.
In a tense hearing helmed by DOGE Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger were grilled on their respective public broadcasting networks’ use of taxpayer money to fund slanted anti-Trump reports.
Rep. Greene held Maher’s feet to the fire over her previous tweets from 2020 illustrating clear Trump Derangement Syndrome, in which she called Trump a “deranged racist sociopath,” and her previous statements as former head of Wikipedia claiming “truth is a distraction” hindering Democrats’ progressive agenda.
Pointing out PBS News’ coverage of Elon Musk’s supposed Nazi salute earlier this year, Rep. Greene stated, “Not once did PBS or NPR report on the numerous accounts of Democrats making the same gesture. Why wasn’t this treated exactly the same way? Is there not a standard in journalism today? Apparently not.”
Rep. Greene also asked Kerger about her station’s creation of documentaries glorifying transgenderism and claiming trees are racist.
Maher also attempted to distance herself from comments made during a 2022 TED Talk, where she defended censorship and bias as Wikipedia CEO, stating, “Our reverence for the truth might have become a distraction that’s getting in the way of finding common ground and getting important things done.”
Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) blasted Maher for NPR’s misrepresentation and distortion of his investigation into the Biden crime family, accusing NPR of propagandizing Americans with false, blatantly partisan adversarial reporting that skewed facts.
Throughout the hearing, various GOP congressmen highlighted NPR’s suspension of whistleblower and former editor Uri Berliner after he published an essay last year exposing and criticizing the political bias inside NPR’s newsroom.
“Concerned by the lack of viewpoint diversity, I looked at voter registration for our newsroom,” Berliner wrote at the time. “In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.”
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) touched on Berliner’s accusations while questioning why NPR refused to report on the bombshell Hunter Biden laptop story, later proven true, to which Maher responded that it “was a mistake.”
“Yeah the whole country knows that was a mistake!” Jordan told her.
Maher also had to answer on how NPR got three major stories, the Russian collusion hoax, the Hunter Biden laptop, and the COVID lab-leak theory, 100% wrong.
The pair were also asked why Democrat Congressman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was interviewed by their networks 25 times to spout anti-Trump rhetoric, compared to the zero times anyone was interviewed on Biden’s alleged crimes.
Meanwhile, Democrats like Rep. Jasmine Crockett (Texas) and Rep. Greg Casar (Texas) attempted to undermine the legitimacy of the hearing and frame the committee’s questions over taxpayer funding of propaganda as a “goofy” cause, with one Dem. rep. asking if Elmo was a communist because he’s a red puppet.
The whole time, the public broadcast CEOs claimed federal funding is a small part of their overall budget, with most funds coming from donations from “viewers like you” — yet, they claimed that DOGE cutting the federal support would directly impact local affiliates.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/russia-winning-in-ukraine-continually-gaining-leverage-us-intel-community,"Russia Winning In Ukraine, Continually Gaining Leverage: US Intel Community",By ZeroHedge,1 month ago,"The US government in its 2025 Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community – which was just released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in conjunction with top officials’ testimony at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday – has admitted that Ukraine’s battlefield prospects are fading amid the onslaught of superior Russian forces.
Currently, Moscow has “seized the upper hand” in the war over the past year, the fresh assessment warns, and “is on a path to accrue greater leverage” as peace talks with Washington are underway.
“Even though Russian President [Vladimir] Putin will be unable to achieve the total victory he envisioned when initiating the large-scale invasion in February 2022, Russia retains momentum as a grinding war of attrition plays to Russia’s military advantages,” the report states.
“This grinding war of attrition will lead to a gradual but steady erosion of Kyiv’s position on the battlefield, regardless of any U.S. or allied attempts to impose new and greater costs on Moscow,” it continues.
This should come as no surprise to any objective observer; however, what is surprising is the huge amount of Russian losses estimated by US intelligence. While there’s no way of verifying such information, the report claims that there are over 750,000 dead and wounded on the Russian side.
Still, the intel community emphasizes the Russian military machine’s ability to quickly replenish personnel while growing its industrial capacity to continually support the war.
On the prospect for achieving a quick peace settlement, the report notes that both Russian and Ukrainian leadership “probably still see the risks of a longer war as less than those of an unsatisfying settlement.”
“For Russia, positive battlefield trends allow for some strategic patience, and for Ukraine, conceding territory or neutrality to Russia without substantial security guarantees from the West could prompt domestic backlash and future insecurity.”
“Regardless of how and when the war in Ukraine ends, Russia’s current geopolitical, economic, military, and domestic political trends underscore its resilience and enduring potential threat to U.S. power, presence, and global interests,” it adds.
According to the DNI assessment, Russia had more than 750,000 military casualties during its war in Ukraine. By comparison, the U.S. had just over a million service members killed or wounded in World War II. The U.S. at the time had a population roughly the same size as Russia… pic.twitter.com/pG8PPUAoHl
But interestingly, in her Tuesday testimony before the Senate Intelligence Community, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard characterized Russia as a “formidable competitor” but stopped short of calling Moscow an adversary, which former Biden intel officials frequently did.

US Intelligence On Russia Nuclear Capacity, China And Taiwan
The US annual threat assessment from the Director of National Intelligence carries warnings about Russia and China. The 2025 edition warned that Russia is developing a satellite capable of carrying a nuclear weapon. It said that China was making aggressive efforts to assert its sovereignty in the south and east China seas, and seems likely to increase its economic pressure on Taiwan."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-makes-progress-toward-ukraine-war-ceasefire-via-trade-commerce-creation,Trump Makes Progress Toward Ukraine War Ceasefire Via Trade & Commerce Creation,By Sean Miller,1 month ago,"On Tuesday Ukrainian Dictator Vladimir Zelensky expressed his readiness to comply with a United States-developed ceasefire plan designed to protect energy infrastructure from strikes. This is similar to a previous ceasefire that Kiev had agreed to but has not obeyed. Russia has requested as part of this new ceasefire that the U.S. lift sanctions against it. President Donald Trump said that progress toward peace is being made at the negotiations his administration has organized, which are taking place in Saudi Arabia.
Ukraine’s Dictator agreed to the ceasefire in a rather rudimentary statement.
“We do not hit their energy. They do not hit our energy. I think there will be a million questions and details, but today it sounds like this: each side does not use the corresponding weaponry against the energy of both sides,” Zelensky said Tuesday.
Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Wednesday that Kiev is still bombing Russian targets, however.
Russia is requesting the U.S. remove its sanctions against it as part of the ceasefire. Ukraine’s Dictator appears to be upset that President Trump has willingness to do so.
“They will be looking at them [the sanctions], and we’re thinking about all of them right now. There are about five or six conditions. We’re looking at all of them,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.
Specifically, the U.S. will likely restore Russia’s access to global markets, specifically for agricultural and fertilizer exports, decrease its maritime insurance costs and enhance its access to ports and payment systems for these transactions.
Ukraine’s Dictator had this to say about the possible easement of U.S. sanctions against Russia:
“We did not agree to this so that it would be in a joint document. We believe that this is a weakening of positions and a weakening of sanctions,” Dictator Zelensky said. “This was not on our agenda. The American side violated this. [Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem] Umerov contacted me. I said that this is not a discussion of an unconditional ceasefire.”
Regardless of Dictator Zelensky’s dismay at Moscow gaining increased access to commerce, President Trump hailed the progress his global peace plan is making.
“We’ve made a lot of progress on two fronts,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, referencing both Russia and Ukraine but also the Middle East. “We’ll see what happens. We’re in deep discussions with Russia and Ukraine and I would say it’s going well.”
While Trump lauded the progress toward the end of the war, on the same day he said Russia may be dragging its feet.
“I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they’re dragging their feet. I’ve done it over the years,” Trump told Newsmax in an interview that aired Tuesday night."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/german-coalition-talks-hit-bump-as-afd-support-reaches-all-time-high,German Coalition Talks Hit Bump as AfD Support Reaches All-Time High,By Zoltán Kottász | The European Conservative,1 month ago,"The parties vying to form the next German government are struggling to come to an agreement on such core voter concerns as migration, taxation, and gender issues.
The negotiations highlight the divide between what the centre-right CDU/CSU alliance promised to the electorate and the left-wing policies they are about to implement in order to accommodate their likely coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD).
The first round of the official coalition talks ended on Monday, March 24th and, according to media reports, there are still many differences of opinion in significant policy areas.
One such area is migration. During his election campaign, CDU leader Friedrich Merz promised to halt illegal migrants at the border, only to backtrack when it became clear that he would have to give in to the demands of the SPD in order to form a government.
As we previously reported, the SDP wants the exact opposite of what the CDU proposed: to bring in 500,000 people a year, give non-German migrants the right to vote, and make sure that deportations are only a “very last resort.”
The Social Democrats also reject the centre-right’s proposals to cut benefits for asylum seekers, calling such a move inhumane.
While the CDU/CSU generally wants to reduce taxes and their left-wing partners want to increase them, there is also a disagreement on the so-called self-determination act, a piece of legislation adopted last year which allows anyone to legally change their name and gender with a simple application form. The centre-right would like to get rid of it, but the SPD wants to keep it.
The negotiating parties have praised each other in public but behind the scenes all is not well.
Merz and his CDU party are already feeling the brunt of voters’ dissatisfaction for breaking their campaign promises in order to seize power.
A poll released by broadcaster ZDF last week showed 73% of those surveyed felt deceived by Merz, including 44% of CDU/CSU supporters.
Conservative voters are not only dissatisfied with Merz’s U-turn on migration but also with his plans to take on a massive €1 trillion debt to boost the country’s defence and infrastructure—despite vowing not to reform rules on borrowing limits, the so-called ‘debt brake.’
Merz has also given in to the demands of the Greens, namely to put aside €100 million for the government’s existing climate fund and to enshrine in the constitution 2045 as a compulsory climate neutrality deadline.
A new survey shows that the CDU/CSU’s support has dropped to 27% from the 28.5% it received at the elections a month ago. The SPD’s popularity decreased by 2 percentage points to 14.5%.
Meanwhile, the second-placed right-wing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which has lambasted Merz for his “orgy of debt,” has seen its popularity grow from 20.8% to an all-time high of 23.5%.
BUNDESTAGSWAHL | Sonntagsfrage INSA/BILDUnion: 27,0% (-2,0)AfD: 23,5% (+1,5)SPD: 14,5% (-1,0)GRÜNE: 12,0% (+1,0)LINKE: 10,5%BSW: 4,5% (-0,5)FDP: 3,5% (+0,5)Sonstige: 4,5% (+0,5)Änderungen zur letzten Umfrage vom 17. März 2025Verlauf: https://t.co/f9MV7iZ8iJ#btw29 pic.twitter.com/95N0ZHIL2a

https://www.infowars.com/posts/censorship-season-opens-as-canada-heads-to-the-polls,Censorship Season Opens as Canada Heads to the Polls,By Didi Rankovic | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"Elections Canada, the agency responsible for administering federal elections, has announced that it has been “in touch” with social media platforms like X and TikTok, as the country goes into campaign mode.
TikTok has already revealed that whatever is considered “harmful misinformation” will be removed, while fact-checkers will be used to label content they decide cannot be verified.
The concern is, as ever, the perception of “misinformation” and its effect, which Canada’s authorities, like many others around the world, elevate to the level of no less than “the single biggest risk to our democracy,” and, “an existential threat.”
That is what the Foreign Interference Commission, set up by the Canadian government in 2023, recently concluded in a report, noting that this is true both of foreign and other forms of “information manipulation.”
Now Elections Canada is “building” on this fearmongering climate to put pressure on social media companies to censor more diligently during the campaign.
Chief Electoral Officer Stephane Perrault said he is satisfied with the way the companies are thus far responding to the demands to “secure” the election and its integrity.
And while Perrault is promising that the public will learn about these communications with social firms, some of them, like TikTok, are already issuing press releases detailing how they intend to behave during the campaign in Canada.
The company revealed that it is “working” with Elections Canada – and that the result of that work has been the newly introduced in-app Election Center.
The Center is supposed to provide “media literacy and authoritative information” and users will be nudged to visit it via prompts that appear on videos and searches related to the election. In addition, users will be directed to the site of Elections Canada.
Meta is also “working” with the agency, according to a blog post published last week. Besides informing users in Canada where, when, and how they can cast their ballots, Meta promises “advanced security operations and transparency around political and social issue ads.”
And the giant will be labeling “realistic” AI-generated content – but also “some other types of organic content.”
Meta’s post does not clarify if it will be using third-party fact-checkers on its platforms accessed by users in Canada."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-admin-ends-taxpayer-funded-housing-for-illegal-immigrants,Trump Admin Ends Taxpayer-Funded Housing For Illegal Immigrants,By ZeroHedge,1 month ago,"The Trump administration on Monday announced that it would be ending taxpayer-funded housing for illegal immigrants.
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revealed a joint partnership to curtail what they describe as an “exploitation” of the country’s housing programs.
As Rachel Acenas reports for The Epoch Times, Turner and Noem together signed the “American Housing Programs for American Citizens” memorandum of understanding (MOU).
“We’re here signing a partnership to ensure that the wasteful misappropriations that have been going to assist the illegal aliens in our country will no longer go to assist them but instead to assist the American people,” Turner said in a video statement on X.
Under @POTUS, Americans will no longer take a back seat to illegal aliens.  DHS @Sec_Noem and I want to make it clear: No more taxpayer-funded housing for illegals. pic.twitter.com/DWvYlSHEqg
American citizens have taken a back seat to illegal immigrants for too long, according to Turner, who said that American tax dollars should be used to benefit only U.S. citizens, especially when it comes to an issue as pressing as the nation’s housing crisis.
As part of the new memorandum, HUD will provide a full-time staff member to assist in operations at the Incident Command Center (ICC) to facilitate data-sharing and ensure taxpayer-funded housing programs are not used to benefit or harbor illegal immigrants.
Noem accused the Biden administration of failing to prioritize Americans.
“This memorandum is going to be a partnership that we will form to make sure that these housing programs are going to only people who deserve it, people who are in this country who need assistance, who want a better life for their family,” Noem said in the video.
The HUD and DHS partnership comes after Trump signed an executive order in February to direct federal agencies and departments to identify all federally-funded programs that provide financial benefits to illegal immigrants and to take corrective action.
The order seeks to “ensure taxpayer resources are not used to incentivize or support illegal immigration,” according to a fact sheet on the order.
HUD cited data from the Center for Immigration Studies that showed about 59 percent of illegal immigrant households use one or more welfare programs, creating roughly $42 billion in costs. The increase has a direct impact on housing, according to the agency. By increasing demand for housing, immigration drives up costs in areas where immigrants settle, according to the data.
The department pointed to various other issues surrounding taxpayer-funded housing programs for illegal immigrants."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/get-ready-activists-holding-dc-rally-to-urge-trump-admin-to-address-child-trafficking-epidemic-caused-by-child-protective-services,GET READY: Activists Holding DC Rally To Urge Trump Admin To Address Child Trafficking Epidemic Caused By Child Protective Services,By Patrick Howley | Patrick Reports,1 month ago,"In April, parents and activists will hold a major rally in Washington, D.C. to urge President Donald Trump’s administration to address the child trafficking epidemic caused by Child Protective Services (CPS). The activists have their best chance ever to finally achieve policy reforms, according to signs from inside the Trump administration.
“Will the media report that our foster children are America’s number one source of domestic prostitutes?” Kathlee Arthur of the Family Forward Project, who is one of the rally organizers, told PATRICK REPORTS. “We started doing this in 2016, and now we have about 20,000 members.” Arthur’s group focuses on how Title IV-E Social Security money is spent because it fuels for-profit child trafficking through CPS, as we explain below.
Kathlee Arthur revealed that her group has made inroads in the Trump administration, getting “high-level executive meetings,” and that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has assigned a representative to work with one of the group’s partners Mark Ludwig, who works on father’s rights and child support issues.
The Family Forward Project (found on Facebook here) and many other likeminded activists including Ludwig’s group are coming together for the protest, which takes place from April 7-11 in Washington, D.C., complete with some training exercises for activists to learn how to gain legislative victories. The actual rally will be held on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (April 8, 9, and 10) at noon across from Union Station on Capitol Hill, with at least 25 speakers and some musical acts. The rally will feature personal stories from government victims. On Thursday, there will be a Rest In Peace ceremony for the victims who didn’t make it.
The U.S. federal government pays out money to states every time a child is adopted out of foster care, courtesy of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, signed by Bill Clinton and spearheaded by Hillary Clinton as part of her “It Takes A Village” collectivist child-raising philosophy. The program incentivizes judges and social workers to take children out of their biological family homes to increase foster care enrollment, which leads to widespread child trafficking.
So where does the money come from? The money comes from Social Security. Since the Clinton administration, the U.S. government has been funding child trafficking using the retirement money of hardworking Americans, as I explain in my groundbreaking movie “Save The Babies: A Documentary on CPS Child Trafficking (WATCH IT HERE).”
Sometimes, the government even uses “predictive analytics” programs to determine that parents are unfit, even when they haven’t done anything wrong.
“When you look at the population, it’s super disproportionate for handicapped children and poor children. That’s why they go after those moms so hard, because those are the moms who are going to make them the money,” Arthur said.
The activists are confident that they can make policy progress with members of the Trump administration, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Effiency (DOGE).
“Title 4, the data coding of it, hasn’t been updated since before the computer era. There’s no standard definition of abuse or neglect. You go to look for information for the Title 4 it’s literally impossible. There’s no way to get any information out of them,” Arthur said. “I did a cartwheel when I found out DOGE might audit Social Security Title 4 spending.”
Arthur says the group has good connections in the Senate including with Democrat Georgia senator Ossoff, who is actually paying attention to the issue and conducting research on it. Increasingly, lawmakers on both sides are starting to ask where the missing children are going.

Jasmine Crockett Assaults Reporter & Calls Wheelchair-Bound TX Gov. Abbott “Governor Hot Wheels”,By Kelen McBreen,1 month ago,"Disgraceful Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) referred to disabled Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott as “Governor Hot Wheels” during an LGBTQ benefit dinner this weekend, before physically attacking a journalist on Tuesday.
Crockett, who made headlines earlier this week for inciting violence against Republican politicians, was filmed attacking Loomer Unleashed journalist Charles Downs as he asked a simple question in the halls of Congress.
While she walked down a hallway and chatted with GOP Congressman Tim Burchett (Tenn.), Downs asked, “Congresswoman Crockett, you were recently on a Tesla Takedown call calling for violence on the 29th. Would you like to clarify your comments?”
Ironically, Downs then asked, “Congresswoman, will you condemn violence at the Tesla?” as he was cut off due to Crockett grabbing the camera from his hands.
Downs posted a video following the assault.
The incident caused Crockett to issue a response on 𝕏, writing, “This morning an individual attempted to my invade personal safety for a soundbite. Thank you to my Colleague @RepTimBurchett for putting himself between me and the individual to ensure I made it to Committee. In a time of division, he put respect and safety first and I appreciate it.”
Commenters on the congresswoman’s post criticized the statement, calling Crockett a “liar” and pointing out the video speaks for itself.
During her speech at the pro-LGBTQ “Human Rights Campaign” dinner over the weekend, Crockett mocked Texas Governor Greg Abbott for using a wheelchair.
“We in these hot ass Texas streets,” she told the audience, adding, “Y’all know we got Governor Hot Wheels down there, come on now. And the only thing hot about him is that he is a hot ass mess honey.”
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton responded, “Jasmine Crockett is despicable.”
The Texas Democrat has quickly become one of the most controversial figures in American politics due to her inflammatory remarks and ghetto persona."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/dhs-terminates-bidens-chnv-program-used-by-half-million-migrants-to-fly-into-us,DHS Terminates Biden’s CHNV Program Used by Half-Million ‘Migrants’ to Fly Into US,By Dan Lyman,1 month ago,"The Trump administration is removing protected status and canceling work visas for more than half a million ‘migrants’ who arrived to the U.S. via the Biden regime’s “Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans,” also known as the CHNV parole program.
Under the scheme, which was initially made available to Venezuelan nationals in late 2022 and then opened to citizens of Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua in January of 2023, some 532,000 inadmissible aliens flew to U.S. airports in just over two years, until the program was suspended during the first days of the new Trump era.
On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced CHNV participants whose temporary parole status has not already expired must leave the country before April 24 or face removal.
“The CHNV program was an abuse of the parole authority,” Matt O’Brien, a former immigration judge and director of investigations at the Immigration Reform Law Institute, told news outlet Border Hawk in a recent interview.
“The government, for humanitarian purposes… can parole people into the country, and that is a legal fiction. Under the law, you are considered to be at the border, not in the United States, but you’re physically in the U.S,” O’Brien explained.
“Congress created ‘Temporary Protected Status,’ and what that essentially does is allows the government to give a temporary protection similar to asylum to people who are fleeing political struggle, civil wars, natural disasters. The problem is that it’s supposed to be temporary, and it’s supposed to end. And it’s also supposed to apply only to people who are in the United States when the event, the disaster, the civil war, whatever, took place.”
DHS confirmed O’Brien’s assertions, stating, “Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status, nor does it constitute an admission to the United States.”
“Once an alien is paroled into the United States, the parole allows the alien to stay temporarily in the United States for the duration of the parole period unless and until the parole expires or is otherwise terminated.”
The Biden administration was forced to temporarily suspend CHNV in 2024 after an internal audit found the program was rife with fraud and abuse.
Investigators discovered that applicants and sponsors were submitting false identification and personal information, using the same physical and IP addresses for thousands of applications, and even admitting that they planned to support approved foreign nationals via income earned from criminal activity.
Additionally, more than 80,000 applications were approved for citizens of non-CHNV countries.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/canadas-new-carney-govt-has-already-given-lgbtqiaap2s-groups-more-than-2-million-in-taxpayer-funding,Canada’s New Carney Gov’t Has Already Given LGBTQIAAP2S+ Groups More Than $2 Million in Taxpayer Funding,By Clare Marie Merkowsky | Lifesite,1 month ago,"OTTAWA, Ontario (LifeSiteNews) — Newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney has already spent over $2 million in taxpayer funding on LGBT groups.
According to March 21 government press releases, the Carney Liberals have directed a total of $2,118,000 to LGBT groups in Ontario and Quebec, continuing former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s legacy of throwing taxpayer dollars at radical groups.
“With this investment, we stand alongside 2SLGBTQI+ communities in Québec in addressing systemic barriers to equality,” Steven Guilbeault, minister of Canadian Culture and Identity, Parks Canada, and Quebec Lieutenant said.
“Together, we are working to challenge discrimination in all its forms,” he continued, apparently referring to opposition to gender confusion and homosexuality as “discrimination.”
The Quebec grants include $228,511 to a group “for their project Awareness and Engagement in Rural Communities that will address the barriers to equality faced by 2SLGBTQI+ communities.”
Another $241,743, will go to push “sexual health education” on gender-confused youth.
In Ontario, Egale Canada, a LGBT legal group known for challenging pro-family laws, will receive $148,800 to fund a “pride” summit.
Additionally, Intersex Canada will be given up to $874,285 “for their project Enhancing Support and Visibility for Intersex Individuals within the 2SLGBTQI+ and broader Canadian society to enhance support and visibility for intersex individuals within the 2SLGBTQI+ communities and broader Canadian society, with a focus on collaboration with Indigenous and racialized communities in Canada.”
Notably, Carney’s grants come just a week after LGBT groups slammed the prime minister for eliminating the position of minister for women and gender equality and youth in his cabinet.
This moved caused LGBT groups to question if Carney would fund the LGBT agenda, leading a coalition of 200 LGBT groups to send a letter to him.
Campaign Life Coalition’s Pete Baklinski told LifeSiteNews that “by funding these pro-LGBT groups, Carney is showing where his allegiance lies and that he will continue his predecessor’s advancement of sexual and gender ideologies during leadership.”
“Carney is signalling that he is no different than Trudeau when it comes to advancing ideologies that undermine marriage, assault the fundamental cell of society which is the family, and push ideologies on children that are both abusive and destructive,” he continued.
Carney’s funding of radical LGBT groups using Canadians’ hard-earned tax dollars follows a decade of the Trudeau government mercilessly pushing the LGBT agenda on Canadians.
In fact, records show that the Trudeau government spent $11.2 billion on so-called “gender”-based programs in foreign countries during Trudeau’s time in office.
It’s estimated that the billions spent on projects is a conservative number. As reported by investigative blogger Pat Maloney, Canada spent $108,594,964 on LGBT ideology in 2022, a number that swelled to $665,454,357 in 2023.
Maloney reported that in 2024 Canada gave LGBT activists $6,469,076 – an increase from the previous three years, in which $12,548,238 was spent in total.
As reported by LifeSiteNews last month, Trudeau used his final days as leader of the Liberal government to promise $41.5 million in taxpayer funds to advance 106 pro-LGBT projects “across Canada.”"

https://www.infowars.com/posts/hillary-clinton-calls-america-authoritarian-while-in-germany,Hillary Clinton Calls America ‘Authoritarian’ While in …Germany…,By Cindy Harper | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"During a speech in Berlin, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton decried what she framed as the rise of authoritarianism in the United States, seemingly oblivious to the very real speech suppression happening all around her.
Speaking on March 18 at the World Forum on the Future of Democracy, AI, Tech, and Humankind — with the phrase “New World Order” conspicuously glowing behind her — Clinton lashed out at President Donald Trump, labeling him one of the world’s “autocrats” and warning of the “peril” democracy faces globally.
However, she made no mention of the German government’s deeply entrenched speech policing practices, including armed dawn raids on individuals for controversial internet posts. Her condemnation of American governance rang especially hollow in the context of her surroundings — a nation known for prosecuting its citizens over memes and critical commentary.
“There’s no way to explain it away, autocracy is on the march and we now have a government in the United States that has thrown in its lot with the autocrats,” Clinton declared.
Her rhetoric then turned to tech platforms, criticizing their role in amplifying information she deemed harmful. Clinton said they “have given enormous power to the men who control the information flow in our world, who have all pledged allegiance to the continuation of algorithms that not only addict us but poison us with hatred and fear,” urging greater urgency in addressing these forces.
Her comments came just months after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a rollback in platform censorship and a distancing from ideologically driven fact-checking operations.
Clinton’s statements follow a pattern of demanding tighter controls on online discourse, previously arguing that without strict content moderation, “we lose total control.” That perspective aligns neatly with the European Union’s aggressive Digital Services Act, which effectively coerces tech companies into silencing viewpoints deemed undesirable by regulators. Germany, a leading voice in this EU push, has already demonstrated how far it’s willing to go.
You may recall, in a revealing segment by CBS’s 60 Minutes, German prosecutors openly discussed their country’s expansive social media surveillance system. The episode featured footage of a pre-dawn raid in which six armed officers entered a man’s home and seized his devices — his crime: sharing a meme.
Despite this backdrop, Clinton’s speech contained no reference to these real and ongoing violations of civil liberties. Instead, she directed her ire toward her own country, accusing the US government of aligning with autocrats while offering no critique of the censorship and state surveillance taking place in her host nation.
The hypocrisy couldn’t be more striking: while railing against alleged threats to democracy at home, Clinton ignored the authoritarian tactics in plain view abroad. Her silence on German censorship contrasted with her alarmist warnings about American politics, raises troubling questions about the true target of today’s calls for “democracy” — and whether it’s freedom of thought and expression that’s really under threat."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/is-the-eus-power-fading-as-it-finds-itself-increasingly-marginalized-by-events,Is The EU’s Power Fading as it Finds Itself Increasingly Marginalized by Events?,By Staff | Remix,1 month ago,"There are many signs that European Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen’s star is fading, according to the German newspaper Bild. Von der Leyen has practically become the face of the European Union in recent years, and has frequently been called “Europe’s most powerful woman.” Yet, as the bloc finds itself more and more marginalized by the actions of national governments in response to new developments, she seems to have less influence over events. Moreover, she is being increasingly ignored by her colleagues, claims Bild.
This has been highlighted most recently by the EU being shut out of the ongoing negotiations between the United States and Russia to end the Russo-Ukrainian War. Although Brussels has been completely pushed aside on this issue thus far, several of Europe’s national leaders have instead come to the fore in order to offer proposals regarding the way forward. This was made abundantly clear during the EU’s summit on a new massive aid package for the war-torn nation which was held last week.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán blocked a joint EU statement supporting Ukraine at Thursday's European Council summit, reaffirming his opposition to further military aid and economic burdens on Hungarian families. https://t.co/K5h3da7Geb
One such sign that the winds are shifting was that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not attend the summit in person. Although Zelensky made an appearance by video, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that his Ukrainian counterpart would instead come to Paris on Thursday of this week in order to discuss potential military commitments from Europe. Along with Zelensky’s high-profile visit to Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London earlier this month, this reinforces the notion that Kyiv now sees better opportunities in London and Paris than in Brussels.
Also at the summit, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez spoke on behalf of several EU member states when he demanded that the bloc appoint a special representative to deal with Ukrainian issues. Neither von der Leyen nor Kaja Kallas, who is the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, were mentioned for this role.
This snub was not lost on Kallas, who, according to Bild, lashed out at Sanchez by asking, “What am I here for?”

Kallas’ proposal to develop a new €40 billion military aid package for Ukraine was likewise criticized by several member states – not just Hungary this time – and now seems unlikely to be approved.
The essence of the problem is that the EU has no military power of its own. Although all EU member states have acknowledged that the time has come to increase defense preparedness, the only way this can be achieved is through the national governments. Thus, by calling for greater defense spending, Brussels is prioritizing an issue that it lacks the means to address, and is inadvertently highlighting its own weaknesses.
The EU’s increasingly apparent impotence is not limited to defense issues, however. The bloc has also so far failed to develop an effective response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe. It is rather Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni who has stepped up and is attempting to make use of her personal relationship with Donald Trump in an attempt to avert a trade war. Brussels, for its part, seems at a loss on how to develop a way of dealing with the new administration in Washington.
No less a person than Manfred Weber, the leader of the powerful European People’s Party (EPP) in the EU parliament, implicitly suggested that Ursula von der Leyen and Kaja Kallas may not be up to the task of dealing with the new problems that Europe is now facing. He recently suggested on German television that the EU’s citizens should be given the opportunity to elect a figure who will represent the entire EU in matters of foreign policy. Weber suggested that such a representative may be needed in order to decide the issue of whether Europe “will have a face, a voice, strength, and effectiveness.”
Apparently, von der Leyen’s face is no longer identical with Europe’s agenda, at least in Weber’s eyes.
Only time will tell if the Brussels bureaucrats can figure out a way of reasserting their importance on the international stage. Failing that, we may be approaching the moment when Europe’s national governments will take the initiative once again and reassert their own sovereignty – and perhaps Europe’s as well."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/senate-bill-threatens-section-230-and-online-free-speech,Senate Bill Threatens Section 230 and Online Free Speech,By Dan Frieth | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"A bipartisan push in the US Senate is targeting the foundation of online free expression, with Senators Dick Durbin and Lindsey Graham proposing legislation that would effectively put an expiration date on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act; a law widely credited with enabling the modern internet. If passed, the bill would cause Section 230 to lapse on January 1, 2027, unless Congress enacts a replacement.
The move is being touted as a way to force tech companies into negotiating new rules, but it’s a dangerous game of brinkmanship that risks gutting a core legal protection without a clear, workable alternative in place. Section 230 currently shields platforms from liability for content posted by users, allowing them to host a wide range of speech without being held legally responsible for every comment, post, or video.
Though framed as a bipartisan initiative, the motivations behind the bill are far from aligned. Democratic supporters such as Durbin and Senator Amy Klobuchar seek tighter content moderation and greater accountability for platforms spreading “harmful” or “misleading” speech.
Conversely, Republican proponents including Senators Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn — who have both demonstrated limited digital literacy — argue that Section 230 enables political bias and censorship. They seek to limit platforms’ ability to remove or moderate content they disagree with.
Despite these opposing aims, the bill is gaining momentum. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Richard Blumenthal, and Peter Welch have joined as co-sponsors, further blurring the lines between those aiming to curb harmful content and those pushing for unregulated political messaging. The unusual coalition raises concerns that lawmakers could dismantle foundational legal protection without agreeing on what should replace it.
By imposing a hard sunset date, the bill risks creating a regulatory vacuum if no consensus emerges in time.
This is not the first time Senator Graham has floated such a proposal. He introduced similar bills in 2020 and 2021, both with Republican co-sponsors. What’s new, and alarming, is the growing number of prominent Democrats lending bipartisan legitimacy to a plan that could unravel the internet’s legal framework."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/dems-explode-over-leak-of-secret-war-plans-in-signal-chat-heads-should-roll,Dems Explode Over Leak of Secret War Plans in Signal Chat: ‘Heads Should Roll’,By ZeroHedge,1 month ago,"Jeffrey Goldberg’s Monday bombshell piece in The Atlantic has been met with outrage among Congressional Democrats. In the article entitled The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans – which reproduces text messages among top Trump national security officials – Goldberg explains that “US national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen. I didn’t think it could be real. Then the bombs started falling.”
Among some 18 individuals listed as members of a Signal group that the journalist was ‘inadvertently’ invited to included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President Vance, national security adviser Michael Waltz, Secretary of State is Marco Antonio Rubio, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.
Golberg wrote, “What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.”
The journalist goes on to identify that it was Waltz who initially added him to the group, and that as the conversation unfolded, he was shocked and alarmed that all involved seemingly didn’t notice his name was listed in the group. We should note that all of this is also very bizarre because Goldberg is so obviously and rabidly anti-Trump.
The group and thread was initially engaged in a policy conversation on how to restore US and global shipping in the Red Sea, and the question potential public backlash if a bombing campaign on Yemen once again commenced…
But then, later on March 15 the conversation continued and actually turned to operational planning and then debriefing after execution of new bombing raids.
“According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time,” Goldberg recalled. “So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.”
In the wake of the Atlantic author revealing and publishing these messages and more on Monday, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes has offered confirmation on their authenticity.
“At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” he said in a Monday afternoon statement.
“The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security,” Hughes said.
“Send a message”: the below is among the most interesting moments from the Signal thread released by Goldberg:

Vance elsewhere is actually the only one that calls the war in Yemen “a mistake” that doesn’t advance US interests, but expresses willingness to go along with the consensus
This high-level confirmation has provoked outrage among Dems in Congress. Below are some examples via Axios:
But Republicans are by and large shrugging it off. Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, another Armed Services Committee member and former Air Force brigadier general, was cited in Axios as saying, “I’ve accidentally sent the wrong person a text. We all have.”
And more reaction…
Early reaction from Democratic senators https://t.co/Fbig0cmVbU pic.twitter.com/07It4HWKZs
Unfortunately, as yet none of the pushback and anger coming from Democrat leaders has focused on what we see as the real question and actual scandal–waging war in a foreign nation without Congressional approval— instead, all seem merely focused on the breach or leak aspect itself, involving ultra-sensitive national security conversations.
Here’s how one prominent geopolitics account on X summarized what’s been gleaned from the Signal chat leak..
So just to recap:
-They didn’t think the Houthis were a real threat
-They didn’t think Americans would understand the strikes
-They did it anyway, to “send a message”
-And they did it on an unencrypted chat app with a journalist inside the group You cannot make this up.
This is how wars are started in 2025.
Jeffrey Goldberg helped start a 20-year failed war based on lies about non-existent WMDs, while we’re on the topic of actually insane national security stories as opposed to fake hysteria from dead-end neocon war pimps. https://t.co/cNKVzeUFrY
The question remains why? Why would Goldberg (of all people) be added to such a sensitive group chat? Here’s one theory that makes sense."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/deep-state-actors-are-using-color-revolution-lawfare-tactics-to-thwart-trumps-agenda,Deep State Actors Are Using Color Revolution ‘Lawfare’ Tactics to Thwart Trump’s Agenda,By Stephen Kokx | Lifesite,1 month ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — Most Americans have never heard of Norm Eisen, but that hasn’t stopped him from taking a great deal of interest in their day-to-day lives. In fact, he’s so concerned with their wellbeing that he has worked tirelessly for more than 20 years to defend their country. At least that is what he claims he’s doing.
Last week, an Obama-appointed judge ruled that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency must stop its dismantling of the United States’ Agency for International Development (USAID). The judge, who has donated to multiple far-left causes, said the administration’s efforts “likely violated” the Constitution because they harmed the public interest.
Eisen is the lawyer who succeeded in getting the judge to rule on the case. He filed a lawsuit on behalf of 26 anonymous USAID employees who sued the Trump team over its efforts. This is not the first time Eisen has targeted Trump. He helped the House Judiciary Committee with its impeachment of the president in 2020 as well.
Norm Eisen is a liberal activist, not a defender of democracy
Eisen, who is Jewish, has ties to numerous left-wing organizations and politicians. He worked for the Anti-Defamation League in the 1980s, received funding from George Soros’ Open Society Foundations to start a “pro-democracy” group in 2003, and was President Barack Obama’s ambassador to the Czech Republic for 2011 until 2014. These days, Eisen serves as a legal analyst for CNN and chairs the misleadingly named State Democracy Defenders Fund. He also works at the Brookings Institute.
Eisen is an expert on an array of subjects, most especially lawfare and color revolutions. He wrote a book about that in 2019 called The Democracy Playbook, which lays out tactics that can help oust and/or cripple political leaders from carrying out their agenda. Here is a clip of him on MSNBC explaining how these sorts of operations work.
So much in this short segment but what Norm Eisen is doing is continuing the color revolution he has been running against Trump and MAGA since 2017. He is once again trying to overthrow the Trump administration via lawsuits, protests, etc. He files hundreds of lawsuits with… pic.twitter.com/GSvl8dHjA2
A Substack blog titled “Amuse on X” defines a color revolution as “a method of regime change that relies not on direct military intervention but on protests, media narratives, election disputes, and legal challenges to delegitimize and ultimately remove a leader.”
“The method was employed in Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution, Georgia’s Rose Revolution, and various other upheavals in Eastern Europe,” it adds.
“Amuse on X” also explains that in The Democracy Playbook, Eisen shows “how to use media coordination, civil unrest, and legal warfare to undermine incumbent.”
The blog proceeds to observe that “when viewed through the lens of domestic U.S. politics, the parallels between this playbook and the campaign to delegitimize Trump are striking.”
Trump pushes back against the Deep State’s lawfare
Eisen is currently implementing the “lawfare” or “legal warfare” stage in the Deep State’s plan to ensure Trump’s agenda is defeated. He and the mainstream media already tried (and failed at) the first stage in their coup attempt: to discredit Trump by branding him a racist, a Russian pawn, and an authoritarian. Big Tech also censored Trump, de-banked his supporters, and promoted the narrative that he was “dangerous for democracy.”
Given that none of those efforts worked (though they did almost get Trump killed) Eisen and his colleagues are now turning to the courts. Eisen’s USAID lawsuit against DOGE was just one of many efforts being taken against Trump right now. Trump himself has noted the brazenly political nature of the filings.
In a social media post, he exclaimed, “unlawful Nationwide Injunctions by Radical Left Judges could very well lead to the destruction of our Country!”
“Lawyers endlessly search the United States for these Judges, and file lawsuits as quickly as they find them,” he continued. “These Judges want to assume the Powers of the Presidency, without having to attain 80 Million Votes. They want all of the advantages with none of the risks.”
GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California introduced the “No Rogue Rulings Act” last month in an attempt to limit federal judges’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions, which under Trump have reached historic highs. Congressman Jim Jordan told Fox News that lawmakers will soon hold hearings on the matter.
Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller has said that “our objective, one way or another, is to make clear that the district courts of this country do not have the authority to direct the functions of the executive branch. Period.”
The Judicial Branch has become a weapon for leftists like Eisen
Last Tuesday, Trump singled out District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington as a “troublemaker and agitator” after he issued an order blocking deportation flights. Trump said Boasberg should be impeached by Congress.
“HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY,” Trump wrote.
Trump’s remarks elicited a rare response from U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.
“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,” he said.
But what Roberts’ statement conveniently forgets is that there are so many lawsuits being filed by Eisen and his allies that the court system cannot handle them all in a timely manner. And until they are settled (which may take years), these judge’s decrees will act as the law of the land, handcuffing Trump and preventing the swamp from being drained.
If Congress doesn’t do something about this growing threat, it is not hard to imagine that Trump may be tempted to ignore these judicial decisions. After all, it was he who posted a quote from Napolean on social media last month that said, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.”
If Trump does go that far (though it seems he won’t anytime soon), he would surely set a bold precedent and would be labeled an authoritarian and anti-democratic by Eisen and the left-wing media. But what is the alternative? Isn’t authoritarianism and tyranny precisely what Eisen and his cohorts are seeking to usher in right now with their sabotaging of Trump’s second term with their Color Revolution tactics? It is he and not Trump who seems to be the true threat to democracy."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/german-ruling-parties-want-to-ban-afd-as-soon-as-possible,German Ruling Parties Want to Ban AfD “As Soon As Possible”,By Zoltán Kottász | The European Conservative,1 month ago,"The economy is in crisis and the constant influx of migrants is threatening to destabilise society—yet the German mainstream parties’ main concern is their right-wing opposition Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
According to media reports, the left-wing Greens are intent on pushing through a motion in parliament to ban the AfD “as soon as possible”, and it seems that they have the support of all the other parties.
The idea of getting rid of the ruling elites’ most significant political opponent has been discussed for many years, and as the AfD gets stronger and stronger—it is the second largest formation in the parliament following February’s elections—they want to put a stop to its rise before the next elections in 2029.
The establishment parties have been using all kinds of undemocratic methods—backed by state institutions—to undermine AfD’s credibility: they are legally spying on the party, withholding state funds, and publishing false media reports.
The Greens are hoping that the new government, likely to be formed by the centre-right CDU/CSU alliance and the Social Democrats (SPD), will quickly appoint the new head of the domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV) so that it can designate the AfD as a “confirmed extremist” organisation.
This would be one step up from its current categorisation as a “suspected extremist organisation,” and it would allow the parliament to ask the constitutional court to rule on whether the party is unconstitutional.
Last year, a total of 113 MPs from the CDU/CSU, the SPD, the Greens, and the far-left Die Linke called for the parliament to discuss a motion to ban the AfD, claiming that the party “opposes central basic principles of the free democratic basic order.”
This year, the same parties are advocating the move. SPD’s parliamentary group leader Katja Mast said “the AfD poses a serious threat to democracy.” Sources from the CDU/CSU have indicated that they could agree to a ban procedure if the AfD is classified as “confirmed right-wing extremist.”
However, constitutional law experts believe the AfD does not meet the conditions required for a ban, because it does not fight the free democratic basic order “aggressively and combatively.”
AfD co-leader Alice Weidel has previously criticised attempts to ban her party, saying that these “reflect the undemocratic spirit of the competing parties.”"

Activist Judges Are Revealing Their True Colors by Siding with Foreign Gangs and Cartels,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"The pretty young waitress eyed me nervously. It took a second or three for her to speak. “Is, er, everything okay?”
For a moment, I wasn’t in a quaint little English market town, sipping a flat white and reading the paper. I had been transported to a God-forsaken place somewhere in Mexico: a dusty encampment, abandoned now, where hundreds of innocent people lost their lives; where desperate parents haunt the ruins, looking for any evidence they can find of their missing children, however small. A backpack. A scrap of clothing. A shoe…
And then I was back—and suddenly aware of just how hard I was frowning. I uncrumpled my face.
“Oh yes, reading some awful story… The coffee’s very good, by the way.”
The waitress did that strange non-smile thing Zoomer kids do, tinted with disgust, and went on her way.
This was a story I had first encountered last week. I didn’t pay too much attention to it then, but now I was reading about it in today’s international edition of The New York Times, where it graces the front page. I suppose the Toilet Paper of Record is still good for some things.
“A camp for killing in Mexico,” is the headline, beneath a picture of Irma Gonzalez, a mother who travelled to the camp to look for her son Jossel. She holds a picture of him. Her face is wracked with pain.
The camp is situated in La Estanzuela, in western Mexico, a small village close to Guadalajara, Jalisco State. That puts it firmly in the territory of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a group that has a reputation for unusual brutality, even among some of the most brutal, bloodthirsty criminals Satan has ever belched forth from his lair.
After the camp was discovered, police and local volunteers, including a group called “Searching Warriors of Jalisco,” moved in and began discovering “traces of unimaginable violence”:“cremation ovens, burned human remains and bone shards. Discarded personal items and hundreds of shoes.” Over 1500 personal items have been documented, suggesting that hundreds, maybe even more than a thousand, people met their end in this little slice of Hell in the Mexican sun.
The authorities have not identified any of those people yet or even given them a number, but they believe the camp was not just a killing place. It was also a training ground where initiates to the New Generation Cartel were made to torture and kill to prove their worth.
How many more sites there are like this, nobody knows. Locals claimed they knew nothing about it—a familiar refrain that has echoed through the atrocities of the last hundred years, from the bloodlands of Eastern Europe to the killing fields of South-East Asia.
I’m sure there are many, many more. Between 2018 and 2023, the Mexican government recorded 2,710 clandestine grave sites across the country, containing anything from the remains of a single person to the pathetic vestiges of dozens. One site discovered in the same week as the camp at La Estanzuela, a residential property in Guadalajara, yielded 13 bags of buried human bones.
The scale of the evil taking place in Mexico is staggering. And it is, without a doubt, evil in the true metaphysical sense.
The Trump admin has sought, quite rightly, to recognise this moral fact, and to use it to fight the groups perpetrating such evil—and others like them—all the more effectively, since they are killing tens of thousands of American citizens too.
On the one hand, the Trump admin has reached for the familiar language and legal framework of terrorism to peg the cartels as an existential threat rather than run-of-the-mill criminals. Seven Latin American cartels, including the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, have been added to the State Department’s list of terrorist organizations, opening the way to new, sharper methods of dealing with them, including the use of the full might of the American military. Naturally, this has worried the regime in Mexico, which is hand in glove with the cartels—as if that needed saying.
In our relativistic, disenchanted age, the label “terrorist” is perhaps the closest we come to calling anyone pure evil, beyond the pale, and making their elimination a moral imperative. A war on terrorism helped to launch a modern-day, generational crusade through Afghanistan and Iraq, costing trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives; although that’s precisely the kind of righteous conflict Donald Trump wants to avoid with his America First agenda. I agree: the War on Terror was a big bloody mess.
But used properly, and applied to the correct groups, “terrorist” has an exceptional power that should be wielded to its full extent.
On the other hand, President Trump has used a far older law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, to designate the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua as a hostile enemy within the territories of the United States. Tren de Aragua may not have extermination camps that we know of, but they’re just as odious as the Jalisco New Generation Cartel or any other cartel for that matter.
Murderers. Robbers. Drug dealers. Human traffickers. Pimps.
The Alien Enemies Act has been used sparingly over the last 200 years, but it has tremendous application. During the First and Second World Wars, it was used to round up and intern suspected foreign sympathisers, including Japanese citizens and Japanese-Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Empowered by the Alien Enemies Act, President Trump can arrest and deport people without the niceties of due process. Because they’re alien enemies, they can be cuffed, chucked on a plane and flown somewhere far away from the United States and left there—like El Salvador, for example.
And that’s exactly what happened within hours of President Trump invoking the Act last weekend: Two planes left the US carrying hundreds of Venezuela’s finest, lifted straight off America’s streets. One plane was bound for El Salvador, to deposit its cargo of human filth in President Bukele’s mega-latrine otherwise known as the Center for Terrorist Confinement (CECOT).
As soon as word broke that this was happening, an Obama judge, James Boasberg, issued an emergency injunction to stop the deportations. He even ordered the planes to turn around and come back. They didn’t, thankfully. The White House was unrepentant, and stuck to the line that it was not defying Judge Boasberg’s order and, in any case, what right does a district-court judge have to determine the foreign policy of the United States of America? The White House has promised to dispute the injunction in the Supreme Court.
To add to the admin’s well-documented problems with district judges, leakers have now released confidential information which The New York Times in its wisdom claims throws into doubt the basis for calling Tren de Aragua alien enemies at all. The information is an official assessment that the Maduro regime in Venezuela is not controlling Tren de Aragua in any direct sense; ergo, gang members aren’t actually agents of a foreign power.
That may be so, but frankly, a lot has changed in 200 years, including the nature of sovereign power. Criminal gangs wield power in their own countries in ways that make them rivals to the official state—states within a state if you will. According to the classic definition of the state given by the sociologist Max Weber, a state monopolizes the use of force within a given territory, but in Maduro’s Venezuela and Claudia Sheinbaum’s Mexico, that simply isn’t so. Criminal groups like Tren de Aragua maintain standing armies of thousands of troops who control significant portions of territory as if the official state didn’t even exist. They enforce their own forms of taxation and “justice,” however primitive and sordid the latter may be. They make billions of dollars. They rule.
When the case reaches the Supreme Court, which it will, I don’t think the Trump admin will have too much trouble convincing the Bench that Tren de Aragua fit the definition of alien enemies.
More broadly, though, the Trump administration should go all in on the language of moral struggle in its bid to defeat the foreign cartels and gangs that have preyed on the American people for far too long."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/a-new-world-order-with-european-values-the-unholy-union-of-globalism-and-anti-free-speech-measures,“A New World Order With European Values”: The Unholy Union of Globalism and Anti-Free Speech Measures,By Jonathan Turley | Jonathanturley.org,1 month ago,"Below is my column in the Hill on the recent World Forum where leaders gathered to declare “A New World Order With European Values.” Globalists gathered in Berlin to seek a new era based on European values that not only involve the expansion of transnational systems but the contraction of free speech rights.
Here is the column:
“A New World Order With European Values.” Emblazoned across banners and signs, those words met the participants at this week’s meeting of the World Forum in Berlin.
Each year, leaders, executives, journalists and academics gather to address the greatest threats facing humanity. This year, there was little doubt about what they view as the current threat: the resurgence of populism and free speech.
In fairness to the Forum, “a New World Order” likely sounds more ominous for some civil libertarians than intended. While the European Union is a transnational government stretching across 27 nations, the organizers were referring to a shift of values away from the United States to Europe.
As one of the few speakers at the forum who was calling for greater protections for free speech, I found it an unnerving message. Even putting aside the implications of the New World Order, the idea of building a world on today’s European values is alarming for free speech.
Free speech is in a free fall in Europe, with ever-expanding speech regulations and criminal prosecutions — including for having “toxic ideologies.”
The World Forum has a powerful sense of fraternity, even an intimacy, among leaders who see each other as a global elite — a cadre of enlightened minds protecting citizens from their own poor choices and habits.
There has long been a push for transnational governing systems, and European figures see an opportunity created by the conflict with President Trump. The European Union is the model for such a Pax Europaea or “European peace.”
The problem is that this vision for a new Holy Roman Empire lacks a Charlamagne. More importantly, it lacks public support.
The very notion of a “New World Order” is chilling to many who oppose the rise of a globalist class with the rise of transnational governance in the European Union and beyond.
This year, there is a sense of panic among Europe’s elite over the victory of Trump and the Republicans in the U.S., as well as nationalist and populist European movements.
For globalists, the late Tip O’Neill’s rule that “all politics is local” is anathema. The European Union is intended to transcend national identities and priorities in favor of an inspired transnational government managed by an expert elite.
The message was clear. The new world order would be based on European, not American, values. To rally the faithful to the cause, the organizers called upon two of the patron saints of the global elite: Bill and Hillary Clinton. President Clinton was even given an award as “leader of the century.”
The Clintons were clearly in their element. Speaker after speaker denounced Trump and the rise of what they called “autocrats” and “oligarchs.” The irony was crushing. The European Union is based on the oligarchy of a ruling elite. The World Forum even took time to celebrate billionaires from Bill Gates to George Soros for funding “open societies” and greater transnational powers.
The discussions focused on blunting the rise of far-right parties and stemming the flow of “disinformation” that fosters such dissent.
Outside of this rarefied environment, the Orwellian language would border on the humorous: protecting democracy from itself and limiting free speech to foster free speech.
Yet, one aspect of the forum was striking and refreshingly open. This year it became clear why transnational governance gravitates toward greater limits on free speech.
Of course, all of this must be done in the name of democracy and free speech.
There is a coded language that is now in vogue with the anti-free speech community. They never say the word “censorship.” They prefer “content moderation.” They do not call for limiting speech. Instead, they call for limiting “false,” “hateful” or “inciteful” speech.
As for the rise of opposing parties and figures, they are referred to as movements by “low-information voters” misled by disinformation. Of course, it is the government that will decide what are acceptable and unacceptable viewpoints.
That code was broken recently by Vice President JD Vance, who confronted our European allies in Munich to restore free speech. He stripped away the pretense and called out the censorship.
With the rise of populist groups, anti-immigration movements and critics of European governance, there is a palpable challenge to EU authority. In that environment, free speech can be viewed as destabilizing because it spreads dissent and falsehoods about these figures and their agenda. Thus far, “European peace” has come at the price of silencing many of those voices; achieving the pretense of consensus through coerced silence.
Transnational governance requires consent over a wide swath of territory. The means that the control or cooperation of media and social media is essential to maintaining the consent of the governed.
That is why free speech is in a tailspin in Europe, with ever-expanding speech regulations and criminal prosecutions.
Yet, it is difficult to get a free people to give up freedom. They have to be very afraid or very angry. One of the speakers was Maria A. Ressa, a journalist and Nobel laureate. I admire Ressa’s courage as a journalist but previously criticized her anti-free speech positions. Ressa has struck out against critics who have denounced her for allegedly antisemitic views. She has warned that the right is using free speech and declaring “I will say it now: ‘The fascists are coming.’”
At the forum, Ressa again called for the audience of “powerful leaders” to prevent lies and dangerous disinformation from spreading worldwide.
But the free speech movement has shown a surprising resilience in the last few years. First, Elon Musk bought Twitter and dismantled its censorship apparatus, restoring free speech to the social media platform. More recently, Mark Zuckerburg announced that Meta would also restore free speech protections on Facebook and other platforms.
In a shock to many, young Irish voters have been credited with killing a move to further expand the criminalization of speech to include “xenophobia” and the “public dissemination or distribution of tracts, pictures or other material” from viewpoints barred under the law.
Anti-free speech forces are gathering to push back on such trends. Indeed, Hillary Clinton has hardly been subtle about the dangers of free speech to the new world order. After Musk bought Twitter with the intention of restoring free speech protections, Clinton called upon the European Union to use its infamous Digital Services Act to make Musk censor her fellow Americans. She has also suggested arresting those spreading disinformation.
The European Union did precisely that by threatening Musk with confiscatory fines and even arrest unless he censored users. When Musk decided to interview Trump in this election, EU censors warned him that they would be watching for any disinformation.
For many citizens, European governance does not exactly look like a triumph over “oligarchs” and “autocrats.” Indeed, the EU looks pretty oligarchic with its massive bureaucracy guided by a global elite and “good” billionaires like Soros and Gates.
Citizens would be wise to look beyond the catchy themes and consider what Pax Europaea would truly mean to them. We have many shared values with our European allies. However, given the current laws limiting political speech, a “New World Order Based on European Values” is hardly an inviting prospect for those who believe in robust democratic and free speech values."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/lower-courts-issue-record-number-of-nationwide-injunctions-against-trump,Lower Courts Issue Record Number of Nationwide Injunctions against Trump,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Lower courts have issued a record number of nationwide injunctions against President Donald Trump in the first two months of his second term.
Fifteen injunctions frustrating various aspects of Trump’s agenda, from immigration reform to the eligibility of transgenders to serve in the military, have been issued.
By contrast, Joe Biden was subject to 14 in his four-year term, Barack Obama was subject to 12 in his two full terms—a record at the time—and George W. Bush was on the receiving end of six in his two terms.
During his first term, Trump was subject to a whopping 64 nationwide injunctions. At the current rate, President Trump could exceed that figure before the first year of this term is out.
The scope of district-court rulings has increased dramatically in recent years.. Generally, they were considered to apply only to the parties before them, but during the Obama administration, judges became more willing to apply their decisions at the national level, giving them the same scope as a Supreme Court ruling.
A notable judicial block was issued last weekend by an Obama-appointed judge.
President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of members of Tren de Aragua, but ithin hours of the President’s order being issued, Judges James Boasberg revoked it and ruled that deportation flights in the air, including a plan bound for El Salvador, must be turned around. The planes continued to their destinations, and the White House later issued a statement saying the flights were not in violation of the judge’s order and that it would be challenged in the Supreme Court.
Under the Alien Enemies Act, which was first issued in response to the threat of war with France, the President would have the power to allow non-citizens to be deported without the opportunity to appear before an immigration or federal judge.
Since 1798, the act has been used only three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II, when it was used to inter people of German, Italian and Japanese ancestry. Over 100,000 people with Japanese ancestry were interred in camps between 1941 and 1945, including American citizens.
Trump said on a number of occasions during the election campaign that he would use extraordinary powers to remove illegal aliens.
In his inaugural address, the President said the Alien Enemies Act would be a key part of his immigration policy.
“By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil,” he said.
“As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions.”"

Until now, however, they have always been optional. Now, the Belgian government has become yet another country to consider making them a requirement for their citizens to use social media.
All Belgian citizens over the age of 12 are required to have a national ID card. An eID is one option to fulfill this requirement. eID cards are already required in order to access certain government services online.
Belgium’s ID cards have been upgraded several times over the years. In 2020, the owner’s fingerprints became a mandatory inclusion on all such cards, for example.
It was announced earlier this month that citizens will soon be able to request digital versions of their ID cards that they can use on smartphones by Nov. 26. The new form of the ID will be accepted not only for identification purposes but also for online authentication, electronic signatures, and for travel between countries within the Schengen Zone.
Minister of the Interior Bernard Quintin stressed that the use of the digital ID will remain optional and that existing eID cards will still be valid.
Last week, however, it was reported by the Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws that the country’s new minister of public modernization, civil service, public enterprises, digitization, and buildings administration, Vanessa Matz, is considering making digital ID mandatory for using social media. The newspaper said that this suggestion appears in a policy note issued by Matz.
Caroline Gennez, who is the current Flemish minister of welfare, praised the idea. “It is becoming increasingly clear that social media has a negative impact on the well-being of our children and young people,” she said, as reported by Het Laatste Nieuws. “There they are confronted with completely unrealistic ideals about beauty, images of brutal violence and sexual abuse, fake news, and hate speech.”
“We need to intervene,” Gennez added. “In real life, we find it perfectly normal to set boundaries and introduce age restrictions to protect our children and young people. Why should it be different in the digital world?”
The minister did not address the obvious privacy issues that would arise from such legislation, despite the fact that a mandatory ID check would render online anonymity impossible for citizens of all ages.
Other European countries are considering making a digital ID mandatory for social media use as well. Last month France’s Minister of Justice Gérald Darmanin said that he will be looking into such a scheme for French Internet users in the coming weeks, as previously reported by Remix News."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/uk-mp-questions-whether-elon-musk-and-jd-vances-criticism-of-censorship-laws-may-constitute-foreign-interference,UK MP Questions Whether Elon Musk and JD Vance’s Criticism of Censorship Laws May Constitute “Foreign Interference”,By Cam Wakefield | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"At first glance, you might think Emily Darlington, Labour MP for Milton Keynes Central, had simply woken up on the wrong side of a particularly Orwellian bed. During a recent parliamentary inquisition — sorry, hearing — on social media, misinformation, and algorithms, Darlington floated an idea so alarmingly daft that even the Ministry of Truth would have blushed.
Her proposal? That public criticism of the UK’s speech laws by Elon Musk and US Vice President JD Vance might amount to “foreign interference.” That’s right. According to Darlington’s logic, if an American so much as questions the Online Safety Act, they might as well be stuffing ballot boxes or hacking government servers.
“Should we consider the current JD Vance, Elon Musk campaign against the UK — particularly against the government and the Prime Minister — and this push about free speech and the misrepresentation of our free speech laws as foreign interference?” she asked, in a sentence so brazenly bonkers it should come with its own government warning label.
This wasn’t a discussion about cyberattacks or deepfake election manipulation. No, Darlington was talking about speech. Dissent. Opinions. The sort of thing democracies used to be quite fond of.
Now, under the UK’s freshly unwrapped National Security Act 2023, “foreign interference” can land you 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine. It used to be that such punishments were reserved for actual enemies of the state — spies, saboteurs. Now, apparently, tweeting that Britain’s Online Safety Act is a bad idea could get you tossed into the Tower.
One would expect a room full of educated adults to respond to this with a firm, resounding no. Instead, we got caution, hedging, and a heavy whiff of complicity.
Dr. Eirliani Abdul Rahman, a Senior Fellow at Georgetown and one-time Twitter Trust and Safety Council member, refused to outright dismiss the idea that Musk or Vance might be causing harm.
“I think there is some grounds there that, because, for example, we can show there’s harm,” she said. “For example, with the riots, he said, Elon Musk said that this is, the civil war is inevitable… So in terms of, say, it’s not causal, but you can show by timestamps what happened…”
In other words: we can’t prove anything, but if you squint hard enough and ignore causality, it sort of looks incriminating. Like blaming a pothole on climate change because both happened on a Tuesday.
And then came the pièce de surveillance: “You should have every right to legislate it the way you want because you’re protecting your country, your own sovereignty.”
Ah yes, sovereignty. The catch-all cloak for every anti-democratic impulse. Want to censor Americans? Sovereignty. Want to monitor thought crimes with AI? Sovereignty. Want to classify criticism as sedition? You guessed it: sovereign self-care.
Enter Lyric Jain, CEO of the surveillance tech firm Logically, a company so deep in the government’s pockets it probably answers emails in MI5 lingo. Asked about Musk and Vance, Jain did the classic political sidestep; say nothing about specifics and pivot to platitudes about safety.
“Each country does have to make a determination on what its sensitivities are,” he said, before launching into a baffling sales pitch for behavioral surveillance. “Looking at behaviors can be quite technical. It can be quite clinical. We don’t need to get into, really, debates around freedom of expression.”
Speech is messy. Feelings get hurt. People shout. But behavior? Behavior can be measured. Modeled. Monetized.
Committee Chair Chi Onwurah tried to strike a more moderate tone. But in her attempt to balance the scales, she simply reinforced the core problem: a belief that speech online is no different than shouting in a town square.
“We also support the UK’s sovereignty as a sovereign nation and the laws that apply offline now apply online,” she said.
Who’s really interfering in the UK’s democratic processes? Is it Musk and Vance, tweeting criticisms of its free speech record? Or is it the British MPs and bureaucrats using taxpayer money to build a surveillance and speech regime that treats criticism as criminal?
Is it the foreigners with opinions, or the homegrown censors writing laws with more loopholes than a magician’s contract?
This latest stunt by Parliament is less about security and more about silencing. It’s a state quietly muttering, “We believe in freedom,” while reaching for the duct tape."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/us-russia-talks-begin-in-saudi-arabia,US-Russia Talks Begin in Saudi Arabia,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"US and Russian representatives have begun talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at bringing to an end the Russia-Ukraine war.
The US is seeking a separate maritime ceasefire deal to cover the Black Sea, before securing a wider agreement. A maritime ceasefire would allow a return to normal shipping on the Black Sea. Military operations in the area have been significantly reduced in recent months.
In 2022, a deal was struck to allow the export of precious Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea, but Russia withdrew from the agreement in 2023, claiming that the export of its own goods, including grain and fertilizer, was being hampered.
White House National Security adviser Mike Waltz said the talks will also consider the boundaries of a ceasefire, peacekeeping and the return of Ukrainian children taken into Russia during the war.
The American delegation in Riyadh is being led by Andrew Peek, a senior director at the White House National Security Council, and Michael Anton, a senior official in the State Department.
Russia, meanwhile, is represented by Grigory Karasin, a former diplomat and now chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Sergei Beseda, an advisor to the Federal Security Service.
President Donald Trump has said he is satisfied with the progress of talks so far. On Saturday, he said efforts to stop further escalation in the conflict were “somewhat under control.”
Although European powers are worried Putin will be emboldened by any US-mediated deal, special envoy Steve Witkoff, who met Putin in early March, played down such concerns.
“I just don’t see that he wants to take all of Europe. This is a much different situation than it was in World War Two,” Witkoff told Fox News.
“I feel that he wants peace.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/maryland-faces-first-amendment-battle-over-satirical-meme-account-targeting-governor-wes-moore,Maryland Faces First Amendment Battle Over Satirical Meme Account Targeting Governor Wes Moore,By Regina Morrison | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"There’s a certain poetic symmetry to the fact that in the year 2025 — when most political discourse feels like it was cobbled together from a Reddit thread and a group chat full of GIFs — one of the most hotly-debated free speech battles is being fought over a meme account named NoMoore.
The state of Maryland now finds itself at the epicenter of a First Amendment showdown.
The “villain” — is NoMoore, a pseudonymous social media account with a gift for satire and criticism, a talent for trolling, and a distinctly unfiltered opinion about Governor Wes Moore.
Among their many visual masterpieces: Moore at a presidential podium rebranded with the word “NOPE,” and a delightful image of hundred-dollar bills raining around him like it’s his birthday in a hedge fund. This, apparently, references a Baltimore Sun story on a $1 billion business tax proposal, though the vibe is more Scrooge McDuck than an economic policy brief.
Naturally, NoMoore has opinions. And they are not subtle.
The Maryland Democratic Party, perhaps tired of being meme’d into oblivion, has filed a formal complaint, arguing that NoMoore is not just a garden-variety critic, but potentially engaging in campaign activity—and thus, should be regulated under state election law.
This is where the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) enters stage left, the Constitution in one hand, and historical receipts in the other.
Aaron Terr, who speaks for FIRE with the calm fury of someone who’s read too much case law, said: “The First Amendment is at its strongest and most essential when protecting speech about public officials and public affairs.” He added, “Anonymous political speech has been a cornerstone of American democracy since the Federalist Papers.”
This is a question of whether anonymous criticism of public officials can survive in a world where everything is tracked, tagged, and litigated."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/ice-close-to-cutting-deal-with-irs-for-illegals-tax-data,ICE Close To Cutting Deal with IRS for Illegals’ Tax Data,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is close to making a deal with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to allow access to tax data provided by illegal immigrants.
According to The Washington Post, there have been “weeks of negotiations” thus far.
Under the draft agreement being considered, ICE would be able to submit names and addresses of suspected illegals to the IRS to cross-reference with confidential databases, sources confirmed.
Normally, tax information, including names and addresses, is considered confidential. Unlawfully disclosing tax information carries civil and criminal penalties.
“However, tax information may be shared with other federal law enforcement under certain, limited conditions — and typically with approval from a court,” The Post Notes.
“It would be unusual, if not unprecedented, for taxpayer privacy law exceptions to be used to justify cooperation with immigration enforcement.”
The requests would have to be submitted directly by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.
It’s estimated that around 50% of all illegal aliens in the US are paying taxes to the IRS. In 1999, the IRS encouraged illegal aliens to obtain individual taxpayer identification numbers and to pay tax, on the promise that their data would not be shared with immigration authorities. The move was part of a broader effort to ensure tax compliance among those who are ineligible for a social-security number."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-admin-cuts-funding-of-australian-universities-that-promote-gender-ideology,Trump Admin Cuts Funding of AUSTRALIAN Universities That Promote Gender Ideology,By Jonathon Van Maren | Lifesite,1 month ago,"(LifeSiteNews) — According to the Guardian, the U.S. government has cut off research funding at six Australian universities, including Monash University, Australian National University, the University of Melbourne, the University of Sydney, the University of South Wales, and the University of Western Australia. The reason? The Trump administration has informed researchers that the “temporary” funding pause was due to the new U.S. policy of avoiding “DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.”
These details emerged from a memo sent to one of the universities, which was viewed by the Guardian. It reads:
Financial assistance should be dedicated to advancing Administration priorities, focusing taxpayer dollars to advance a stronger and safer America, eliminating the financial burden of inflation for citizens, unleashing American energy and manufacturing, ending ‘wokeness’ and the weaponization of government, promoting efficiency in government, and Making America Healthy Again. The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve.
The funding pause comes while each project is vetted via a “comprehensive analysis” to ensure that the president’s executive orders – including those on gender ideology – are being complied with.
“In the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal,” the memo stated.
According to Universities Australia CEO Luke Sheehy, the funding pause indicates a “worrying trend” from the “biggest foreign partner we have” and that the U.S. “is looking like its becoming unreliable.” American funding for research projects amounted to over $400 million in 2024, which is “equivalent to around half the funding the federal [Australian] government provided in research grants via the Australian Research Council.”
Ironically, the Guardian reported that earlier this month, “the Trump administration was accused of “blatant foreign interference” in Australia’s universities after researchers who receive US funding were sent a questionnaire asking to confirm they aligned with US government interests.” In short, many researchers appear to feel that they are entitled to American funding regardless of whether the research being funded is in the American or, indeed, even the public interest. Some of the research, particularly medical research, clearly qualifies. But the idea that it is “foreign interference” for funders to ask for details on how those funds are being used exposes the extent to which the U.S. taxpayer has been viewed as a cash cow by international institutions.
The funding cuts aren’t just happening abroad. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has terminated over 500 research grants related to DEI and transgender ideology. Hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants, worth over $350 million, have been canceled, including, according to Fox News, projects focusing on “multilevel and multidimensional structural racism,” “gender-affirming therapy in mice,” and “microaggressions.” Other transgender research projects were cancelled as well.
The criticisms of these cuts, it must be noted, only flow in one direction. When Democrats appoint ideologically aligned personnel to essential posts and ensure that federal funding is directed towards their priorities, this is considered normal. Conversely, when Republicans do so, it is considered a violation of “norms.” In short, “norms” means that regardless of who holds office, progressive priorities continue unabated. The Trump administration appears to have had enough of this double standard."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/afd-snubbed-again-as-ex-communist-set-to-open-bundestag,AfD Snubbed Again as Ex-Communist Set to Open Bundestag,By Ildikó Bíró | The European Conservative,1 month ago,"Germany is still no country for old AfD men, especially not in the Bundestag.
Or so it seems when one looks at the events unfolding in the Berlin legislature regarding the position of the parliament’s Alterspräsident (president by right of age), a largely symbolic title that gives the holder the right to make the first speech of the new legislative session.
The oldest member of the federal parliament is AfD MP Alexander Gauland (84), who traditionally would be the one to open the newly elected Bundestag when it first convenes on March 25.
However, this will not be the case. The honour will instead be given to far-left Die Linke MP Gregor Gysi, aged 77, who was the leader of the ruling German Socialist Unity Party (SED) in the Communist German Democratic Republic, an effective one-party system.
The issue is not just that AfD has again been snubbed by the parliamentary consensus of the so-called centre-right, the liberals and the Left. This has been the official practice since AfD first entered parliament in 2017. At that time, Wilhelm von Gottberg was the oldest member, but the parliamentary majority changed the rules. Since then, Instead of using age—traditionally the criterion since 1949—the ranking member is now determined by length of service in the Bundestag..
As if this in itself were not sufficiently cringe, the person of Gysi is a major embarrassment, as Junge Freiheit reminds us. There is evidence that Gysi used to work for the feared and loathed East German secret police, the Stasi, as an “unofficial collaborator,” according to Stasi archival documents.
Despite his prominent political role in the GDR, Gysi seamlessly converted himself to a dedicated democrat after the system changed. He entered the Bundestag in 1990 for the SED-PDS (Socialist Unity Party and Die Linkespartei) coalition. In 2002, he resigned his seat to become Berlin’s Senator for Economic Affairs under Governing Mayor Klaus Wowereit (SPD). However, he resigned from that position shortly afterwards and obtained a seat in the Bundestag as the leading candidate of Die Linke in 2005, where he has been a member ever since.
As Junge Freiheit highlights, while the CDU/CSU has raised no objections to Gysi presiding over the first Bundestag session next week, the AfD is pondering a protest. According to reports, AfD is considering various ways to express their dissatisfaction next Tuesday.
This is the second time in the history of reunified Germany that a former member of the SED (now part of Die Linke) has become the oldest member of the Bundestag. But back in 2004 the CDU/CSU protested strongly against 81-year-old Stefan Heym, who was running on the PDS list only so that the party could nominate the German parliament’s Alterspräsident.
Despite the criticism, 21 years ago no one thought of changing the rules of procedure for this reason. The CDU/CSU representatives remained seated after Heym’s speech and remained silent, “which at the time was considered an unheard-of breach of the unwritten rules of parliament”, Junge Freiheit recalled, adding: “We’ll find out on Tuesday whether they’ll give Gysi a standing ovation this time.”
We’ll be watching."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/astroturfed-aoc-sanders-rally-full-of-professional-protestors,ASTROTURFED: AOC-Sanders Rally Full of Professional Protestors,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Sen. Bernie Sanders has claimed his “Fight Oligarchy” tour with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is drawing record crowds. But there’s just one problem—they packed full of professional protestors, according to detailed analysis of mobile-phone data.
Sanders posted a video on X of his rally in Denver, on Saturday.
“The video speaks for itself,” the Senator for Vermont wrote.
“34,000 people out in Denver. Largest political rally there since 2008. The message is clear: NO to authoritarianism. NO to oligarchy. NO to Trumpism. We are ready to fight back.”
Data analyst Tony Seruga had a different interpretation of the event and others on the “Fight Oligarchy” tour. He used an algorithm to analyze data from smartphones at the event, and came to the conclusion that the numbers were severely inflated and that many in attendance were professional protestors.
“Here we go again, there were 20,189 devices,” Seruga wrote on Twitter.
“Still a large crowd but not even close to the 30,000 quoted in Denver newspapers nor the 34,000 quoted by Bernie Sanders and AOC.
“84% of the devices present had attended 9 or more Kamala Harris rallies, antifa/blm, pro-Hamas, pro-Palestinian protests, 31% had attended over 20.”
Seruga went on to say that further detailed analysis showed that many of these individuals were linked to five activist groups—Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project, Troublemakers and the Democratic Socialists of America—all of which receive money from ActBlue and three of which are known to have received money from USAID.

Indivisible, which has also received millions of dollars from George Soros, have been in the news in recent days for their attempts to unseat Chuck Schumer as Senate Minority Leader.
Indivisible is now calling for Schumer to resign. It hosted an event on Saturday at which attendees will be encouraged to write “happy retirement” cards to the veteran politician.
The group’s co-executive director Ezra Levin announced the plan to oust Schumer shortly after the funding bill passed, with Schumer’s help: “Senator Schumer should step aside as leader. Every Democrat in the Senate should call for him to do so, and begin making plans for new leadership immediately.”
He added that the wrangling over the spending bill should have been used by Democrats as a “rare, precious point of leverage,” but “Schumer did the opposite. He led the charge to wave the white flag of surrender.”
The new campaign to oust Schumer drew pointed comment from a White House official, who spoke to The New York Post.
They said: “The Democrats will have an important question to answer in the coming days: Who actually leads their party — Schumer or Soros?”
Indivisible reckons it has 1,600 local chapters and employs at least 10 paid staffers. As The New York Post notes, it’s unclear to what extent they receive “orders” from their backers.
A representative of George Soros dismissed the claim that he leads the Democrat Part as “a daydream.”
Indivisible is also coordinating protests against Elon Musk and his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, including offering $200 payments to activists to take part in “Musk or us”-themed protests.
Protests against Musk have descended into violence in recent days, with attacks on Tesla dealerships, charging stations and vehicles.
On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced federal charges against three individuals involved in this violence, labelling the protests “domestic terrorism.”"

Sanders appeared on This Week with Jonathan Karl when he was asked whether he thought Trump had done anything right so far. Sanders replied, “Cracking down on fentanyl, making our borders stronger.”
“Look, nobody thinks illegal immigration is appropriate, and I happen to think we need comprehensive immigration reform, but I don’t think it’s appropriate for people to be coming across the border illegally.”
Sanders made clear, however, that he doesn’t agree with Trump’s mass-deportation policy in full, especially not the numbers Trump wants to deport.
“He wants to deport 20 million people who are in this country who are undocumented,” Sanders said.
“Well, you do that, you destroy the entire country.”
Sanders went on to quip that Trump’s “billionaire friends are not going to be picking the crops in California that feed us.”
“They are not going to work in meatpacking houses. That’s what undocumented people are doing.”
Sanders is currently travelling the nation with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as part of their “Fight Oligarchy” tour, which is directed  at Elon Musk and his efforts to cut government waste with the Department of Government Efficiency."

The interview began with Bartiromo asking AG Bondi about the Trump admin’s recent run-in with Obama-appointed Judge James Boasberg, who tried to bring a half to deportations of suspected Venezuelan gang members using the Alien Enemies Act.
“The Supreme Court will get involved,” Bondi said.
“This is an out-of-control judge. A Federal judge trying to control our entire foreign policy and he cannot do it.
“We are appealing. We will be in court Monday, again, we will win, we will prevail.”
Bondi continued by saying that members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which was targeted by President Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, are “not immigrants.”
“They are illegal aliens who are committing the most violent crimes you can imagine on Americans,” Bondi said.
Today, exclusively on @SundayFutures with @MariaBartiromo, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi @AGPamBondi spoke about U.S. Federal Judges blocking some of President Trump's Agenda.@FoxNews pic.twitter.com/IfH1yggPEK
Bartiromo then asked about the recent spate of attacks on Tesla dealerships, charging stations and vehicles, and AG Bondi had tough words for all those involved, including the three people who have already been arrested and charged for their part in the attacks.
“These aren’t vandals. These are Molotov cocktails. That could be a weapon of mass destruction,” Bondi said.
“The three people in custody right now, they will receive severe and swift consequences, and they are facing up to twenty years in prison. We are not negotiating these. We are not coming off these charges.
“This is domestic terrorism,” Bondi continued.
The Attorney General also warned Representative Jasmine Crockett over her calls for “attacks on Elon Musk.”
“Yet she turns and says, oh, I’m not calling for violence. Well, she is an elected public official and so she needs to tread very carefully because nothing will happen to Elon Musk,” Bondi said.
“Domestic terrorism is going to come to a stop in our country,”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-many-disguises-of-socialism,The Many Disguises of Socialism,By Wanjiru Njoya | Mises Institute,1 month ago,"In his book, Socialism, Ludwig von Mises warns about the threat posed by socialism to peaceful co-existence and to Western civilization. He highlights the “disastrous wars and revolutions, heinous mass murders and frightful catastrophes” that have been caused by socialist policies, a warning that was also sounded by Friedrich von Hayek in The Road to Serfdom.
Mises goes beyond warning about the destructive nature of socialism, going further to draw attention to what he considers “the main issue,” which he describes as “the desperate struggle of lovers of freedom, prosperity and civilization against the rising tide of totalitarian barbarism.” Socialism is destructive in itself, but more than that it fuels the “rising tide of totalitarian barbarism” through its many disguises. There is a persistent belief that socialism is an ideal worth pursuing if we could only work out just the right form that it should take. Part of Mises’s goal in Socialism is to explain the dangers of socialism and help readers to recognize socialism when they see it.
Among its many disguises, socialism cloaks itself in the mantle of ideals that many people value such as the ideals of justice and equality before the law. Speaking of the anthropomorphism that ascribes “justice” to the distribution of wealth that results from market interactions, Hayek in his essay “‘Social’ or Distributive Justice,” warns:
I believe that “social justice” will ultimately be recognized as a will-o’-the-wisp which has lured men to abandon many of the values which in the past have inspired the development of civilization.
Thus, the problem is not simply that many people are beguiled by socialism, but that this causes them to abandon the ideals which civilized societies once held. As Hayek writes in “The Origins and Effects of Our Morals”:
[I]t is no exaggeration to say that the central aim of socialism is to discredit those traditional morals which keep us alive.
The traditional principles of morality to which he refers, such as the concept of honesty, are associated with the cultural values of classical liberalism which are now under threat: freedom of contract, freedom of association, free speech, and the right to private property. By undermining these ideals, socialism undermines the very foundations of civilization.
In the contemporary context, the primary disguise of socialism is the ideal of equality. Thomas Sowell describes the tenets of socialism as “make believe equality”—the idea that we should create laws and policies that ensure we are, in fact, all equal—even though, as Murray Rothbard explains in Egalitarianism as a Revolt against Nature, seeking to make all people, in fact, equal would be a sinister Procrustean goal. As Sowell famously said, “No one is equal to anything. Even the same man is not equal to himself on different days.” Yet the concept of “equality” now provides cover for many socialist policies. Most notorious is the concept of “diversity, equity, and inclusion.” DEI is based on theories of racial polylogism, which are explicated by reference to explicitly Marxist concepts. Indeed, this is one of the main methods by which Marxist ideals now proliferate—by being subsumed within the intellectual foundations of the latest iteration of socialism.
In Socialism, Mises observes that the central doctrines of Marxism are widely accepted and used as the foundation for all manner of socialist ideologies. Mises explains: “At no point in history has a doctrine found such immediate and complete acceptance as that contained in [Marxism]. The magnitude and persistence of its success is commonly underestimated. This is due to the habit of applying the term Marxist exclusively to formal members of one or other of the self-styled Marxist parties, who are pledged to uphold word for word the doctrines of Marx and Engels” while overlooking the extent to which its core constructs have been used as the foundation for “equality” policies.
Equality policies often substitute the notion of racial conflict for Marxist notions of class conflict and disguise their Marxist roots by adopting words like “diversity, equity and inclusiveness” or the new terminology of “community, opportunity and belonging.” To illustrate the influence of Marxist thought on racial equality debates, a good example is one of the doctrines of Marxism described by Mises:
[Marxism] denied that Logic is universally valid for all mankind and for all ages…. Thought, it stated, was determined by the class of the thinkers; was in fact an “ideological superstructure” of their class interests. The type of reasoning which had refuted the socialist idea was “revealed” as “bourgeois” reasoning, an apology for Capitalism.
Following the same reasoning, critical race theories deny that logic is universally valid for all races. They substitute “race” for “class” directly mapping racial concerns onto Marxist class concerns. They declare that anything written by white people is about “white interests,” is based on “white reasoning,” and is, in fact, an apology for colonialism.
Just as Marxism claims “class conditions thought,” so they argue that race conditions thought. They say economics is “white,” having been “created” by white economists, therefore, black economists such as Thomas Sowell or Walter E. Williams are merely reflecting “white” economics and ought, therefore, to be disregarded by black readers. Their argument is that economics is based on “racist” reasoning which does not apply when racial minorities or their antiracist “allies” are in charge. Any counter arguments can, conveniently, be dismissed as “whiteness.” It follows that, just as—according to Marxism—the interests of the working class can never be unified with the interests of the bourgeoisie, so the interests of white and black can never be unified.
In thinking of strategies to unmask the many disguises of socialism, we should bear in mind Mises’s caution that we cannot oppose socialism by adopting all the same dogmas as the socialists. Doing so amounts to falling into the socialist trap. A good example of this trap is the attempt to challenge DEI by doing DEI “better,” or opposing the anti-discrimination principle by suggesting new or refined grounds for enforcing the anti-discrimination principle.
For example, some opponents of DEI argue that it is wrong to force an employer to hire anyone based on race, so their solution is to force the employer to hire based on merit. They fail to notice that, in both cases, the use of force has been invoked against the employer, or perhaps they think that as long as we cannot escape the use of state force it would be just as well to deploy that force in a more meritorious direction. They have forgotten the non-aggression standard that the use of state force is wrong. However unattainable that standard may now seem, especially as the size of the government workforce continues to grow, it should still be borne in mind as the goal towards which “lovers of freedom, prosperity and civilization,” as Mises put it, should continually strive.
Murray Rothbard also addresses this issue in For a New Liberty. He asks: “How can we get from here to there, from our current State-ridden and imperfect world to the great goal of liberty?”
He discusses the strategies adopted by Marxists, not, of course, because he agrees in any way with Marxist goals but “because [Marxists] have been thinking about strategy for radical social change longer than any group.” When an ideology becomes as pervasive as socialism now is, it cannot be countered without giving serious thought to the long term implications of immediate policy proposals."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/peter-schiff-the-fed-is-ignoring-the-inflation-crisis,Peter Schiff: The Fed is Ignoring the Inflation Crisis,By SchiffGold,1 month ago,"In his latest podcast, Peter tackles the Fed’s recent decision to hold rates steady, criticizing Chair Jerome Powell for downplaying inflation risks and questioning the central bank’s logic behind future rate cuts. He also addresses the patterns of foreign central banks ditching U.S. Treasuries for gold, rising national debt burdens, and the dangerous misconception that all employment is equally productive.
Peter first analyzes the Fed’s decision to significantly slow down balance sheet reduction. He sees a clear pivot back toward quantitative easing:
Of course, the Fed should continue to shrink the balance sheet. The balance sheet is much too large. The fact that the Fed is dramatically slowing the rate of reduction, I think it’s just another step in the direction of a return to all out quantitative easing. I think that’s coming. The reason I think that this is a very dovish move by the Fed has to do with the way in which Powell really dismissed the pickup in inflation as if it’s really no big deal or even denying that it exists and showing that the Fed is still focused on these rate cuts, when in reality they should be hiking rates.
Peter elaborates on the critical difference between rising prices and inflation, cautioning against a narrow focus on CPI statistics. He stresses that true inflation comes from monetary expansion and increasing credit availability, both of which continue to ramp up:
Prices going up are a result of inflation. You can’t just focus on prices. Again, it’s like looking in the rearview mirror. You’re going to get into an accident. It’s the money supply expanding, which is continuing, and credit. Inflation is not just the expansion of the money supply; it’s an expansion of credit because credit can be used as money. You can buy stuff with credit even if you don’t have any money. And so the more credit there is in the economy, the more upward pressure there is on prices.
According to Peter, Powell and the Fed are setting themselves up for future failure by insisting on waiting for inflation to prove permanent before acting. He points out that such a delayed reaction will only exacerbate the inflation issue, noting how the Fed is potentially using tariffs as a scapegoat to deflect blame from its own failed monetary strategies:
I mean, I know this was going to happen: anything that happens, he’s going to say, ‘Well, I guess it was the tariffs.’ That’s how the Fed is going to deflect the blame from its own monetary policies and put them onto the tariffs. That’s another reason why Trump shouldn’t have done it, because it gives the Fed an excuse and it lets them off the hook because it’s very easy to blame the inflation on tariffs. But if Powell does what he says, just really waits until he can figure out whether the price increases are transitory or whether it’s more permanent, by the time he figures that out, it’s much too late to do anything about it.
Peter concludes by underscoring Powell’s troubling disregard for the distinction between productive jobs in the private sector versus unproductive government employment. He makes clear that treating these different forms of employment equally reveals a fundamental lack of economic insight and only worsens inflationary pressures:
Somebody asked Powell, ‘Are you worried about this composition that too many of the jobs that we’ve created are these government jobs?’ Powell basically said no. Powell said that the Fed doesn’t distinguish what kind of job it is: jobs are jobs. He says that from our standpoint, employment is employment; it doesn’t matter where the job is coming from and it doesn’t matter what the person is doing. As far as the Fed is concerned, all jobs are created equal, which is a bunch of nonsense. Does he really believe that? Is he really that ignorant about basic economics? Of course, all jobs are not equal, because a productive private sector job is worth a lot more to the economy than a non-productive government job."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/max-volume-if-threat-detected-tesla-adds-new-sentry-mode-security-feature-to-deter-unhinged-leftist-attacks,“Max Volume If Threat Detected”: Tesla Adds New Sentry Mode Security Feature To Deter Unhinged Leftist Attacks,By ZeroHedge,1 month ago,"The Tesla-focused blog Not a Tesla App reported that following last week’s Q1 2025 All-Hands Meeting, Tesla quietly updated the Cybertruck’s webpage to include a new Sentry Mode feature that plays loud music as a deterrent against unhinged individuals—particularly Democrats—attempting to damage the vehicles.
The new feature appeared on the lower half of Cybertruck’s About page. The text reveals Sentry Mode will soon be able to play loud music when it’s triggered:
Enable Sentry Mode to monitor your unattended vehicle or trailer, and automatically activate the alarm, increase the touchscreen brightness, and play music at max volume if a threat is detected.
Not a Tesla App provided more color on this new feature set to be rolled out shortly:
This latest change appears to build on that, leveraging the Cybertruck’s Superhorn and external speaker, which can already play music when parked via the Boombox feature. We suspect this feature won’t rely on the internal speakers, as the music would have to be extremely loud in order to be heard outside the car.
And given how loud the Superhorn and external speakers are—powerful enough to function as a proper horn—this could be an effective deterrent for vandals or intruders.
As some users have pointed out, Tesla does have a feature that Sentry Mode will play Bach on the internal speakers if the alarm is triggered while Sentry Mode is activated. It’s not completely clear whether that’s what Tesla was referring to on the new Cybertruck page, but it seems like it could be something different.
The new feature comes as crazed Democrats have targeted Tesla vehicles and firebombed Tesla showrooms, service centers, and Supercharger networks.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/former-squad-rep-cori-bushs-husband-charged-with-covid-relief-fraud,Former Squad Rep Cori Bush’s Husband Charged With Covid Relief Fraud,By Zero Hedge,1 month ago,"The husband of former “Squad” member and Missouri Congresswoman Cori Bush has been charged with defrauding the US government out of $20,000 in payments under the Covid-era Paycheck Protection (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) programs.
In an indictment filed in DC federal court, 46-year-old Cortney Merritts is accused of filing fraudulent applications for Covid-relief money and using the proceeds for his “personal benefit and enjoyment.” Prosecutors say that, on April 3, 2020, Merritts filed an application with the Small Business Administration for an EIDL in the name of a sole proprietorship, Vetted Courier and Logistics. He claimed the business had six employees and gross revenues of $32,000 in the year leading up to the Covid disaster declaration.
One day after receiving cash for that application, Merritt raced back to the federal trough, submitted another application for an EIDL loan and an advance — this time for a sole proprietorship under his personal name. Prosecutors say he falsely claimed this business had 10 employees and gross revenues of $53,000 in the 12 months preceding the Covid disaster. That application was declined because the information on the application was nearly identical to what he put on the first one. Merritt also tapped the widely-abused PPP program for a business he claimed to have opened in 2020, saying it had $128,000 in annual revenue. The government says those statements were false.
“This case is being investigated by the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of the Inspector General and the FBI Washington Field Office,” said the DOJ in a press release.  Merritts’ attorney says his client will plead not guilty. “We look forward to litigating this case in the courtroom,” Justin Gelfand of Margulis Gelfand DiRuzzo & Lambson told the Washington Post. We look forward to watching that too.

While she hasn’t been charged in this matter, Bush was previously embroiled in controversy and federal investigations relating to Merritt. Last year, the DOJ, Federal Election Commission and House Committee on Ethics all launched probes into allegations that Bush had misused Congressional funds by hiring Merritt to provide “security services” for her. Part of the controversy sprang from Merritt’s reported lack of security licenses in either Bush’s congressional district or the Washington DC area. The ethics complaint was dismissed; the status of the FEC and DOJ investigations is not known.
Bush was run out of office in 2024. It wasn’t her Marxism that did her in, but rather her criticism of Israel. Pro-Israel organizations threw millions of dollars behind an Israel-catering Democrat who successfully challenged her in the primary. “Cori Bush has been one of the most hostile critics of Israel since she came to Congress in 2021 and has actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship,” AIPAC told Associated Press. The AIPAC-affiliated but opaquely-named United Democracy Project spent almost $9 million to ensure that Bush was ousted. Democratic Majority for Israel chipped in almost $500,000.
Merritts is just the latest of many who are suddenly finding cops at their door almost five years after their fraudulent Covid-era acts:

https://www.infowars.com/posts/global-watchdog-claims-us-could-lose-democracy-status-because-of-trump,Global Watchdog Claims US Could Lose “Democracy Status” Because Of Trump,By Zero Hedge,1 month ago,"Let’s clarify one important issue up front:  Progressives do not believe in democracy.  They use the term frequently as a Pavlovian bell to whip useful idiot activists into a frothing frenzy, but there is no measure by which they have proven they care about Democracy or even know what it is.  And since this is the case, we have to ask – What do they really mean when they use the word?
If we consider the traditional definition of “majority rule”, then this is clearly not what leftists support.  That is to say, they only support majority rule when they represent the majority.  In the case of the 2024 election Donald Trump won both the Electoral College and the popular vote, which means he does in fact represent the majority.  Yet, Democrats and their ilk continue to accuse him of being a “threat to democracy”, and they have openly and actively refused to accept the will of the people.
Therefore, one can only conclude that leftists want something other than democracy.  And, given their track record over the last four years in which they attempted mass online censorship and a global authoritarian coup using pandemic hysteria as a weapon, there is little doubt who the true autocrats really are.
The hypocrisy is overwhelming when these same people accuse conservatives of authoritarianism.
Such is the case in light of a newly released annual report on the global state of democracy published by a “global watchdog” called the Varieties of Democracy project, or V-Dem.  Headed by Staffan Lindberg of Sweden’s University of Gothenburg, the group boasts that it is one of the largest social science data collection projects on democracy in the world.  V-Dem’s report covers the state of democracy around the world up until the end of 2024.  However, Lindberg provided special notes on Donald Trump, claiming that the President could lead America to lose its democracy status by 2026.
“If it continues like this, the United States will not score as a democracy when we release [next year’s] data…If it continues like this, democracy [there] will not last another six months.”
Lindberg says Trump is doing many of the same things as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Narendra Modi in India — only faster.
“It’s the pace…He’s trying to do in a few months what it took them eight to 10 years to achieve.… It’s very dire.”
Canada’s state funded CBC (the CBC receives almost 70% of its funding from the Canadian government) was quick to jump on the V-Dem bandwagon in a rambling and mostly biased expose on the report and its implications for the Trump Administration.
“The latest report still ranks the U.S. as a “Liberal Democracy,” the highest of five tiers, one higher than Canada, which is classified as an “Electoral Democracy.”
The report adds an important caveat: this year’s version does not include events in 2025, meaning it does not cover the start of Donald Trump’s latest presidential term.  But it refers to ongoing events in the U.S. as unprecedented, mentioning Trump pardoning 1,500 criminals who supported him; firing independent agency watchdogs without process; purging apolitical police and military brass; ignoring laws; and his unilaterally deleting federal programs, and even a whole organization, created by U.S. Congress.”
V-Dem warns that the US may fall from the graces of their democracy list into the frightful category to “electoral autocracy”.  Meaning, people are still basically free to do all the things one does in a democracy, but the threat of retribution or retaliation is present.  In other words, it’s a lot like life in the US under the Biden Administration.
It’s hard to see how Trump’s audits of the federal government and his cuts to government waste and NGO fraud are a “threat to democracy” unless you view democracy as progressive authoritarian boondoggle.  Biden pardoned his criminal son and most of his family retroactively back to 2014 under suspicious circumstances, with some insiders claiming that Biden’s unelected wife and son were running the White House behind the scenes while Biden was turning into a vegetable.
We don’t hear the leftists complaining about that act of autocracy.  Trump pardoning people who were politically railroaded and thrown in prison for up to 20 years for protesting is nothing in comparison.
It’s also incredibly disingenuous to label the military brass under Biden as “apolitical” when they were entirely political and devout proponents of DEI.
Finally, Trump’s federal cuts are exactly what he campaigned on and what the American people voted for him to do.  Democrats want to call the will of the people “autocracy”, but this only holds weight with low intelligence legacy journalists that simply don’t want to accept that they are in the minority.
It should be mentioned that the V-Dem Project gets it’s funding from a variety of interesting sources, including The World Bank, George Soros’ Open Society Foundation, and, yes, you guessed it – USAID.
So, it’s not surprising that Trump’s cuts to agencies that money launder for leftist institutions have triggered V-Dem into a hostile response.  Trump is threatening their money train.  The new Administration is catching so much flak because they’re directly over the target."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/bookmakers-see-20-chance-of-third-trump-term-report,Bookmakers See 20% Chance of Third Trump Term – Report,By RT,1 month ago,"Bookmakers view US President Donald Trump as one of the top picks to win the 2028 election, despite the two-term constitutional limit, Newsweek has reported, citing the latest betting data.
According to an article published on Saturday, British betting company William Hill has listed Trump as a favorite to win the next presidential race with 5/1 odds, giving him a 16.7% chance of securing what would be his third term in office.
The leading contender is Vice President J.D. Vance, with 5/2 odds (28.6%). Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., is next in line with 9/1 odds (10%). Democratic governors Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gavin Newsom of California are also in the top five, with 9/1 and 10/1 odds, respectively.
Trump won the 2024 election by a wide margin against Democratic candidate and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, becoming the second president in US history to serve two non-consecutive terms.
The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” The amendment was introduced after Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term presidency.
Trump has repeatedly joked that he may end up serving more than two terms. Former White House strategist Steve Bannon has claimed recently that Trump will run again in 2028. In an interview with journalist Chris Cuomo, Bannon said his team is working to find ways Trump could bypass the restrictions laid out in the Constitution.
A William Hill spokesperson told Newsweek that repealing the 22nd Amendment would be a difficult process, but Trump might attempt it due to his support in Congress.
“Trump ally Steve Bannon predicted this week that the POTUS would run for a third term and win, so there’s certainly a feeling that it could be possible, and we’re not taking any chances as we’ve installed him in our next president market at 5/1, behind only favorite J.D. Vance,” the spokesperson added.
Amendments to the Constitution must be approved by a 2/3 majority in both the House and Senate and then ratified by 3/4 of the states."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-pushes-for-sanctions-against-lawyers-frustrating-immigration-agenda,Trump Pushes for Sanctions against Lawyers Frustrating Immigration Agenda,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"President Donald Trump has threatened new sanctions against lawyers and legal firms that attempt to frustrate his immigration agenda.
On Friday, the President sent a memorandum to Attorney General Pam Bondi, stating that lawyers were driving “rampant fraud and meritless claims” and directing her to seek professional misconduct proceedings against them.
Trump’s memorandum also targeted law firms that sue the Trump administration in “baseless partisan lawsuits.” The President asked AG Bondi to refer the names of such firms to the White House, so they can have their security clearances revoked and be stripped of federal contracts.
The Trump administration has been hit with over 100 lawsuits challenging the President’s Executive Orders and actions on immigration, transgender rights and a number of other issues since 20 January. Advocacy groups and at least a dozen law firms are behind the suits.
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said “President Trump is delivering on his promise to ensure the judicial system is no longer weaponized against the American people.”
Earlier this month, President Trump issued Executive Orders against law firms Perkins Coie and Paul Weiss, revoking their security clearances and restricting access to federal buildings, officials and contracts. Last month, the President did the same for lawyers at Covington and Burling.
On Thursday, Paul Weiss made a deal with the Trump administration to lift the Executive Order against it. The firm pledged $40 million in free legal work to support a number of the administration’s causes."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/hegseth-slams-activist-judge-for-halting-military-transgender-ban,Hegseth Slams Activist Judge for Halting Military Transgender Ban,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth slammed an activist judge who has sought to reverse President Trump’s ban on transgenders serving in the military, claiming she exceeded her authority as a judge.
US District Judge Ana Reyes, who was appointed by Joe Biden, ruled that Trump’s Executive Order of 27 January, in which he targeted the legal rights of transgenders, was a violation of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.
In a post on X, Secretary Hegseth mocked Reyes, calling her “Commander Reyes” and saying she should take a more active role in military decision-making.
“Since ‘Judge’ Reyes is now a top military planner, she/they can report to Fort Benning at 0600 to instruct our Army Rangers on how to execute High Value Target Raids,” Hegseth wrote.
“After that, Commander Reyes can dispatch to Fort Bragg to train our Green Berets on counterinsurgency warfare.”
The DoD declared on 11 February that it would no longer allow transgenders to join in the military and would stop performing or funding gender transition procedures for service members. Later last month, the military said it would begin to expel serving transgender personnel.
The plaintiffs in the case before Judge Reyes argue that the President’s order of 27 January is illegal, citing a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that discrimination against transgenders in the workplace is illegal sex discrimination.
Lawyers for the Trump admin have countered by arguing that the military is allowed to prohibit individuals with conditions that make them unfit for service, including eating disorders and mental conditions.
The clash with Judge Reyes is part of a broader ongoing conflict with activist judges who are seeking to stifle President Trump’s agenda, especially his campaign promise of “the largest mass deportation operation in American history.”
On Tuesday, President Trump called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg, who issued an order preventing the deportation of Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/justice-department-to-probe-intel-leaks-about-gang-deportation-efforts,Justice Department To Probe Intel Leaks About Gang Deportation Efforts,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into a leak of classified information about Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by the Trump administration for expedited deportation under the Alien Enemies Act.
In a statement issued on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department is investigating the “selective leak of inaccurate, but nevertheless classified” information to The New York Times.
President Trump has classified Tren de Aragua as alien enemies operating in concert with a foreign government, using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. The Act, invoked only a handful of times in US history, allows for the immediate arrest and deportation of members of the gang without standard due process.
However, on Thursday The New York Times reported a leaked intelligence document that challenges the legal basis for Trump’s designation of the gang as alien enemies.
The document clams with “moderate confidence” that Tren de Aragua are not operating under the direction of the Venezuelan government.
Deputy AG Blanche strongly condemned the leak and described it as a deliberate effort by elements of the Deep State to undermine President Trump’s deportation agenda.
“We will not tolerate politically motivated efforts by the Deep State to undercut President Trump’s agenda by leaking false information onto the pages of their allies at the New York Times,” Blanche said.
“The Alien Enemies Proclamation is supported by fact, law, and common sense, which we will establish in court and then expel the TDA [Tren de Aragua] terrorists from this country.”
The New York Times defended its reporting in a statement.
“Freedom of the press is a cornerstone of democracy and critical for citizens to hold their government accountable. Leak investigations are meant to chill communications between journalists and sources, and undermine the ability of a free press to bring out vital information that may otherwise be hidden,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“Our story raised fundamental questions about whether the American people were getting a straight story about an important national security issue. That is precisely what journalists should be doing, no matter which party is in office.”
Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 68 members of violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua this week, according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security.
“In less than 100 days, the Trump Administration has arrested 394 members of the Tren De Aragua—a vicious gang known for human trafficking, kidnapping, drug trafficking, and other heinous acts terrorizing American communities,” the report states.
Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in the Venezuelan state of Aragua before spreading across Latin America and into the US, was designated a terrorist organization by President Trump last month.
“This has allowed a whole of government approach to dismantle this criminal terrorist gang,” the agency said.
“Members of this vicious terrorist gang are responsible for the brutal assault and murder of nursing student Laken Riley and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.”"

Kennedy Jr believes children should not be using cellphones in schools, claiming they affect children’s health and their academic performance.
Speaking to Fox and Friends, Secretary Kennedy said cell phones “produce electric, magnetic radiation, which has been shown to do neurological damage to kids when it’s around them all day, and to cause cellular damage and even cancer.”
Kennedy went on to outline a variety of harms associated with excessive cellphone use by children and teenagers.
“Cell phone use and social media use on the cell phone has been directly connected with depression, with poor performance in schools, with suicidal ideation, with substance abuse. And you know … other countries that have done this [banned cellphones in schools]. The states that are doing this have found that it is a much healthier environment when kids are not using cell phones in schools. And the teachers loved it.”
Kennedy added that although he believes cellphones should be kept out of schools, he believes parents should make the decision themselves. Nearly 80% of American parents support a school ban, according to a recent survey.

Nine states have now brought in cellphone bans or restrictions in their public schools: Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina, and Virginia.
Cellphone use among children is increasing rapidly.
In the US, survey data suggests 42% of US children will now have a smartphone by the age of 10, with 91% owning one by 14.
A meta-analysis of 25 studies showed a link between increased use of cellphones and other wireless devices and poor mental health in children and teenagers."

“This has allowed a whole of government approach to dismantle this criminal terrorist gang,” the agency said.
“Members of this vicious terrorist gang are responsible for the brutal assault and murder of nursing student Laken Riley and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.”
Last weekend, President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of members of Tren de Aragua.
The order states that the group “is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.”
The order describes how Tren de Aragua “operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela, and commits brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking.” The gang is involved in “irregular warfare” against the US, the order continues.
Under the Alien Enemies Act, which was first issued in response to the threat of war with France, the President would have the power to allow non-citizens to be deported without the opportunity to appear before an immigration or federal judge.
Since 1798, the act has been used only three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II, when it was used to inter people of German, Italian and Japanese ancestry. Over 100,000 people with Japanese ancestry were interred in camps between 1941 and 1945, including American citizens.
Within hours of the President’s order being issued, and Obama judge revoked it and ruled that deportation flights in the air, including a plan bound for El Salvador, must be turned around. The planes continued to their destinations, and the White House later issued a statement saying the flights were not in violation of the judge’s order and that it would be challenged in the Supreme Court.
Trump said on a number of occasions during the election campaign that he would use extraordinary powers to remove illegal aliens.
In his inaugural address, the President said the Alien Enemies Act would be a key part of his immigration policy.
“By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil,” he said.
“As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/thousands-of-federal-workers-being-diverted-to-deportation-push,Thousands of Federal Workers Being Diverted to Deportation Push,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"Thousands of federal workers have been reassigned from their duties to aid in President Donald Trump’s campaign promise of “the largest mass deportation operation in American history.”
Reuters reports, “As U.S. President Donald Trump pledges to deport ‘millions and millions’ of ‘criminal aliens,’ thousands of federal law enforcement officials from multiple agencies are being enlisted to take on new work as immigration enforcers.
“I do not recall ever seeing this wide a spectrum of federal government resources all being turned toward immigration enforcement,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former Homeland Security official who spoke with Reuters.
Although the specific number of federal workers being redirected to immigration is not fully clear, Reuters notes that the effort is reminiscent of the “aftermath of the 2001 attacks, when Congress created the Department of Homeland Security that pulled together 169,000 federal employees from other agencies and refocused the FBI on battling terrorism.”
According to one ATF official, around 80% of the organization’s 2,500 agents have been ordered to take on immigration-related tasks. At least a quarter of DEA agents are also working on immigration.
So far, Trump’s mass-deportation program has made notable gains, while also facing challenges.
The number of migrants crossing the southern border is now at a record low.
Average apprehensions were at just 330 a day during February, Trump’s first full month in office.
In a statement issued by CBP, they said these are “the lowest nationwide apprehensions in” the organization’s history.
Border Patrol agents apprehended 8,347 illegal aliens at the southern border in February, down 94% from 140,641 apprehensions in February 2024.
Securing adequate funding has proven an early difficulty, though.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is facing a serious funding shortfall of $2 billion.
According to Axios, ICE has warned Congress it faces a massive black hole in its budget that could compromise its ability to carry out Trump’s flagship immigration policy.
Although Congress will send an additional $500 million in the stop-gap spending bill that just passed the House, that money would still fall well short of providing the funds ICE needs to continue working at its current pace through September.
Current plans for ICE expansion include the hiring of hundreds more stuff, the doubling of detention space to accommodate 100,000 people and increasing the number of detention flights.
The spending plan now before Congress is “not going to be sufficient to be able to cover the entire need for what they’re covering” at ICE, said Sen. James Lankford
“Just the bed space alone becomes very significant. And to just be able to detain people for a couple of days while they’re processing, and then to be able to move out flights… is exceptionally expensive.”
It may be possible to divert money to ICE from other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, such as FEMA and the Coast Guard, but this could only be a temporary measure."

The day after, his suspension was upgraded to a full ban.
Wilson was accused of inciting violence against Elon Musk with a Substack essay entitled “Kill Tesla, Save the Country.” Wilson posted the essay on Twitter and repeated the title again—“Kill Tesla, Save the Country”—just to make sure his message was heard loud and clear on the Tesla CEO’s own social-media platform.
I’d call that a provocation if ever I saw one.
Wilson has spent the last couple of days bitching and complaining about his ban. He says he never meant to incite harm against Elon Musk. His words are being twisted. It’s all just semantics. Metaphor. “Kill” isn’t supposed to be taken literally. It means something more like, “tank Tesla sales” or “cause Tesla’s stock price to crash by boycotting their products” or “make it socially unacceptable to buy a Cybertruck,” but those phrasings don’t make for a pithy title, do they? So “kill” was just a convenient shorthand.
Right?
Here’s what I say.
Poppycock.
Balderdash.
Drivel.
Sh*te.
I could think of a dozen or more words to describe Wilson’s special pleading, each one of them more profane than the last.
Rick Wilson thinks we’re stupid. This isn’t news. He’s described Trump supporters as “part of the credulous boomer rube demo,” “childless single men who masturbate to anime.” (I may be a confirmed bachelor, Rick, but I do NOT masturbate to anime, thank you very much!)
In fact, Rick Wilson has built the entire latter part of his career off denigrating Donald Trump and his supporters. It’s what he does. The man feels no obligation to tell us the truth, since he thinks we’re among the lowliest creatures that slither and crawl across the earth on their bellies.
Wilson wants to avoid being held accountable for his own actions. That’s it. He wants to be allowed to continue using the master’s tools—Twitter—to deconstruct the master’s house. To set it on fire.
It’s not like Wilson doesn’t have form. He’s made violent threats before. Most famously, back in 2015, he urged someone to “put a bullet in Donald Trump.” He had to wait nine years for his wish to come true, but it did.
A little bit of linguistic theory. Like all forms of language, metaphors depend for their meaning on the general context of utterances in which they exist. Meaning doesn’t just exist in the head of the person making an utterance. Even the would-be solipsist’s brain is invaded by the shared symbols of the culture he was raised in. The language we think through is a common inheritance, never truly our own. When René Descartes said, “I think therefore I am”—cogito ergo sum—he wasn’t simply confirming the existence of the lone thinker’s thoughts and being, but also a whole social world that had produced, among other things, the Latin language in which those thoughts were expressed.
So here’s the context in which Wilson’s entreaty to “kill Tesla” is being made, and which gives it its full meaning. Across the length and breadth of America, Tesla dealerships, Tesla charging stations and Tesla vehicles are being attacked and destroyed deliberately, because of Elon Musk’s role in supporting Donald Trump, bankrolling his campaign and running the Department of Government Efficiency. In the absence of Molotov cocktails, disgusting fat leftists are even reaching into the chasm of their own backsides for material with which to deface Tesla vehicles when they see them (don’t watch that video with a full stomach, by the way). Musk himself is being called a Nazi, the real President (not Donald Trump), the devil’s banker, and so on.
It’s a domestic terror campaign, and the Trump admin is rightly treating it as such. Three people who’ve been arrested so far now face between five and 20 years in prison.
Wilson knows all of this. He watches the news. He was on Twitter. In his Substack piece, he calls Tesla a “bank for fascists, a goose-stepping hedge fund bankrolling the political fever dreams of Elon Musk and his DOGE dreams of controlling the ruins of the American government as he becomes earth’s first trillionaire and then the emperor of Mars.” He wields the “metaphors” so well: fascist, goose-stepping Nazi, emperor of Mars.
Beyond Tesla and Elon Musk, in the wake of the American left’s decade-long failure to stop Donald Trump, leftists are turning to violent reprisal as the establishment political machine grinds to a halt. I’ve called this the “Mangione model,” because it draws its inspiration from failed-pornstar-turned-hitman Luigi Mangione, who gunned down United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, in December. As the possibility of satisfaction, of “doing something,” by conventional means disappears—as the pussy hats and placards get put away—what’s left is individual action or action in small groups. Mangione showed it was possible to do something spectacular alone, with just an army of one.
Mangione has been feted in popular culture by dirtbag nepo-retards (Hasan Piker), YouTube pedo-apologists (“Vaush”) and painfully unfunny comedians (Bill Burr), and even politicians like Bernie Sanders and AOC are giving him sly winks with all their recent talk about “America’s oligarchy.” Mangione has also been feted by people doing actual violence: by the principal organizers of the Tesla protests and by bloodthirsty tranny Ryan Michael English, who tried to kill Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and burn down the Heritage Foundation at the end of January.
This is a moment that’s pregnant with violence. That’s the context in which the utterance “kill Tesla, save America” must be understood, whatever Rick Wilson wants us to believe now he’s been put on the naughty step.
For weeks, months, years—actually, the better part of a decade—we had warnings that Donald Trump was the greatest threat to American democracy in its 250-odd-year history. Before he was even in office, Trump was being called Orange Hitler, and liberals and Never Trumpers like Rick Wilson were telling us a Thousand-Year Trumpenreich was imminent.
It never materialized of course, but the language continued to become harsher and more urgent. By the time we got to the middle of 2023 and all the Democrat lawfare was clearly failing and it become obvious Trump was going to win a second term, a new metaphor was deployed for a very specific reason: Trump as Caesar.
As soon as the Trump-as-Caesar metaphor began to gain traction in the mainstream media, I predicted, in print, there would be an assassination attempt. The key point, for me, was an op-ed by Robert Kagan, Victoria Nuland’s husband, which warned that a “Trump dictatorship” was “inevitable” and described Trump in Caesarian terms—crossing the Rubicon, etc. The image for the article was a splice of Trump’s head and a bust of Caesar. The message was unmistakeable: only a Brutus figure can stop Trump now. This time, though, Brutus can strike in advance, rather than waiting for Caesar to bring about the Republic’s downfall. We know what will happen otherwise.
I called this “the Brutus Option.” It took scarcely six months for it to happen. And then it happened again.
Every single commentator who had “metaphorically” referred to Trump as Hitler or Caesar, or simply said, like Rick Wilson, that somebody should “put a bullet in Trump,” was responsible for the actions of Thomas Matthew Crooks and Ryan Routh. Every single one.
This Elon Musk stuff is no different.
Words matter. Who says them, when, where, how, why. Context is everything. Rick Wilson knows this. A Twitter ban should be the least of his punishments."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/columbia-university-bends-knee-agrees-to-trump-conditions-to-restore-400-million-federal-funding,"Columbia University Bends Knee, Agrees to Trump Conditions to Restore $400 Million Federal Funding",By Zero Hedge,1 month ago,"Columbia University has agreed to meet wide-ranging conditions set by the Trump administration to restore $400 million in federal funding, according to a memo sent by the university to the federal government reported first by the Wall Street Journal.
In response to demands from the Trump administration, Columbia will implement several notable changes, including ending mask mandates on campus, granting 36 campus police officers expanded authority to arrest students, and appointing a senior vice provost with extensive oversight powers for its Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department, as well as the Center for Palestine Studies.
Control of the Middle East department has been a central dispute in negotiations and sparks controversy across campus. Faculty at Columbia and nationwide are expressing deep reservations about letting the federal government dictate how they can operate an academic department. The new vice provost, appointed by Columbia, will review curriculum, nontenure faculty hiring and leadership “to ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced.” -WSJ
Columbia’s agreement represents a turning point in ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and some elite universities. President Trump has emphasized the need to address alleged antisemitism on campuses, particularly singling out Columbia due to recent controversies and protests regarding the Middle East conflict.
Earlier this month, Trump administration officials suspended federal grants and contracts to Columbia, alleging insufficient protections for Jewish students during pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations. Following intense negotiations, Columbia agreed to multiple demands outlined by the federal task force on antisemitism, and even committed to additional reforms promoting intellectual diversity.
“We have worked hard to address the legitimate concerns raised both from within and without our Columbia community, including by our regulators, with respect to the discrimination, harassment, and antisemitic acts our Jewish community has faced in the wake of October 7, 2023,” the university stated in the memorandum.
A senior Columbia administrator indicated that while the university considered legal action against the federal government, officials ultimately concluded that cooperation was necessary due to the federal government’s significant financial influence. Some reforms listed by the administration were already under consideration, according to the university.
Among the new policies, Columbia will prohibit disruptive protests involving the occupation of campus buildings, require protesters to identify themselves, and ensure an unbiased admissions process. The university also plans to closely investigate a recent decrease in enrollment among Jewish and African-American students.
Although Columbia stands among the country’s wealthiest universities, with an endowment of about $15 billion, it wouldn’t take long for it to cease to operate in any recognizable form without government money.
That stark reality hovers behind the school’s concessions. Columbia has agreed to curtail protests that take over buildings and disrupt classes. The school will require protesters to identify themselves and will review admissions practices to “ensure unbiased admissions processes.”
Columbia noted they have “identified a recent downturn in both Jewish and African-American enrollment, and we will closely examine those issues.”
Additionally, Columbia will adopt a specific definition of antisemitism developed by its own antisemitism task force, clarifying what constitutes antisemitic speech or behavior, including exclusion of students based on views toward Israel or the celebration of violence against Israelis or Jewish individuals.
The university emphasized steps beyond federal demands, including institutional neutrality on political issues, launching educational programming at its Tel Aviv hub, and developing a free K-12 curriculum focused on promoting open inquiry and civil discourse.
To further enhance academic diversity, Columbia announced it will hire faculty jointly affiliated with the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and other departments such as Economics, Political Science, and the School for International and Public Affairs.
Other universities nationwide are closely observing Columbia’s concessions, as many depend on federal funds, student loans, and research grants critical to their operations. The outcome may influence negotiations at other institutions facing similar government scrutiny."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/alleged-leader-of-vegan-trans-murder-cult-faces-new-charges,Alleged Leader of Vegan Trans Murder Cult Faces New Charges,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"The alleged leader of the Zizians, a self-described “vegan transgender anarchist rationalist” group, has been slapped with more gun charges after his recent arrest. His group is linked to a spate of murders across the US.
Nine more gun-related misdemeanor charges have been added to the case against Jack Amadeus LaSota, 34, which include carrying a concealed weapon and loaded handguns, as well as possession of an assault weapon.
LaSota, aka “Ziz,” is considered to be the leader of the Zizian group, which has been linked to homicides in California, Vermont and Pennsylvania.
He was arrested by Maryland State Police on 16 February along with Michelle Jacqueline Zajko, 32, of Media, Pennsylvania, and Daniel Arthur Blank, 26, of Sacramento, California, after they asked a man to camp on his property. He reported them to the police as “suspicious.”
Members of the Zizians have been linked to the killing of a landlord in Vallejo, California, a shootout in Vermont that left a Border Patrol agent dead, and the killing of Zajko’s parents in Pennsylvania.
Rita and Richard Zajko were shot and killed at their Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, home on 31 December 2022, their daughter’s birthday.
Guns purchased by Michelle Zajko have been linked to the shooting of Border Patrol agent David Maland in January. Teresa Youngblut is now standing trial for her part in the shooting. Her accomplice, Felix Bauckholt, was killed when Border Patrol agents returned fire.
Youngblut is linked to Maximilian Snyder, who is alleged to have killed Curtis Lind, his landlord, in Vallejo, California. Snyder was arrested in January and charged with murder. LaSota was apparently present at the scene; although he wasn’t charged.
LaSota, who identifies as female, is well known in the California rationalist movement. He has written extensive blog posts about anarchism and veganism.
He also served as an intern at NASA.
His next scheduled court appearance is 8 April."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/longtime-illegal-alien-activist-arrested-by-ice,Longtime Illegal Alien Activist Arrested by ICE,By Allan Wall | Border Hawk,1 month ago,"“Cruel and Unnecessary”
“Soviet-Style Political Persecution of Political Dissidents”
These grave accusations refer to the recent arrest of Jeanette Vizguerra, a prominent activist for illegal aliens who is a longtime illegal alien herself.
In Colorado, where she was detained, they’ve been protesting her arrest.
“This is not immigration enforcement. This is Soviet-style political persecution of political dissidents under the guise of immigration enforcement,” declared Denver Mayor Mike Johnston.
According to the American Friends Service Committee, “Jeanette Vizguerra has been a pillar of the community for decades, advocating for immigrant rights and supporting countless families. There was no reason for ICE to take her into custody – her detention is a cruel and unnecessary action that is causing irreparable harm to her family and community.”
CNN has called her “a symbol of resistance as she fought for immigrant rights during the first Trump administration,” and a New Republic report about her case is entitled, “ICE Detains Prominent Immigration Activist in Grim Sign for Future.”
CBS begins an article with this description: “A community is in distress, and emotions are running high over the recent ICE detainment of Jeanette Vizguerra, a well-known immigration activist…”
What’s going on? What does this tell us about the past, present, and future of immigration law enforcement?
The saga of Jeanette Vizguerra, of Mexico City, began in 1997 when she, her husband, and a daughter entered the U.S. illegally.
She’s been here ever since (with a seven-month interruption in 2012), evading detention and giving birth to three anchor babies who were awarded automatic birthright citizenship.
In 2009, Vizguerra got into trouble over driving without a license or insurance and having a fake Social Security number.
Deportation proceedings began which didn’t go anywhere for years.
In 2012, she spent seven months in Mexico, was detained during an illegal reentry, and then allowed to stay in the country.
The feeble attempts to deport Vizguerra continued until 2017, when Trump took office for the first time.
Vizguerra entered Denver’s First Unitarian Society church for “sanctuary,” where she remained for three years.
If an illegal alien resides in a church building, he or she can’t be detained or deported under sanctuary doctrine.
That scam was supported by ICE policy, which has changed under the Trump 2.0 administration.
But back in 2017, it made Jeanette Vizguerra a cause célèbre.
She was named by Time magazine to its 100 Most Influential People in the World list.
The Time piece about her, penned by actress/activist America Ferrera, declared, “The current Administration [Trump 1.0] has scapegoated immigrants, scaring Americans into believing that undocumented people like Jeanette are criminals.”
Jeanette Vizguerra was not just exploiting the system for herself. She was an activist fighting for other illegal aliens.
In a November 2024 interview , she said she’d been an activist for 26 years, which, by her own admission, would begin her activism in 1998, two years after her arrival.
Vizguerra organized the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition, a group of churches offering “sanctuary” to other illegal aliens.
She also had two other groups: Sanctuary for All and Abolish ICE Denver.
In 2012, Vizguerra returned to Mexico for seven months, illegally re-entered the U.S., was apprehended, then released on a stay of her deportation, and has been here ever since.
Finally, on March 16, the jig was up.
Vizguerra was arrested at a Denver-area Target store where she was employed as a cashier. (Shouldn’t that Target be in trouble for employing her?)
“Jeanette Vizguerra-Ramirez, 53, was arrested without incident March 17 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She will remain in ICE custody pending removal from the United States,” according to ICE.
Jeanette Vizguerra’s long career as an activist illegal alien may be nearing an end, though she claims she’ll continue the fight from Mexico.
Think about how crazy things have been in recent years.
Illegal aliens openly flout the law and run campaigns against our immigration system – and they get away with it.
Hopefully, those days are over."

Effective from 24 April, the revocation will cut short a two-year “parole” period granted to migrants from these four nations, under a program that allowed them to fly into the US if they had sponsors in the country.
President Joe Biden launched a parole program for Venezuelans in 2022 and then extended it to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans the following year. The move was ostensibly aimed at reducing levels of illegal migration from the four countries.
In a notice that will be published in the Federal Register on Monday, the Department of Homeland Security will say that revoking parole status will make it easier to fast-track these immigrants for removal, under a policy known as “expedited removal.”
Expedited removal, which was implemented by President Trump in January, can be applied to certain migrants in the US for two years or less.
At the beginning of March, President Trump also said he would decide “very soon” whether to revoke the parole status of nearly 250,000 Ukrainians who have entered the US as a result of the conflict with Russia. Rumours suggest their status may be changed as early as April."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-reopening-massive-migrant-detention-center-closed-by-biden,Trump Reopening Massive Migrant Detention Center Closed by Biden,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"A huge two-thousand capacity migrant detention center will be reopened after Joe Biden closed it down.
The facility, in Baldwin, Michigan, will be run by GEO Group, which announced a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“We expect that our company-owned North Lake Facility in Michigan will play an important role in helping meet the need for increased federal immigration processing center bed space,” GEO Group Executive Chairman George Zoley said in a statement.
The facility, which can hold 1,800 migrants, was closed by the Biden administration when it decided to eliminate all private contracts with the Bureau of Prisons. In doing so, bed space for thousands of criminals and migrants was lost.
Before it was closed, the Baldwin facility held illegal aliens convicted of federal crimes. It was a major source of employment in the local community.
Increasing detention space for migrants is a key issue for the Trump administration as it seeks to deliver on the President’s promise of “the largest mass deportation operation in American history.”
Over eight million illegals remain on ICE’s “non-detained” docket.
At present, ICE is facing a serious funding shortfall of $2 billion as its mass-deportation efforts are ramped up.
According to Axios, ICE has warned Congress it faces a massive black hole in its budget that could compromise its ability to carry out Trump’s flagship immigration policy.
Although Congress will send an additional $500 million in the stop-gap spending bill that just passed the House, that money would still fall well short of providing the funds ICE needs to continue working at its current pace through September.
Current plans for ICE expansion include the hiring of hundreds more stuff, the doubling of detention space to accommodate 100,000 people and increasing the number of detention flights.
The spending plan now before Congress is “not going to be sufficient to be able to cover the entire need for what they’re covering” at ICE, said Sen. James Lankford
“Just the bed space alone becomes very significant. And to just be able to detain people for a couple of days while they’re processing, and then to be able to move out flights… is exceptionally expensive.”
It may be possible to divert money to ICE from other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, such as FEMA and the Coast Guard, but this could only be a temporary measure.
As part of a larger “budget reconciliation” bill, tens of billions of dollars have been earmarked for Trump’s immigration policies, but that bill is likely to take some time to pass, since it contains significant changes to tax policy that will provoke serious debate among lawmakers."

A survey conducted by Morning Consult asked Democrat voters and Democrat-leaning independents who they would support in the 2028 primary. Over a third—36%—chose Kamala Harris, making her the most popular choice by a significant margin.
So far, Harris has kept her cards close to her chest, saying only “I am staying in this fight.” There have been suggestions she will try to run for California governor to replace incumbent Gavin Newsom.
In second place was former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, with ten percent. Buttigieg recently declined a Michigan Senate bid, suggesting he has ambitions for the presidency.
Tied for third place with 5% were Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who was Kamala Harris’s running-mate last year.
Walz has already signalled his interest in running for the presidency in 2028, saying he would do “whatever it takes.”
“Look, I never had an ambition to be president or vice president. I was honored to be asked,” he said.
“If I feel I can serve, I will. And if nationally, people are like, ‘Dude we tried you, and look how that worked out,’ I’m good with that.”
Polling at 2-4% were billionaire Mark Cuban, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Cory Booker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
Sen. Raphael Warnock and Sen. John Fetterman each garnered 1% of the vote."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/could-the-dems-splinter-party-faces-historic-discontent-from-base,Could the Dems Splinter? Party Faces “Historic Discontent” from Base,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"The Democrat Party is struggling to come to terms with the scale of its defeat to Donald Trump and could face a Tea Party-style breakaway movement, as discontent among the party base reaches historic levels.
According to a detailed analysis of polling data conducted by Politico, “Just 40 percent of Democrats approve of the job performance of congressional Democrats, compared to 49 percent who disapprove. That’s a dramatic change from this time last year, when 75 percent of Democrats approved compared to just 21 percent who disapproved. The Democratic base’s disillusionment runs so deep that it’s eerily reminiscent of Republican grassroots sentiment in the period leading up to Donald Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party.”
These data are “unlike any in recent history” and suggest the Democrats are “on the verge of a Tea Party-style, intra-party revolt.”
The first time the Democrats lost to Donald Trump, congressional approval ratings actually went up, because voters agreed with the way the party opposed him. The same trend was noticeable among Republican voters in 2020, despite Trump’s loss.
The data clearly suggest that anger among Democrat voters is directed at the party’s leadership. There seems to be no clear sign that voters want the party to be more left, less left or just stay the same. Instead, polling suggests voters believe party leadership isn’t doing enough to resist Trump.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is now facing a determined push from a Soros-backed group to step down after he helped pass a six-month spending bill to avert a federal shutdown last week.
Indivisible, an activist organization that has received nearly $8 million from George Soros’s Open Society Foundations since 2017, is now calling for Schumer to resign and is hosting an event tonight at which attendees will be encouraged to write “happy retirement” cards to the veteran politician.
The group’s co-executive director Ezra Levin announced the plan to oust Schumer shortly after the funding bill passed: “Senator Schumer should step aside as leader. Every Democrat in the Senate should call for him to do so, and begin making plans for new leadership immediately.”
He added that the wrangling over the spending bill should have been used by Democrats as a “rare, precious point of leverage,” but “Schumer did the opposite. He led the charge to wave the white flag of surrender.”
The new campaign to oust Schumer drew pointed comment from a White House official who spoke to The New York Post.

Indivisible is also coordinating protests against Elon Musk and his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, including offering $200 payments to activists to take part in “Musk or us”-themed protests.
Protests against Musk have descended into violence in recent days, with attacks on Tesla dealerships, charging stations and vehicles.
On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced federal charges against three individuals involved in this violence, labelling the protests “domestic terrorism.”
“The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,” Bondi said in a statement.
“Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.”
Daniel Clarke-Pounder, Adam Matthew Lansky and Justin Thomas Nelson were all charged in connection with the protests.
Clarke-Pounder was charged with arson of property in interstate commerce after setting fire to a Tesla charging station in South Carolina. He wrote “F*ck Trump” and “Long Live Ukraine” in spraypaint before hurling Molotov cocktails at the charger. Agents found a notebook in Clarke-Pounder’s apartment containing statements against the Department of Government Efficiency, which is run by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Lansky threw Molotov cocktails at a Tesla dealership in Oregon, causing half a million dollars in damages.
Nelson, a male-female transgender, spray-painted “Nazi” on a Tesla dealership in Colorado. He is also suspected of setting fire to a Cybertruck.

However, it remains to be seen if the fire will spread across the Atlantic in a meaningful way, as globalists have their claws firmly wrapped around the levers of power in many countries.
“If Trump is successful, even if that’s on a small scale, this just enables people in Britain and in Europe to start talking about those things that Trump is talking about, to start implementing those policies, as well,” GB News correspondent Steven Edginton told immigration news outlet Border Hawk in a recent interview.
“’Mass deportations’ – no one had even heard of that expression in Britain until Trump started talking about it in the campaign, and that’s why I asked Nigel Farage about it last year. It’s starting to become a more mainstream idea on the right.”
“Whatever happens in America will always have an impact on Europe – we’re like your cultural vassal state, in a way. Everything in America is downstream in Europe, so hopefully President Trump is successful,” Edginton asserted.
EXCLUSIVE: Federal Judge Clears Way For Infowars Shutdown!!!"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/commercial-real-estate-is-in-serious-trouble,Commercial Real Estate Is in Serious Trouble,By Douglas French | Mises Institute,1 month ago,"While the financial press is attempting to cover Trump’s frenetic bipolar tariff policy, the ponderous commercial real estate market continues to deteriorate. Bisnow.com reports, citing CoStar, “US banks reported delinquencies hit 1.57 percent at the end of last year, a rate not seen since the fourth quarter of 2014.”
Putting a number to the percentage, “The 1.57 percent delinquency percentage means more than $47.1B of loans would have been delinquent at the end of the year,” writes Billy Wadsack for Bisnow’s Dallas-Fort Worth bureau. That’s an 88 percent increase from a decade ago.
Delinquencies in CMBS (Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities) are setting multi-year highs with $38B in arrears at year-end 2024, a 41 percent increase from the previous year end.
In the face of troubling news, those who work in real estate are taking a rosy view, as usual. James Robertson, Jr. writes in the latest Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, “Optimism in the industry is the highest it has been in eight years.” This industry he calls “illiquid and slow-moving” with cycles that can “drag on for years.”
There has been little transaction volume and sellers have held tightly to the valuations and cap rates experienced during days of ZIRP. Likewise, bankers have extended and pretended, hoping the never-before-seen low rates will miraculously return to lift all boats (and buildings).
Fitch Ratings’s Melissa Che told Robertson, “As more lower-quality assets, some of which have significantly deteriorated in performance, come to market and trade at relatively low prices, this may trigger an overall reset and further price discovery across various property quality segments.”
Distressed market sales nearly doubled to 6 percent in last year’s fourth quarter, according to Newmark Group, Inc. Banks are growing more impatient with loan extensions and modifications raising the amount of 2025 debt maturities to $957 billion from $659 billion from 2022. Newmark believes a third of CMBS loans fail to cover debt services.
Robertson focuses on bridge loans (REBLs) whose issuance ballooned in 2021 to $45 billion from less than $9 billion the year prior. Artis Shepherd of Patterson Capital, LLC told Robertson, “Bridge lending shifted around this time into a fairly aggressive product. Some lenders were offering credit at 80 percent-85 percent loan-to-value ratios and underwriting loans based upon proforma rather than actual net operating income.”
Shepherd goes on to explain that 2021 bridge lender’s loose underwriting included debt service coverage of just 1.0 or 1.05 to pro forma numbers rather than the traditional 1.25 DCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio). This has come back to bite lenders and REITs.
Borrowers whose loans are maturing must confront interest rates which are 300 bps higher than what they are paying. If they are paying at all. In Robertson’s piece he gives the example of the Starbucks Seattle HQ building. The current rate is 2.3 percent. However, the loan matures in August and Harsh Hemnani of Greenstreet told Robertson “If spreads and rates stay the same, it’s going to be somewhere around 5.5 percent. The owners will have to eat the difference. I think that pain is definitely going to happen.”
If Starbucks is your tenant, you take the hit. Owners with lesser quality tenants (or none at all) will likely walk away. Office properties are not the only problem. Overbuilding of multi-family projects has put pressure on rents. Community banks hold $629.7 billion in apartment loans with $6.1 billion being 30 days or more delinquent. This is the most since 2012 the tail-end of the Great Financial Crisis.
Researchers at the NY Fed are on high alert concerning the coming CRE maturity wall, believing banks are undercapitalized. “For example, regulators, credit rating agencies and providers of funding might scrutinize bank maturity extensions more closely, thus forcing banks to accept defaults rather than granting more maturity extensions.”
These defaults could lead to deposit runs and/or “trigger a wave of foreclosures or sales of loans in secondary markets, imposing fire-sale externalities on other intermediaries by depressing the market valuations of CRE debt and underlying CRE properties.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/who-controls-the-administrative-state,Who Controls the Administrative State?,By Jeffrey Tucker | Brownstone Institute,1 month ago,"President Trump on March 20, 2025, ordered the following: “The Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.”
That is interesting language: to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” is not the same as closing it. And what is “permitted by law” is precisely what is in dispute.
It is meant to feel like abolition, and the media reported it as such, but it is not even close. This is not Trump’s fault. The supposed authoritarian has his hands tied in many directions, even over agencies he supposedly controls, the actions of which he must ultimately bear responsibility.
The Department of Education is an executive agency, created by Congress in 1979. Trump wants it gone forever. So do his voters. Can he do that? No but can he destaff the place and scatter its functions? No one knows for sure. Who decides? Presumably the highest court, eventually.
How this is decided – whether the president is actually in charge or really just a symbolic figure like the King of Sweden – affects not just this one destructive agency but hundreds more. Indeed, the fate of the whole of freedom and functioning of constitutional republics may depend on the answer.
All burning questions of politics today turn on who or what is in charge of the administrative state. No one knows the answer and this is for a reason. The main functioning of the modern state falls to a beast that does not exist in the Constitution.
The public mind has never had great love for bureaucracies. Consistent with Max Weber’s worry, they have put society in an impenetrable “iron cage” built of bloodless rationalism, needling edicts, corporatist corruption, and never-ending empire-building checked by neither budgetary restraint nor plebiscite.
Today’s full consciousness of the authority and ubiquity of the administrative state is rather new. The term itself is a mouthful and doesn’t come close to describing the breadth and depth of the problem, including its root systems and retail branches. The new awareness is that neither the people nor their elected representatives are really in charge of the regime under which we live, which betrays the whole political promise of the Enlightenment.
This dawning awareness is probably 100 years late. The machinery of what is popularly known as the “deep state” – I’ve argued there are deep, middle, and shallow layers – has been growing in the US since the inception of the civil service in 1883 and thoroughly entrenched over two world wars and countless crises at home and abroad.
The edifice of compulsion and control is indescribably huge. No one can agree precisely on how many agencies there are or how many people work for them, much less how many institutions and individuals work on contract for them, either directly or indirectly. And that is just the public face; the subterranean branch is far more elusive.
The revolt against them all came with the Covid controls, when everyone was surrounded on all sides by forces outside our purview and about which the politicians knew not much at all. Then those same institutional forces appear to be involved in overturning the rule of a very popular politician whom they tried to stop from gaining a second term.
The combination of this series of outrages – what Jefferson in his Declaration called “a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object” – has led to a torrent of awareness. This has translated into political action.
A distinguishing mark of Trump’s second term has been an optically concerted effort, at least initially, to take control of and then curb administrative state power, more so than any executive in living memory. At every step in these efforts, there has been some barrier, even many on all sides.
There are at least 100 legal challenges making their way through courts. District judges are striking down Trump’s ability to fire workers, redirect funding, curb responsibilities, and otherwise change the way they do business.
Even the signature early achievement of DOGE – the shuttering of USAID – has been stopped by a judge with an attempt to reverse it. A judge has even dared tell the Trump administration who it can and cannot hire at USAID.
Not a day goes by when the New York Times does not manufacture some maudlin defense of the put-upon minions of the tax-funded managerial class. In this worldview, the agencies are always right, whereas any elected or appointed person seeking to rein them in or terminate them is attacking the public interest.
After all, as it turns out, legacy media and the administrative state have worked together for at least a century to cobble together what was conventionally called “the news.” Where would the NYT or the whole legacy media otherwise be?
So ferocious has been the pushback against even the paltry successes and often cosmetic reforms of MAGA/MAHA/DOGE that vigilantes have engaged in terrorism against Teslas and their owners. Not even returning astronauts from being “lost in space” has redeemed Elon Musk from the wrath of the ruling class. Hating him and his companies is the “new thing” for NPCs, on a long list that began with masks, shots, supporting Ukraine, and surgical rights for gender dysphoria.
What is really at stake, more so than any issue in American life (and this applies to states around the world) – far more than any ideological battles over left and right, red and blue, or race and class – is the status, power, and security of the administrative state itself and all its works.
We claim to support democracy yet all the while, empires of command-and-control have arisen among us. The victims have only one mechanism available to fight back: the vote. Can that work? We do not yet know. This question will likely be decided by the highest court.
All of which is awkward. It is impossible to get around this US government organizational chart. All but a handful of agencies live under the category of the executive branch. Article 2, Section 1, says: “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.”
Does the president control the whole of the executive branch in a meaningful way? One would think so. It’s impossible to understand how it could be otherwise. The chief executive is…the chief executive. He is held responsible for what these agencies do – we certainly blasted away at the Trump administration in the first term for everything that happened under his watch. In that case, and if the buck really does stop at the Oval Office desk, the president must have some modicum of control beyond the ability to tag a marionette to get the best parking spot at the agency.
What is the alternative to presidential oversight and management of the agencies listed in this branch of government? They run themselves? That claim means nothing in practice.
For an agency to be deemed “independent” turns out to mean codependency with the industries regulated, subsidized, penalized, or otherwise impacted by its operations. HUD does housing development, FDA does pharmaceuticals, DOA does farming, DOL does unions, DOE does oil and turbines, DOD does tanks and bombs, FAA does airlines, and so on It goes forever.
That’s what “independence” means in practice: total acquiescence to industrial cartels, trade groups, and behind-the-scenes systems of payola, blackmail, and graft, while the powerless among the people live with the results. This much we have learned and cannot unlearn.
That is precisely the problem that cries out for a solution. The solution of elections seems reasonable only if the people we elected actually have the authority over the thing they seek to reform.
There are criticisms of the idea of executive control of executive agencies, which is really nothing other than the system the Founders established.
First, conceding more power to the president raises fears that he will behave like a dictator, a fear that is legitimate. Partisan supporters of Trump won’t be happy when the precedent is cited to reverse Trump’s political priorities and the agencies turn on red-state voters in revenge.
That problem is solved by dismantling agency power itself, which, interestingly, is mostly what Trump’s executive orders have sought to achieve and which the courts and media have worked to stop.
Second, one worries about the return of the “spoils system,” the supposedly corrupt system by which the president hands out favors to friends in the form of emoluments, a practice the establishment of the civil service was supposed to stop.
In reality, the new system of the early 20th century fixed nothing but only added another layer, a permanent ruling class to participate more fully in a new type of spoils system that operated now under the cloak of science and efficiency.
Honestly, can we really compare the petty thievery of Tammany Hall to the global depredations of USAID?
Third, it is said that presidential control of agencies threatens to erode checks and balances. The obvious response is the organizational chart above. That happened long ago as Congress created and funded agency after agency from the Wilson to the Biden administration, all under executive control.
Congress perhaps wanted the administrative state to be an unannounced and unaccountable fourth branch, but nothing in the founding documents created or imagined such a thing.
If you are worried about being dominated and destroyed by a ravenous beast, the best approach is not to adopt one, feed it to adulthood, train it to attack and eat people, and then unleash it.
The Covid years taught us to fear the power of the agencies and those who control them not just nationally but globally. The question now is two-fold: what can be done about it and how to get from here to there?
Trump’s executive order on the Department of Education illustrates the point precisely. His administration is so uncertain of what it does and can control, even of agencies that are wholly executive agencies, listed clearly under the heading of executive agencies, that it has to dodge and weave practical and legal barriers and land mines, even in its own supposed executive pronouncements, even to urge what might amount to be minor reforms."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/gangsters-terrorists-and-deep-state-judicial-tyranny,"Gangsters, Terrorists, and Deep State Judicial Tyranny",By Thomas J. DiLorenzo | Mises Institute,1 month ago,"The primary purpose of the federal judiciary is to make sure that anything the federal government does is almost never, ever, ruled to be unconstitutional. This is Hamilton’s constitutional regime. A believer in unlimited government, Alexander Hamilton’s constitutional belief was that the constitution can and should be used as a rubber stamp on unlimited government — as long as the government is run by “well behaved” politicians like himself, he insisted. His political nemesis, Thomas Jefferson, took the opposite view that the government needed to be “bound by the chains of the Constitution.”
Andrew Napolitano pointed out in his book, The Constitution in Exile, that the federal government’s “supreme” court did not rule a single federal law to be unconstitutional from 1935 to 1997. The eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Jeffersonians warned that if the day ever arrived that the federal government, through its judiciary, would be the sole arbiter of constitutionality Americans would then live under a tyranny. That judicial tyranny was cemented into place in April of 1865 with the destruction of the rights of nullification and secession and the evisceration of the Tenth Amendment – the real purposes of the “Civil War.”
The latest example of our bullying and tyrannical federal judiciary is Chief Justice John Roberts’ nasty rebuke of President Trump’s recommendation of impeaching a federal judge who issued one of those Stalinist-sounding federal judicial “decrees” saying that the president has no authority to deport illegal aliens who have committed such felonies as rape and murder, as he did with over 200 members of a notorious El Salvadoran criminal gang.
Americans – and American presidents – were not always bullied by black-robed totalitarians. They once understood that there are three branches of the federal government, not just the judicial branch, and that federal judges are not black-robed deities. President Andrew Jackson, who President Trump apparently reveres, is a good example of such a president. After Chief Justice John Marshall “ruled” in 1819 (McCulloch v. Maryland) that the Second Bank of the United States (BUS), a precursor of the Fed, was constitutional despite not being one of the delegate powers in Article 1, Section 8, and despite its being voted down during the constitutional convention, Jackson voiced his disagreement by vetoing the recharter of the BUS in 1832.
Paying “solemn regard to the principles of the Constitution,” Jackson said in his veto message, he had “come to the conclusion that it (the BUS) ought not to become a law . . .” The BUS, in his opinion, was incompatible with justice, sound policy, and “the Constitution of our country.” Its grants of “almost a monopoly of the foreign and domestic exchange” had increased the value of its stock (The BUS was 80 percent privately owned, 20 percent government owned) so much that a few hundred stockholders had become very wealthy by it, he said. As to Marshall’s opinion that the bank was constitutional, President Jackson simply said, “To this conclusion I cannot assent.”
He mocked Marshall’s theory that mere precedent – the existence of the BUS – established its constitutionality. A slavish follower and worshipper of Hamilton, Marshall here repeated Hamilton’s totalitarian-minded theory that whenever government does something that is unconstitutional, the fact that it did that thing magically makes it constitutional! No constitutional amendment is needed!
Stating the common understanding of all Americans outside of Marshall and his nationalist comrades in the legal profession, Jackson explained the truth about constitutional interpretation that “The Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each for itself be guided by its own opinion of the Constitution.” To that Jefferson would have added “the people of the free and independent states” as he called them in the Declaration of Independence. “The authority of the Supreme Court,” Jackson continued, “must not, therefore, be permitted to control” the other two branches.
When Jefferson debated Hamilton on the constitutionality of a national bank run by politicians Hamilton based his argument on the “Necessary and Proper” clause of the Constitution. Jefferson’s response was that the country already had banks, so a national bank run by politicians was not “necessary and proper” but only convenient for the political class."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/international-organizations-are-beyond-reform-abolish-them,International Organizations Are Beyond Reform – Abolish Them,By SchiffGold,1 month ago,"Both the Russia-Ukraine conflict and recent trade policy disputes have permanently embedded organizations like NATO and the World Trade Organization in the news cycle. While many of these organizations, like the WTO and EU, ostensibly liberalize economic policy, the reality is that they usually serve the state’s interest at the expense of individual liberty.
The following article was originally published by the Mises Institute. The opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect those of Peter Schiff or SchiffGold.
In a recent Springer publication, Marcos Falcone proposed “Bringing the Austrian School into the 21st century” by embracing existing international institutions as a means of maximizing global liberty. Acknowledging that they are often justly criticized for being bureaucratic and ineffective, Falcone argues that they have historically contributed to economic growth and democratization and that all that is needed are two key reforms to strengthen freedom within the current international order: strict enforcement of the subsidiarity principle (where governance decisions occur at the most local level possible) and the acceptance of secession as a legitimate political process.
The article traces the theoretical justification for these reforms through the works of prominent Austrian economists, such as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Murray Rothbard. Falcone highlights how subsidiarity, when applied weakly (e.g., the European Union’s version), allows for overreach by centralized authorities and argues that a stricter application would ensure that power remains local, preventing unnecessary bureaucratic growth and inefficiency. Likewise, secession is framed as an extension of self-determination, enabling political communities to align more closely with their preferences.
Falcone uses Switzerland and the early United States as models for balancing subsidiarity and secession, arguing that their federal structures successfully limited centralized power while preserving diversity. Ultimately, Falcone argues that enforcing subsidiarity and embracing secession would strengthen rather than weaken international institutions by making them more accountable, flexible, and limited in scope. The reforms would foster competition between governments, improving policies and enhancing freedom.
While it should be clear that Falcone is right in citing Rothbard as a champion of secession as essential for individual liberty, he did so because he saw decentralization as a step toward full privatization of governance, not the better working of supranational institutions. A full Rothbardian critique would take issue with several fundamental premises of Falcone’s argument.
From a strict anarcho-capitalist and voluntarist perspective, the idea of “improving” international organizations rather than abolishing them is entirely misguided, as these organizations are inherently coercive, funded through taxation (theft), and serve the interests of political elites rather than individuals. What is desired is advancing true liberty, not advocating for a “better” form of statism.
1. International Organizations as Illegitimate Entities
In Nations by Consent, Rothbard rejects the idea that states (or international organizations) should have any monopoly over governance. Instead, he argues for a world of decentralized, voluntary associations without coercive taxation or state control. Falcone assumes that international institutions should be reformed to function more efficiently, but Rothbard would insist that they should be eliminated entirely, as they are unnatural constructs that exist solely to serve political elites, not individuals.
2. Subsidiarity is Insufficient – Only Privatization Ensures Freedom
The article argues that strict subsidiarity (where decision-making is pushed to the lowest level) is a means of increasing liberty. However, Rothbard would reject subsidiarity as an incomplete solution because it still assumes the existence of government power at any level.
3. Secession is Good – But Not Enough
The article correctly aligns with Rothbard’s strong support for secession as a fundamental right. However, Rothbard would likely push the logic further – secession should not stop at the nation-state level but continue down to the individual level.
4. No Need for “Stronger” International Organizations
The article assumes that international organizations could strengthen if they limit their scope and embrace secession. A Rothbardian critique would be that international organizations should not be strengthened at all – they should be abolished.
5. The Market, Not Governments, Should Facilitate Trade and Cooperation
The article acknowledges that international trade has lifted billions out of poverty, but it credits international institutions like the WTO and NAFTA for facilitating this trade. Rothbard would argue that free markets, not governments or bureaucracies, are responsible for economic progress.
While the article presents a vision for greater decentralization, Rothbard would find its underlying premise flawed: namely, that the current system can or should be improved within existing international structures. Instead, a Rothbardian critique would advocate for:"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/judge-who-blocked-deportation-flights-was-neck-deep-in-russiagate-hoax,Judge Who Blocked Deportation Flights Was Neck Deep in Russiagate Hoax,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"The Obama judge who blocked President Trump’s deportation flights last weekend played a central role in the Russiagate collusion hoax.
Within hours of President Trump invoking the 200-year-old Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan gangbangers, Judge James Boasberg moved to block the President and even ordered planes in the air, including one bound for El Salvador, to be turned around.
According to a report from journalist Jerry Dunleavy, Judge Boasberg was heavily involved in the Russiagate collusion hoax that was used to belabour President Trump during his first term.
As the head of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court, Boasberg “made a number of divisive decisions, including a slap on the wrist for a member of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane team, the appointment of officials who had defended the FBI’s actions during the Russiagate saga, the renewal of the FBI’s FISA powers, and more,” Dunleavy wrote.
Even though he noted the wide-ranging errors in the DoJ’s investigation, which he said “called into question the reliability of the information proffered in other FBI applications,” Boasberg extended the FISA surveillance powers for US agencies in November 2020.
Boasberg allowed major errors, including improper searches, to take place, and also gave ex-FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith a light sentence after he pled guilty in John Durham’s investigation into the Russiagate hoax. Prosecutors wanted him to serve significant jail time.
Boasberg gave Clinesmith just a year of probation, community service and no fine for falsifying an email from the CIA.
Boasberg also appointed to the FISA court Obama DoJ figures who were prominent in pushing the Russiagate hoax. David Kris and Mary McCord were both appointed by Boasberg to lead reform of the FISA court.
Trump’s presidential order from last weekend, entitled “Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua,” states that the group “is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.”
The order describes how Tren de Aragua “operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela, and commits brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking.” The gang is involved in “irregular warfare” against the US, the order continues.
Under the Alien Enemies Act, which was first issued in response to the threat of war with France, the President would have the power to allow non-citizens to be deported without the opportunity to appear before an immigration or federal judge.
Since 1798, the act has been used only three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II, when it was used to inter people of German, Italian and Japanese ancestry. Over 100,000 people with Japanese ancestry were interred in camps between 1941 and 1945, including American citizens.
Trump said on a number of occasions during the election campaign that he would use extraordinary powers to remove illegal aliens.
In his inaugural address, the President said the Alien Enemies Act would be a key part of his immigration policy.
“By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil,” he said.
“As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions.”"

“I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,” the President posted.
“Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!”
Last weekend, El Salvador received hundreds of suspected members of the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. In a deal with the US government that will cost $6 million, up to 300 Tren de Aragua members who have been arrested in the US will spend a year in El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison, which was built to house tens of thousands of native gang members. Within hours of President Trump invoking the 200-year-old Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of the gang members, an Obama judge issued a decision to revoke the order.
There has been a wave of attacks on Tesla in recent weeks, as radical leftists have sought to single out the electric-car maker because of the involvement of its CEO, Elon Musk, in running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and for his massive financial support of President Trump during and since the election.
Yesterday, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced federal charges against three individuals involved in the violent protests, labelling the protests “domestic terrorism.”
“The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,” Bondi said in a statement.
“Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.”
Daniel Clarke-Pounder, Adam Matthew Lansky and Justin Thomas Nelson were all charged in connection with the protests.
Clarke-Pounder was charged with arson of property in interstate commerce after setting fire to a Tesla charging station in South Carolina. He wrote “F*ck Trump” and “Long Live Ukraine” in spraypaint before hurling Molotov cocktails at the charger. Agents found a notebook in Clarke-Pounder’s apartment containing statements against the Department of Government Efficiency, which is run by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Lansky threw Molotov cocktails at a Tesla dealership in Oregon, causing half a million dollars in damages.
Nelson, a male-female transgender, spray-painted “Nazi” on a Tesla dealership in Colorado. He is also suspected of setting fire to a Cybertruck.
Each man faces between five and 20 years in prison if convicted.
The violent protestors have been bolstered in their actions by support from high-profile leftists and celebrities like Rick Wilson, who was permanently banned from Musk’s social-media platform X after a post that was a clear incitement to violence.
Wilson posted a link on X to a Substack article he wrote entitled “Kill Tesla, Save the Country,” in which he advocated targeting Tesla and destroying the brand in order to strike directly at Elon Musk for his role in heading the Department of Government Efficiency.
The X post repeated the inflammatory title of the article: “Kill Tesla. Save the Country.”
On Wednesday, Wilson was suspended for 30 days, but then the sanction was increased to a full suspension on Thursday.
In the Substack post, Wilson describes Tesla as a “goose-stepping hedge fund” and says Musk is wielding its billions to “control the ruins of the American government.”
“Tesla is no longer just a car company; it’s a bank for fascists, a goose-stepping hedge fund bankrolling the political fever dreams of Elon Musk and his DOGE dreams of controlling the ruins of the American government as he becomes Earth’s first trillionaire and then the Emperor of Mars.
“Musk’s power and wealth are inseparable from Tesla’s absurdly inflated stock price. If the Tesla bubble pops, so does Elon’s ability to keep throwing money around like a drunken Russian oligarch in a Macao casino.”
As the piece comes to a close, Wilson repeats the mantra, “Break Tesla, break Elon. Break Elon, break Trump.”
Although Wilson has spent much of the last two days attempting to defend his post and claim he was not advocating violence, he has a history of making such threats, including a call in 2015 to “put a bullet in Donald Trump.” He also celebrated Trump’s ban from social media including Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/boston-votes-to-become-lgbtqiaap2s-sanctuary-city-in-defiance-of-trump-administration,Boston Votes to Become LGBTQIAAP2S+ ‘Sanctuary City’ in Defiance of Trump Administration,By Calvin Freiburger | Lifesite,1 month ago,"BOSTON (LifeSiteNews) – The Boston City Council voted 12-1 Friday to declare the left-wing city an LGBT “sanctuary” against compliance with out-of-state conservative policies.
LGBTQ Nation reported that the resolution codifies local pro-LGBT policies, condemns “policies that will undermine access to essential gender-affirming healthcare, reproductive services, and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment,” and affirms the city will not comply with federal rules or regulations it deems contrary to its sexual values.
“During the election and since, there’s been an incredible escalation in anti-trans rhetoric and violence that has caused incredible stress and anxiety to our LGBTQI+ community, and especially to our trans brothers and sisters,” declared Democrat Liz Breadon, the council’s first openly lesbian member.
The sole member to vote against the resolution was Democrat Ed Flynn, who said he was unclear on the full details of what it would specifically do. “I don’t want to be disrespectful to anybody, but it’s just something I would like to have before I vote,” he said.
The Trump administration has taken a variety of executive actions to withdraw federal tax dollars from states and institutions that support biological males in women’s sports, transitioning gender-confused minors, and similar policies. The moves have provoked a backlash in left-wing enclaves, but evidence indicates disgruntled activists are out of step with the American people.
A recent Pew Research survey found that 66% of respondents supported limiting athletic participation to actual members of a team’s designated sex, 56% supported prohibiting “transition” procedures on minors, and 53% oppose forcing insurance companies to cover transition services. At the same time, just under half support requiring gender-confused individuals to use biologically correct restrooms or prohibiting “gender identity” lessons in elementary school, although support for those policies is only 26% and 34%, respectively.
Left-wing fixation on “woke” causes is also widely considered to be one of the reasons Democrats lost the latest presidential election. Exit polling by the pro-Democrat firm Blueprint found that the statement “Kamala Harris is focused more on cultural issues like transgender issues rather than helping the middle class” was the third-biggest reason for why overall voters chose not to vote for her, and the number one reason why swing voters rejected her and voted for Donald Trump instead.
Still, such political considerations hold little sway in deep-blue Boston, which has long been known for its left-wing radicalism – perhaps most notably when it was rebuked by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 for refusing to let a Christian flag fly at city hall despite allowing other groups to have their causes represented, including LGBT “pride.”"

US District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said the prisoners must be sent back to their previous holding facilities “immediately” and, moreover, their hormone-therapy treatments must be resumed, at taxpayer cost.
“The fact that they have already been transferred and, allegedly, have been abused at their new facilities can only strengthen their claims of irreparable harm,” Judge Lamberth wrote of the plaintiffs in the case, who are identified only as “Rachel” and “Ellen Doe.”
In court filings, the plaintiffs said they were living in constant fear of sexual violence in the male prisons they now reside in. They said they were subject to strip searches by male guards, without female guards present, and that they had been propositioned for sex by male guards as well.
On the day of his inauguration, President Trump signed an executive order, “Defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government.” Among other things, the order prohibits men from occupying women’s spaces and cuts federal funding from being used to pay for gender-transition therapy for prisoners.
Male prisoners who have transitioned to female have been accused of assaulting women after being transferred to female prisons.
For example, Christopher Williams, a 6’4” convicted pedophile, is at the center of a lawsuit alleging he abused female inmates he shared a prison cell with in Washington State."

At a White House event, the President said, “Today we take a very historic action that was 45 years in the making. In a few moments I will sign an executive order to begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all.”

Explaining his decision to abolish the Department, which was established in 1979 to oversee federal funding of education and enforce civil rights, Trump said, “We’ve got to get the federal government out of education.
“The Department of Education has become a bloated bureaucracy that’s more interested in pushing its own agenda than in helping our kids learn. It’s time to put the power back in the hands of parents, teachers, and local communities.”
Trump also railed against the “woke mob” and their “indoctrination of our children.”
Also in attendance was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
“This is a historic moment,” DeSantis said. “For too long, the federal government has been meddling in our schools, pushing its own agenda and stifling innovation. Trump’s plan will give us the freedom to create education systems that work for our communities.”
The abolition of the department has already been blasted by Democrats such as Elizabeth Warren, who called it a “reckless and short-sighted move.”
“The Department of Education is essential to ensuring that every child in America has access to a quality education, regardless of their zip code or family income. Trump’s plan would gut these protections and leave millions of students behind.”"
https://www.infowars.com/posts/twitter-value-returns-to-price-elon-musk-paid-for-it,Twitter Value Returns to Price Elon Musk Paid for It,By Raw Egg Nationalist,1 month ago,"The value of Twitter / X has returned to $44 billion—the price Elon Musk paid for it in 2022.
Back in September, it was estimated the platform was worth less than a quarter of the purchase price, or $10 billion.
Critics and commentators said Elon Musk’s purchase of the social-media behemoth would be a huge mistake, with some even predicting he would destroy the platform by removing the heavy censorship regime that had prevailed under its previous owners and firing a majority of employees.
But Musk’s backing of Donald Trump, to whose election campaign he contributed $250 million, appears to have paid off.
“The new $44bn valuation represents a rebound for Musk and the group’s investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, 8VC, Goanna Capital and Fidelity Investments. The deal would help set a price for the upcoming primary round,” the Financial Times notes.
Musk is now looking to pursue a new round of fundraising to offset some of the debt he used to buy the platform.
A spike in X’s advertising revenue has contributed to the buoyant valuation. According to sources who spoke to The Financial Times, advertising brought in $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings in 2024, which is roughly the same as before Musk bought the company. There was an initial exodus of advertisers after Musk took control, but they have gradually returned and big companies have increased their advertising spend on the platform.
Increased confidence in the company has also come from the sale of the loans Musk used to buy it. Interest in buying the $12.5 billion in loans increased dramatically after Donald Trump’s election victory in November."

https://www.infowars.com/posts/germany-berlin-takes-out-emergency-loan-for-alien-care-as-costs-spiral,Germany: Berlin Takes Out Emergency Loan For Alien Care as Costs Spiral,By Staff | Remix,1 month ago,"The city of Berlin has been a major magnet for migrants, but instead of the economic boom promised, they are costing the state billions of euros. Now, the city is throwing more debt at the problem, which will be facilitated by the massive debt package passed by the Christian Democrats (CDU), Christian Socialists (CSU), Social Democrats (SPD), and the Greens.
Economics Senator Franziska Giffey (SPD) announced that Berlin is taking an “emergency loan for refugee costs “
“We are planning our state budget for 2026/27 under the assumption that we will be able to access further loans,” she said.
The Bundestag’s decision to amend the constitution will allow federal states to take out new debt, and the Berlin Senate is wasting no time doing the same, with most of the money flowing to foreigners.
The relaxation of the debt brake allows each federal state to take on debt that amounts to 0.35 percent of nominal GDP every year. For Berlin, this is a welcome reprieve, with the city’s migrant population straining the budget to the extreme. Now, Berlin can take out approximately €670 million every year in new debt, which will be €1.3 billion for the budget for 2026 and 2027.
Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner, of the CDU, is known for his welcoming stance towards immigrants; however, his government has struggled to house and care for this growing population. He said it is “absolutely right” that German states can take on more debt.
“Germany’s infrastructure has been criminally neglected and driven to wear and tear,” said Wegner, who was a major supporter of relaxing the debt brake.
As Remix News has reported in the past, Berlin has allocated €1.3 billion to housing refugees, while cutting public school budgets. The city has turned to tent cities and prefabricated structures to house migrants. Of course, the housing crisis is seen across Germany, with mass immigration pricing people out of the cities and leading to rising rents year after year. German security firms continue to rake in tens of millions of euros every year due to the violence, assaults and even sexual abuse seen in the various asylum centers in the city.
As the Berlin police chief Barbara Slowik noted last year, crime has soared due to mass migration in the city, which is further straining the security budget.
In an interview with RBB, she voiced concerns over the impact of immigration on the city and the broader nation, suggesting that the current levels of immigration are unsustainable, both financially and socially.
“I believe that a limit has been reached as to what is affordable,” she told the broadcaster.
She emphasized the need for a comprehensive societal response to address the growing number of violent incidents involving immigrants.
Now, with the new debt package passed in the parliament, federal states have significant leeway to spend the money how they want. A lot of that money is going to sustaining Germany’s new foreign population, which costs the federal government approximately €50 billion per year. That is approximately the same amount the country spends on the armed forces every year."

Sander Smit of the Dutch Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) and Pietro Fiocchi of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) filed an objection to the future financing of the so-called LIFE programme, the EU’s funding instrument for the environment and climate action.
“It is our duty to protect the institutional integrity of the European Parliament from any undue influence, whether direct or indirect, including that which arises from the use of funds for targeted lobbying activities,” Sander Smit said at a meeting of the EP’s climate committee on Tuesday, March 18th.
The MEP was referring to recent revelations that the European Commission used public funds to finance environmental NGOs to push its climate agenda. In other words, European taxpayers’ money was used to subsidize groups that then lobbied in favor of the Green Deal in Brussels.
Members of the European Parliament were among those targeted by lobbyists.
Géén nieuw groen #lobbyschandaal toelaten! 🚫 Daarom heb ik met @FiocchiPietro bezwaar ingediend tegen werkprogramma EU-fonds natuur en milieu.Scheiding der machten! Europese Commissie mag groen gelobby 🗣️ngo’s tegen EP met belastinggeld niet ❌ mogelijk blijven maken.👇🏻 pic.twitter.com/GACtXQt9Vh
Sander Smit and his BBB party, an advocate of Dutch farmers who have had to bear the brunt of harmful EU climate policies and tax hikes, were one of the first to raise their concerns following the eruption of the scandal.
Speaking on Tuesday, Sander Smit said:
The Commission’s approach continues to blur the line between governance and advocacy, creating a framework where public funds can be leveraged to exert political pressure on policy makers.
He called on the future funding of the LIFE programme to be more transparent because a lot of money from this programme ends up with NGOs for communication and lobbying activities.
The LIFE programme—which supports projects in the field of nature restoration and sustainability—has a substantial budget of €5.4 billion but, according to Smit, transparency is completely lacking. “It’s about the separation of powers and preventing a new green lobbying scandal,” he said.
The European Commission has downplayed any wrongdoing, with Teresa Ribera, Vice President for competitiveness and climate saying “it is not lobbying” but “raising public awareness.”
But many MEPs, especially on the right side of the European Parliament are fuming.
Hungarian MEP Kinga Gál,  vice president for the conservative Patriots for Europe (PfE) group, said last week that the green lobbying scandal was “just the tip of the iceberg.”
An increasing amount of serious information is coming to light that the European Commission is funding hundreds of political activist groups across Europe to push its own policies, extremist ideologies, and often to attack sovereigntist governments.
She demanded full transparency on the funding of NGOs and said the PfE has submitted more than eighty public interest requests to the European Commission in recent weeks.
Whether these formal objections and requests will have any impact at all remains to be seen. However, the Commission is not known for giving in to demands easily."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/indias-election-commission-advances-voter-digital-id-linking-initiative,India’s Election Commission Advances Voter Digital ID-Linking Initiative,By Didi Rankovic | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"India’s Election Commission is pushing an initiative aimed at linking voter ID cards (EPICs, electoral photo identity cards) with the country’s digital biometric ID system.
The system, Aadhaar, in turn, links residents’ fingerprints and iris scans to a unique 12-digit ID number.
A meeting was been scheduled for this week that was expected to discuss how to speed up the process and deal with any road bumps along the way. For now, the plan is for the process of linking EPICs with Aadhaar to remain voluntary – and this is thanks to a Supreme Court ruling.
The Election Commission is basing the effort on India’s Election Laws Act, the version amended in 2021, which allows officials to ask voters for their Aadhaar ID number in order to verify identity.
Meanwhile, according to announcements earlier in the week, the meeting would bring together the Commission’s chief, Gyanesh Kumar, and officials from India’s Ministry of Home Affairs as well as those from the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).
This last participant is credited for successful work on “biometric deduplication” (of voter registration, through Aadhaar authentication using facial recognition.)
Not everyone is happy with these developments – several opposition parties have spoken about the possibility of manipulating voter lists by abusing the incoming system, as well as through duplication of EPIC numbers. The Commission did not deny this last point, but said it would solve the problem “within three months.”
However, its representatives claim that duplicated voter ID card numbers “do not necessarily indicate fraudulent registration.”
And the justification for this latest initiative of linking EPICs with Aadhaar is that it will improve “election integrity” – specifically around voter rolls.
The initiative comes on the heels of the rollout of the electronic version of electoral photo identity cards – e-EPICs. The overall direction of all these moves is to further cement the role of digital ID in both India’s government services and the private sector.
Another recent development aimed toward the same goal is the announced launch in 2025 of an updated Central KYC (“know-your-customer”) Registry (CKYCR). Before this, the country’s postal service incorporated eKYC, based on Aadhaar, for savings accounts."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/coup-nato-ally-turkey-arrests-erdogans-main-rival,‘Coup’: NATO Ally Turkey Arrests Erdogan’s Main Rival,By Nick Hallett | The European Conservative,1 month ago,"In a move condemned by Turkish opposition parties, Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu has been arrested on charges of corruption and links to a terrorist group. His arrest comes just days before he was expected to be nominated as the main opposition candidate for Turkey’s 2028 presidential election.
The Turkish government has accused İmamoğlu of engaging in bribery and supporting the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a group classified as a terrorist organisation by Turkey and its allies. Imamoglu denies all charges, declaring on social media,
The will of the people cannot be silenced.
Alongside İmamoğlu, 100 others were also arrested, including journalists and business figures. Istanbul authorities have banned protests for four days and restricted access to social media platforms such as X, YouTube, and Instagram. Several city streets and metro lines have been shut down.
The opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), to which İmamoğlu belongs, claims his arrest is an attempt by the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to suppress political opposition. The party’s chairman, Ozgur Ozel, said they will proceed with nominating Imamoglu as their candidate, calling the arrest “a coup attempt against the next President.”
The move is awkward for European leaders. Turkey is a NATO member and Europe is relying on the country’s large army to help defend democracy in Ukraine—all while it apparently stifles democracy at home. Germany and France expressed concern over the arrest, but there is likely little they can do against a key ally.
The financial markets have reacted negatively to the news: the Turkish lira fell to an all-time low against the dollar, while Istanbul’s stock market dropped over 5%.
President Erdogan has been in power for 22 years. Under the country’s constitution, he is not allowed to run for another term in the 2028 election—unless he calls for an early vote or changes the law. Many now speculate that İmamoğlu’s arrest is part of a broader strategy to secure Erdogan’s continued rule."
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-uks-online-safety-act-is-here-and-free-speech-is-on-notice,The UK’s Online “Safety” Act is Here — And Free Speech is on Notice,By Didi Rankovic | Reclaim The Net,1 month ago,"The first phase of the UK’s Online Safety Act, a sweeping censorship law, has come into force.
The requirements imposed on online platforms include identifying and deleting illegal content, but also taking steps to reduce the risk of such content being posted.
The law includes truthful and non-violent speech in the “illegal” category that platforms must remove. The first phase rules cover a huge list of “priority offenses” – 130 types of content in total, which can be grouped into 17 categories.
The stated goals of the legislation are one thing, but its many critics have been consistently warning that the interpretation and implementation poses an unacceptable level of risk of stifling lawful speech.
The “Foreign Interference” category is where truthful speech is also targeted for removal. This stems from the definition of “misinterpretation” in the National Security Act 2023, on which the Online Safety Act bases its rules.
That definition, among other things, outlaws “presenting information in a way which amounts to a misrepresentation, even if some or all of the information is true.”
Another priority offense is “fear” of violence – such as “fear or provocation of violence” and “putting people in fear of violence.”
Given how prone the UK’s top former and current officials and lawmakers are to conflate non-violent speech with violence, this is another cause for concern.
In the wake of the Southport riots, there were repeated instances of high-ranking officials considering incitement to violence to be the same as “misinformation,” while PM Keir Starmer accused supporters of activist and journalist Tommy Robinson of their stance being equal to seeking “vicarious thrill from street violence.”
The category of racial hatred is among the priority offenses in the law, and this relies on the Public Order Act 1986 and the way it deals with stirring up racial hatred – but also instances when racial hatred is “likely” to be stirred up.
And this can be done not only through behavior but also words, including those that are threatening, abusive, and, “insulting.”
This type of definition leaves plenty of room for interpretation, and even before this first phase of the Online Safety Act’s implementation, many UK citizens would get arrested or interrogated for allegedly “stirring racial hatred” with their social media posts.
Presented with the choice of paying huge fines, or erring on the side of over-removal, tech companies are expected to choose the latter."
