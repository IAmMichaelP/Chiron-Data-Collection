https://foodbabe.com/fda-banning-artificial-dyes-from-our-food-watch-my-speech-at-the-hhs/,FDA banning artificial dyes from our food. Watch my speech at the HHS.,"I just had the most impactful day in my entire career as a food activist.
For so many years, I have said “The FDA is asleep at the wheel”. Now I no longer need to say that.
I flew to Washington D.C. on Tuesday to witness HHS Secretary Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary make the historical announcement that they are officially phasing out artificial dyes from all food sold in the country. (2)






You can watch the replay of the full HHS event here.


From the moment my kids were born, I taught them the truth about artificial food dyes because our government was doing nothing to protect them from these harmful ingredients.
The science is there, and has been for over a decade.
These dyes are made from petroleum and since 2010 products containing them require a warning label in Europe that states they “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children”.  Artificial dyes have also been linked to cancer and disruptions in the immune system.
Artificial dyes are one of the most problematic ingredients in the American food supply, and food companies often add them to products that are targeted towards and marketed towards our children.
Whether it’s red for Valentine’s Day, or pastel yellow & blue for Easter, or red & green for Christmas, or orange for Halloween…virtually all holiday “treats” are artificially dyed. This is the reason why I’ve struggled with the parties at my children’s school and dreaded the “Holiday Death Aisle” that shows up in stores every season.
Now we’re going to live in a world where we no longer have to worry about this.
Imagine a world where we have…
Birthday cakes that aren’t frosted with petroleum-based dyes contaminated with carcinogens.
Breakfast cereals without the fluorescent dyes that harm a child’s ability to focus in school.
Dye-Free candy in your child’s Halloween bucket that doesn’t harm their brains.
Chips and sports drinks on the soccer field, naturally colored with fruit and vegetable extracts like they use in Europe.
Parents across the nation have been tirelessly scouring ingredient labels, trying to avoid artificial dyes in their food and in their children’s food. Now, in 2 years, they’re not going to need to do this anymore.
This will help every American out there who doesn’t know the truth about our food…
Who is struggling for answers on their children’s health problems when they can be solved with food.
Because food is medicine.
This is the first step at reducing the amount of toxic ingredients in our food supply and safeguarding American children.
Dr. Makary addressed this in his first few weeks at the FDA, which is incredible. I’m very thankful that we now have intellectual honesty coming out of the FDA, focused on looking at the updated science on food additives that American food companies are not using in other countries.
The FDA is no longer turning a blind eye, and bowing down to corporate interests.
The FDA is no longer asleep at the wheel! They have woken up and are steering us towards a healthier future for our children.
This is what propelled me into becoming a food activist. Over 12 years ago, I did an investigation comparing products in Europe with the same products in America. (3) I was shocked and disgusted that companies like Kraft, for example, were creating safer Mac n’ Cheese without artificial dyes in other countries while they sold Americans an inferior version of their product with artificial dyes made from petroleum. I was so angered by the situation that I started my first nationwide petition demanding that Kraft remove the artificial dyes in America. (4)  After 365,000 petition signatures, a visit to their headquarters, and a viral grassroots campaign, Kraft removed the artificial dyes. (5)

We went on to successfully campaign several other billion-dollar corporations to change including Subway, Anheuser-Busch, and Starbucks. The wins were coming in and food companies were making changes, but it wasn’t coming quick enough. Making matters more difficult, we were confronted with a deluge of industry-funded attacks that stifled our progress.
Although I was proud of the work that the “Food Babe Army” was doing, I became increasingly frustrated that our government was turning a blind eye and allowing food companies to poison Americans with ingredients that are either banned or restricted in other countries.
This past September I had the opportunity to testify before the U.S. Senate where I displayed the blatant hypocrisy of American food companies selling safer products in Europe and Canada, without artificial dyes and other man-made food additives. (1)
I shared the work that everyday citizens and the Food Babe Army have been doing on a grassroots level to force these companies to change over the last 10 years…
And then I addressed the elephant in the room.
I looked everybody in the eye that day and asked: “Isn’t this something that the people in Washington, our elected politicians, should be doing?”

Then in October (6 short months ago!) one thousand of us marched to Kellogg’s headquarters and demanded that they remove the artificial dyes from their cereals like they have done in nearly every other country in the world — Moms, dads, doctors, teachers, and concerned citizens from all over the country stood up for the health of our children, and we were met with a cold corporate slap in the face. (6)
We didn’t give up and we stayed loud!
I’ve been traveling the country over the last few months with several of my colleagues and fellow activists, including Calley Means and Jason Karp, in support of various state bills to remove artificial dyes from the food sold in schools, and in some instances, in the entire state.
Just last month, West Virginia became the first state to ban all artificial dyes from food sold in the state, despite efforts of Big Food lobbyists to dismantle the legislation. All of this has been setting the stage for this at the federal level and now it’s happening!

This was the effort of so many amazing activists, nonprofit organizations, documentaries, podcasters, celebrities, authors, health leaders, doctors and everyday citizens who have used their platforms and voices to elevate this to the center stage.
I especially want to recognize and thank some incredible allies. Thank you Calley Means for standing by my side and making this happen right along with me. Thank you Jason Karp for bringing me out of “retirement.” Thank you Ryland Englehart for planting this seed. Thank you Zuri Allen, John Roulac, Gary Ruskin, Del Bigtree, Zen Honeycutt, and Max Goldberg for your friendship, support, and expert guidance over the years. Thank you Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and Environmental Working Group (EWG) for your incredible research and activism. Thank you Lisa Leake who started the Kraft petition with me all those years ago, and Pulin Modi at Change.org. Look at where we are now!
I’m so grateful for all of you who marched with me to Kellogg’s last October, some of you traveling across the country to take part in the biggest petition ever asking a food corporation to change. I was blown away by your support and activism Courtney Swan, Alex Clark, Max Goldberg, Ginny Yurich, Dr. Will Cole, Dr. Josh Axe, Iliriana Balaj, Parker Brook, Iman Hasan, Dr. Staci Whitman, Dr. Joel Gator, Zuri Star, Rob Herring, Liana Werner-Gray, State Representative Brad Paquette, and State Senator Jonathan Lindsey.


When Kellogg’s told us to get off their lawn, they didn’t fully appreciate the public uproar it would create. And now the reckoning has taken place.
Because you made your voice heard…this is now FINALLY being addressed by the FDA.
We couldn’t have done this without everyone who signed and shared our petitions over the years, and told everyone to boycott these food corporations who are poisoning us with ingredients they don’t use in other countries. Thank you for being loud and coming together on this issue.
Finally, thank you Secretary Kennedy and Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary for your brave leadership in safeguarding our children.


It’s not just the dyes. American food companies are knowingly using several ingredients here in this country that they’ve removed abroad due to stricter regulations and to avoid warning labels. This isn’t just about ingredients, this is a moral issue. It is unethical and needs to stop.
I am looking forward to seeing every American food company remove ALL risky ingredients from their products that they don’t use in other countries.
It’s time to bring this to an end!!!

I was invited to speak at the White House this week to advocate for safer food for our children.

I was joined by a powerful coalition of moms who all want to get the harmful chemicals out of our food to protect our future generations.
To have this opportunity to expose the truth about how Big Food poisons us with ingredients they don’t use overseas was a DREAM COME TRUE.
I had my charts with me to show how billion-dollar corporations like PepsiCo, Kellogg’s, Mars, General Mills and Coca-Cola make safer versions of their products to sell in other countries.
You could hear gasps in the room as I went through the ingredient comparisons!
It was extraordinary to sit there across from the Department Secretaries (HHS, USDA, Education) where this is now a major topic of discussion!
I’m so grateful that we now have leaders at the highest levels of government who are making this a top priority and looking to make changes fast.

This week really felt like a “pinch me” moment because I can’t believe how far we’ve come in just the past few months…
Everything has been moving so fast, but nothing can stop us now.
This week I also spoke at the Florida State Capital in support of a bill that will require warning labels on products with artificial dyes, just like they have in Europe.
This is our moment!
But there is so much work to be done.
Most people still don’t know that food corporations have reformulated safer products to sell in Europe.

https://foodbabe.com/wk-kelloggs-ceo-gary-pilnick-breaks-his-silence-on-poisoning-american-kids-with-artificial-dyes-they-dont-use-overseas-video/,WK Kellogg’s CEO Gary Pilnick breaks his silence on poisoning American kids with artificial dyes they don’t use overseas (VIDEO),"WK Kellogg’s CEO Gary Pilnick finally breaks his silence since we delivered over 400,000 petitions to their front door on October 15th.
On that day we made history when close to 1,000 of us marched to their headquarters, asking them to remove the artificial dyes and BHT that they don’t use in other countries from their cereals. (1)
They ignored us and employees put a sign in the window that said “Get Off My Lawn”.
Kellogg’s executives refused to meet with me or any of the fellow activists, health leaders, and elected officials who were there with us that day. (1)
Since then, a massive Kellogg’s cereal boycott was started and Froot Loops sales have declined OVER 50% in the last 3 months (according to SPINS data). (2)
Our petition and boycott has been splashed all over the media, Good Morning America, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal… and yet Kellogg’s has remained largely silent.
Until now…
Mr. Pilnick was interviewed at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer & Retail Conference on December 4, 2024, where he was questioned about the massive amounts of news coverage on their use of these artificial dyes in American cereals. (3)
When I heard the CEO of Kellogg’s respond to why they use these dyes in America…but not in other countries…my mouth dropped to the floor!
If his cockiness and patronizing tone doesn’t make you want to boycott them even harder, I don’t know what will. I am honestly horrified that he sounds proud they are in the news for poisoning American children, while serving so many other countries better and safer ingredients. Kellogg’s company does not deserve one more red cent of our money.


Megan Clapp deserves a round of applause for asking the question that no other financial analyst has been brave enough to ask!
For them to go on the record saying “the reason why we use colors in our food is because we know it’s safe” without addressing the mountains of research and health experts who say otherwise is irresponsible.
They may try to pull the wool over our eyes, but the truth is getting out!
And that is because of all of you who are sharing this information and voting with your dollars at the grocery store.

https://foodbabe.com/general-mills-has-been-put-on-notice-remove-dyes-from-lucky-charms-cinnamon-toast-crunch-and-trix-in-america/,"General Mills has been put on notice: Remove dyes from Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Trix in America!","Our movement is growing bigger and faster than I could have ever imagined.
We are right in the middle of the onslaught on Kellogg’s, however… other companies need to take notice.
General Mills, who is also complicit with poisoning Americans with ingredients they don’t use in other countries came out with Trix in Australia (made in joint venture of General Mills and Nestle) that says right on the front of the box that it has “No Artificial Colours”.
Meanwhile in America they’re using 3 Artificial Dyes PLUS unidentified additional “color added”…which could be Titanium Dioxide (an ingredient linked to cancer and banned in Europe).


Soon after they removed the dyes, General Mills reported that sales “exceeded expectations” with great feedback from customers…
But later claimed that people missed the fluorescent-colored Trix and had to put the dyes back.

I’d eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch nearly every day when I was a kid and now I come to find out they use the same caramel coloring that we successfully campaigned to get removed from Starbucks drinks back in 2015. There are four different types of caramel color and two of those types (Class III and IV) contain the dangerous substance 4-methylimidazole (4-MeI), which is linked to cancer.
You won’t find the type (class) of caramel color on an American ingredient label, although this is required to be labeled in Europe. We reached out to General Mills and they confirmed via email that they use Class 4 in Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which is the most dangerous type:



NOTE: At the time I sent them this email, I was unaware that they use class IV caramel color, so this has now been added to my list of major concerns.

General Mills said they’ll comply with the new California law banning artificial dyes from schools, but still “working through” questions of how it plans to do that, “which could include reformulating products or removing them from the available options for California schools“.
If General Mills is reformulating for California schools, why can’t they do this everywhere? All citizens deserve these safer cereals.


I responded for further clarification and will update you here when I learn more.
Rumor has it that a school district is removing General Mills from their schools and replacing it with Nature’s Path (an organic brand without artificial dyes or BHT). This would be a huge blow to General Mills and could get the ball rolling in a direction that they can’t pull back from.
I really feel like General Mills could position themselves as the leader here, but they don’t have much time to make a decision. The writing is on the wall now about where the regulations are headed. Other states are looking at banning artificial dyes from schools. And with RFK Jr. positioned to head the HHS, he has already gone on the record stating that he is going to ask the cereal companies to remove the dyes.
General Mills should step up now, to avoid a PR disaster like what Kellogg’s is currently experiencing.
All they need to do is announce their plans for removing artificial dyes and BHT from all of their cereals in America, just like they are doing for school districts in California and as they are doing in other countries.
This will encourage other brands to do the same, and they will be seen as the hero.
You can contact General Mills here or on their social media channels:

(ha ha, I’m joking of course…)
I was thrilled to see a respected food policy expert calling out Froot Loops and warning parents everywhere about their awful ingredients.

Dr. Darin Detwiler has been advocating for food safety for the last 31 years and counting. He tragically lost his son, Riley, in 1993 to an E.coli infection that he contracted from another child – traced back to Jack In The Box hamburgers. This really propelled him into a life-long career of consulting for the USDA, FDA, and food corporations on how to improve their policies.
I knew I needed to get Dr. Detwiler’s take on our Cancel Kellogg’s campaign, and what he really thinks about Kellogg’s selling cereals with safer ingredients in other countries. I contacted him and was so thankful that he agreed to do a live interview with me last night.
Some of the most compelling parts of our conversation were:
I really hope Kellogg’s was watching… because at one point I asked Dr. Detwiler what he would say to Kellogg’s CEO if he could talk to him. You’ve got to see what he said for yourself…

I’m putting out a formal request for anyone who has insider information on Big Food or our Kellogg’s boycott to contact me. You can remain anonymous, but we want to hear from you!

Kellogg’s Cereal Heiress Exposes Kellogg’s Froot Loops and says to “BOYCOTT”,"Ever since we delivered 400,000 signed petitions to Kellogg’s headquarters asking them to sell us the same safer cereals they sell in other countries, I have been contacted several insiders and whistleblowers who want to help our campaign.
I was contacted by Victoria Kellogg, the great great great granddaughter of W.K. Kellogg, the founder of Kellogg’s, who started the business selling Corn Flakes to the public in 1906.
Victoria said that she wanted to advocate for our petition asking Kellogg’s to drop artificial food dyes from their cereals in America. When I called her and asked her if she would be willing to do a live interview, she said yes. I never thought a member of the Kellogg’s legacy family would ever want to speak out about their unethical business practices. But she did. And it’s one of the most heroic conversations I have had. I am so impressed by her courage to demand a boycott on Kelloggs, even though it will affect her financially.


I also received an email from another relative of W.K. Kellogg, Jeannie Kellogg Keyes. Here’s what she wrote to me:

When we arrived at their front steps with more than 400,000 signed petitions, we were met with a sign in a high-rise window that said “Get Off My Lawn”.
Their executives refused to meet with any of us. Even a Kellogg’s shareholder and elected officials were denied a meeting to discuss why they sell safer versions of their cereals in other countries without artificial dyes or BHT.
This is a slap in every American’s face! They do not care about us and they do not care about children.
This is why NO ONE should be buying Kellogg’s products. Kellogg’s is Anti-American and does not deserve one more dollar from any citizen.
Last year, Kellogg’s split into two separate companies, and sold off all of their other brands like Eggos and Poptarts. Now they mostly just sell cereal.


This is important because most Americans don’t know the truth about their food.
Not everyone knows that Kellogg’s sells safer cereals in other countries.
Not everyone knows that artificial dyes and BHT are linked to cancer and other health risks, especially in children.
Schools throughout the country are serving Apple Jacks and Froot Loops full of dyes and BHT to American children for breakfast. It’s a travesty.

https://foodbabe.com/the-insane-ingredients-in-lemonade-homemade-lemonade-recipe/,The insane ingredients in lemonade + Homemade Lemonade Recipe,"I recently went to the store and evaluated every lemonade brand I could find…and let me tell you, the ingredients FLOORED me.
If you love lemonade as much as I do, it can be super frustrating when you can’t find a single brand without processed ingredients.
Lemonade should be made with just lemons, water, and sugar (or honey)…
But almost every brand out there (even organic like Santa Cruz Lemonade) contains “Natural Flavors”. You’ll also find flavors added to fast food lemonades like Chipotle’s Organic Lemonade, McDonald’s Lemonade, and Wendy’s “All-Natural” Lemonade.
Natural Flavors are used as a way to use fewer lemons, so it is much cheaper to produce. These flavors are NOT natural and are made in a lab. They also can contain dozens of different chemicals, preservatives, and emulsifiers, none of which are labeled.


The ingredient list on Minute-Maid Lemonade “Made with Real Lemons” is insane. Sure, there’s some real lemon juice in there, but it’s also full of high fructose corn syrup, artificial preservatives, and artificial dyes!
It’s alarming that they add the synthetic preservative sodium benzoate to this, because with this chemical is mixed with vitamin C (naturally found in lemons!) it can produce BENZENE, a known carcinogen.

Cans of Minute Maid Zero Sugar have THREE different Artificial Sweeteners linked to cancer: Aspartame, Acesulfame Potassium, and Sucralose.
These sweeteners are also linked to weight gain. Although artificial sweeteners have no calories, they have been shown to contribute to weight gain by encouraging sugar cravings. Research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. Stay far away from these ingredients!



I try to avoid Stevia because it’s linked to fertility issues and endocrine disruption. There is also research showing it may kill good bacteria in the gut. I’d rather have a natural sweetener like honey in my lemonade.

CITRIC ACID: Heavily processed preservative and flavoring made from sugar fed to fungus (a GMO black mold, not fruit). It can contribute to a leaky gut, or make it hard to heal from a leaky gut.
ASPARTAME: A peer-reviewed study in France found that consuming this artificial sweetener may increase the risk of breast cancer up to 22%. It was originally created in a lab during pharmaceutical development and was found to be sweet on accident when a researcher licked his finger.
STEVIA EXTRACT: Linked to reduced fertility, endocrine disruption, and may kill good bacteria in the gut.
SOY LECITHIN: Emulsifier likely derived from GMO soybeans and extracted with hexane, a neurotoxin.
MALTODEXTRIN: Heavily processed powder, often made from GMO corn. Linked to increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune conditions, gastrointestinal issues – gas and diarrhea.
BHA: Shown to be an endocrine disruptor, linked to cancer, causing tumors in animal studies. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies BHA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans“ and it’s been deemed a “reasonably anticipated human carcinogen” by the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, National Toxicology Program.
SODIUM BENZOATE: A synthetic preservative that when combined with either ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can produce benzene, a known carcinogen.
POTASSIUM SORBATE: This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer. It has also been shown to induce DNA damage when combined with vitamin C (naturally found in lemonade).
It’s made purely with filtered water, lemon juice, and honey – it’s incredibly refreshing and delicious!

https://foodbabe.com/is-there-a-healthy-popsicle-watch-out-for-these-ingredients/,Is there a healthy Popsicle? Watch out for these ingredients!,"Our family loves to cool down on hot days with popsicles, but I don’t buy most brands.
I even stay away from those ones that say they’re “Made with Real Fruit”, because I’ve found out that it’s a lie. The fruit is so heavily processed and there’s a lot more going on in those frozen pops besides real fruit!
I recently investigated every single popsicle at the grocery store, and filmed a quick video to show you what I found. Make sure to watch this before you buy any more popsicles!

Almost every brand is packed with so many unhealthy ingredients like tons of added refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, gums, and fake flavors.
Even most organic brands and those “Made With Real Fruit” bars contain added flavors and gums. And if you’re not careful, you might get sabotaged with artificial colors and artificial sweeteners too.


HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP: Increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia.
JUICE CONCENTRATES: Fruit juice heated into a syrup, which makes it higher in sugar, lower in fiber, and lower in nutrients. Experts say it is similar to high-fructose corn syrup!
SUCRALOSE: Artificial sweetener made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine. Has been linked to leukemia and related blood cancers in animal studies.
ACESULFAME POTASSIUM: Another artificial sweetener that Center for Science in Public Interest says to avoid it because safety testing was inadequate and some research links it to cancer.
GUAR GUM: A thickening ingredient which can kill healthy gut bacteria, and disrupt the microbiome. It can lead to bloating and a “bubble gut” feeling in your stomach.
CARRAGEENAN: Thickener and emulsifier linked to digestive issues and cancer.
ARTIFICIAL COLORS: Dyes derived from petroleum, linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe.
I will sometimes buy organic frozen treats like JonnyPops or GoodPop. These both contain added natural flavors and gums though, so they are not ideal. My kids love Sweet Nothings Squeezable Smoothies and these are like popsicles to them. These are organic and made with real fruit & veggies, and taste incredible! They also make Dessert Pops, like Chocolate Peanut Butter that are an awesome replacement for Fudge Pops. I recently found out about Chloe’s, which are made with just fruit, sugar, and lemon juice (but they are not organic). You can find these brands in natural food grocery stores.
Let me show you how ridiculously easy it is to make delicious frozen treats with fresh fruit and vegetables. It’s as simple as making a smoothie…and you freeze it like a popsicle!
These Superfood Pops from my newest cookbook, Food Babe Family, pack a super nutritional punch in each bite. They are seriously HEALTHY popsicles that taste great!

https://foodbabe.com/brave-mother-calls-out-school-district-for-serving-junk-food-to-kids-video/,Brave mother calls out school district for serving junk food to kids (Video),"There’s nothing I love more than watching people use their voices to improve our food, especially the food they are serving our kids in schools. Most schools are serving Kellogg’s Froot Loops full of artificial dyes and sugars, re-heated processed meals laden with refined vegetable oils and refined flours, “reduced fat” Doritos, and even pizza like Domino’s made with awful ingredients. It’s despicable.
If I could wave a magic wand and improve the food that schools are serving, I would. Unfortunately, I am not in the position to wipe the slate clean. This is a massive issue and an uphill battle that will require a united movement to make sweeping changes. That’s not to say that there isn’t anything we can do.
The best way to make a difference, is to start at the local level, in your own school district. In the introduction of my book Food Babe Family, I tell the story of how I worked to change Pizza Friday’s at my daughter’s school from Domino’s to a local organic pizza place. This wasn’t easy, but I highlighted this story in the book in hopes that it would inspire other parents out there to do the same.

“Hello, Vani! I have been enthusiastically following you for some time now. My two daughters absolutely love your mom’s dal recipe – I make it regularly for them and we inhale it! I was very much inspired by your advocacy around the awful school lunches served to kids. I wanted to let you know that I recently spoke to my local school board about the deplorable items on the menus. My words generated a lot of buzz and they are now looking to improve these menus!” – Amanda A.

Change in schools is possible and you can make a difference too.
Think outside the box when it comes to food being served in your child’s school. Are there any small changes you can make? Are there any specific products that you can get swapped out for a healthier alternative? Anything with artificial colors is a great place to start!
You can do what I did, and you can also do what this mother did. Come armed with research and ask directly for what you want.
Get other parents involved if you need to. When you work together, you can make a difference even faster. Remember that any changes you spur will not only help your child, but other children at their school too— especially those who rely on cafeteria food for all their lunches and snacks.

The other day Kellogg’s posted a picture of original Apple Jacks from the 1960’s on Instagram, which just proves that their cereals are MORE TOXIC than ever.

But they contained fewer artificial dyes (AKA certified colors) and NO natural flavors. They were flavored simply with dried apples and cinnamon.
The ingredients remained essentially the same for 30 more years…until they drastically changed in the late 1990’s.

Studies showed that children would be more drawn to the product and would eat more of it, if it was brighter and more colorful.
So, Kellogg’s added in MORE dyes to make the bright green and orange Apple Jacks that we have today.
Kellogg’s cereals are now some of the most unhealthy products on the market, and they continue to poison our children with artificial colors, artificial flavors, hydrogenated oils, BHT, and GMO corn, all coated and loaded with refined sugars.
These artificial dyes are made from petroleum and are linked to several health issues like ADHD and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. Recent research shows they may also disrupt the immune system.
Meanwhile they create healthier versions of their products for other countries, like Apple Jacks colored naturally with turmeric and paprika in Australia, without any BHT.


Why don’t they do that here??? They clearly already have the formula.
How do we get them to change?
Stop buying Kellogg’s Cereal and tell your friends!
This is the strongest way to send a message to Kellogg’s headquarters that we don’t want cereals made with GMOs, artificial colors, BHT, and fake flavors.
Our petition asking Kellogg’s to remove artificial dyes & BHT (as they do in other countries) has nearly reached 100k signatures! Kellogg’s is surely feeling the heat now.

Please share the petition to your social media channels today on Instagram and Facebook.

https://foodbabe.com/dont-let-kelloggs-get-away-with-this-crime-keep-the-pressure-on/,Don’t let Kellogg’s get away with this CRIME! Keep the pressure on.,"I was interviewed on TV this week, where I shared the latest on our Kellogg’s petition asking them to remove all artificial dyes and BHT from their cereals. They don’t use these ingredients in other countries, so they already know how to do it. These ingredients are known to cause hyperactivity in children and can even increase the risk of cancer. It maddens me that Kellogg’s knows this, yet fails to do anything about it.
Kellogg’s has their shareholders meeting today. Let’s send them a strong message that we are holding them accountable for their actions. We are forming a coalition of activists and health experts who are passionate about this issue, Jason Karp, Calley Means, Jesse Itzler, Dr. Mark Hyman and more. We won’t back down until Kellogg’s does the right thing. The FDA and our regulatory agencies are asleep at the wheel and not doing anything about it, so we are leading this charge.


We are SO CLOSE to 100,000 signatures on our petition. Have you signed it yet?

https://foodbabe.com/shake-shacks-ingredients-are-a-mile-long-is-it-really-the-healthier-fast-food/,Shake Shack’s ingredients are a mile long! Is it really the healthier fast food?,"Shake Shack announced they’re giving away their antibiotic-free chicken sandwiches for FREE every Sunday this month, which is a pretty brilliant marketing move… taking a jab at Chick-fil-A who just went back to using antibiotics in their chicken.
But Wait!!
Before you run down to Shake Shack this Sunday to grab your free chicken sandwich, there’s something you need to know.
Shake Shack doesn’t publish their ingredient lists online, which makes it difficult to know what you are really eating. I’ve tried to get their ingredients in the past, and they refused to disclose them to me… but now I’m happy to report that I’ve got Shake Shack’s ingredients for their burgers, sandwiches, fries, and shakes in my hot little hands.
I hate to pick on one of the few restaurants who are serving antibiotic-free meats, but when I saw Shake Shack’s ingredients, there was no way I could keep them to myself.
And let me tell you, I think they should feel ashamed using so many processed ingredients especially with a slogan like “Stand For Something Good”.
Shake Shack doesn’t use hormones or antibiotics in their meat, which is great, but don’t assume that means they use good ingredients in their menu items.
They say, “Food is at the center of what we do. We’re committed to sourcing real, premium ingredients to deliver menu items our guests crave and can feel good about eating. Guided by our vision of quality and food safety, our culinary team continues to craft high-quality menu items, surprising and delighting guests with innovative recipes.”  (1)
Is that true?
Well, now you can see for yourself:


AUTOLYZED YEAST EXTRACT: Shake Shack may not use MSG (monosodium glutamate) but they do use this hidden form of MSG. It is purely used to increase food cravings and irresistibility, so you can’t stop eating. (2)
NATURAL FLAVORS: Besides the hidden MSG to get you hooked, Shake Shack uses 5 different “natural flavors” in their chicken sandwich. You’ll find them in their buttermilk and butter, along with natural onion flavor, natural garlic flavor, and capsicum flavoring in their chicken. These natural flavors are proprietary mixtures made in lab, designed to make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. It is very similar to MSG. No wonder their sandwiches taste irresistible! (2)
TBHQ: You’ll find this preservative in the fryer oil at Shake Shack. It may harm the immune system and increase the risk of food allergies. (2)
DIMETHYLPOLYSILOXANE (aka Silly Putty): This is an anti-foaming ingredient used in the fryers at Shake Shack. Funny that other restaurant fryers seem to work just fine without this ingredient. Besides being the main ingredient in Silly Putty, it was used as a filler fluid in breast implants until it was phased out due to safety concerns. This ingredient was deemed unsafe to put into our bodies, but we are supposed to eat it? (2)
DATEM & MONO AND DIGLYCERIDES: Contains trans fat which is correlated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. (3)
SOYBEAN OIL: Increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, heart disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (2)
CALCIUM PROPIONATE: This preservative disrupts the metabolism and can promote weight gain. (4)
POLYSORBATE 80: An emulsifier linked to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. (5)
GUAR GUM & XANTHAN GUM: These emulsifiers can kill beneficial bacteria in your gut and decrease bacterial diversity, which may contribute to an array of chronic inflammatory diseases. (6)

It’s quite shocking to see Shake Shack’s ingredients compared to what’s in Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s. They use many of the same processed ingredients like calcium propionate, soybean oil, DATEM, mono and diglycerides, and dimethylpolysiloxane (aka Silly Putty). Shake Shake still even uses TBHQ in their fryer oil, which happens to be one of the ingredients that Chick-fil-A removed after I met with them. (7)

The ShackBurger has a whopping 73 ingredients. Those “Non-GMO” potato buns are filled with a slew of dough conditioners, preservatives, and emulsifiers.
And that Shack Sauce? It’s mostly Canola Oil, which is an unhealthy refined oil linked to inflammation and heart health risks. (2) The sauce is preserved with Potassium Sorbate. This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer (8)
Just like the chicken sandwich, the ShackBurger is packed with 4 different natural flavors to give it that irresistible taste. No wonder they are so popular!

While I love that Shake Shack doesn’t use antibiotics or hormones in their beef, there is more to making good food. They really don’t need to use all of these processed ingredients to make a burger. One of their biggest rivals is Five Guys… and neither one is really any healthier than the other.

Shake Shack coats their fries in soybean, canola, and cottonseed oils, which are the worst oils on the planet. These oils come from GMO crops and are processed to DEATH with chemical solvents, steamers, neutralizers, de-waxers, bleach and deodorizers. (9) Then they fry them up in refined soybean oil preserved with TBHQ along with the Silly Putty ingredient, Dimethylpolysiloxane. Why not just use potatoes, oil, and salt??

Their grilled cheese sandwich has the same bun and cheese that they use in the ShackBurger, so it’s loaded with the same dough conditioners and preservatives.

The base of their shakes is their vanilla custard, which they blend with milk to make their vanilla shake. The custard contains a “stabilizer blend” that consists of some very problematic ingredients:
MONO AND DIGLYCERIDES: This ingredient is a hidden source of trans fat, which is detrimental to heart health. (3)
CELLULOSE GUM: This thickener & emulsifier is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. It may alter gut bacteria, increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, significant weight gain, and cancer. (2)
LOCUST BEAN GUM: Similar to cellulose gum, this can alter gut bacteria and lead to various inflammatory diseases. These gums also often cause bloating and that “bubble gut” feeling in your stomach because they slow down your digestion. (6)
CARRAGEENAN: This thickener and emulsifier can cause digestive problems and intestinal inflammation. Tests have found that “food-grade carrageenan” is contaminated with up to 25% of “degraded carrageenan” (the kind not supposed to be used in food and drinks). Degraded carrageenan is classified as a “possible human carcinogen” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. (2)


Number one on my wish list would be to stop using all those refined oils (soybean oil, canola oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil) in everything and to switch to a healthier oil like avocado oil in their fryers…without the TBHQ and Silly Putty, of course.
Then, they could take that nasty “stabilizer blend” out of their custard and shakes. There is nothing good about filling your famous shakes with unnecessary additives linked to heart disease, cancer, and inflammatory diseases.
And what about all of those natural flavors in everything? What would happen if Shake Shack lived up to their promise to use “real, premium ingredients” and actually used real food?
It would be INCREDIBLE to see them make these changes, wouldn’t it?
Maybe they’ll see this post and agree that it’s time to clean up their food.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/is-this-ingredient-giving-you-a-bubble-gut-watch-out-for-gums-added-to-these-popular-foods-and-drinks/,Is this ingredient giving you a BUBBLE GUT? Watch out for “Gums” added to these popular foods and drinks!,"The other day my friend told me that she had been drinking a bottled protein shake every morning, and she suspected that it was making her feel like she had a “bubble gut” a few hours later.
You know that feeling when you have to unzip your pants because they feel too tight? When you feel so bloated that you can’t get comfortable? When you just want to put on your stretchy pants and lie on the couch?
She asked me to review the ingredients for her…and so I grabbed the bottle and it didn’t take me long to spot the culprit on the ingredient list. Her daily protein shake had THREE different “gums” listed on the label.


All of these gums are added to foods to thicken the consistency and as “Emulsifiers” to suspend ingredients evenly throughout the product so it does not separate.
Think about what these thickening ingredients are doing inside your GUT and to your digestive system.
They sit in your stomach like a glob of thickening goo. This leads to that awful bloated, gassy, “bubble gut” feeling.
After they stew in your stomach, some people experience constipation and others get diarrhea. Gums make you feel like crap…literally!
If that’s not awful enough…
A deep dive study by researchers from the University of Michigan Medical School and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences looked into how we digest (or don’t!) Xanthan Gum. They found that it may alter the gut microbiome. (1, 2)
A previous study in 2021, published in Gastroenterology, investigated Carboxymethylcellulose (aka cellulose gum) consumption in humans and found that it “detrimentally” alters intestinal microbiota composition and may contribute to an array of chronic inflammatory diseases. (3, 4) There are multiple studies on guar gum, cellulose gum, and other gums that have found they negatively affect your microbiome. (5, 6, 7)
When your microbiome isn’t filled with a rich and diverse composition of bacteria, your health can go downhill very fast. An unhealthy gut can lead to mental disorders like depression, obesity and difficulty in losing weight, nutritional deficiencies, depleted immune system, autoimmune diseases, and gastrointestinal illnesses. (8)
If you want good health, you need to keep your microbiome healthy. PERIOD.
It’s like a garden, and you need to keep it watered, colorful, and alive! This is why probiotics and fermented foods are so good for you.
Sadly, many of the products that gums are found in are daily go-to products like protein shakes, coffee creamers, and non-dairy milks.
Want to add some creamer to your morning coffee? GELLAN GUM!
Want to whip up a smoothie with almond milk to bring to work? GUAR GUM!
Want to grab a quick ready-to-drink protein shake after your workout? XANTHAN GUM!
We are being bombarded by gums, and you can barely escape it!









I was sick of all of the processed additives, preservatives, flavors, emulsifiers, and gums in my food and drinks, even in products that you’d think would be “healthy” like an organic protein shake! At Truvani our top priority is ingredients. We believe in real food without added chemicals. Products without toxins. Labels without lies.

https://foodbabe.com/chick-fil-a-cancels-antibiotic-free-chicken-heres-why-this-is-devastating-for-everyone/,Chick-fil-A cancels antibiotic-free chicken (Here’s why this is devastating for everyone!),"It was my birthday last week…but I got the worst present ever. That morning Alex Clark of the Spillover Podcast DM’d me: “Someone sent me this!”
Along with a screenshot from Chick-fil-A’s app stating that they are cancelling their “No Antibiotics Ever” standard, and would start selling chicken raised with antibiotics this Spring:


As soon as I saw this, I was devastated and disgusted by their horrible decision.
People who eat at Chick-fil-A believe they’re eating Antibiotic-Free chicken because they made a huge announcement about this when they made the switch 10 years ago, and it has been a big part of their marketing. (1)
I knew the public needed to know about this change ASAP.
I didn’t waste a minute. I urgently contacted every major news organization with this information. Then I filmed a quick reel and posted it on my social media. I was doing everything I could to get this news out.





A reporter replied back to me and published the news that afternoon. (2) Now the story has been picked up by all major news outlets (Washington Post, NY Times, CNN, ABC, CBS, Fox). It’s everywhere.

While I’m happy the word is out about Chick-fil-A’s chicken, it’s driving me crazy that the media isn’t delving into what this change really means.
For example…
Antibiotics that are “not important to human medicine” aren’t used in humans, so it’s assumed they don’t affect human health. However, this is not the case. (3)
The research shows that antibiotics “not important to human medicine” still harm human health.
Experts warn these antibiotics may still lead to resistance to other antibiotics that are used by humans: “Resistance genes don’t discriminate”. (4, 5)
Overusing ANY antibiotic – whether it’s “important to human medicine”, or not, is promoting resistant bacteria. These antibiotics, such as ionophores, are not subjected to the same regulations as medically-important antibiotics and their impact may be silently devastating to the future of human medicine. (6)
The FDA allows antibiotics to be used for:
It is very common for chickens to be sick while living in crowded and unsanitary factory farms. (8)
Does this mean Chick-fil-A’s chickens will receive antibiotics to prevent diseases living in crowded factory farms that often have sick birds?
“Disease prevention” is a real loophole here, and the question is – will Chick-fil-A exploit it?
These are the questions we should be asking.
While it’s true that I haven’t eaten Chick-fil-A in over a decade because of the horribly processed ingredients they use (over 50 in their sandwich alone!), this change affects us all.
Factory farms use 80% of the nations antibiotics, and they have been heavily relied upon and OVERUSED for decades. They were initially given to help farmers grow animals faster and bigger on less food, but now they are widely given to prevent diseases in filthy, crowded farming conditions. (9, 10)
This overuse of antibiotics is creating a major health issue. It has caused an emergence of deadly bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics. It’s in our soil, water, air, and food.
In other words, if you were to take an antibiotics for an infection, it may not work because it’s resistant to antibiotics.
This issue is deeply personal. Several years ago my Dad was infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and was hospitalized as a result. Needless to say, it was one of the most stressful and scary times of my life. Thankfully with good medical care, my Dad survived but the antibiotics he was supposed to be given to treat the infection were deemed useless.
This problem is growing. Over 2 million Americans suffer from antibiotic-resistant infections every year, and 35,000 people die. (11)
If this continues, they say antibiotics could become useless by 2050, making antibiotic-resistance the leading cause of death. (12)
This is insanity!
I believe this is one of the most important health issues of our time, and Chick-fil-A going back to antibiotic-raised meat is very harmful to all of us.
They agreed!  At first they told me it would be nearly impossible, but in early 2014 made the commitment to serve antibiotic-free chicken. When this news hit, I screamed so loud that every neighbor within a mile radius must have heard me. And then tears of joy started rolling down my face.


WE DID IT.
Or did we??
Now 10 years later, they cancel it overnight and go back to serving the same conventional chicken you’ll find at McDonald’s and other fast food places.
Moms Across America tested the food from popular fast food chains in 2023 and 60% of the samples contained the antibiotic Monensin and 40% contained Narasin. (13)
They also found Nicarbazin in Chick-fil-A, a contraceptive and anti-parasitic drug that has been prohibited from use.
Remember this next time someone tries to tell you that these drugs don’t end up in our food!

Last year, Tyson announced they would go back to using antibiotics to raise their chickens. (14) They are a major supplier of restaurants and fast food chains, and reportedly this includes Taco Bell, KFC, McDonald’s, Burger King, Popeyes, and Chick-fil-A. (15)
In February of this year, Panera Bread quietly removed all signage from their restaurants that said “No Antibiotics Ever,” “Vegetarian Fed,” “Grass Fed Pasture Raised,”  and “Animal Welfare”. Then it was leaked that they loosened their ingredient standards ahead of a planned IPO. Panera now allows the use of antibiotics in their pork (bacon) and turkey. (16)
This is what we need to do:

https://foodbabe.com/legal-demand-to-kelloggs-drop-the-artificial-dyes-and-bht-you-dont-use-in-other-countries/,Legal demand to Kellogg’s: Drop the artificial dyes and BHT you don’t use in other countries!,"My dear friend and activist Jason Karp launched a major legal campaign on Kellogg’s last week.
He hired one of the top lawyers in the country, Alex Spiro, and sent a letter to Kellogg’s demanding that they sell Americans the same cereals they sell in other countries without artificial dyes and BHT: “as a minimum first step, Kellogg must reinstate — and immediately deliver on — its commitment to remove artificial dyes from its products.”
Kellogg’s continues selling Americans cereals full of artificial dyes they don’t use in other countries, even after promising in the media nearly 10 YEARS ago that they would be removing them. (1) And most of these cereals target our kids. It’s so unethical!
In the letter they ask for a meeting with WK Kellogg’s Board of Directors to discuss the timeline for removing these ingredients and state that they “will not hesitate to hold Kellogg’s leadership accountable”.
BOOM!!!!
Read the letter from attorney Alex Spiro to Kellogg’s in its entirety here:




“Kellogg’s Froot Loops made with ‘harmful additives’ despite vow to remove dyes” – New York Post (3/14/24)
“DealBook: Activist investing in the cereal aisle” – The New York Times (3/14/24)
I love seeing this information back in the news. People should know about this and demand better. Kellogg’s should not be able to get away with this.
But it sure is interesting to see how the FDA defends artificial dyes when you’re challenging a powerful billion dollar food corporation, like Kellogg’s.
For example, look at these quotes from the media coverage:
The groundbreaking University of Southampton Study in 2007 found a strong link between artificial dye and sodium benzoate consumption in children and hyperactivity. (2)
This led the European Food Safety Authority to require all products that contain the “Southampton Six” artificial food dyes (Yellow #6, Quinoline Yellow, Carmoisine, Red #40, Yellow #5, and Ponceau 4R) to carry a warning label that they “may have an effect on activity and attention in children”. (3)
Instead, they use fruit and vegetable concentrates to color their cereals.

In 2021, the state of California backed Europe’s findings, after conducting a 2-year scientific review of 7 artificial dyes approved by the FDA:
“Overall, human studies indicate that synthetic food dyes are associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in children, and that children vary in their sensitivity to synthetic food dyes…current federal levels for safe intake of synthetic food dyes may not sufficiently protect children’s behavioral health. The levels were established by the US Food and Drug Administration decades ago and do not reflect newer research.” (4)
Artificial colors have also been shown to affect memory and learning, causing changes to neurotransmitters in the brain! (4) Additional research shows they disrupt the immune system (5) and are laced with carcinogens.(6)
Clearly, these dyes come with several scientifically-backed health risks.
Who are they covering for?
Why are they protecting Big Food brands like Kellogg’s?
When you read these articles, call them out for it!
I launched my 2nd petition to Kellogg’s in 2019, asking them to keep their promise and dump the dyes. The Food Babe Army went wild sharing this petition and we gathered over 50k signatures in a few months. As I was getting ready to book a flight to take these signed petitions to Kellogg’s headquarters in Michigan, the unexpected happened. The world came to a screeching halt when Covid hit, and this put a big wrench in our plans.
But now it’s time. We are going to hit them from every angle, forming a powerful coalition with incredible activists… Jason Karp, Jesse Itzler, Calley Means, and more!
Along with YOU and the entire Food Babe Army!!!
If you agree it’s time to stop poisoning our children with ingredients that Kellogg’s knows they should not use, especially since they already make safer versions overseas, please do these two things today:

https://foodbabe.com/health-damaging-plastic-chemicals-found-in-gerber-cheerios-wendys-fast-food-and-more-see-the-list/,"Health-damaging plastic chemicals found in Gerber, Cheerios, Wendy’s fast food, and more (See the list!)","If you need another reason to stop eating ultra-processed packaged products and fast food,, this might be the motivation you need.
A breaking new report found that many of the most popular food and drinks sold in grocery stores and in fast food drive-thru’s are laden with hazardous chemicals from plastics that can seriously harm your health over time. (1)
It’s not just the ingredients in Wendy’s, Coca-Cola, and Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream that we need to watch out for. There are chemicals in these products that seep in when they come in contact with packaging materials, or the plastic tubing, conveyor belts, and gloves used during food processing. (1)
You’ve probably heard about BPA in the lining of canned food, but now many brands have removed BPA and replaced it with other chemicals that are just as bad! Most of the products that Consumer Reports tested still had some levels of BPA in them, but…


Phthalates are the most common plasticizers (a chemical that makes plastic flexible and durable). Since they are used so much in food processing and packaging, these chemicals are showing up in our bodies, where they can harm our health over time. Experts say even low levels are harmful to the body, especially since we’re being exposed multiple times a day! No level is considered safe. (2)
The most contaminated product they tested is an organic brand – Annie’s Organic Cheesy Ravioli – which had 53,579 ng of phthalates per serving! That was nearly double the amount found in other highly contaminated products.
The other major offenders were Wendy’s Crispy Chicken Nuggets, Chicken of the Sea Pink Salmon, Moe’s Southwest Grill Chicken Burrito, Fairlife Core Power High Protein Chocolate Shakes, Del Monte Sliced Peaches, Chipotle Chicken Burrito, and Burger King Whopper With Cheese.
Most shocking is what they found in baby food!
The levels in baby food weren’t quite as high as other products tested, but babies and children are much more susceptible to the health-damaging effects of these chemicals in our food.



Based on this report, it appears that almost every product in a package is contaminated by chemicals used in plastics. The most important thing we can do, is raise awareness about this and ask these companies to test for BPA and phthalates, and to find the source of them in their products so they can get them out!
“Supermarket and fast-food chains, as well as food manufacturers, should also be required to take action, and should set specific goals for reducing and eliminating bisphenols and phthalates from all food packaging and processing equipment throughout their supply chains.” – James E. Rogers, PhD, product safety testing at Consumer Reports (1)
At home we can do our part too.
Eat fresh unpackaged food as much as possible, stop using plastic food containers and bags, and eat at home whenever you can. I like to use stainless steel and glass containers in my kitchen.

https://foodbabe.com/no-sugar-granola-recipe-perfect-for-a-sugar-detox/,No Sugar Granola Recipe – Perfect for a Sugar Detox,"I just baked up a batch of my No Sugar Granola in the oven and can’t wait to dig in. This is one of my favorite recipes on my 7-Day Sugar Detox, which I’m doing this week to get back on track after the holidays!
This granola is quick to make and has no sugar or sweeteners in it at all. It has that delicious crunch along with naturally-sweet coconut that makes it a savory and delicious topping for yogurt.
I also love to just snack on this granola all by itself. The healthy fats are so satisfying and it takes away any of my sugar cravings! If you have been struggling with sugar cravings lately, you’ve got to make this granola STAT! And for even more help, get my 7-Day Sugar Detox while it’s open this week (more details about that below!)

I pretty much stopped buying granola from the store years ago. Most brands taste stale, processed, and overly sweet. After you make your own granola, it’s really hard to go back to the packaged stuff!
There is also so much refined sugar added to popular brands of granola like Nature Valley and Love Crunch. You’ll often find several different types of sugar listed on the ingredient list.
I truly believe that one of the most insidious ways the food industry poisons us is by filling their products with refined sugar. The food industry knows that sugar is addicting and that sugar makes heavily processed foods taste good, so that’s why they have added it to practically everything! It may seem innocent, but what refined sugar does to the body is scandalous.
There is little to no nutritional value in these refined sugars. They have been chemically stripped of their minerals, so when you indulge in these sugars, you get no nutrition and your body becomes more acidic. As these sugars are devoid of minerals, they are acid-forming causing more inflammation. When your body stays in a state of inflammation, you are at a greater risk of developing various chronic diseases ranging from cancer, to heart disease, to digestive disorders.
Eating refined sugar is addictive, makes you fat, tired, depressed, age faster, makes your skin dull, weakens immunity and when consumed in excess causes all sorts of diseases… No thanks.
This is why I avoid refined sugar whenever possible. That means that when I go shopping I look for refined sugars on the ingredient label (see the list above for some main culprits). This also means that I don’t buy bags of cane sugar to stock in my kitchen pantry. I use natural nutrient-dense sweeteners at home instead such as maple syrup, honey, and coconut sugar.
I’m sorry to break the news, but most brands of granola contain at least 2 teaspoons of sugar per serving, and sometimes even more. Even organic brands like Love Crunch and Nature’s Path contain refined cane sugar. Here’s how much sugar you’ll find in one serving (1/2 cup) of your favorite brands:

Another reason I stopped buying packaged granola is because it’s usually made with inflammatory refined oils and added flavors. Does your granola contain these ingredients?
CANOLA OIL (found in Nature Valley, Post, Great Value, and Kind): Unhealthy refined oil linked to inflammation and heart health risks.
SOYBEAN OIL (found in Love Crunch and Nature’s Path): This unhealthy oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.
NATURAL FLAVORS (found in Love Crunch and Nature Valley Protein Granola): Proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. The ingredients in flavors are not listed, so you are in the dark about what you are eating.
I have a healthy granola recipe that I love to make during the holidays, and even though it doesn’t contain any refined sugar it still contains natural sugar from maple syrup and dried fruit. After the holidays are over and I want to get all sweets out of my diet, I love to make my No Sugar Granola from my 7-Day Sugar Detox instead.
I created this Sugar Detox Program because I used to be addicted to sugar, and this gives me an easy to follow meal plan with mouthwatering recipes to help me get back on track. Anytime I feel too much sugar creeping into my diet, I follow the plan and it makes me feel amazing. I use it to help myself and want it to help you too!
I opened up enrollment this week at a HUGE discount and I’d love to send this program to you:

I will show you that you CAN win the battle against sugar.
You CAN finally take control of your cravings.
And that you CAN enjoy more energy, fewer mood swings, and lose weight.
You don’t need to starve yourself. You don’t need to eat processed, pre-packaged “sugar-free” foods. All you need is this simple, step-by-step plan that’s worked for thousands of people.
To give you a little taste, I’m sharing this No Sugar Granola recipe from the Sugar Detox Recipe Guide that I’m sure you’ll love as much as I do.

To make this granola, you simply mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl and spread it out onto a cookie sheet. Then you bake it at 325 degrees for 12-15 minutes until it’s crunchy and nicely toasted. After it cools, you can store it in a glass jar for up to a week. It makes about 4 cups!

https://foodbabe.com/i-quit-eating-sugar-and-look-what-happened-to-my-body-true-story/,I quit eating sugar and look what happened to my body! (True Story),"I’m a little embarrassed to admit this.
But I want to share a personal story with you because I know it might help you.
It was one of the biggest reminders in my life that diet is so powerful, and that we truly are what we eat.
Although I eat healthy most of the time, I’ve always loved sweets…(a little too much!)
This comes back to bite me every few months if I’m not careful.
Especially this time of year when I’m surrounded by so many cookies and candies!
A few years back, I completely went off the rails.
After I gave birth to my son, I started eating candy every night.
And not just one piece.
I was binging on ENTIRE BAGS of organic YumEarth Licorice and Giggles (which are like organic Skittles).

I began looking forward to my special treat every night after dinner. It became an addiction.
Sure, it was “organic” candy, but this is when organic doesn’t matter. Sugar has detrimental effects on the human body, whether it’s organic or not.
I wasn’t only sabotaging myself with sugar. I was also ordering take out food often – and even though it was from healthy places – they still use inflammatory vegetable oils to cook their food along with dairy and gluten, which also feeds inflammation in the body.
With a new baby, I obviously had a lack of sleep. Couple that with the stress of continuing to work, as I wasn’t able to take a maternity leave.
Now I had not one, but two children, while I was running two businesses. This all took a real toll on my body.
Allergy season hit me like a ton of bricks. I normally have a few sniffles here and there, but this time I was suffering from eczema breakouts all over my body.
Every time my baby would touch me with his little nails on my neck and my face, it would cause an inflammatory break out.
I had huge welts on my skin from my chest up.
My eczema came back so bad that I couldn’t see through my eyes, they were itchy and red all the time.
This made it impossible to do my work – I couldn’t be on camera and didn’t want to take any pictures. I wanted to hide. I felt awful and exhausted!
I talked to a doctor about it, and she told me what I was afraid to admit…
I needed to change my diet – remove all inflammatory foods like sugar. I knew she was right, but I really didn’t want to.
I was sleep deprived, working two jobs, and breastfeeding – which makes you SO HUNGRY.
I was told the only other alternative was to go on pharmaceutical steroids (Prednisone) to reduce my eczema and inflammation.
But this wasn’t going to solve my issue for good – I needed to address the root cause…which was my sugar addiction.
This is when push came to shove.
I told myself: I’m the Food Babe.
I know what I need to do…
I need to stop being weak and take control of my diet.
I CAN DO THIS.
One night I just did it.
I eliminated most dairy, gluten, and sugar from my diet.
20 days later…
My candy addiction and symptoms had disappeared!
This was the BEST THING I’d done for my health in a long time. I reset my palette. I started having more energy and felt really good.
This reminded me why I do what I do.

https://foodbabe.com/candy-cane-cookies-without-artificial-dyes/,Candy Cane Cookies (Without Artificial Dyes!),"This time of year is so fun with the kids, but one thing I don’t love are all of the red and green cookies filled with artificial dyes everywhere we go. That’s what makes this new candy cane cookie recipe a lifesaver! These are so fun to make for the holidays and you won’t be poisoning your loved ones with artificial ingredients.


As I wrote about in my new book, Food Babe Family, I have zero tolerance for artificial colors in my food or my children’s food. We don’t eat products with artificial colors…ever. This may sound extreme—but there are so many reasons why we shouldn’t be eating them, especially children.
Artificial colors…
You’ll find them listed on an ingredient label as Red 40, Red 3, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 1.



This is why it’s sooo much better to make homemade holiday cookies.
But don’t make this mistake…
Almost everyone reaches for food colors made by McCormick and Betty Crocker to make their holiday cookies, but this is a BIG MISTAKE.
These popular food colors are made with the same artificial dyes that you find in holiday cookies from the store.  Plus, they are suspended in a solution made with nasty processed ingredients like carrageenan, propylene glycol, and parabens (endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems).
To make cookies without artificial dyes at home, you’ll need natural food colors. There are natural coloring kits available made from real food like beets, spirulina, and turmeric, such as the Supernatural brand. The red color is simply made with BEETS…how amazing is that?!?

You simply make a basic sugar cookie dough and divide it into two portions. Then you add natural red coloring to one half and chill the dough for a couple of hours. This makes the dough really easy to work with, so you can effortlessly roll it into ropes and twist the white and red ropes together to make the twisted candy cane shape. This is super fun to do with the kids and creates great memories! Now you won’t need to buy those processed “ready to bake” Pillsbury cookies full of dyes and other shady ingredients…yay!

The cookies bake up perfectly on my favorite 360 Cookware cookie sheets. I use these stainless steel cookie sheets for all of my baking and couldn’t be happier! This is the same brand that makes the non-toxic slow cookers I use in my kitchen. Because I love their products so much, I was able to partner with them for a big discount for the Food Babe Army:


I hope you enjoy a batch (or two!) of these candy cane cookies with your family for the holidays. They also would make a great edible gift for someone on your list!
Here are more holiday cookie recipes without dyes that my family loves:
We also need to keep sharing the truth about artificial colors, because they are EVERYWHERE this time of year. Please share this post to spread the word.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/the-best-pumpkin-spice-cookies-gluten-free-refined-sugar-free/,The BEST Pumpkin Spice Cookies (Gluten Free & Refined Sugar Free!),"When I first tasted these I squealed with joy. Wow. These pumpkin spice cookies are perfectly crisp on the edges and soft and chewy on the inside. They are seriously sooo good and perfect for my kiddos.


Almost every holiday cookie out there is packed with refined white flour and refined white sugar…but not these babies! I use nutrient-dense oat flour that is gluten-free and sweeten the batch with organic coconut sugar and maple syrup.

I recommend using Arrowhead Mills Organic Oat Flour to make this recipe, as this will give you the most consistent result.
You can also make your own oat flour with One Degree Sprouted Rolled Oats and blend them into a flour in a blender. If you make your own oat flour it is very important to increase the total amount of oat flour to 1 3/4 cup in the recipe. These are my favorite oats because they are sprouted (making them more nutritious and easier to digest) and certified glyphosate-free. You don’t want no Roundup weed killer in your oats!
I often use organic coconut sugar and maple syrup in my baking because these natural sweeteners are unrefined, which means their vitamins and minerals are intact. White sugar is stripped of minerals and has an acidic affect on the body, so I try to avoid that as much as possible. You can take almost any recipe and substitute coconut sugar for the white sugar on a 1:1 ratio!


I’m totally obsessed with 360 Cookware* because their products are so high quality, made with stainless steel and free of any harmful coatings such as PFAS, PFOS, PFOA and PTFE.
The way they conduct the heat in the oven is great, and I come out with perfect cookies every time. I know these cookie sheets will last me a very long time and I’m so happy to have them in my kitchen!
This is a great time to get that cookware you’ve been eyeing at a big discount. I also highly recommend their slow cookers!



I hope you enjoy these gluten-free Pumpkin Spice Cookies with your friends and family this holiday season. You may want to double the batch because they won’t be able to stop at just one!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/sweet-potato-sausage-breakfast-casserole-in-the-slow-cooker-easy-prep-to-feed-a-crowd/,Sweet Potato & Sausage Breakfast Casserole in the Slow Cooker – Easy prep to feed a crowd!,"Things have been a little crazy at my house as I’m running around getting everything ready to host Thanksgiving for my family next week. That’s what makes this new breakfast casserole recipe such a lifesaver!


This holiday breakfast casserole is made in a slow cooker, so you can get it started right before bed…and in the morning breakfast will be ready! This is what I plan to make on holiday mornings, so breakfast is effortless and I can spend time with my family.
This casserole is made with layers of yummy veggies (spinach, onions, bell peppers!), pastured eggs, cheese, and organic sausage. It makes the perfect breakfast to feed a crowd of up to 8 people. Serve it with some fresh fruit and perhaps some organic sourdough toast…YUM.

This stainless steel slow cooker* is incredible for making soups, stews, meats, and I use the smaller 2.3 Quart Slow Cooker* to make my steel cut oats every night before bed.

You have to be very careful about the cookware you choose because many brands use coatings that contain toxic chemicals that can leach into your food. This is why you want to avoid all slow cookers with a ceramic insert – which is almost every brand out there.
As I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family, heavy metals can be especially harmful to children and babies. Exposure to heavy metals during childhood has been linked to ADHD, behavior problems, and learning disabilities. (1)
With 360 Cookware*, I don’t need to worry about any of that. Their products are stainless steel and free of any harmful coatings such as PFAS, PFOS, PFOA and PTFE.

This discount includes their amazing slow cookers (in 3 different sizes!), stainless steel cookie sheets, pots, and pans… which I all love.
Now is the perfect time to stock up so you’re ready for the holidays!

This ingredient is optional, but I use Bilinski’s Chicken Breakfast Sausages to make this casserole. These are made simply with organic meat and spices, and my family loves them. If you can’t find these near you, you can use another organic brand of breakfast sausage.
You want to especially avoid breakfast sausage that is made with conventional meat, which is raised in a factory farm where it’s pumped up with growth-promoting drugs and antibiotics.
When I was kid, I loved Banquet Brown n’ Serve Sausages, but man, those ingredients are atrocious! It’s made with “Mechanically Separated Turkey”, which is a paste-like meat product generally made from extra parts of turkey, which may include bones, nerves, and blood vessels. If that isn’t bad enough, these sausages are preserved with some risky chemicals: BHA and BHT, which are both linked to cancer in some animal studies. Stay far, far away from brands who use ingredients like this!
I use Laclare brand raw goat cheddar cheese in this casserole, which you can find in natural food grocery stores. This is cheddar cheese, but from goats instead of a cow, which is easier to digest for many people. You can also use grass-fed organic cheddar cheese, just shred it yourself to avoid anti-clumping additives like “cellulose” that is added to pre-shredded bags of cheese.
The best eggs for this casserole are pastured organic eggs. You don’t want your eggs from chickens who ate antibiotics and GMO corn their whole life. Nor do you want to purchase eggs from chickens that are being raised in crowded hen houses with no light and horrible conditions. There are a few good organic pastured options in stores like Vital Farms, or try your local farmers.
You can use either organic grass-fed milk (such as Organic Valley) or an organic nut milk. If you use nut milk, I like to use the MALK brand, as it is organic and has minimal additives, it is the closest I’ve found to homemade!

I hope you enjoy this holiday breakfast casserole with your family this year! If you know anyone who would love this recipe, please spread the love and share this with them.
Happy Holidays!",Food Babe,Unknown

I dealt with a shocking blows from my daughter’s school that threw me into a tailspin…
I launched my 4th book into the world, Food Babe Family, which sold out in almost every bookstore on launch day…
And I’ve been interviewed countless times, shouting the truth about our food from the rooftops.
There are so many families still eating ultra-processed food and need help. They have no idea the chemicals in our food are wrecking their health. It’s time for everyone to wake up to this madness and learn the truth! They need this book right now and I’ve been doing everything in my power to get the word out.
The good news is that Food Babe Family is already a big success because of you, it’s a National Bestseller with over ninety 5-Star Reviews and counting!
I’m so thankful to everyone who has shared this book with their friends and family. Once you know the truth, you can’t keep it to yourself. This book exposes the truth about Dominos, Pepperidge Farm, Kellogg’s, Gerber, and many other billion dollar processed food brands with deep pockets. So I’m against some mighty forces and need all of the support I can get!


This is where I do a deep dive into how and why I started investigating our food, the big campaigns that the Food Babe Army has led to force some of the biggest food companies to change, and what we can do to ensure our families are eating healthy real food.
You can share this blog post or a link to your favorite interviews on your social media channels.
Thank you for caring about the food that goes into our children’s bodies and helping me to get the truth out! You are amazing.

https://foodbabe.com/why-dominos-pizza-at-schools-have-to-stop-the-shocking-ingredients/,Why Dominos Pizza at Schools Have To Stop (The Shocking Ingredients),"There’s a very important update to my new book Food Babe Family that I want to share with you.
It was really devastating to me.
I had a hard time grappling with it.
It kept me up at night.
It made me angry…
Frustrated.
Disappointed.
But it also fired up my passion and reminded me why I do this work.
I wrote this blog post so you’d know what happened and learn from it just like I did.
As a food activist, author, and investigator of what’s in our food, I knew the ingredients in Domino’s are not something I wanted going into my daughter’s body every week.

At the same time, I didn’t want her to miss out on having Pizza Fridays with all the other children.
So, I decided to ask for a change. At the orientation meeting, in front of all the other parents, I asked if there was an opportunity to change pizza places. I explained how Domino’s contains questionable ingredients…including TBHQ that affects children’s immune systems. I was hoping this would get their attention, because parents will do anything to keep their kids from getting sick. right?
But Immediately – I felt tension in the air. The consensus was that they wanted to keep Domino’s.
I felt defeated – but I didn’t give up. I emailed the school my research on Domino’s ingredients and made a case for change. I reached out to our favorite pizza place in Charlotte which uses organic ingredients and olive oil. I explained the whole situation to the owner, and she agreed to match Domino’s prices with free delivery.
When this happened, I was over the moon! Every Friday, the kids at her school enjoyed organic pizza made with organic wheat, organic tomato sauce, organic cheese and olive oil for the entire school year.
At the time I thought…THIS is how you make a change in our schools! One small change at a time. One product, one food, at a time. Pick the worst food in your school and make a case for change. You may need to negotiate prices and do some footwork, but it is so worth it.
But not so fast!
A few weeks back, I wrote a letter to the school headmaster and to the owner of the local organic pizza chain to let them know I shared the story about Pizza Friday in my new book, and also to thank them for continuing to serve children healthier ingredients on Pizza Friday.
The first Pizza Friday of the school year was organic, but then the next week as I was dropping my daughter off at school I was stopped by the headmaster. I rolled down my car window and she said…
“I just want to let you know that we will be switching back to Domino’s for Pizza Friday”.
I was shocked. I asked what felt like a million questions…
My first question was “Why?”
And she said something along the lines of having trouble scheduling and that it would be easier to just do Domino’s.
Then I asked “But why Domino’s? There are pizza chains with better ingredients than Domino’s”.
She abruptly said that this was their decision, and they just made it.
The owner told me that they had given the school over a 50% discount last year and to continue, they would need to increase the costs by a few dollars a pie.
As soon as I got home, I emailed the headmaster and asked her to wait before sending an announcement to all of the parents about Pizza Friday, because I had a proposal for her and wanted to meet.
She immediately wrote me back and said:
Time was of the essence, so I replied back by email that the organic pizza chain would raise their prices by just a few dollars, but that I would cover this in a donation to the school.
This way it would be the same price as last year and we wouldn’t have to change anything about Pizza Friday.
Problem solved, right?
I was anxiously waiting to hear back from her, but a few hours later…
I couldn’t believe this was happening.
I remember spiraling the entire day after I got this email. Everything that I planned to get done that day didn’t happen. I was so up in arms about it.
Not only did I take it personally because I had spent the time to research and make the case for this change…But also as a parent who cares deeply about all the kid’s bodies at school. No one should be eating these ingredients, especially our children!
I wasn’t given the opportunity to make this right even though I was willing to do it, and this was just so upsetting to me.
The next morning I stopped the headmaster at the car line so that I could further explain my position. I reassured her that the organic pizza place was good with the scheduling and that I’d be covering the extra cost. I wanted my donation to be anonymous.
She replied that they wouldn’t switch back and forth. And they were just not going to do it. She really was adamant about the decision.
I let her know that Kraft told me “No” five or six times before they removed artificial food dyes from their mac and cheese, and that I wouldn’t give up.
This fight is not over and this story will be continued.
I became an activist because all I want in this world is for kids not to feel like I did when I was little.
My parents and I didn’t know the truth about our food when I was a child. I ate the “typical American diet” that all of my friends were eating…McDonalds, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Cheetos, and Coca-Cola... and I felt AWFUL.
There are more than 30 Pizza Fridays in the school year. That’s more than 30 times that children will be eating pizza doused with Roundup weedkiller, GMO soybean oil, TBHQ that affects the immune system, and many more controversial ingredients. I think that’s too many times. Way too many.
This may not seem like a big deal to some… but perhaps that’s because they don’t know the truth about Domino’s pizza.
The next thing I did was I sent a letter to all the parents so they could see the ingredients in Domino’s and decide for themselves if this what they wanted their children eating every Friday.
Since my daughter would no longer be participating in Pizza Friday, I also armed them with the knowledge of what we were going to be doing as a family to pack homemade pizza for her lunch on Fridays instead.
During this whole process, I was really concerned about what she would do or think when I told her what had happened.
Of course she’s been part of this conversation for so long and was already aware of what the ingredients were in Domino’s, so I didn’t really have to say that much.
While she was in the bath one night, I causally mentioned, “I think your school is changing to Domino’s for Pizza Friday”.
She just looked at me and said, “Mom, why don’t you just send me pizza. I would love green peppers, red peppers and olives on it, please.”
I said okay and just kind of left the room in shock and disbelief. I thought to myself, she doesn’t care where it’s from. She just wants Pizza.  And so that next Friday I made her the homemade pizza she wanted, and put it in a little warming pack for her lunch.
When I picked her up from school I asked her, “How was Pizza Friday?” And she said, “Mom, it was so amazing”. So I asked, “What it was like? Was it better than the local place?” And she said yes.
I felt like a hero that day.
Harley is one of the few children in her school not eating Domino’s on Pizza Friday.
What is that teaching her? What is that showing her? What is she learning from that resilience? And why?
If we’re going to live in this over-processed world, surrounded by all of the McDonald’s and Burger Kings and Domino’s of the world, we need to know how to navigate these situations.
I’m teaching her those skills, and she’s building that muscle to stand up and be different.
And I want to give this gift to every family across the country.
Food Babe Family  arms you with the tools you and your family need to stand up to the Big Food industry.
You don’t have to succumb to the pressures of society and fall for B.S. marketing campaigns targeting you into eating toxic ingredients.
And don’t EVER feel like your children are missing out when they aren’t eating the processed food that everyone else around them is eating.
They’re not missing out when they’re avoiding chemicals that cause cancer, gut issues, eczema, fatty liver, obesity, and type 2 diabetes!
So stop saying your kids are missing out when they aren’t eating Doritos and Domino’s with their friends. You are protecting them from dangerous chemicals, which is your greatest job as a parent. You could be saving their life!

This experience also taught me that we can’t give up…
I’ve found this out the hard way so many times, and I should have known better. I’ve petitioned companies like Kellogg’s who said they were going to remove artificial food dyes from their cereals. They announced it all over the news, but then they didn’t do it. M&M’s did the same thing! Then General Mills removed the dyes from Trix cereal, only to put them back in the following year! It’s horrible.
It’s these types of situations that ignite my passion and make me realize my work so important to continue going.
Even though the story I wrote about kicking Domino’s to the curb for the introduction to Food Babe Family is crushed (and I already have to update the book!) I hope that this situation inspires parents to keep going even when they face adversity.
Raising my kids on real food has never been an easy feat. I’m constantly bombarded with everyday situations that expose my kids to an industrial food system that is making so many children and adults sick today.
Every single time we leave the house, there’s some overly processed junk food available. Whether it’s at a birthday party, sporting event, playground, restaurant, you name it. It’s everywhere. Ultra processed foods made with chemicals that serve no nutritional purpose in the body.
This is why I wrote Food Babe Family. I want to let everyone know there’s another way to feed our kids. Together we can make a change and choose better. We can teach our kids the truth about food and be responsible for their health. My mother didn’t know the truth about food, but once you know better, you do better.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-teach-your-children-the-truth-about-food/,How to teach your children the truth about food,"When I was child, I wasn’t allowed in the kitchen. It was off limits. My dad wanted good grades in school—not cooking skills. My mom would make these incredible Indian meals from scratch, but I never learned how to cook ANYTHING.
My parents didn’t know it at the time, but learning how to cook would eventually save my life.
As I got older the only things I figured out to make were in a microwave or cold out of the fridge. I ate Chick-Fil-A, Lean Cuisines, Hot Pockets, Burger King, and anything that was fast and easy.
Eventually this caught up with me…
In my early 20’s I got very sick and ended up in the hospital. I was on several prescription drugs, was overweight, and I felt like a zombie all the time.
It was then I realized I needed to make a change.
I could no longer give up control to processed food manufacturers. I had to figure out how to make food from living, real food ingredients.
So, I taught myself how to cook.
This is when my life turned around. My health improved dramatically and I got off all my prescriptions. The excess pounds MELTED off my body. My skin was glowing.
Today, teaching my children the truth about food is one of my TOP PRIORITIES.
I never want my children to feel the way I did when I was younger.
I don’t want you to feel that way either!
This bonus expires TOMORROW so don’t delay!


Don’t wait! I started talking to my daughter about food when she was a toddler. I’m doing the same with my 2-year old son. I wanted to begin teaching them the truth and started as soon as possible!
It’s been shown that children are most receptive to learning about the world around them between the ages of 2 and 7. This is a critical period of brain development, during which they learn faster than any other time in their life. You have this amazing window of time to shape their beliefs about food, so take advantage of it!
That’s why I dedicate a big section in my book on how to teach your children about their food and get them involved in the kitchen.
Once you know the truth about our food, it’s our ultimate obligation to pass it on to our children and loved ones. I don’t believe anyone should be shamed for this, and in this world full of Oreos, Pepsi, Doritos, we need to arm our children with the facts.
If they decide to eat that food later on in life, they make that decision on their own, but at least you did your job as a parent and told them the truth.
To give you a little snapshot of the tips you’ll find inside Food Babe Family here are…


1. Read recipes out loud together while you are cooking, especially in cookbooks with pictures. Show them how you follow the recipe, measure out the ingredients, preheat the oven, and put it all together to make the finished product.
2. Have your children right there with you when you prepare meals. This opens up a ton of opportunities to talk about the ingredients that you’re cooking with. Tell them what different fruits and vegetables are and why they are good for you. Explain what you’re doing and how you’re preparing something, so they start to learn how we use these ingredients to make meals.
3. Young children can wash vegetables and squeeze lemons, while older children can learn to peel and chop up vegetables. Get your child some child-safe knives that will allow them to learn motor skills for cutting when they’re ready for it.
4. If your toddler is too little to help out with a recipe, you can keep them busy by giving them some safe ingredients to play with, such as a sprig of herbs or a ball of dough. Let them play while they watch and listen to you cook in the kitchen.
5. When your child is around seven years old, they might find it fun to put together some easy recipes on their own. Start with cold recipes that don’t require an oven or stove, such as wraps and sandwiches.
6. At around 10 years old, they might be ready to learn to use the stove and oven with your assistance. For instance, your child could prepare blueberry pancakes and you can show them how to safely pour the batter onto the hot griddle and flip!
7. Children love to be creative, so use this to your advantage and ask them to help you decorate cookies and cakes. You can even take ordinary dishes and allow them to arrange the food on a plate in a fun way.
8. Have them help set the table.Younger children can set out the napkins and older children can set the plates, glasses, and silverware.
9. Ask them to help you clean up after a meal too. Show older kids how to unload and load the dishwasher or wash the pots, while younger children can wipe the table or clean up messes. Let them help scoop the leftovers into containers to store in the fridge or freezer.
Above all else, keep this a positive experience! It’s best to involve them when you don’t feel rushed. Save cooking time with your child for lazy Sunday afternoons and other calmer times.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-make-real-food-fun-for-your-kids-from-my-new-book-food-babe-family/,How to make REAL FOOD fun for your kids (from my new book Food Babe Family!),"In 2020, when daughter was 3, I was working on a campaign about Kellogg’s Unicorn Waffles. These pink waffles are made with artificial colors, artificial flavors, and other very processed ingredients. Harley came into my office, sat on my lap, and saw the graphic I was creating. Her face lit up when she saw that colorful purple box with a rainbow unicorn and pink waffles on it, and she exclaimed, “Mom, mmm those waffles look good!”…


And, of course they did! Those colorful boxes are VERY ENTICING to any young child; that’s exactly what Kellogg’s is banking on and how they are able to sell boxes of Unicorn Waffles by the truckload.
But it was the beginning of the pandemic and traveling wasn’t possible.
Instead, I used this as a learning opportunity and talked to Harley about how they make Unicorn Waffles this pretty pink color by putting fake colors in them that aren’t actually real food, and that actually those fake colors are not good for our bodies and can make us sick. You’d be amazed at how quickly young children pick up on this and understand, and now, whenever Harley sees brightly colored food she knows to ask if it is artificially colored.
I also published a blog about these waffles, blasted Kellogg’s on social media, and wrote about them in my new book Food Babe Family, warning parents everywhere about the artificial ingredients they use.
This is a big win, but the sad reality is…
There are still thousands of toxic products being pushed on our kids with cartoon characters on their packaging like Paw Patrol Fruit Snacks, Super Mario Oreos, Disney Princess Goldfish, and Mickey Mouse Eggos.

This whole experience got me thinking about ways that I could make REAL FOOD fun for my kids to eat. If we’re competing with brands like Kellogg’s — we’ve got to have a few tricks up our sleeve, right?





Food that is full of toxic chemicals is constantly being shoved in our faces by the media, celebrities, marketing giants and the terrible BIG food industry.

https://foodbabe.com/see-whats-inside-my-new-cookbook-food-babe-family-sneak-peak/,See what’s inside my new cookbook Food Babe Family (Sneak Peak!),"My new cookbook Food Babe Family will hit bookstores in just a few days…Eeeek!  I can barely wait another second for you to have this book, because it is truly LIFE-CHANGING.
To prove it to you, let me give you a sneak peek inside of Food Babe Family, chapter by chapter so you can see for yourself what you’ll find inside!


Food Babe Family is MUCH MORE than a typical cookbook. We actually considered publishing it into TWO books, because it’s jam-packed with so much information. This book has all the tools and information on how your entire family can eat real food, easily and effortlessly, along with over 100 family recipes.
It’s like two books in one!

In the first part of Food Babe Family (85 pages!) I show you how to raise your children to love real food, how to buy the healthiest food for your family, what to do at home to make it all work, and how to navigate the over-processed food in schools, restaurants, parties, events, and while traveling.
The second half of this book provides over 100 delicious and simple recipes to make the process of feeding your family even easier! Because I believe that no one should have anxiety when feeding their children.
Let’s look at each chapter in more detail…

You’ll see a day-in-the-life as I prepare food for my children. I dispel some great myths we have been fed about feeding children and the real reason why some kids hate vegetables. I give you the rundown on what to look for in baby food and packaged toddler products along with a list of the brands I recommend. When your kids are in school, you’ll love the Mix & Match Lunch Ideas Chart and real-life lunch box examples that map out how to effortlessly pack healthy lunches for your child.

I’ll take you on a virtual trip to the grocery store, where I’ll show you how to avoid misleading labels on packages and how to choose the healthiest snacks and drinks for your family. You’ll know how to quickly spot B.S. marketing, so you won’t be swindled.
I also break down the Terrible 10 Ingredients In Children’s Food. You’ll see what makes these ingredients terrible and what specific products they’re found in, with brand names! You’ll also find the Best and Worst Beverages for Kids, which are ranked into four categories. I explain why each drink landed in each category, so you’ll easily be able to choose the healthiest drinks for your family.

You’ll get a huge list of the best packaged food for busy parents, which are the go-to products I keep in my pantry to make quick meals. Everything from nut butter to bread to pancake mix to tortillas. You’ll see exactly what brands I buy! I also share why I don’t buy Veggie Straws or Goldfish Crackers for my kids. This section might surprise you!
This is where you’ll also find Processed Food Swaps, healthy alternatives for your favorites like Honey Nut Cheerios, Little Bites Mini Muffins, Pizza Rolls, and Go-Gurt. There are both store-bought and homemade options to help you!

Now we bring it all together so you know what to do at home to help foster a love for real food in your children. This is where we get into the real nitty-gritty of how to incorporate real food and healthy habits into your daily life. I’ll show you how to make Real Food FUN for your kids. We’re competing against multi-million dollar food brands like Kellogg’s Fruit Loops, so we’ve got to have some tricks up our sleeve, right?
I delve into what to do if your child is “Picky” and how to encourage your child to try new foods. This includes my tried-and-true 5 Ways To Help Your Child Love Green Drinks – which is a great way to get more vegetables into your child’s diet.
You’ll see why it’s a great idea to involve your kids when you’re preparing meals and ways to make it fun and rewarding for the whole family. I’ll also show you why eating together is so beneficial – and in many ways that you’d never expect! I give you my best tips for making it easier to have this special time together on a regular basis.

We’ll delve into how to navigate the world we live in with your child, despite it being full of processed food temptations like M&M’s, Pepsi, and Doritos. I’ll show you how we handle birthday parties, the food in school, holiday candy, eating in restaurants, and what we do when we travel and go to events. You obviously can’t be with your child all the time and everywhere they go, so it’s very important to also teach them strategies to use when faced with food decisions and challenges as they venture out on their own.
Can you believe how much you’ve already gotten in this book?!? The first part that we’ve covered is just the beginning…
In part two you’ll find over 100 of my family’s favorite recipes. This is what we regularly eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and everything in between. I’ve also included a section on lunch boxes, which breaks down exactly what you’ll often find in my daughter’s school lunches.

Here’s where you’ll find our favorite & fast hash browns, muffins, french toast, and overnight breakfasts. There’s a variety of savory and sweet, so there’s something for everyone. I even share my recipe for cookies that are healthy enough for breakfast!

Smoothies are the best fast food, and every parent needs an arsenal of quick smoothie recipes to make when you’re busy. I also share how to make homemade sports drinks so you never have to drink awful Gatorade again!
Here you’ll find the easily packable recipes for lunch boxes that are in heavy rotation in my house such as Pinwheels (3 ways!) and delicious Taco Cups.
This is where you’ll get recipes for healthy pizza bites, hot pockets, and even homemade “Goldfish”! The effortless dips that I share make it easy to get your child to eat more veggies.
You’ll see the perfect way to make veggies flavorful, so add these to your meals every chance you get. The warming Ginger Chicken Soup is a must-have for when anyone is feeling under the weather, and my kids go crazy for the Ultimate Veggie Pasta Salad that packs in the healthy veggies with tons of flavor. It’s perfect for a backyard cookout!
Here’s where you’ll find my family’s favorite main dishes. I like to keep cooking simple, so these recipes have short prep times for speedy meals made with real food and healthy ingredients. You’ll find our favorite Home-Baked Pizza, that the kids love to help make, and our No Fuss Stir-Fry that cooks up in less than 30 minutes from start to finish.
You’ll love our incredible Mexican Casserole and Veggie Fajitas that will chase away any cravings you have for processed Mexican food. You’ll even find copycat recipes for Chick-fil-A Chicken Nuggets and the Fast Food Burritos we like to stash in the freezer for busy days.

I’ll show you the quick way we make broccoli at home the our children just gobble up, plus our favorite sides like Marinated Beets and Thai-Style Rice. This is where you’ll also find a copycat recipe for Chick-Fil-A’s Waffle Fries to go with those Nuggets in chapter 10!
Now this is where the real fun happens with our favorite ice-cream treat that puts Baskin Robbins to shame! Plus incredible Homemade “Oreos” without the nasty artificial ingredients and copycat Oatmeal Cream Pie Cookies that are a zillion times more yummy than what Little Debbie is trying to sell us. These recipes will show you how to indulge in treats with real food. Your kids will never miss the processed cookies and cakes from the store!

This bonus worth over $150 and ends on Monday, October 16!

https://foodbabe.com/four-toxic-chemicals-just-got-banned-from-food-but-theres-something-you-need-to-know/,"Four toxic chemicals just got BANNED from food, but there’s something you need to know!","Lawmakers in California just passed a bill that will ban 4 artificial ingredients from our food, but it’s not all that it seems. There’s some good news and bad news!
A post shared by Vani Hari | Food Babe (@thefoodbabe)

Food brands will likely remove these ingredients from all products they sell in the entire U.S., because it would be too difficult to remove them just in California. Also, this paves the way for other states to enact similar legislation.
But here’s what you still need to watch out for…
You’ll find Red 3 in some foods like Hot Tamales and some Funfetti products, but they will very likely replace it with Red 40, another artificial dye that’s linked to health problems.
Which leads me to the really bad news:
This ingredient was BANNED in Europe after it was linked to cancer last year, but remains in over 11,000 products in U.S. grocery stores such as Skittles and Pop Tarts. So now it appears that it will remain in our food for a very long time.
The best way to get companies to remove toxic ingredients, is to STOP buying their products. Vote with your dollars.
For example, instead of buying Skittles for Halloween treats this year…Buy YumEarth’s brand: Giggles.


Food Babe Family is packed with over 100 recipes and everything you need to help your children fall in love with real food:

https://foodbabe.com/organic-pumpkin-muffins-recipe-your-whole-family-will-love/,Organic Pumpkin Muffins Recipe Your Whole Family Will LOVE!,"Have you seen those Wendy’s commercials from the 80’s where the lady would yell “WHERE’S THE BEEF?!”
Well, that’s what I think when I see the ingredient lists on pumpkin spice products at the grocery store…
This time of year there are dozens of pumpkin spice goodies, drinks, and shakes…but almost all of them are full of chemical flavors made in a lab with tons of heavily processed ingredients.
For example – These Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes look delicious…but with Polysorbate 60? Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate? Mono and Diglycerides? Natural Flavors? No WAY.


And these pumpkin crumb cakes look so good, but this ingredient list hurts my eyeballs. SO MANY processed ingredients, and artificial flavors are listed how many times??? These are toxic.

Look at these Pumpkin Spice Hot Cocoa Bombs…you’d think these would have real pumpkin spices. But nope! More artificial flavors and tons of dyes. Disgusting!


Artificial dyes are one of the Terrible 10 Ingredients in Children’s Food that I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family. That’s because artificial colors (like Red 40, Blue 1, and Yellow 5) are known to cause hyperactivity in children and disrupt their immune systems. (1)  And they’re also filled with high fructose corn syrup, TBHQ, caramel color, and so many other nasty ingredients that it will make your head spin. (2)
If you love pumpkin treats but don’t want to eat this crap (or feed them to your kids) I have something for you!

I love switching up the type of muffins I serve my kids. I want them to enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables, and I love how good pumpkin is for them and me. These pumpkin muffins are perfect for freezing and reheating on busy school mornings. They also are a great lunch box addition.


Teaching families the truth about real food is my mission in life and I want to make living in this over processed world easier for everyone!

https://foodbabe.com/does-your-slow-cooker-leach-toxins-try-these-safe-brands-instead/,Does your slow cooker leach toxins? (Try these safe brands instead!),"I want to give you some quick, valuable information on slow cookers that I wish I had known years ago… but didn’t and learned the hard way.
As soon as I found this out, I ditched my old slow cooker ASAP.
Ceramic slow cookers may leach lead, and if they get scratched it’s more likely. Even if a slow cooker brand says it was tested for lead at the time of manufacture, they can leach lead over time. This is why you want to avoid all slow cookers with a ceramic insert – which is almost every brand out there.
As I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family, heavy metals can be especially harmful to children and babies. Exposure to heavy metals during childhood has been linked to ADHD, behavior problems, and learning disabilities. (1) So we especially don’t want our children to be exposed to lead. If you’re a family and have little kids, it’s really important to stop using these types of slow cookers and just throw them out. They aren’t safe for anyone.





I’m am so excited to find this company, 360 Cookware. They use stainless steel for the pan in their slow cookers. I use the 2.3 Quart version (pictured), but they also have larger 4 Quart and 6 Quart sizes. This smaller size is perfect for my family’s oatmeal every morning from the Food Babe Family cookbook. This is what we eat for breakfast almost every morning, so this slow cooker gets a lot of use.
Get 25% OFF slow cookers at 360 Cookware with the code FOODBABE. This code is good for cookware and bakeware, which includes their slow cookers!
It’s also great for keeping dishes warm when I’m out on the morning with the kids and don’t have time to make lunch when I get back. I just stick the food in here with some water and let it steam to stay hot, so it’s ready to go when we come in from our morning activities. It’s absolutely incredible and has made my life so much more efficient. I can’t recommend this slow cooker enough. It has four different settings for the heat, which is great too. One time I put it on 4 (which is the highest setting) and it was boiling the water in there. That’s pretty amazing.


The other stainless steel crock pot I own is from Wolf. It’s got to be the Mack Daddy of all slow cookers, because this one is huge! It’s 7 Quarts, so it makes giant stocks and I can put a whole chicken in here. I use the Wolf when I’m making meals that are really large, such as big pots of soup and chili. This time of year, I use the Wolf to make homemade Hot Apple Cider from my new Slow Cooker Meals In Minutes BONUS recipe guide.

https://foodbabe.com/hot-healthy-apple-cider-in-your-slow-cooker-easy-recipe-without-refined-sugar/,Hot healthy apple cider in your slow cooker (Easy recipe without refined sugar!),"Fall is here… and you know what that means? I’m enjoying a cup of my favorite Hot Apple Cider.
It’s so comforting drinking Malic Acid, Caramel Color, and Artificial Flavors…
Ahhh. Sooo delicious!


Ok, I’m kidding. I’m not drinking that!
MALIC ACID: An artificial flavor enhancer and/or acidity regulator created in a lab from petrochemicals like butane. (1)
MALTODEXTRIN: Heavily processed powder often made from GMO corn. Linked to increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune conditions, gastrointestinal issues – gas and diarrhea. (2)
CARAMEL COLOR: There is Class III Caramel Color in Alpine Apple Cider mix, which is created with heat and ammonia – a process that produces a cancerous substance called 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI). (3) It is completely unnecessary, as apple cider should be naturally brown from the apples and spices.
ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Chemical mixtures synthesized in laboratories, derived from petroleum and other inedible substances. Cheaper than using real food. Makes processed food taste irresistible. (4)
NATURAL FLAVORS: Practically the exact same thing as Artificial Flavor, but it’s derived from substances found in nature (plants, animals, etc). This isn’t all it contains. Flavors typically contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other “incidental additives”, which can make up 80% or so of the formulation. Some of the most common incidental additives in flavors include: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol (none of which are labeled). (4)
These ingredients are disgusting!


I throw apples, ginger, an orange, and real spices into my slow cooker and turn it on for a few hours. It makes the most delicious apple cider that’s HEALTHY and it makes the house smell incredible. It’s the perfect way to celebrate fall!

After the apples, orange, and spices cook down in the slow cooker for about 2 hours, all you do is strain the juice into a glass pitcher and enjoy! It’s naturally sweet from the apple and orange juice, so there is no refined sugar needed! It makes about four servings, and will keep in the fridge for about four days.

https://foodbabe.com/is-oatmeal-healthy-the-truth-about-oatmeal/,Is Oatmeal Healthy? The TRUTH About Oatmeal,"There’s a lot of chatter going around right now about oatmeal. If you are confused, let me help clear it up.
People are saying oatmeal is the devil.
That oatmeal spikes your blood sugar.
That oatmeal is not healthy.
And that you shouldn’t be eating it for breakfast.


It’s true that I wouldn’t touch Quaker oats with a 10 foot pole.
That’s because it’s conventionally grown and tests have found it contains Roundup that is linked to cancer. (1)
So here’s the bottom line:
Best of all – it takes me less than a minute to make in my slow cooker. Breakfast is ready to go first thing in the morning. What is better than that?


Not only do steel-cut oats make a filling and healthy breakfast, but they are also easy to prepare ahead of time so that you don’t need to cook in the morning.

These creamy oats take less than a minute to pop into the slow cooker at night before bed. Compare this to cooking oats in the morning while you’re busy and waiting 30 or more minutes for them to cook, watching the stove, and stirring, or even worse, resorting to instant oats that are not as nutritious.
Top your oatmeal with a variety of healthy toppings like freshly ground flaxseeds, chia seeds, berries, walnuts, nut butter, and coconut milk.

https://foodbabe.com/wendys-chili-recipe-fast-food-swap-quicker-than-the-drive-thru/,Wendy’s Chili Recipe Fast Food Swap (Quicker than the Drive-Thru!),"Please forgive me…
The other day I was really busy and needed a quick lunch, so I pulled into the Wendy’s Drive-Thru and ordered a cup of their chili.
I know, I know, I’m always warning you about the ingredients in processed food…but I was having a hard day.
JUST KIDDING!!!
Ok, the truth is I DID order Wendy’s Chili in the drive-thru, but this was to film a video for social media to show why I never eat their chili.
Even if I’m in a rush or having a crazy day, all I need to do is remember the ingredients in Wendy’s Chili and I’m not tempted.


Wendy’s flavor enhancer contains Yeast Extract, which is known as a hidden form of MSG. It’s coupled with two more flavor enhancers: Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate.
Disodium Guanylate is derived from guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which when mixed with MSG can amplify the flavor of food up to 8 times! (1)
It’s been shown that food companies can take processed food that tastes gross on its own, and make it taste irresistible with these additives. In one study, researchers took an ingredient out of sausages which made them taste bad, but once they added MSG flavor enhancers, the study participants thought the sausage tasted delicious. (2)
It’s been shown that MSG can help you gain weight, even if you don’t eat more calories. (3) This is why MSG is fed to rats in animal studies to make them obese!
I don’t like to eat products that trick my brain into craving them, and I especially don’t want to give chili with “flavor enhancers” to my kids. This is why hidden MSG additives like Yeast Extract are one the Terrible 10 ingredients in children’s food that I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family.
It’s very important to choose products made with organic meat to avoid consuming potential residues of antibiotics, synthetic hormones, and other drugs often given to animals on factory farms. Wendy’s still sources their beef from conventional farms who use antibiotics. They announced a commitment to end “routine use” of medically important antibiotics in their beef supplies by the end of 2030 – but that is still so many years from now. (4)
Antibiotics are being routinely fed to farm animals – not to treat diseases – but to fatten them up and make them grow bigger on less food. Almost all of the antibiotics used in the U.S. are fed to farm animals and the amount continues to rise. This misuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs that could threaten the entire human population. When animals are constantly fed low levels of antibiotics, they become a breeding ground for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and it’s spreading to humans. (5)
When you buy fast food like Wendy’s Chili, you are supporting the industrial BIG FOOD complex of crap food.
Introducing my Slow Cooker Chicken Quinoa Chili…
I just take 10 minutes to throw the ingredients in my slow cooker in the morning, and it’s ready by lunch time! It’s so filling and delicious, without addictive chemicals, conventional beef, and lab-created emulsifiers.


The average drive-thru takes 6 minutes, and then whatever time it takes to buckle your kids in the car and drive down there. Why not just spend a few minutes in the morning putting these ingredients in your slow cooker? It makes a big pot that will feed a family without potential toxins.

My secret ingredient in this hearty chili is quinoa. This is a gluten-free seed that contains about 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per cup. It’s also a good source of manganese and magnesium, which is why I love adding quinoa to my meals to bump up the nutritional content. Quinoa has a texture similar to rice and adds a special touch to this chili!
If you want to make this chili vegan, you can easily do so by simply replacing the chicken stock with vegetable stock, and eliminating the chicken. Without the meat, reduce the cooking time to 2 hours on high or 3-4 hours on low, or until the quinoa is cooked.

These recipes are an absolute LIFESAVER on busy days. I don’t know what I’d do without them. When you spend a few minutes in the morning throwing a few ingredients into a slow cooker, making a homemade meal is so much easier (and a zillion times healthier!)

These wings are perfect to throw together on a busy weekday. It takes only a few minutes to whisk up the sauce and throw it all in a slow cooker. My kids go CRAZY for the tangy sauce on these wings. The hot sauce is optional if you want to make them less spicy and more kid-friendly, they taste fabulous either way! I like to serve these with rice and steamed vegetables.

https://foodbabe.com/organic-snack-bars-are-full-of-processed-ingredients-is-there-a-healthy-snack-bar-brand/,Organic snack bars are full of processed ingredients (Is there a healthy snack bar brand?),"Walk down the grocery aisle with me and let’s check out the organic snack bars. Will any of them be made with real ingredients that you’d find in your own kitchen? Or will they be filled with added “flavors”, emulsifiers, and processed sweeteners?
My daughter saw this box of Chocolate Drizzled Made Good bars and got so excited. But look at the ingredients…


NATURAL FLAVOR: Proprietary mixture invented to make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. Preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol). None of these ingredients are labeled, so we are in the dark about what flavors actually contain. (1)
ORGANIC INVERT CANE SYRUP: A thick, sweet syrupy liquid that’s processed by splitting the fructose and glucose molecules in sugar. It’s a refined sugar made in a lab and not what I’d consider a natural sweetener. (2)
ORGANIC VEGETABLE GLYCERIN: Another heavily processed sweet syrup made in a lab. To make it, vegetable oils are processed under pressure (typically with lye–a caustic chemical) to separate the glycerin from the fats. Since it’s a sugar alcohol, you eat too much of it you could get gas and diarrhea. (3)
MALTODEXTRIN: Heavily processed powder, often made from GMO corn. Linked to increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune conditions, gastrointestinal issues (gas and diarrhea). (4)
Do you have “natural flavors” and “maltodextrin” in your kitchen? Ugh…nope!
I used to love Z Bars because they’re organic. They say they’re “crafted for active kids” and contain “None of the No-No’s” like high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, or GMO ingredients. So, does that mean their ingredients are healthy?


Well, look at that!
They may not use “Artificial Flavors”…but they still use NATURAL FLAVORS which are practically the SAME THING! (1)
The only difference between the two is that Natural Flavors are derived from natural substances (which can be literally anything ranging from tree bark to beaver anal glands), and Artificial Flavors are derived from synthetic substances. They are both made in a lab, contain proprietary additives, and are designed by teams of flavor scientists to give food an irresistible taste. Flavors are not real food, and not something that I want to eat (or give to my kids!)
Plus, these Z Bars contain several refined sugars along with SOYBEAN OIL. Even if it’s organic, this unhealthy oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (5)
I wouldn’t buy Z Bars now, and these aren’t ingredients I have in my kitchen. Moving on…
Wow look at Dave’s Killer Bars! These say they’ve got 22 grams of whole grains and are organic. Let’s check those ingredients…

Ugh…Natural Flavors is listed TWICE. That alone is a reason why I wouldn’t buy these. But they also contain other processed ingredients I don’t have in my kitchen like ORGANIC INULIN and ORGANIC CANOLA LECITHIN.
There’s got to be healthier bars than this, right?
How about Annie’s organic bars? Millions of parents buy these instead of those awful Quaker Chewy granola bars… but are they really much better? They say they “use ingredients that matter” to me on the box, so let’s see…

Annie’s granola bars are made with several different processed and refined sugars. I especially don’t like to eat ORGANIC BROWN RICE SYRUP because it has a high risk of arsenic contamination. (6) Being organic doesn’t reduce the risk. Arsenic is toxic and is linked to increased risk of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and impaired brain function. (7) When I see this sweetener in a snack bar, it’s an automatic NO GO for me.
These also contain added ORGANIC NATURAL FLAVOR and ORGANIC SUNFLOWER LECITHIN.
Are these ingredients in your kitchen? Nope. I hate these processed ingredients.
These bars worry me the most, since they’re marketed for toddlers with Sesame Street characters on the box. Crossing my fingers that they use healthy ingredients…

Awful! These contain three different added FLAVORS along with BROWN RICE SYRUP and refined flour, refined sugars, and refined oils. These bars are extremely processed and certainly not what I’d consider real food.
I created a Kid’s Snack Guide with all of the packaged snacks that my family loves. You’ll see all the bars, fruity snacks, savory snacks, and sweet snacks that we buy that are made without refined sugars and other nasty ingredients. These are the healthy snacks I keep in my diaper bag, my car, and in the pantry for whenever we are running out the door–and my kids LOVE them.

It infuriated me when I saw all the processed ingredients in every single snack bar at the store, even organic brands. That’s why I created my own snack bars at Truvani. As you can see below, The Only Bar is “only” made with ingredients you’d find in your own kitchen.

Happy Snacking!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/see-takis-ingredients-every-parent-needs-to-know-the-truth/,See Takis Ingredients – Every parent needs to know the truth,"There’s nothing that makes me more angry than when food companies create products with highly addictive chemicals, and fill them with the absolute worst ingredients linked to health problems. That’s why I had to share the truth with you about Takis. If you haven’t heard of Takis, I bet your kids have. Check out these comments I saw on social media…
“I see 6 year olds eating this for breakfast”
“My high school students eat these A LOT! I’ve been telling them how bad they are for their health”
“My last year of teaching…it seemed like half the high school walked in every morning with Takis for breakfast”
I admit I’ve never tried Takis, but I hear they’re extremely spicy chips that are very addicting. That’s no surprise when you look at the ingredients…

There are 3 forms of MSG in Takis:
It’s awful that they add MSG because this entices you (and your kids) to eat more Takis…and the next thing you know you’re inhaling handfuls of artificial dyes and unhealthy processed ingredients. MSG is added to make you crave Takis, so you keeping eating and eating and eating their product. There is simply no other reason for food companies to use MSG. I don’t like to eat products that trick my brain into craving them, and I especially don’t want to give snacks with MSG to my kids.
It’s been shown that MSG can help you gain weight, even if you don’t eat more calories. (1) This is why MSG is fed to rats in animal studies to make them obese!
The natural and artificial flavor chemicals that flavor manufacturers engineer are contributing to what David Kessler (former head of the FDA) calls a “food carnival” in your mouth. (2) The inability to stop eating because the flavors they have synthesized trick your mind into wanting more and more. They don’t want you to have the full essence of a taste – they want you to only experience the best 1 millionth part of the taste – so you keep having to go back for more and more, continuously searching for gratification. (2)
These ingredients are hijacking your taste buds one by one! This is why I try to avoid products with “Natural Flavors” or “Artificial Flavors” added.
Artificial colors are one of the Terrible 10 Ingredients In Children’s Food in my new book, Food Babe Family. That’s because artificial colors come with so many health risks and are in a lot of foods that parents buy for their kids. Artificial colors (like Red 40 and Yellow 6) require a warning label in Europe that states they cause hyperactivity in children. (1)  This is why most foods in Europe don’t contain them! Artificial colors have also been shown to disrupt the immune system. Any product with artificial colors in it is an automatic NO GO in my house. I’m teaching my kids how to spot artificial dyes and why we don’t want to eat them.
Another major ingredient to avoid is TBHQ. This preservative may increase the risk of food allergies. Scientific research has shown that TBHQ negatively affects “T-cells” in the body (which are generally used to fight infections) in a way that promotes allergies to tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat and shellfish. It’s banned for use in food in other countries including Japan. (1)
They color Takis naturally with Paprika Extract in Spain. (3) They also don’t use TBHQ. Which begs the question, why do they continue to use these ingredients in the U.S. if they aren’t necessary? The other ingredients in Takis in Spain are horrible too, but this just goes to show that they could use better ingredients if they wanted to.

The FDA has a database (4) with reports of people who ate Takis and later received treatment for…
In one shocking case, a 17-year old girl in Memphis had her gallbladder removed, which her mother believes was due to eating too many Takis and spicy chips. She was eating “big bags and would take them to school with her” before her stomach problems started. Dr. Cary Canvender at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital also believes eating too many Takis probably contributed to her gallbladder removal. He said they see a lot of kids with stomach problems after eating spicy chips: “We do see tons of gastritis and ulcer-related stuff due to it… We probably see around 100 kids a month, easily.” (5)

https://foodbabe.com/kool-aid-or-kool-scam-dont-let-your-kids-drink-this/,Kool-Aid or Kool-Scam?! Don’t let your kids drink this,"I remember my mom mixing up Kool-Aid when I was a kid. She’d pour that packet of colored powder into a pitcher of water with a cup of sugar…and my brother and I would drink that down like it was no one’s business! At the time I didn’t think about the ingredients they used or what all that sugar does to the body, and I wish I knew then what I know now.
Sadly, Kool-Aid isn’t a thing of the past. Children everywhere are drinking Kool-Aid Jammers and I can see why parents buy them for their kids. They are inexpensive and sold in boxes of 10 pouches that are easy to pack in your kids lunch box. Plus, they say on the front of the box that they’re an “Excellent Source of Vitamin C” with “75% Less Sugar Than Soda”.
So Kool-Aid Jammers have got to be healthier for your kids than soda, right? Let’s see.


Just like soda, Kool-Aid Jammers are mostly water mixed with High Fructose Corn Syrup, along with Artificial Flavors, Artificial Colors and preservatives.



High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is a heavily processed sweetener made from Roundup-Ready GMO cornstarch that contains more fructose than regular corn syrup. Studies have shown it increases appetite and the risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. HFCS especially contributes to type 2 diabetes in children! (1)
Look at the other controversial ingredients in Kool-Aid Jammers and what they do to your body:
ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Chemical mixtures synthesized in laboratories, derived from petroleum and other inedible substances. Cheaper than using real food. Makes processed food taste irresistible. (1)
NATURAL FLAVORS: Essentially the same as artificial flavors, but are derived from natural substances. This is a proprietary ingredient that has a top secret ingredient list. These flavors contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives that can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol) – none of which are labeled). (1)
SUCRALOSE: Kool-Aid uses this artificial sweetener to reduce the sugar content, but it’s just as bad, if not worse. Sucralose is made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine. Has been linked to leukemia and related blood cancers in animal studies. Although artificial sweeteners have no calories, they have been shown to contribute to weight gain by encouraging sugar cravings. Research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. (1)
ARTIFICIAL COLORS: Dyes derived from petroleum, linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. May also be contaminated with carcinogens, such as benzidine. (1)
CITRIC ACID: Heavily processed preservative and flavoring made from sugar fed to fungus (a GMO black mold, not fruit). It can contribute to leaky gut, or make it hard to heal from leaky gut. (1)
SYNTHETIC VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID): They add synthetic vitamin C to Kool-Aid Jammers so they can add the health claim on the box that they’re an “Excellent Source of Vitamin C”. Besides the fact that this is one really unhealthy way to get vitamin C into your child, synthetic vitamins are made in a lab from a variety of questionable sources like coal tar, petroleum and GMOs. Lab-created vitamins differ from natural vitamins found in whole food, and aren’t often believed to be absorbed by your body as well. (1)
I offer my children just a few drink options. We serve filtered water with everything and this is what I pack in lunch boxes. This is the main thing that we drink as a family. Occasionally, we’ll enjoy organic coconut or almond milk, mint tea, kombucha, or raw coconut water. My husband likes to drink cold-pressed orange juice, so sometimes if my daughter sees him drinking it, she’ll want some. I’ll pour her a little OJ in a glass mixed with filtered water. She doesn’t know the difference!
You’ll find drinks listed in four categories: (1) Worst Drinks for Kids, (2) Not-Much-Better Drinks for Kids, (3) Still-Not-the-Best Drinks for Kids, and (4) Best Drinks for Kids. It makes it so easy for you!
If you are buying Kool-Aid Jammers for your kids, I don’t want you to feel bad. Remember, the Big Food industry spends millions of dollars on advertising to sell these drinks to you and your children. They know how to push your buttons. Take this as empowering advice. Now that you know better, you can choose better!

https://foodbabe.com/aspartame-in-diet-coke-classified-a-possible-carcinogen-found-on-1000s-of-food-products/,Aspartame in Diet Coke classified a Possible Carcinogen (found on 1000’s of food products!),"If you drink Diet or Zero Calorie drinks, you’ve got to hear this. The International Agency for Research on Cancer just declared the popular artificial sweetener, Aspartame, as a possible carcinogen. (1) That means there’s evidence it can cause cancer in humans, specifically liver cancer.
You’ll find aspartame in so many “sugar free” products, like chewing gum, energy drinks, diet drinks, and snacks.
I see a lot of people trying to dismiss this news and say it’s not a big deal…
“Cancer scare around aspartame is mostly unfounded: Lovers of Diet Coke have little to fear“ – The Economist (2)
“Aspartame may be linked to cancer, but officials say it’s safe“ – Houston Chronicle (3)
“Aspartame Isn’t Great for You, But It (Probably) Won’t Kill You” – Bon Appétit (4)
The truth is, there were (and still are!) many reasons to avoid Aspartame even before this news broke.
A post shared by Vani Hari | Food Babe (@thefoodbabe)


It’s not real food.
Aspartame was originally created in a lab during pharmaceutical development. It was found to be sweet on accident when a researcher licked his finger! (5)
It was never intended to be used in food, but somehow the FDA green-lit it and now it’s added to thousands of products on grocery store shelves. It’s safety has been questioned ever since! Many studies have linked Aspartame to cancer over the years, but the FDA has done nothing to stop its use. (9)
A peer-reviewed study in France found that people are more likely to get cancer if they consume artificial sweeteners (such as Aspartame). The researchers studied the diet data of over 102,000 french citizens over a 10 year period (2009 to 2021). People who consumed artificial sweeteners often (Aspartame and Acesulfame Potassium) were more likely to get cancer. Specifically breast and obesity-related cancers. Heavy Aspartame intake was associated with a 22% increased risk of breast cancer! (10)
Although artificial sweeteners have no calories, research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. (6) When you eat something sweet – even when it has no calories – your brain is tricked into wanting more calories because your body is not getting enough energy (i.e. calories) to be satisfied. So you keep craving sweets, eating sweets, and gaining weight.
This is why a lot of people never reach their full health potential or weight loss goals, because they are constantly being pushed around by these chemical artificial sweeteners that trick the brain and body.
In one study, researchers from the University of Texas discovered that drinking sodas made with artificial sweeteners may expand waist size, which is a risk factor in type 2 diabetes. (7)  People who drank sodas had 70% greater increases in waist circumference compared with people who didn’t drink diet soda. Those who drank 2 or more diet sodas a day had 500% greater waist circumference increases! And in a following study they found that Aspartame raised fasting blood sugar in mice. (7)
You’ll find aspartame in products labeled “diet” and “zero sugar”, and it’s not just in drinks. Aspartame is in some frozen pops and kid’s snacks.


Are they getting funding from BIG Food companies that use Aspartame? Sometimes that’s the case! (8)

https://foodbabe.com/american-vs-european-ingredients-in-childrens-food-see-the-comparisons/,American VS. European Ingredients In Children’s Food (See the comparisons!),"Is your child getting sabotaged by American food companies who use healthier ingredients in Europe and the U.K.? There are several big food brands in the U.S. who use better ingredients and fewer processed ingredients in other countries. Some of the biggest offenders are Kellogg’s, Kraft Heinz, and PepsiCo.
Check out these real examples from other countries…
Kellogg’s uses beets and paprika to color their Strawberry Pop Tarts in other countries, while in the U.S. they use artificial colors Red 40, Blue 1, and Yellow 6. These dyes are linked to hyperactivity in children and can disrupt the immune system.


Froot Loops in Germany are made colorful naturally, instead of the 4 different artificial dyes used in the American version. How many kids eat this for breakfast?

They make Heinz ketchup with simple ingredients in other countries, which is very unlike the U.S. version full of High Fructose Corn Syrup and lab-produced “natural flavoring”. You’ll find it at nearly every restaurant in America and most children grow up dipping their fries in this.

PepsiCo makes Gatorade without artificial dyes in other countries, and they are still brightly colored from natural sources such as Black Carrot Juice Concentrate. When I was a child, my parents would give me Gatorade when I was sick to keep me hydrated. Considering how many children and teenagers drink these, why don’t they make them dye-free everywhere?


Europe has much stronger food regulations than America. The U.S. government allows food companies to largely police itself, deciding which ingredients, chemicals, and additives are “safe” to use in their products. This allows them to use chemicals that help them make products cheaper and quicker, with essentially zero oversight into their safety. (1)
If a company can get away with using cheaper ingredients, they will!
Even if these cheaper alternatives have a negative impact on our health.
This is SO WRONG because many of these products are created for CHILDREN.
In my brand new book, Food Babe Family, I walk you through how my family and I navigate the processed food world that we live in. You will learn how to deal with sticky food situations at parties and in restaurants. I list out healthy store-bought swaps for ultra-processed products so that your children don’t feel like they’re missing out.
You’ll also find more than 100 delicious recipes that make it simple to put healthy, real food on the table that the entire family will love. From Pumpkin Muffins to Taco Salad Cups, Zucchini Pizza Bites, “Chick-Fil-A” Chicken Nuggets and Waffle Fries, and even Homemade “Oreos”.
Pre-order your copy of Food Babe Family here and I’ll send you an incredible bonus TODAY!
This is how we put pressure on these companies to change. We can’t depend on our government to force these companies to remove the processed ingredients they don’t use in other countries. This a grassroots movement that starts with each one of us.
Because of YOU sharing this information and voting with your dollars, companies are changing. We’ve inspired companies like Kraft and Quaker to give us the same products they sell in other countries, and we can do it again! (2, 3)

https://foodbabe.com/read-this-before-your-kids-teens-drink-prime-energy/,Read This Before Your Kids & Teens Drink PRIME ENERGY,"You are probably really aware of the PRIME drink brand if you have a teen in your house. PRIME drinks are insanely popular. So many parents have asked me to write about them because their kids (mostly teenagers, but some even younger) are totally obsessed with these drinks. The are THE THING right now, heavily promoted on TikTok and YouTube.
It’s really important to know that PRIME has two different drinks. The first one they came out with is a sports drink (kinda like Gatorade) called PRIME Hydration. They say it’s “the fastest growing sports drink in history” with $250 million in sales in its first year. (1) This is the drink that really got kids hooked on the PRIME brand.
After that huge success, they came out with energy drinks earlier this year called PRIME Energy which have become very controversial…
PRIME Energy drinks are LOADED with caffeine: 200mg per can. As much caffeine as 2 Red Bulls or 6 cans of Coke!


The reason these drinks are being singled out is because the PRIME brand is popular with kids and teens. The energy drinks have been banned from schools in several countries (2) such as Australia and New Zealand where they are not even sold in stores. Kids are still getting a hold of them…buying them on the black market and selling them to each other on social media. (3) Some are even buying EMPTY bottles of PRIME off of Facebook for $20 a pop because the brand is so huge and kids want to be seen with the logo. (10) PRIME Energy drinks are selling out in grocery stores in America, and some U.S. schools will confiscate them from students if they see them.
Kids and teens are more susceptible to caffeine and more likely to suffer from its effects like anxiety, abnormal heart rhythm, moodiness, sleep disruptions, and tremors. (4)
High amounts of caffeine in energy drinks are also linked to heart problems in teens. (5) Sometimes even teenage heart attacks have been attributed to drinking too much caffeine. (6) It’s awful! And most parents don’t know about this.
The American Academy of Pediatrics says there’s no safe dose of caffeine for children under 12…And teens under 18 should have no more than 100mg of caffeine a day.

SUCRALOSE: An artificial sweetener made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine. This zero-calorie sweetener has been linked to leukemia since 2016. (7) And more recently to other cancers too. (8) This is one ingredient I personally avoid at all costs.
ACESULFAME POTASSIUM: Another artificial sweetener that Center for Science in Public Interest says to avoid it because safety testing was inadequate and some research also links it to cancer.
NATURAL FLAVORS: Proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. Preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol) – None are labeled.
CITRIC ACID: Heavily processed preservative and flavoring made from sugar fed to fungus (a GMO black mold, not fruit). It can contribute to leaky gut, or make it hard to heal from leaky gut.
Besides the caffeine, you’ll find those same questionable ingredients in PRIME Hydration sports drinks. They don’t contain artificial colors, but I don’t otherwise consider these drinks any healthier than Gatorade Zero even though they are advertised that way.



PRIME Energy has 200 mg. caffeine, but some brands have even more! To give you an idea of how much caffeine you’ll find in other drinks here’s a rundown:
A Senator in NY is asking the FDA to investigate the marketing of Prime Energy as it’s packaged and marketed “in near identical form” as Prime Hydration. (9)
I’ve seen reports of parents who didn’t realize the PRIME Energy drinks were different than their sports drinks or that they contain caffeine. Even though the cans have a small warning on them that they aren’t for anyone under the age of 18, some parents are accidentally buying them for young children!

https://foodbabe.com/is-non-gmo-or-organic-food-safer-the-truth-may-surprise-you/,Is Non-GMO or Organic Food safer? The truth may surprise you!,"I recently posted this graphic on social media about the difference between non-GMO food vs. organic food and people went wild… Which one do you think is safer to eat?


When I have a choice, I choose certified organic food for all these reasons and more!
Non-GMO Project verifies that a product doesn’t contain GMO ingredients. While that is good, it’s not the whole story about what the product contains, how it was produced, and where it came from.
It’s key to remember:
Let’s break it down…
All of this is why the Non-GMO label is NOT enough!
Chemicals like synthetic preservatives, artificial colors, synthetic pesticides, growth hormones and antibiotics are not used in organic food! These chemicals can lead to hyperactivity in children, allergies, skin issues, and even worse – they may put you at risk for scary, life-shortening diseases like cancer.
Some organic foods get contaminated with pesticides from nearby crops, but thankfully it’s been shown to be minimal compared to what’s found on conventional crops. There are also some controversial ingredients added to some organic products such as carrageenan, natural flavors, refined flour, and refined sugar. So, remember to always read the ingredients on the food you buy, even if it is organic.
If you rely on the Non-GMO Verified label to find the safest food, the info in this post is a lifesaver! Thank you for sharing and helping others know the truth about their food.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/4-reasons-i-dont-buy-goldfish-crackers-for-my-kids/,4 Reasons I Don’t Buy Goldfish Crackers For My Kids,"When I first saw Goldfish crackers in the shape of Disney Princesses and Mickey Mouse – I lost my mind.
Over the last few years, I’ve thrown myself into researching how Big Food companies lure children in, coaxing them with targeted marketing (like Disney characters on packages!) into craving processed foods from a very early age. This begins in the first year of life and accelerates as they get older! This is why it makes me so angry to see products like this.
With products like this, the industry is putting young children on the processed food bandwagon so that it only seems natural to them to eat food from a box, bag, or jar. Sadly, this has helped create generations of children who are hooked on ultra-processed packaged foods, and who end up being “picky eaters” later in life.

1) Goldfish are primarily made from refined wheat flour that is not organic.
This is a very unhealthy flour to consume. Enriched wheat flour is milled discarding all the essential nutrients the original grain contained. The heat that’s generated to crush the grain into flour destroys any vitamin or mineral normally found in the the grain, leaving a white powdery product devoid of any life. It’s essentially DEAD FOOD. So they “enrich” it back by adding in synthetic vitamins and minerals. In addition, the FDA has approved dozens of chemicals for manufacturers to use to help with the smell, appearance, and shelf life of flour. (1)
Bottom line: It is very heavily processed and not real food.
Conventional wheat crops in America are commonly sprayed with glyphosate (Roundup weed killer) as a drying agent before harvest, which is ending up in finished products on the shelf. This weed killer is not used on organic wheat crops. In 2016, an independent food safety laboratory tested popular American food products for residues of glyphosate (Roundup) and they specifically found it in Goldfish Crackers. In three samples of Goldfish tested, they detected 18.40 ppb glyphosate in Goldfish Crackers Original, 8.02 ppb in Goldfish Crackers Colors, and 24.58 ppb in Goldfish Crackers Whole Grain. (2)
While it’s been awhile since Goldfish have been tested for glyphosate, Pepperidge Farm hasn’t addressed whether they would do anything to remedy this. Do Goldfish still contain weed killer residues? That’s not a gamble I’m willing to make. I don’t feel safe feeding my child a food known to be contaminated with Roundup, a chemical strongly linked to cancer. It’s safer to choose products made with organic whole grain wheat or other organic ingredients.
2) Goldfish are made with Soybean Oil and Canola Oil, both from GMO crops.
These refined oils go through an insane amount of processing with chemical solvents, steamers, neutralizers, de-waxers, bleach and deodorizers before they end up in our food. These seed oils are very high in omega-6 fatty acids which are known to promote inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation leads to many diseases, increasing the risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. (1) The soybean and canola oil in Goldfish are derived from GMO crops, as it says so right on the label. These crops are also commonly contaminated with Roundup weed killer.
3) Goldfish contain hidden MSG in the form of autolyzed yeast extract.
Pepperidge Farm adds Autolyzed Yeast Extract to engineer Goldfish Crackers to taste irresistible and memorable so your kids can’t stop eating them. This helps get your kids hooked on processed food. MSG is also linked to obesity because it causes food to taste better than it should, increasing addictive eating habits. (1) In fact, MSG is often used in animal studies to make rats obese. I don’t want my children eating Goldfish with a flavor-enhancer designed to hijack their taste buds. This is one the Terrible 10 ingredients in children’s food that I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family.
4) The cheese in Goldfish is not organic, and likely comes from factory farms where the cows are given antibiotics and hormones.
It’s very important to choose products made with organic dairy to avoid consuming potential residues of antibiotics, synthetic hormones, and other drugs often given to animals on factory farms. (3) When you buy Goldfish crackers, you are supporting the industrial BIG FOOD complex of crap food.
Looking for healthy snacks to feed your kids instead of Goldfish? I’ve got you covered!
I filmed a 20-minute video on all the healthy snacks I keep in my pantry and to-go bag for when we are heading out the door. I also take these snacks everywhere we travel!
The bonus video and snack guide will get emailed to you today. This bonus video is only going to be available for a very limited time, so make sure to get your order in now.

Goldfish are a snack that almost every child in America eats. Parents buy them by the carton full at Costco. Preschools and daycares serve them. Everyone deserves to know the truth.
Isn’t it time we all refuse to buy junk food designed to be addictive that has no nutritional value for our kids?",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/3-ingredients-linked-to-cancer/,3 Ingredients Linked To Cancer In Our Food (Check your products!),"I recently spoke at a large event in Tampa, where I discussed the lies we are being fed about our food (by the very people we should be able to trust) and how we can protect ourselves.
Afterwards I talked with many of the people there and listened to their struggles with their health, which many attributed to the food they were eating.
For example, I met a man who worked for Pepsi for over 20 years. He used to drink Mountain Dew every day. He was going blind in one eye, had diabetes and heart disease. It was heartbreaking.
And while I was there to teach the truth about ingredients in our food, I learned an important lesson that day…
We have A LOT of work to do.
The more I see how badly people are negatively affected by our food system in this country, the more passion grows within me to change it.
What I am about to share with you will alarm you – it’s so downright appalling. But you need to know about it.
There is a BIG misconception that the FDA diligently reviews and approves the ingredients that go into our food, and that they are protecting us from dangerous ingredients.
The truth is that the FDA has done very little to improve the food system in this country, and continually allow us to eat harmful food additives, with very little oversight. Even worse, they fail to act (sometimes for YEARS) after an ingredient has been found to be unsafe. (1)
For example – It took the FDA decades to remove “Partially Hydrogenated Oils” from our food, even though they began being implicated in heart attacks in the 1950’s. (2) There have been several products that have been deemed “FDA Approved” which were yanked from the market years after they were shown to be downright dangerous.
What’s really scary is that history shows that something very serious needs to happen – like deaths – before the FDA takes action. Does someone really need to die before an ingredient is banned? In the eyes of the FDA, that may be the case.
I put together a few examples for you of ingredients that have been allowed into our food supply, despite ample research linking them to cancer. The fact that these are (or have been) allowed in our food is outrageous, as there are safer ingredients and practices that could be used by the industry.
This is not an exhaustive list, as sadly the list of potentially cancerous ingredients in our food is much longer.
You’ll find Titanium Dioxide in reportedly over 11,000 products in U.S. grocery stores and SO MANY products targeting children…Including some you’d never know because it’s hidden under another name on the ingredient list!
This whitening and brightening agent was banned in Europe after the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found it no longer safe to eat based on their review of hundreds of scientific studies showing that it has genotoxic effects. This means that it has the ability to damage DNA, leading to cancer. (3)
Food companies all over Europe swiftly removed this chemical…but they aren’t in America. Because Titanium Dioxide is still allowed by the FDA here. Beware that the FDA doesn’t even require food companies to list Titanium Dioxide by name on an ingredient list. It can also be listed as “artificial color” “artificial color added” or “color added” on an ingredient list.
There’s a bill pending in California that will ban the use of Titanium Dioxide. (4) If this CA bill passes and these companies want to continue selling these products in California, they would need to remove Titanium Dioxide. Which would likely mean that their products would change nationwide because it would be difficult to create a different product without Titanium Dioxide just for California. This is pretty cool if you ask me! In the meantime, make sure you check the ingredient label for titanium dioxide, artificial color, or color added.
Popular products with Titanium Dioxide:


This is an artificial sweetener made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine, otherwise known by the brand name “Splenda”. Research done in Europe showed that rats developed leukemia and related blood cancers after consuming Sucralose. (5) This is why the Center For Science In The Public Interest (CSPI) considers Sucralose a top ingredient to avoid. (6) There are other health risks associated with Sucralose too, such as disrupting healthy gut bacteria and inducing food cravings. (7, 8) You’ll often find Sucralose in “zero sugar” drinks and other products targeting people trying to lose weight, but it’s in some kid’s products too.
Popular products with Sucralose:

BHA is otherwise known as Butylated Hydroxyanisole. This preservative has been shown to be an endocrine disruptor, increasing the risk of cancer. (9) The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies BHA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans“ (10) and it has been deemed a “reasonably anticipated human carcinogen” by the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, National Toxicology Program. (11) Its use is severely restricted in Europe, but the FDA doesn’t care and allows food companies to use it in America. (12) You’ll often find this preservative in sausage, pizza, canned soup, boxed potatoes, drink mixes, canned refried beans, spaghetti sauce, and chewing gum.
Popular products with BHA:

https://foodbabe.com/why-are-mms-in-america-made-with-artificial-ingredients-they-dont-use-in-other-countries/,Why are M&M’s in America made with artificial ingredients they don’t use in other countries?,"Nothing disgusts me more than food companies sabotaging us with ingredients they don’t use in other countries. Especially in products that children often eat.
One of the most outrageous examples of this are M&M’s.
That’s because not only do they use safer ingredients in M&M’s in other countries, but they lied to us…
I filmed a video to explain:

Mars Candy (the maker of M&M’s) told the media they were going to remove artificial colors from their candy in 2016,
But THEY NEVER DID. (1)

This was 7 Years Ago!
And even worse…
M&M’s in U.S. contain 10 artificial colors.
M&M’s in U.K. contain ONE.

The food regulations in Europe and U.K. are stronger. Europe takes a “precautionary principle” approach towards food additives that are potentially risky. They ban or add warning labels to these additives for their citizens.
This is why artificial dyes Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Red 40 require a WARNING LABEL in Europe and the U.K. that says:
The U.S. government doesn’t use the precautionary principle. They won’t remove additives from our food supply until they have been proven dangerous – which can take a very long time and a lot of red tape. This means Americans are literally the lab rats.
It’s been shown time and again that if a company can get away with using cheaper ingredients, they will. And artificial colors are CHEAP compared to natural alternatives.
Simply put, Blue 1 doesn’t require a warning label. So they can get away with still using Blue 1 in the U.K. without slapping a warning label on M&M’s.
M&M’s only keeps out the artificial colors that require a warning label.
Shady….right?!?!?
Blue 1 doesn’t require a warning label because it wasn’t cited in the Southampton Study which found that when children eat certain artificial colors it can lead to hyperactivity. This study prompted the EU to adopt the warning label. (2)
That doesn’t make Blue 1 and more safe to eat!
There is ample research that all artificial colors are a risk to eat. They can disrupt the immune system, are contaminated with carcinogens, can have a negative impact on children’s ability to learn, and have been linked to long-term health problems such as asthma, skin rashes, and migraines. (3)
Millions of American kids eat M&Ms. They are practically synonymous with Halloween, Christmas, and Easter.
Mars said they would remove the dyes. Shouldn’t they keep their promise?
Instead of M&M’s you can buy YumEarth Choco Yums or Unreal Gems, which both don’t have artificial colors.

What do you feed your kids?
How do I get them to not only eat vegetables…but LOVE them?
Which snacks are good for us…and also fun to eat?
How do we navigate the processed food in restaurants?…or when traveling?
What do I pack in my kid’s lunch that they’ll actually eat?

Introducing my new book in 2023…


In this book, I show you all the ins and outs of our life as a Food Babe Family, walking you through how I feed my children (and myself!) on a daily basis.
I actually almost published Food Babe Family into TWO books, because it’s jam-packed with so much information. This book has all the tools, information, and recipes you need to feed your children in a way that will foster a love for real food and set them up for a life of healthy eating.
You’ll find more than 100 delicious recipes that make it simple to put healthy, real food on the table that the entire family will love. From Pumpkin Muffins to Taco Salad Cups, Zucchini Pizza Bites, “Chick-Fil-A” Chicken Nuggets and Waffle Fries, and even Homemade “Oreos”.


This book isn’t just for parents or those with children living at home. It’s for everyone. This is how I eat and the recipes I’m passing on to my loved ones. I guarantee you’re going to love having this in your kitchen.
Food Babe Family also makes a thoughtful gift for anyone you know who has children or is expecting. And it will be available just in time for holiday gift giving season.
Food Babe Family will hit bookstores everywhere on October 17, 2023, but is available to pre-order so you can reserve your copy!
Why should you pre-order now? I’m glad you asked…
Here are some outtakes and behind-the-scenes photos of our photoshoot for this cookbook. It’s hard to believe but we shot all of the pictures at my house for this book in TWO DAYS. There were hundreds of shots to choose from, and only some of these made it into the cookbook. Let me just say that it was 48 hours of pure craziness between naps and set changes, but my photographer Susan Stripling is amazing and I’d never have been able to do it without her and my team there to make it run smoothly.





The multimillion dollar food industry has used their vast resources to target parents, convincing them that it’s difficult to feed their children good food. But here’s the truth: parenting is difficult, but feeding your children simple, healthy, real food shouldn’t be.
Our children are the future. Setting them up with the tools they need to thrive in a world that is overloaded with fast, easy junk food full of health-wrecking ingredients is a practice that’s worth its weight in gold.

TITANIUM DIOXIDE: Banned in Europe after scientists at the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found it “no longer safe to eat” based on their review of hundreds of scientific studies showing that it has genotoxic effects. This means that it has the ability to damage DNA, leading to cancer. (1)
ARTIFICIAL COLORS: Dyes derived from petroleum, linked to several health issues including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. Recent research shows they may also disrupt the immune system. (2)
RED 3: The FDA banned this artificial color from cosmetics in 1990 after it was shown to cause cancer in animal studies, but they still allow it in our food! A bill is currently pending in both California and New York that will ban Red 3 from food…but for now it’s up to us to read the ingredient list to avoid it. (1)
NATURAL & ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. Preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol) – None of which are labeled. With these flavors, chemists can make anything taste like “strawberry shortcake” without any actual strawberries (or any real food for that matter), which is a really horrible thing if you care about health. But it’s a great thing for food manufacturers because these flavors are much cheaper than using real food. (2)
BHA: Shown to be an endocrine disruptor, linked to cancer, causing tumors in animal studies. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies BHA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans“ and it’s been deemed a “reasonably anticipated human carcinogen” by the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, National Toxicology Program. (2)
TBHQ: Controversial preservative that may harm the immune system and increase the risk of food allergies. Scientific research has shown that TBHQ negatively affects “T-cells” in the body (which are generally used to fight infections) in a way that promotes allergies to tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat and shellfish. (2)
POLYSORBATE 80: An emulsifier linked to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. (3)
CARRAGEENAN: A thickener and emulsifier that can cause digestive problems and intestinal inflammation. Tests have found that “food-grade carrageenan” is contaminated with up to 25% of “degraded carrageenan” (the kind not supposed to be used in food and drinks). Degraded carrageenan is classified as a “possible human carcinogen” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. (2)
MONO AND DIGLYCERIDES: This emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing – including canola and soybean oils – which may contain trans fat that is detrimental to our heart health. (2)
HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP (HFCS): This heavily processed sweetener made from GMO cornstarch that contains more fructose than regular corn syrup. Studies have shown it increases appetite and the risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. HFCS especially contributes to type 2 diabetes in children. (2)
ACESULFAME POTASSIUM: An artificial sweetener that the Center for Science in Public Interest says to avoid it because safety testing was inadequate and some research links it to cancer. (2)
HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OILS: These contain small amounts of artificial trans fats which are detrimental to heart health. According to EWG – the FDA has found low levels of trans fat in fully hydrogenated oils. Refined oils go through an insane amount of processing at high temperatures with chemicals to transform them into clear, bland, and odorless product. (4)
SOYBEAN OIL: This unhealthy oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (2)
BLEACHED FLOUR: This is the worst type of flour because it’s been stripped of fiber and nutrients, and comes from a heavily hybridized wheat crop, which may have been pre-harvested with Roundup weed killer, linked to cancer. Treated with up to any of the 60 different chemicals approved by the FDA – including chemical bleach. (2)
The ingredients in Crumbl’s ice cream are just as processed as their cookies. It is full of high fructose corn syrup and emulsifiers that can affect gut bacteria and trigger inflammation and other changes in the gut (2, 3), as well as obesity and metabolic syndrome:

https://foodbabe.com/roundup-weed-killer-detected-on-oatmeal-see-which-brands-how-to-avoid-it/,Roundup weed killer detected on oatmeal (See which brands + how to avoid it!),"Almost every night before bed, I start my slow cooker with steel-cut oats so they’ll be perfectly ready in the morning. They take less than a minute to prep at night before bed and zero time during the morning rush!
While I love this for breakfast, I always choose Organic steel cut oats to make my oatmeal. Here’s why…
Oats are one of those crops commonly contaminated with Roundup weedkiller (glyphosate). This chemical is known to cause cancer. (1)
Organic oats are not sprayed with Roundup, as it’s prohibited on organic crops. Organic oats can be cross-contaminated, but thankfully, tests have found that organic products are less likely to be contaminated and have far fewer residues than conventional products. (3)
It’s important to know that the Non-GMO label doesn’t mean much on plain oats, because all oats are Non-GMO. Also, the non-GMO label doesn’t mean that pesticides are not used, it only means that the ingredients are not genetically engineered. So, it doesn’t mean the same as organic and many pesticides can be used on non-GMO products, like oats. (2)
It is safest to look for oat products that are certified organic, and ideally, that have been certified by a third-party to be free of glyphosate.
The Environmental Working Group (EWG) tested non-GMO oatmeal and found most of it contaminated with Roundup! Quaker Old Fashioned Oats was found to have the most Roundup per sample, with more than 1,000 ppb in two of three samples tested. (3)


Here’s a summary of brands with Roundup detected:
Small amounts of glyphosate (or none) were found on organic brands tested:

https://foodbabe.com/chick-fil-as-cauliflower-sandwich-is-full-of-unhealthy-processed-ingredients-see-the-full-list/,Chick-Fil-A’s Cauliflower Sandwich is full of unhealthy processed ingredients… (See the full list),"When I first heard that Chick-Fil-A was going to start serving up Cauliflower Sandwiches, my first thought was… WOW… you can get a vegetable sandwich at Chick-Fil-A??!?
But my second thought was…
What are in those sandwiches? Knowing the crazy amount of processed ingredients they put in their chicken sandwiches (like MSG, Sodium Aluminum Phosphate, Potassium Iodate, and Dimethylpolysiloxane)… Let’s just say I was REALLY suspicious.
And now that I have the full list of ingredients for the Chick-Fil-A Cauliflower Sandwich in my hot little hands, it’s safe to say my suspicions were confirmed.
This sandwich is NOT what you’d think.
You’d think that you’re just eating healthy cauliflower in a simple sandwich…but NO…
DEAD WRONG.
And before you think that it is a vegetarian or vegan option…it’s not that either “due to its cooking environment”. (1)
Here’s the sad truth:



Just like their chicken, Chick-Fil-A couldn’t resist adding MSG to their cauliflower. Would you EVER add MSG to your healthy cauliflower at home? Of course not.
MSG is used by restaurants to make you crave their food so that you keep coming back. (2) It also makes you eat more than you should. There is simply no other reason to use MSG. It has been shown to help you gain weight, despite how many calories you eat. (3) This is why MSG is fed to rats in animal studies to make them obese! (4, 5) MSG is also an excitotoxin that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. (6) This is one of the top ingredients to avoid if you want to lose weight or maintain your weight. MSG is found in the breading that goes on that cauliflower in this sandwich.
Natural Flavor is another ingredient that is similar to MSG. These are proprietary (ie. secret) mixtures created in a laboratory to make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. (7) Ever eat something and feel like you can’t stop? It probably had natural flavors added.
Companies won’t tell you what ingredients they use to make these flavors…it’s top secret and heavily protected. I don’t know about you, but I hate the idea of eating something with secret ingredients. Who knows what it could be!? We do know that natural flavors can contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives that can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol – none of which are disclosed to the public). (8) Chick-Fil-A adds “natural flavor” to the Honey Buffalo Sauce on the cauliflower sandwich, and also to the Butter Flavored Oil that they spread on their buns (which is mostly soybean oil, and no actual butter).
This is a very popular cooking oil used by most restaurants, but it also happens to be one of the most unhealthy oils out there. It’s widely known that Chick-fil-A uses peanut oil in their fryers, but you may not know that they use soybean oil in their buns, breading, and some sauces. Soybean oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological conditions, and autoimmune diseases. (9, 10, 11) Several animal and human studies have found that eating seed oils (like soybean oil) increases obesity. (12, 13, 14, 15) The dramatic rise of soybean oil consumption in recent decades parallels the rise in obesity. (16, 17)
Soybean oil is also made from GMO soybeans (heavily treated with pesticides and Roundup) and the oil is extracted with hexane–a neurotoxin! During processing, whole soybeans are submerged in hexane to separate the oil from the protein. It’s possible that some of the hexane remains in the oil (which is why organic expeller-pressed oils are safer). (18) It’s much healthier to use organic virgin coconut oil, avocado oil, grass-fed ghee and extra virgin olive oil.
Potassium Iodate: I was surprised to see this controversial dough conditioner in the buns at Chick-fil-A. Most store-bought bread brands have stopped using it and it’s thankfully becoming increasingly rare. This ingredient has been linked to an increased risk of cancer because it can lead to excessive intake of iodine when it’s used in bread. It may also break down in dough to form iodide (a Japanese study found that high doses of potassium iodide leads to cancer in rats). (19)
Xanthan Gum: This thickening ingredient in Chick-fil-A’s Honey Buffalo Sauce has recently been shown to actively alter the gut microbiome. (20) Gut bacteria is very important for our health and well-being, so disrupting this can have a negative effect on overall health. Animal studies have shown it to be inflammatory as well. (21) This additive is often made from GMO corn.
Potassium Sorbate: This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer. (22) It has also been shown to damage DNA when it’s mixed with Ascorbic Acid (which is also an ingredient in Chick-fil-A’s Cauliflower Sandwich). (23)
Enriched Bleached Wheat Flour: That healthy cauliflower is breaded in the most processed and refined flour known to man. It’s stripped of fiber and nutrients and is essentially dead food, so they “enrich” it with synthetic vitamins that are not from nature. It comes from a heavily hybridized wheat crop, which may have been pre-harvested with a spraying of Roundup weed killer, a chemical strongly linked to cancer. (24)
Sodium Aluminum Phosphate: This leavening agent in the breading contains Aluminum (a neurotoxin) which can build up in your body over time, especially if you have kidney issues.
Dimethylpolysiloxane: This de-foaming agent is added to the fryers at Chick-fil-A. It’s otherwise known as the main ingredient in Silly Putty. It was commonly used as a filler fluid in breast implants, until it was phased out due to safety concerns. If this substance is considered to be a hazardous ingredient when it’s placed inside our bodies, doesn’t it make you wonder why the FDA says we can eat it?
I’ll tell ya why. They are jumping on the cauliflower trend to lure you into believing this sandwich is the healthy plant-based fast food option you’ve been dreaming about.
I get so angry when I see products like this because I used to be so duped by them! It checks all the boxes I’d look for… lower in calories, full of vegetables, easy to pick up on my busy lunch break.
Well thankfully, I’m duped NO MORE.
If you love Chick-Fil-A…don’t despair! I have some incredible copycat recipes that will satisfy your cravings without the nasty ingredients:
All of the major media networks (CNN, Yahoo, The Washington Post, USA Today, Fox Business) wrote about Chick-fil-A’s new Cauliflower Sandwich and never even bothered to investigate or report about the ingredients. All they did was promote it. It’s shameful! This is why it’s important to seek out independent investigative reporting on topics like this.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/insane-facts-about-doritos-how-to-make-homemade-doritos-recipe/,Insane facts about Doritos + How To Make Homemade Doritos (RECIPE!),"A recent survey revealed that Doritos are the most popular snack in America, out-ranking M&M’s.
I probably shouldn’t be surprised. I can hardly recall a time that I’ve gone to a party or outdoor cookout where Doritos aren’t being served. Have you ever wondered WHY this is? What makes them so appealing?
I did some digging and found some insane facts about Doritos…





100 million Americans consume Doritos each year. And 6.65 million Americans consume 8 or MORE bags a month.
Eight bags a month! WOW! I told you…It’s insane how popular Doritos are.
First, they contain MSG.
MSG is only added to food to make it taste so irresistible that you keep coming back for more. MSG is what they feed rats in scientific studies to make them fat. It also is associated with increased risk of obesity in humans. Studies show this additive can help you gain weight, despite how many calories you eat.
Then they pile on “Natural Flavors” and “Artificial Flavors”.
These are proprietary mixtures crafted in a lab, which are very similar to MSG. These flavors are designed so that you experience the best 1 millionth part of the taste – so you keep wanting to go back for more and more, searching continuously for gratification – eating more of that product.
Sound familiar???
This is concerning because Doritos in America are filled with artificial colors that they don’t use in other countries. These artificial colors are derived from petroleum and linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. Recent research shows they may also disrupt the immune system.
Doritos in the U.S. also contain GMO ingredients and have tested positive for Roundup weedkiller residues linked to cancer.
If you eat Doritos, is it time to stop buying them?
The decision is yours.
This homemade version tastes incredible too, especially when they are still a bit warm from the oven! You’ll find my recipe for Homemade Doritos (which are organic and non-GMO) in the Food Babe Kitchen cookbook. If you don’t have my cookbook yet, I’ll post the recipe for you below so you can try it ASAP!

https://foodbabe.com/orange-creamsicle-pops-recipe-healthy-swap-for-store-bought-creamsicles/,Orange Creamsicle Pops Recipe (Healthy Swap For Store-Bought Creamsicles!),"Orange Creamsicles were one of my favorite treats as a child, and since I’ve learned how bad the ingredients are in them, I’ve really missed them. Thankfully, I’ve figured out how to recreate this summertime staple with 100% real food ingredients which are actually healthy for you!


I used to LOVE when my mom bought Orange Creamsicles as a child and ate them all summer long. Back then, we had no idea how bad the ingredients were in those little suckers!
Orange Creamsicles are PACKED with seven different types of refined sugar: corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, maltodextrin, sugar, fructose, corn syrup solids, and orange juice “concentrate”.
Did you know that juice “concentrate” is juice that is boiled down to a syrup? This heating process destroys beneficial nutrients and turns it into a refined sugar. Some experts say it is similar to high-fructose corn syrup!
Then they add in several controversial emulsifiers, “natural” flavors, and conventional milk. Check out this comparison:

First, you’ll need a good popsicle mold that isn’t made of plastic. I like these stainless steel ones.
Then, you’ll simply blend the coconut milk, bananas, vanilla extract, and sea salt in a blender until smooth. This is your “cream” for the creamsicles.
To assemble, add one tablespoon of fresh pressed orange juice to each popsicle mold (6 to 8 of them) and top this with one tablespoon of your cream mixture. Stick a popsicle stick in it and freeze this first layer for a hour. Now, repeat the process and build your second layer with one tablespoon orange juice and one tablespoon of cream mixture per creamsicle and pop it in the freezer for 2 more hours. That’s it!

I hope you get to make these healthy orange “creamsicles” soon. If you know anyone who might still be buying Orange Creamsicles full of high fructose corn syrup and other nasty ingredients, please share this healthy swap with them!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/popeyes-spicy-chicken-sandwich-ingredients-exposed-see-whats-in-those-cajun-fries-biscuits-too/,Popeyes Spicy Chicken Sandwich Ingredients Exposed (See what’s in those Cajun Fries & Biscuits too!),"When Popeyes came out with their Spicy Chicken Sandwich a couple years ago, it was unlike anything I’d ever seen. Lines were around the block and the demand was so insane that they sold out of these sandwiches for weeks. (1) My first thought was, “What in the world is in those things that people can’t seem to get enough?”
I had to know what was in them!
Popeyes doesn’t publish their ingredients on their website like other major fast places do (KFC and McDonald’s) and they generally keep their ingredients under tight wraps. There are some old Popeyes ingredient lists floating around online – but these are outdated and don’t include the Spicy Chicken Sandwich.
I contacted Popeyes and asked for their ingredients list – but they gave me their “nutrition facts” instead, which is just the calories, fat grams, etc… and really doesn’t tell you anything about what you’re actually eating.
I contacted them again… and got the same canned response. Womp Womp!
I have to admit, I’ve never eaten a Popeyes Spicy Chicken Sandwich. I don’t eat at places who refuse to disclose their ingredients. It’s totally shady to hide what the actual ingredients are in your food, and I knew that if Popeyes wasn’t willing to share what’s in their food, I wouldn’t eat there.
Refusing to give up, I recently contacted Popeyes AGAIN for their ingredients and to my surprise they sent me the full list of ingredients in their Spicy Chicken Sandwich, Cajun Fries, and Biscuits. YEAH!!
This has been a long time coming, so I can’t wait to share Popeyes ingredients with you.


This is a far cry from how it’s marketed to us:
“Popeyes’ Spicy Chicken Sandwich features a chicken breast filet marinated in Louisiana seasonings, then battered and breaded in a new buttermilk coating. The filet is served with barrel-cured pickles and Spicy Mayonnaise on a toasted buttery brioche bun.”
MSG is purely used to make you crave their food and eat more than you should. There is simply no other reason to use MSG. Now it’s no surprise how Popeyes has hooked you on their Spicy Chicken Sandwiches and keeps you coming back for more and more.
MSG can also help you gain weight, despite how many calories you eat…
A study from researchers at the University of North Carolina looked at the diets of 752 men and women and found those who ate MSG were more likely to be overweight or obese even with the same amount of physical activity and calorie intake. So even if you’re NOT overeating, MSG could be silently packing on pounds. (2)
MSG is also an excitotoxin that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, so there are other health risks associated with it as well. (3)


Artificial Colors (Yellow #5, Yellow #6, Red #3): Derived from petroleum, may cause hyperactivity in children (4) & can disrupt the immune system. (5) Red #3 was banned by the FDA from cosmetics due to its link to cancer, so it is especially concerning. (6)
Powdered Cellulose and Methylcellulose: This thickener is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring when found in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. (7)
Sodium Aluminum Phosphate: Contains aluminum (a neurotoxin) which can build up in your body over time. (8)
Soybean Oil: This unhealthy oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (9)
BHT: Risky preservative linked to cancer. Unnecessary and not permitted in Europe or Australia. (10)
Dimethylpolysiloxane: Main ingredient in Silly Putty. Was commonly used as a filler fluid in breast implants, however this substance was phased out due to safety concerns. (11) If this substance is considered to be a hazardous ingredient when it’s placed inside our bodies, doesn’t it make you wonder why the FDA says we can eat it?
And let’s talk about Popeyes Biscuits…
Popeyes Biscuits aren’t like grandma used to make! They may contain buttermilk…but they also contain artificial flavors, carrageenan (linked to intestinal inflammation), Potassium Sorbate (linked to DNA damage), and Aluminum (a neurotoxin). No thanks!
“At Popeyes US, we’re working towards banning 120 artificial ingredients and offering a menu that is free from colors, flavors, and preservatives from artificial sources by 2025, wherever possible.” – Popeyes Website, June 2022 (12)
Popeyes is owned by Restaurant Brands International (who also owns Burger King). Burger King recently “Blacklisted” 120 artificial ingredients from their food… but when I looked into this I found that this was a bunch of B.S. (13) Many of the ingredients they banned from their food are not approved by the FDA anyway, and their food is still riddled with controversial ingredients. Will Popeyes ban the same 120 ingredients? This is likely. That’s why it’s a pretty safe bet that Popeyes commitment to serving real food without artificial ingredients is B.S. too and just a shady marketing ploy.
“Our chicken is free of added hormones and steroids. In the US, our chicken is now also raised without the use of antibiotics important to human medicine, as defined by the World Health Organization.” – Popeyes Website, June 2022 (12)
Popeyes claims their chicken is “free of added hormones”, but this actually means nothing. All chicken in the U.S. is free from added hormones because it’s been banned since the 1950’s. (14)
They also claim their chicken is “raised without the use of antibiotics important to human medicine”, which means they aren’t using antibiotics that are also used on humans. They may routinely use OTHER antibiotics when raising chicken, which is concerning. (15) That’s because the overuse of any antibiotic in animal agriculture has the ability to contribute to antibiotic resistance, which is a huge threat to our health – meaning that in the future if you get an infection, you won’t be able to treat it with antibiotics anymore because they don’t work. (15)
“Eliminating medically important antibiotics for growth purposes is now the standard in the meat and poultry industry, so restaurants or meat producers that have this policy aren’t doing anything beyond what they’re already supposed to be doing.” – Michael Hansen, Ph.D., senior scientist at Consumer Reports. (15)
Thanks to the work and a petition by Compassion in World Farming asking Popeyes to stop factory farming practices (16), Popeyes has agreed to some changes. By 2024, Popeyes committed to transitioning their breeds, providing more space and enhanced living environments (litter quality, lighting, etc) for their chickens per GAP standards. (17) While this is good, I don’t personally believe it’s enough.
When I’m craving a chicken sandwich, there is nothing better than making one at home with pastured chicken and organic ingredients. I perfected the perfect “fried” chicken sandwich (which is actually baked) that tastes like a Chick-fil-A sandwich, and even better actually.

https://foodbabe.com/burger-king-ingredients-finally-revealed-in-the-whopper-fries-and-chicken-nuggets/,"Burger King Ingredients Finally Revealed in the Whopper, Fries, and Chicken Nuggets","This is a very important investigation into Burger King that you need to know about. What I’m about to share with you is the ultimate example of a food corporation swindling the public into believing their food is something that it’s not.
You may have seen all over the media last September that Burger King banned 120 artificial ingredients from their restaurants. (1) They partnered with celebrities, like Nelly, to sell their new “Keep It Real” meals:
Burger King published a “Blacklist” of their banned ingredients on their website. (2) However, when I pulled up their blacklist, I noticed something very interesting…


Many of these ingredients haven’t been allowed in American food for decades, so of course Burger King doesn’t use them. For instance, you’ll find Violet 1 on their list, which hasn’t been allowed in food since 1973! (3) These ingredients may be artificial…but they aren’t allowed anyway. This is why it is beyond shady that Burger King would include these ingredients on their list, knowing that most consumers (and apparently also the media who covered their story) wouldn’t know this.
(These ingredients are highlighted red in the graphic above)
For example, Burger King separately lists these ingredients, which are different names for the same ingredient:
Are these duplicates a mistake on their part? Or are they trying to trick us by making their list look longer?
(These ingredients are highlighted green in the graphic above)
I have never seen a processed food product with Anoxomer added. I’ve also never read an ingredient list and saw THBP or Trihydroxybutyrophenonon the list. I basically read food labels for a living, so this is really saying something! These ingredients may sound “scary” and make Burger King’s list look legit… but I highly doubt that Burger King ever used many of the ingredients on their list in the first place, because they are so rare or aren’t permitted in products they sell.
(These ingredients are highlighted yellow in the graphic below)

Burger King tells us what isn’t in their food, but doesn’t want to tell us what actually is in it.
If they really want to show how “REAL” their food is, shouldn’t they publish all their ingredients online for everyone to see?
Could it be because they don’t want you to know what’s really in their food?

Burger King’s bun is laced with several dough conditioners, such as Calcium Peroxide which is banned in China (5) and Potassium Iodate that’s linked to an increased risk of cancer because it can lead to excessive intake of iodine when it’s used in bread. (6) It may also break down in dough to form iodide (a Japanese study found that high doses of potassium iodide leads to cancer in rats). (6) The Whopper also contains processed ingredients DATEM and Mono and Diglycerides, which are byproducts of oil processing – including canola and soybean oils – which may contain trans fat. (7)
Burger King’s Chicken Nuggets are “Seasoned” with chemicals that are designed to keep you coming back for more, Yeast Extract (hidden MSG) and Natural Flavors (which are proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible).

Burger King’s Fries are coated in “Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate” (which keeps their frozen fries from turning gray) and unhealthy vegetable oils like Canola Oil and Soybean Oil, which increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (8) Soybean oil almost always comes from GMO soybeans – which have been shown to contain high levels of residues from the herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) compared to non-GMO soybeans. (9)
Burger King might not use high fructose corn syrup….But they still use corn syrup.
They might not use artificial flavors…But they still use natural flavors (which is essentially the same thing).
They might not use MSG…But they still use Yeast Extract, which contains free glutamic acid and is used as a replacement for MSG. (10)

These nuggets have that irresistible taste and crispy coating, without the nasty ingredients that Chick-fil-A uses. They are also baked, instead of fried, which also makes them a healthier option.


If you’ve ever wondered why Chick-fil-A’s chicken is so addicting, here’s your answer!

Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a “flavor enhancer” that heightens the flavor of food by exciting neurons in the brain when eaten. This sounds like a good idea for spicing up bland foods, but MSG isn’t as innocent as it seems:
A 2008 study from researchers at the University of North Carolina looked at the diets of 752 men and women and found those who ate MSG were more likely to be overweight or obese even with the same amount of physical activity and total calorie intake. So even if you’re not overeating, MSG could be silently packing on pounds. (1)
MSG makes food taste so good that you help yourself to too much, which further sabotages your weight. (2) Ever wonder why you can remember the difference in taste between a Chick-fil-A’s Chicken and other fast food chains? It’s because of MSG. They engineer their food to make a flavor irresistible and memorable so you eat more.
Chick-fil-A (and other food companies) know you don’t want to see MSG on their ingredient lists, so they will often substitute it with the additives “Yeast Extract” or “Autolyzed Yeast”, which contain the main component of MSG and is essentially the same thing. (3) Chick-fil-A does this by adding Yeast Extract to some of their chicken. You’ll find yeast extract added to Chick-fil-A’s “healthier items”: grilled chicken nuggets, grilled chicken sandwich, and grilled chicken salads.
You’ll want to plan ahead, however, because to get that authentic “Chick-fil-A” taste you will marinate the chicken for at least 6 hours. It’s generally the easiest to prep these at night and let them marinate overnight.
Carefully cut three boneless chicken breasts into 1-inch chunks and set them aside. Pull out a medium bowl and whisk together two eggs and 3/4 cup each of pickle juice and milk (dairy or non-dairy). Add the chicken pieces, cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours. Overnight is best.

Most pickles are dyed with artificial colors (yellow 5 or yellow 6) to make them look brighter, but these dyes are linked to hyperactivity in children and other health risks. (4) Simply read the ingredient list on the pickles you buy to ensure they don’t contain artificial colors.
Turn on your oven and preheat it to 400 degrees. In a medium bowl, mix together the spelt flour, powdered sugar, paprika, dry mustard, sea salt and pepper.
Drain the marinade from the chicken and dredge the pieces in the flour mixture until fully coated:

Place the chicken on a parchment-lined baking sheet, providing space in between each piece. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.

I’ve figured out how to recreate Chick-fil-A’s sauce without the nasty corn syrup, soybean oil, natural flavors… and other unhealthy ingredients.


We’re not going to use all those crazy ingredients to make a dipping sauce. You can choose to dip them in Primal Kitchen Unsweetened Ketchup, or you can make one of these delicious dipping sauces:



I hope this gives you a ton of options! I also hope you try these nuggets soon and you are able to satisfy your craving for Chick-fil-A nuggets without the MSG and controversial ingredients.

Let me tell you…
These flaky and buttery pastries are DEADLY delicious.  And even better…
They are SO EASY to make. And look so fancy. You’ll impress your family and friends with your mad cooking skills. Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone that you weren’t spending hours in the kitchen to make these (they only take 30 minutes!) Shhhh…It’s our little secret.

Yes…these DO taste as amazing as they look.
I almost hate to call them “Toaster Strudels” because they are a million times better than those Pillsbury ones made with gross ingredients. Have you seen what’s in those things?

Pillsbury uses a tiny amount of “Strawberry Juice Concentrate” which are strawberries that were boiled to death into a syrup, mixed with artificial colors, thickeners, artificial flavors, and corn syrup, to make it taste and look like real strawberries. Yuck!
It’s sad to think how many parents are unknowingly buying these for their children…who might even be eating all these man-made processed ingredients for breakfast… potentially disrupting their young immune systems and triggering inflammation.
Thankfully, we now have a MUCH better option:

Most store-bought pastry dough and jam is made with dreadful ingredients, like hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup. Ideally, you will take a little extra time to make homemade organic jam and pastry dough. This is the best way to control the ingredients, especially since it isn’t always easy to find clean and organic versions of these products in the store. However, there are some better options available.


You actually won’t use a toaster at all… as we bake these in the oven instead. They would get quite messy if we tried to use a toaster, and they get perfectly flaky and puffy when you bake them in the oven.
To get started, preheat your oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper.
Measure out 1/2 cup of jam and put it in a small bowl. Stir in half a tablespoon of arrowroot powder (this will thicken up the filling a bit). Set this bowl aside.
Grab another small bowl and whisk together one egg with a tablespoon of heavy cream. This is the egg wash that you will brush on the pastries before baking. Set this bowl aside too.
Take out your puff pastry, and cut the sheet into 8 equal size rectangles. Place these on the baking sheet like this:

You’ll want to keep the puff pastry as cold as possible while working with it, so move quickly onto the next step.
Put one heaping tablespoon of jam onto the center of four rectangles, leaving roughly 1/2” around the edges. Brush the edges lightly with the egg wash. You can use a brush, or it’s just as easy to use your finger since it’s a small surface and you only need a little bit.
Place an empty puff pastry rectangle on top and seal it together using the back of a fork until it looks like a Toaster Strudel. Repeat with remaining ingredients until you end up with 4 strudels:
Brush the tops of each strudel with the egg wash and bake for 20 to 22 minutes or until golden brown.
While the strudels are baking, it’s time to make the icing.
Mix together the icing ingredients (powdered sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla) in a small bowl. You’ll want to be able to drizzle it over your strudels, so add more cream if necessary to thin it out. The thicker the icing the more it will have that bright white color once drizzled on top. The thinner the icing is, the more it will be transparent after it is applied.
Once the baked strudels have cooled, drizzle the icing on top. Now they’re ready to enjoy!

They taste incredible when they’re fresh and still warm from the oven. Are you drooling yet?
Here’s the printable recipe that you’ll want to keep handy!

https://foodbabe.com/stop-buying-hidden-valley-ranch-seasoning-make-this-recipe-instead/,Stop Buying Hidden Valley Ranch Seasoning (Make This Recipe Instead!),"I recently shared my recipe for homemade taco seasoning – and since then you’ve been asking for a Ranch Seasoning recipe to replace those packets of Hidden Valley Ranch (which is full of MSG and other nasties). Without further ado, I went to work in the kitchen and figured out how to make an easy ranch seasoning mix with real food ingredients that you can use to make delicious ranch dressing, ranch dip, or in other recipes.
MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG): A flavor-enhancer and excitotoxin that excites brain cells to death, increases food cravings, and makes you eat more than you should.
ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Chemical mixtures produced by fractional distillation and chemical manipulation of various chemicals like crude oil or coal tar. Artificial flavors are much cheaper than using real food and make fake food taste irresistible.
NATURAL FLAVORS: Proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more.
CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE: This thickener usually made from wood because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring when found in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems.

It’s always best to buy organic herbs and spices, because virtually all conventional brands sold in the U.S. are fumigated and irradiated. These practices leave a finished product with decreased levels of vitamins and natural enzymes – and all that processing changes the chemical composition of a spice, potentially creating toxic, carcinogenic by-products. Organic spices are not irradiated and cannot have genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs), artificial colors, preservatives, and other synthetic anti-caking agents. Some of my favorite spice companies include –  Simply Organic, Frontier, and various store-brands that are organic.
I also choose an organic buttermilk powder instead of conventional brands. That’s because organic regulations prohibit the use of synthetic hormones, antibiotics, and GMO feed – and I don’t want residues of any of that in my food. You can find organic buttermilk powder in most natural food grocery stores and online.

To make ranch dressing with this seasoning, mix 3 tablespoons of the mix with 1 cup mayo and 1 cup milk. I like to use organic grass-fed milk or nut milk, and mayo that is made with olive oil or avocado oil, such as Chosen Foods brand.  Beware that almost every brand of mayo (even organic!) are made with unhealthy soybean oil or canola oil. You’ll find that the majority that say they are “Made with Olive Oil” are actually mostly sunflower oil or other inferior oils. This is why it pays to be careful and read the ingredient list to see what you are really buying. Don’t get swindled into buying Olive Oil Mayo made with mostly soybean oil!
To make ranch dip with this seasoning, mix 3 tablespoons of the mix with 2 cups sour cream. You can use an organic pasture-raised sour cream (such as Organic Valley brand) or a vegan sour “cream” (like Forager Project brand). Feel free to add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice too, if desired.


Please share this ranch seasoning recipe with your ranch-loving friends. There’s no reason to keep buying those expensive packets of Hidden Valley Ranch full of questionable ingredients!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/3-ingredient-homemade-hot-cocoa-recipe-healthy-swap-for-swiss-miss-hot-chocolate/,3-Ingredient Homemade Hot Cocoa Recipe (Healthy swap for Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate!),"Whenever we get snowstorms here in Charlotte I feel nostalgic about when I was a child and my mom would mix up Swiss Miss hot cocoa after we got done playing in the snow. It was the best way to warm up my cold little hands!
This gets me wondering now though… What are the ingredients in Swiss Miss? They can’t be that bad, right? Shouldn’t it be basically cocoa powder and sugar?
I ran down to the supermarket to see for myself. And boy was I wrong!


CORN SYRUP or CORN SYRUP SOLIDS (in Swiss Miss, Nestle, Great Value): A heavily processed form of sugar typically made from the starch of GMO corn. This refined sugar has zero nutritional value.
CONVENTIONAL WHEY or DAIRY SOLIDS (in Swiss Miss, Nestle, Great Value): Derived from conventionally raised dairy cows who were likely raised in a large factory farm on a diet of GMOs and routine antibiotics.
NATURAL FLAVORS (in Swiss Miss, Good & Gather, Great Value): A proprietary ingredient that can contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives that can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol – none of which are labeled).
ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (in Nestle, Great Value): Chemical mixtures produced by fractional distillation and chemical manipulation of various chemicals like crude oil or coal tar. Much cheaper than using real food ingredients, and used to make processed food taste irresistible.
MONO AND DIGLYCERIDES (in Swiss Miss, Great Value): This emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing – including canola and soybean oils – which may contain trans fat that is detrimental to our heart health.
SUCRALOSE (in Nestle): Artificial sweetener made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine. Has been linked to leukemia and related blood cancers in animal studies.
CELLULOSE GUM (in Nestle, Great Value): This thickener and emulsifier is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring when found in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems.

There are some good organic store-bought hot cocoa mixes, such as Nib Mor, Lake Champlain, or Equal Exchange, but it is way cheaper to make your own. You can make a big batch and store it in a glass jar for when the craving strikes!

All you do is mix together one cup each of cacao powder and coconut sugar. Stir in one and a half cups of coconut milk powder and store the hot cocoa mix in a jar. When you’re ready to make cocoa, simply add 3 tablespoons of hot cocoa mix to a mug and stir in hot water. Each jar makes 18 servings!
If you want to be fancy – you can add some ground cinnamon or vanilla powder to your mix. You can also add a drop of vanilla extract or peppermint extract to your hot cocoa when making a cup.
I sometimes like to top my homemade hot cocoa with natural marshmallows – and never Kraft Jet Puffed or other conventional marshmallows that contain artificial blue dye – bleh!
SmashMallows are the brand I currently buy because I haven’t found an organic brand or another dye-free brand without carrageenan (Dandies uses carrageenan). I’m hoping SmashMallows go organic one day!


I hope your family loves this hot cocoa as much as we do!

https://foodbabe.com/homemade-taco-seasoning-recipe-replace-packets-full-of-processed-ingredients/,Homemade Taco Seasoning Recipe (Replace Packets Full Of Processed Ingredients!),"When I first started my clean eating journey many years ago, one of the best things I ever did was clean out my pantry. I took out everything and carefully read the ingredients on each product. If I didn’t know what an ingredient was or how it could affect my body, I got rid of it… and never looked back!
This helped me learn so much about the processed products that I was buying all the time that I thought I couldn’t live without… like those little packets of Old El Paso Taco Seasoning which are filled with questionable ingredients. Who knew that it’s actually cheaper (and super easy) to mix up my own taco seasoning at home with just a handful of spices that are easy to keep on hand?

Plus, homemade tacos taste wayyy better when they aren’t corrupted with all those nasty ingredients found in packets like de-caking agents, refined oils, and flavor enhancers designed in a lab…

Ortega slaps a big “No MSG Added” label on the front of their taco seasoning, but if you check the ingredient list you’ll find that it contains “Yeast Extract”. This ingredient contains free glutamic acid – the main component of MSG. Food companies don’t want to get a bad rap by putting monosodium glutamate (MSG) on their ingredient list, so they use ingredients like Yeast Extract to secretly add this potent flavor enhancer to your food right under our noses. What a sneaky trick!

Ortega doesn’t tell you what “spices” they use besides paprika and garlic powder, so you’ve got to wonder how much of their seasoning is just synthetically flavored to taste like tacos without using actual spices (which are nutrient-dense real food). It’s more expensive for food companies to use real spices than it is to use “natural flavor” and flavor enhancers which mimic the taste of real food. It’s no wonder they take the cheapest option.
Kraft is one food brand notorious for using cheap additives to save on their bottom line, at the expense of our health. That’s why it’s no surprise that their taco seasoning is spiked with Yeast Extract (hidden MSG) and Malic Acid (an artificial flavor enhancer and preservative created in lab from petrochemicals like butane).

I make homemade taco seasoning with 6 basic spices that I keep stocked in my pantry + sea salt and pepper. When you compare the ingredients in my homemade taco seasoning side-by-side with the ingredients in those processed packets, you really see the difference!
Virtually all conventional spices sold in the U.S. are fumigated [sterilized] with hazardous chemicals that are banned in Europe and irradiated to kill bacteria. These practices leave a finished product with decreased levels of vitamins and natural enzymes. Irradiation changes the chemical composition of a spice, potentially creating toxic, carcinogenic by-products in the food and increasing our exposure to free radicals. Free radicals cause aging and disease – something we want to avoid at all costs!
Organic spices are not irradiated and cannot have genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs), artificial colors, preservatives, and other synthetic anti-caking agents. Some of my favorite spice companies include – Simply Organic, Frontier, and various store-brands that are organic.
It can be a little expensive at first if you are stocking your organic spice rack from scratch, but once you’ve get all the essentials, it’s incredibly inexpensive to make your own taco seasoning and other spice mixes. One of my tricks for saving money on organic spices is to buy them from the bulk bins at health food stores and natural food stores. You can buy just the amount you need or refill your own jars at home at a fraction of the cost.

You can easily double or triple the recipe if you’d like to make a bigger batch of tacos, or save it in a glass jar for later.  To make tacos, simply use 3 tablespoons of seasoning mix per 1 pound of meat. I’ve used this with both ground turkey and chicken and it is fabulous!

https://foodbabe.com/homemade-waffle-fries-chick-fil-a-copycat-recipe-only-3-ingredients/,Homemade Waffle Fries – Chick-fil-A Copycat Recipe (Only 3 Ingredients!),"If you know me, you know I love french fries. They are one of my favorite foods besides cake. That’s why I am SO EXCITED about this new copycat recipe for “Chick-fil-A” Waffle Fries!


There’s just something extra special about waffle fries. I don’t know if it’s the shape or what exactly makes them so delicious, but it certainly isn’t the Dimethylpolysiloxane, chemical preservatives, or unhealthy oils that Chick-fil-A uses to make theirs.


Back in the day, I used to eat Chick-fil-A several times a week for lunch…and I can STILL remember how their waffle fries taste and it makes my mouth water. Now, I wouldn’t consider eating them because of all the shady ingredients they use. But I’m not depriving myself! I firmly believe that if you love to eat something, you can figure out how to make it at home with healthy ingredients. That way you can have your cake (or waffle fries!) and eat it too!
You only need 3 basic ingredients to make waffle fries that are just as delicious as Chick-fil-A’s Waffle Fries (and thankfully, you won’t need to call up a chemical company to send you some “Disodium Dihydrogen Pyrophosphate”).
All it takes are some organic potatoes, coconut oil and sea salt. If you don’t have coconut oil, olive oil or avocado oil work wonderfully in this recipe too.

To cut your potatoes into that amazing waffle shape, you’ll need a good mandoline that has a thick setting and a waffle blade. This is the mandoline I used to make these waffle fries, and I highly recommend using this one because it allows you to cut your waffle fries thick enough (some mandolines don’t cut thick enough). You’ll want to put it on its thickest setting, otherwise you’ll end up with chips.
To cut the potatoes into waffle fries, you’ll use your mandoline to make one slice down the potato. Then you turn the potato one quarter turn and make another slice. Voila! You’ll end up with little waffle slices like this…

The next step is very important to get the crispiest fries in the oven. You’ll want to put your potato slices in a bowl, cover them with cold water, and let them soak for 30 minutes. This will wash off some of the extra starch and create a fluffier, crispier waffle fry.

After your potatoes are done with their bath, you’ll pat them dry, toss them with oil and salt, and place them on a parchment lined baking sheet. If you want to jazz them up, you can season them with smoked paprika, garlic powder and a bit of fresh cracked black pepper when you are tossing them with the oil.
Lay them out in a single layer like this…

Pop them in a 425 degree oven for roughly 25-30 minutes (checking after 20 and turning if they are getting too brown). Once they are cooked through, you can stick them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp them up if needed. Next thing you know, you’ll be munching on these delicious waffle fries that are better (and much healthier) than Chick-fil-A!

PRO TIP: Tossing cooked waffle fries with a bit of fresh rosemary adds a ton of flavor!
I like to dip my waffle fries in ketchup that has no sugar added – like Primal Kitchen brand. Steer clear of Heinz and Hunts Ketchup because those are both made with GMO High Fructose Corn Syrup – bleh!
Here’s the printable recipe – you’ll want to keep this one handy for when the craving strikes!

https://foodbabe.com/the-birth-story-of-my-son/,The Birth Story of my Son,"This is my birth story for my son Finley who was born on January 1st, 2021.


You’ll never believe it, but if you were to look at the stats on paper, my son’s birth was exactly the same as Harley’s birth.
It was a Friday in January. I went to the hospital at the same time. I had the same doula. I had the same doctor. I had the same room. I had the same birthing tub. I started pushing at the same time.
I had Finley earlier than Harley, because I knew what I was doing this time. I had him at 9:25pm and she was born at 10:11pm, which is about 40 minutes later because I didn’t know how to push with Harley.
When she was born, I was like, that’s it?! And was just so relieved that it was over as I was so tired. With Finley, I really felt him coming out. He was a whole pound and a half bigger, so that was the biggest difference.
So many things were similar, but there were so many things that were different too.
Ever since Harley turned three, I started feeling like I really wanted for her to have a sibling. A friend once told me it’s the best gift ever for them and she was right, this whole year has been absolutely magical watching their relationship grow.
Shortly after I started to family plan with my husband. I went to the doctor again for the first time in three years and everything looked really great. I was a little bit worried about getting pregnant because I was still breastfeeding Harley and my doctor told me not to worry and also said not to worry about weaning because it would happen naturally. And that there is no time like the present, don’t worry about planning this next child, it will happen when it happens.
She literally took all of my worries away and said – just do it! (And everything she said was right – Harley weaned naturally on her own without any intervention about 6 months into the pregnancy).
In the beginning of 2020 we started trying for a baby and BOOM in March I became pregnant. This was during the height of the chaos in the world and it was such a joy to be able to have a baby and have something to look forward to while all this madness was going on.
This pregnancy was much different than the first.
I was not in as good of shape as I was the first time in terms of athletically and physically fit, but I still was working out as much as I could considering that most of the gyms and fitness studios were closed. I was desperately trying to get back into a really good routine when I got pregnant, but then didn’t really get back into it as it was really hard to be motivated. I pushed myself to move everyday as I knew that giving birth is an athletic sport.
I spent most of 2020 pregnant and the first few months I was very nauseous (about the same as my first pregnancy). I was really tired as well, and I didn’t have time to take naps because I had a toddler running around. The crazy thing was that I didn’t have heartburn like I did with my daughter. So that was really a pleasant surprise. But I felt generally uncomfortable and just achy and tired for most of my pregnancy. Of course, there was a second trimester where I had more energy, and generally speaking it was an okay pregnancy. I gained the same amount of weight that I gained with Harley as with this baby (approximately 35 pounds). Again another similarity!
One time, I thought my amniotic fluid was leaking. Hearing the nurse say I needed to go to the hospital straight away to have my baby at 34 weeks was so scary, but that wasn’t the case thankfully.
I was in the middle of a book launch (for Food Babe Kitchen) when this was happening. I know this is probably too much information, but I would sit so long at my desk conducting video interviews for the new book that I didn’t get up to use the restroom often, but when I did get up, I would just leak a little. I had no idea if it was pee or amniotic fluid and just to be safe, I got checked. Thank goodness it was not my water breaking and it was just pee!
And then…
I reminded myself, babies come when they want to come, and that happened to be on Jan 1st, one day after his due date.
Leading up to that day was a very difficult time. Yelena, a dear close friend died in a surfing accident on Christmas. She was one of the most beautiful souls in the whole world, incredibly supportive of my mission here at Food Babe, we traveled together and she was an amazing friend who raised the most incredible family. Her daughters love to cook organically and garden, and she was just a truly beautiful mother. Losing her and finding out about that a week before I gave birth was very difficult. When I found out, I immediately went into contractions and continued contracting every single day until he was born.
On December 31st, I was for sure thinking he was going to come, but my friend’s funeral was on the 1st and I feel like he knew that I needed to say goodbye to her before he came. Along the way throughout the week, she sent me so many different signs that she was okay, including showing up on one of the Mama Natural Natural Pregnancy Affirmation birthing cards I was reading to myself each day.
The birthing card said, “riding each contraction like a wave” with this beautiful girl on a surfboard with long hair just like my friend coaching me through another natural childbirth.
On the 1st, I got to say goodbye to my friend. I watched the entire Zoom funeral (because of Covid) on my iPad while I was in the bath contracting. Soon thereafter I got out of the tub, a complete mess of course, and went out into the living room to have lunch. My contractions stopped. And then all of the sudden they started back up at 3pm every 3 minutes.
This is when my doula came over. These contractions were basically pretty painful. I had stopped what I was doing and really braced myself on a wall and breathed through them. I had to do what I needed to do and my daughter was watching this and was looking at me going, “Mommy, you look funny”. I started to laugh and said this is what your body does when it’s ready to have a baby, you have to push the baby out and so your body contracts to move the baby down the birth canal. Harley loved meeting the doula and being part of the day with me, during early labor at home. Around 5pm is when I felt like there could be some kind of water coming out of me and we were worried that my water was breaking and if it had broken then it was time to have the baby. So, my husband got the car packed, we hopped in and headed to the hospital.
Given the fact that I was 41 at the time, I was nervous about having a home birth, and my husband was even more nervous and just wanted to make sure we had the least risky situation for me and this baby.  So we decided to have a hospital birth. Even though I had really considered a home birth because I wanted to stay out of the hospital system during this very interesting time, but we went to the hospital and it was wonderful.
I refused every intervention that I could. I was very gracious about it and polite about my wishes. The nurses and doctors were very supportive of my decisions. Because so many things were similar as my first birth, I really got to focus on the other details around me. I got to focus on the lighting and how I didn’t like certain lights in the room. And what time it was. And having fun and joking with my doctor and doula in between contractions. Of course that was before I went into transition, where I went from 7 to 10 cm, the hardest part of labor. Then I got a little bit cranky. But I was so calm and so fearless and just had no anxiety about anything really. My doctor had put me in such good spirits, knowing that there were no major Covid restrictions that I had to follow. I did not wear a mask during childbirth. I can’t imagine trying to wear one during childbirth. I was free to be me and have this baby.
When things got really really tough, I said to myself, I will never judge a woman for getting an epidural or anything, because wow, this is intense. My friend was there coaching me from above and was looking down on me and saying, “Vani you can do this”. Knowing the sacrifices her family has had to make with her being gone, I knew I could get through it. If her family could get through what they just did at her funeral, I could do this. She got me through every tough contraction. Yelena – thank you for helping me birth Finley – I love you.
When I saw my doctor start to put on different protective clothing, I asked my doula why. She said – your baby is almost here, I was elated labor was about to be over.
It felt so surreal and so fast this time compared to the last time. This time I could just look at the clock and know, okay I think my body will progress this fast for this long, and would ask the doctor for predictions and for everyone to kind of bet on what was going on. It was so fun and beautiful.
Very similar to Harley, I had high blood pressure again after childbirth, which was annoying, but I was able to get it under control very quickly after getting home, acupuncture treatments and getting back into my regular routine.
Recovering from this birth was much harder. I felt like my body had broken into two during labor when I was pushing. I didn’t tear or have complications with the birth, but my body needed rest. I have a hard time asking for help and rest, I am a go go go person and I did not listen to my body. I should have rested more. Also I didn’t have a toddler running around the first time, and this made resting even harder. Right after birth, I had these really intense contractions almost like I was going into labor again two days after having my child, which were very painful. I would just take a hot bath with epsom salt and everything would get better.
I was only in the hospital for 18 hours after I gave birth – I pleated to go home as fast as possible. The little guy decided to sleep almost 8 hours straight after he was born, while me and my husband just stared at him and stayed up all night in awe and got zero sleep. I really wanted to get back to my daughter, as she wasn’t allowed in the hospital.
Having her meet her baby brother was the most beautiful thing in the whole world. She told him “I want you to be my baby brother forever, I love you so much ” when she met him. It was the most life changing thing I have ever seen and you could see the instant love in her eyes.

https://foodbabe.com/homemade-starbucks-peppermint-mocha-recipe-with-real-food-ingredients-and-no-refined-sugar/,Homemade Starbucks Peppermint Mocha Recipe With Real Food Ingredients (And No Refined Sugar!),"I recently shared a recipe for my homemade version of a Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, and many of you were asking for a recipe to replace their Peppermint Mocha. So, here it is…my real food recipe for a peppermint mocha without any of the crazy ingredients like potassium sorbate and carrageenan (both linked to cancer) that Starbucks uses:


Even if you only order a “Tall” Starbucks Peppermint Mocha, you’ll be ingesting 42 grams of sugar.
A “Grande” size has an astonishing 54 grams of sugar.
Much of this sugar is coming from white sugar added to Starbucks Mocha Sauce and Peppermint Syrup. White sugar is one of the worst ingredients to eat in excess. Most experts recommend the average person eat no more than 25 grams (women) or 38 grams (men) of added sugar PER DAY. So, just one of these little puppies will put you wayyy over that.
All the excessive sugar in our diets is one of the biggest health destroyers…increasing the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, liver disease, and cancer – but its detrimental effects can take years to surface. It’s the hidden link to so much pain and suffering – AND it makes you feel and look awful!!!
My peppermint mocha recipe is sweetened with only one tablespoon of maple syrup and is just as satisfyingly delicious as the original. Maple syrup is an unrefined natural sweetener that has its nutrients intact, unlike refined sugar that is stripped of nutrition and has an acidic affect on the body.




Most brands like Reddi-Wip aren’t organic and contain corn syrup and carrageenan. This is why I like to make whipped cream with canned coconut milk that contains just one ingredient: organic coconut milk. And then blending it with unrefined coconut sugar and vanilla extract.

https://foodbabe.com/homemade-chick-fil-a-peppermint-chip-milkshake-recipe-without-artificial-ingredients/,Homemade Chick-fil-A Peppermint Chip Milkshake Recipe Without Artificial Ingredients!,"When I saw the ingredient list for Chick-fil-A’s famous holiday drink, the Peppermint Chip Milkshake, I could not believe my eyes. There are so many artificial ingredients in there and the list is a mile long. It’s insanity! Of course I can’t keep this information to myself, so check it out for yourself:


That is crazy…
This is equivalent to pouring 23 packets of sugar into your coffee…
Or eating 9 Krispy Kreme glazed donuts…
Or eating a dozen fun-size Snickers. Yikes.
It’s a lot easier to consume that much sugar when you are drinking it – and before you know it you will be on a sugar-high, crash and burn, like no other!
Refined Sugar is toxic. Plain and simple. It wreaks havoc on our bodies. Makes us age faster than we should. Destroys our skin. Makes it easy to carry a spare tire around our bellies and taxes our organs. And, it is very addicting.
❌ CARRAGEENAN: A thickener and emulsifier linked to digestive issues and cancer.
❌ CELLULOSE GUM: This thickener is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems.
❌ SODIUM PHOSPHATE: Preservative can lead to excessive levels of phosphate in the blood and puts you at risk of chronic kidney disease, increased mortality, heart disease, and accelerated aging.
❌ POTASSIUM SORBATE: This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer.
❌ RED 40: Artificial color derived from petroleum, linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. May also be contaminated with carcinogens, such as benzidine.
It baffles me how food companies and restaurants fill their food with the WORST possible ingredients in the name of the holidays! The holidays shouldn’t be an excuse to poison the public. Thankfully, you can still enjoy delicious festive goodies without junky ingredients.


If you want your shake to be pink, you can add a bit of natural food coloring or organic Hibiscus Powder. This will give it a more authentic “Chick-Fil-A” look without the artificial colors!
You can easily make this milkshake vegan and dairy-free by using coconut ice cream, coconut milk and dairy-free chocolate.

See how easy that is?
Who knows…maybe someday restaurants like Chick-fil-A will start creating holiday treats that are actually made with real food!
Until then – If you know someone who loves Chick-fil-A’s Peppermint Chip Milkshake, please share this recipe with them and spread the word that there’s now an easy way to make it at home without artificial ingredients.",Food Babe,Unknown

https://foodbabe.com/homemade-stove-top-stuffing-recipe-and-why-you-shouldnt-buy-krafts-version/,Homemade Stove Top Stuffing Recipe (And Why You Shouldn’t Buy Kraft’s Version),"Back in the day, when Thanksgiving rolled around I’d pick up these products at the last minute… Stove Top stuffing, boxed potatoes, and canned cranberry sauce. Can you relate?
I’ve since learned that although the holidays are a busy time, it’s well worth my time to make dishes from scratch with simple recipes that allow me to control the ingredients that I’m putting into my own body and also feeding my family.
I don’t have endless hours available to cook in the kitchen–and I’m sure you don’t either–so that’s why I created this knockoff version of easy Stove Top stuffing. It’s simple enough for anyone to make and frees up your oven for other dishes like the turkey and sweet potatoes!


Before I show you how to make stuffing on your stove top, let me show you exactly why I never buy Kraft’s version anymore:
HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP: This heavily processed sweetener made from GMO cornstarch that contains more fructose than regular corn syrup. Studies have shown it increases appetite and the risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. (1)
HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN: Used as a replacement for MSG. This ingredient is an excitotoxin that overstimulates the neuron receptors in your brain and excites your tastebuds. It can greatly influence how much you eat…encouraging you to eat food that’s unhealthy for you, which ultimately will affect your waistline and health. (2)
NATURAL FLAVOR: Similar to MSG, this ingredient is created in a laboratory from dozens of substances that are designed to make processed food taste irresistible. (3)
INTERESTERIFIED SOYBEAN OIL: A heavily processed form of soybean oil that’s engineered to replace partially hydrogenated oil. The FDA banned partially hydrogenated oils since they are full of trans fat that is bad for the heart, but some research indicates that interesterified oils can be just as bad. (4)  This unhealthy oil has been shown to promote weight gain, impair glucose tolerance and increase liver cellular stress markers in the body. (5)
BHT: Risky preservative linked to cancer. It’s easily replaceable with safer preservatives and not permitted for use in many other countries. (6)
BHA:  Another risky preservative linked to cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies BHA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” (7)
Thankfully, you can make delicious stuffing on the stove top with real food! My “Stove Top” stuffing recipe is made with basic ingredients that you can find in any grocery store–bread, butter, broth, and spices.


You can make this stuffing recipe with conventional bread, factory-farmed butter, and boxed chicken broth full of sugar and flavors… but then it won’t be much better than the boxed Kraft version.
Let’s talk about how to choose the main ingredients…
The main ingredient in stuffing is the bread, so you’ve got to choose this carefully. Most commercially baked breads come with a crazy ingredient list full of dough conditioners, preservatives, and sugar. Assuming you don’t want to bake your own bread, your best bet is to choose an organic loaf of crusty french bread from a natural foods bakery.
The ingredient list should be simple and free from unhealthy oils (canola, soybean), sugar, and dough conditioners like DATEM. Ideally, look for a bread made with organic whole wheat or organic sprouted grains instead of a bread made with “Bleached Wheat Flour” or “Enriched Wheat”.
If using an organic sourdough bread, make sure it’s on the mild side so it doesn’t overpower the stuffing. Feel free to mix sourdough bread and whole wheat or sprouted grain to give the stuffing more texture and improve the nutrition. Have fun with the bread combinations!
You can easily make this stuffing recipe gluten-free by choosing your favorite crusty gluten-free bread and proceeding with the recipe as written. Again, don’t forget to check the ingredient list for crazy additives!
Conventional butter is raised on GMO feed in a factory farm. Whatever the cows are eating… pesticides, antibiotics, etc, can end up in their milk too. That’s why I like to choose grass-fed and organic butter whenever I have the choice. Some good brands include Organic Valley, Vital Farms, and Kerrygold.
You can use organic turkey or chicken broth to make this recipe. However – many containers of pre-made broth contain added flavors, hidden MSG flavor enhancers (such as yeast extract) and added sugar – even some organic versions! So make sure to read the ingredients carefully on your broth, or make your own.
Here are some good brands:
The most economical option is to make your own chicken broth, which is actually super inexpensive and easy to do. I explain how to make your own chicken or vegetable broth here. (You could do this with turkey too!)
First you’ll cut your bread into cubes. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees while you carefully cut the bread and spread it out onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake the cubed bread for 10 to 15 minutes until it’s lightly toasted. This step can be done in advance and stored in an airtight container until needed. The drier the bread the better!

Grab a large pot (big enough to fit all the bread cubes later) and melt 4 tablespoons of grass-fed butter over medium high heat. Add your chopped onion, celery, and garlic and cook it all together for about 5 minutes to soften.

Stir in your spices and fresh parsley.

Carefully add your toasted bread to the pot and give it all a good stir to combine.

Slowly pour two cups of turkey or chicken broth over the bread crumbs and stir once again. Put a lid on the pot and remove it from the heat.

Allow the stuffing to sit with the lid on for about 8 to 10 minutes until the bread cubes have softened. If you find the stuffing is too crunchy for your liking, simply add more hot broth in ¼ cup increments until you reach your desired consistency. If you want the stuffing to have a crunchy top, place in a baking dish and pop it in the oven set to broil. Broil until desired crispiness, but keep a close eye on it so it doesn’t burn.
Simply mix in 2 eggs after you have stirred in the broth and place the stuffing in a baking dish. Bake at 350 for 30 to 35 minutes. Feel free to prep the baked stuffing version the day before. Keep it covered in the refrigerator and bake the next day.
If you make it ahead of time, simply store the prepared stuffing in an airtight container in the refrigerator. To reheat, place in a baking dish in the oven at 350 degrees and bake for 25 to 20 minutes. The stuffing will be nice and warm and have a delicious crispy top.

Making stove top stuffing from scratch may seem like more work at first, but small changes like this will have a dramatic effect on your health over time. It’s worth the effort… I promise!

https://foodbabe.com/homemade-pumpkin-spice-latte-better-than-starbucks/,Homemade Pumpkin Spice Latte (Better Than Starbucks!),"Let me show you how easy it is to make a Pumpkin Spice Latte at home that’s better than Starbucks… REALLY!
First, you’ll need to grab the Potassium Sorbate and Carrageenan out of your pantry to make the flavoring… Ha ha, just kidding!
Of course, you’d never use those ingredients in your coffee. But Starbucks does.



When I first exposed the secret ingredients in the original Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte a few years back there was a media firestorm. Within days, my blog post made headlines from USA Today to Fox News. My phone was ringing off the hook while my post went viral on social media with more than a million shares. (1)
I was so happy that Starbucks FINALLY had to own up to the ingredients they were using at the time. Specifically the Class IV Caramel Color, which is linked to cancer. All of the media attention really helped get the ball rolling in getting Starbucks to change. Next thing you know, they dropped the Caramel Color altogether. Then, Starbucks published the ingredients in their drinks on their website for the first time in history. This was HUGE. Now everyone can see exactly what they are drinking at Starbucks. (2)
Potassium Sorbate: You’ll find this preservative in many of Starbucks drinks, including the PSL. This ingredient has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer. (3)
Carrageenan: This ingredient in Starbucks whipped cream is a thickener linked to digestive issues and cancer. (4)
Natural Flavors: It’s not just pumpkin spices that make the PSL taste delicious. Starbucks adds Natural Flavors, which is actually a top secret formulation that contains preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives (which could be: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol – none of which are labeled or disclosed). (5)
Mono and Diglycerides: This emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing – including canola and soybean oils – which may contain trans fat that is detrimental to heart health. (6)
They do not serve organic coffee at most Starbucks locations, which means (like all conventional coffee) it’s been sprayed with pesticides. Increased exposure to pesticides are linked to birth defects, nerve damage and cancer.
Starbucks also does not use organic milk. Their dairy comes from cows raised on GMO feed which is treated with synthetic pesticides. Whatever dairy cows eat can end up in their milk. And despite what you may have heard…illegal antibiotics, growth hormones, and pesticide residues are commonly found in non-organic milk, but NOT in organic milk. (7) Even though no one is testing Starbucks drinks for these substances, it’s made with non-organic milk, so it is a possibility.
We all know Starbucks coffee ain’t cheap, but most people don’t know that regular consumption of their products can be a serious source of pesticide exposure and ingredients that sabotage your health.

I like to use all organic ingredients, which is actually cheaper than Starbucks in the long run after you invest in these ingredients to make dozens of organic Pumpkin Spice Lattes at home!

To make the Pumpkin Spice Latte at home, all you do is add milk, pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and maple syrup to a small saucepan. After it heats up, pour it into your cup of coffee. That’s it!
You can make a big batch of the latte and store it in your fridge for 3-4 days, that way it will be ready when you’re in a hurry. Simply heat it back up… or pour it over ice.

Just make sure yours isn’t made with Carrageenan and Mono and Diglycerides like Starbucks! Since most brands of whipped cream aren’t organic and contain gums and other additives, I like to make whipped cream with canned coconut milk.

Know anyone who would love to make a Pumpkin Spice Latte at home that is better than Starbucks? Please share this recipe with them, or perhaps bring them a cup.
Now you can enjoy this delicious fall drink without the controversial ingredients that Starbucks uses! Isn’t it awesome when you take matters into your own hands? It’s small changes like this that can dramatically change your health and your life.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-goldfish-crackers-with-organic-ingredients/,Homemade Goldfish Crackers With Organic Ingredients,"This recipe is a long time coming and something that countless parents have asked me for. Homemade Goldfish Crackers! Before I show you how to make these fun cheese crackers, let me tell you why I developed this recipe…


Almost every child in America eats Goldfish Crackers. Parents love them because they are easy, not too expensive, and seem healthier than other snacks like Cheetos. They are served in schools and daycares across the country. But are they really a good snack for kids?
To really examine this question, you need to know what Goldfish Crackers are made of. Let’s take a hard look at the ingredients used to make Pepperidge Farm’s Goldfish…
Goldfish Crackers Ingredients: Enriched Wheat Flour (Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Cheddar Cheese ([Cultured Milk, Salt, Enzymes], Annatto), Vegetable Oils (Canola, Sunflower And/Or Soybean), Salt, Contains 2% Or Less Of: Yeast, Sugar, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Paprika, Spices, Celery, Onion Powder, Monocalcium Phosphate, Baking Soda.

I personally don’t want my children eating Goldfish full flavor enhancers designed to hijack their taste buds. We need to stop the habit of brainless munching on low quality foods that has led millions of Americans with diseases like obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
Even worse, they might be tainted with Roundup weed killer:
In 2016, an independent food safety laboratory tested popular American food products for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (Roundup). They specifically found this weed killer in Goldfish Crackers. In three samples of Goldfish tested, they detected 18.40 ppb glyphosate in Goldfish Crackers Original, 8.02 ppb in Goldfish Crackers Colors, and  24.58 ppb in Goldfish Crackers Whole Grain (1). While these amounts are not as high as other products tested, I don’t personally feel safe feeding my child a food known to be contaminated with Roundup, a chemical strongly linked to cancer.
Plus – when you buy Goldfish crackers, you are supporting the industrial BIG FOOD complex of crap food. Let’s stop supporting brands like Pepperidge Farm who are creating unhealthy products for our kids.
Thankfully, I’m happy to report that you don’t need to give up Goldfish Crackers. I’ve figured out how to make crispy cheesy goldfish shaped crackers at home – with real food ingredients.

The main ingredient in these crackers is flour. I chose to use organic spelt flour, which is an ancient whole grain form of wheat. I like to use spelt flour because it is easier to digest than regular whole wheat flour and contains a bit more protein. If you want to make these gluten-free, you can substitute oat flour for the spelt flour. You can make oat flour by simply grinding organic rolled oats in a blender, or you can also buy a bag of organic oat flour at most grocery stores.
The other ingredients I used were also organic, especially the cheese and butter. It’s very important to buy organic animal products to avoid consuming potential residues of antibiotics, synthetic hormones, and other drugs often given to animals on factory farms. When it comes to dairy products – choose organic and grass-fed whenever possible.
Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees. You’ll bake these on a baking sheet, so you can line that now with some unbleached parchment and set it aside.
If you don’t have a food processor, simply place all of the ingredients in a bowl and use a pastry cutter to mix everything together until it resembles a fine meal. However, this process is much easier with a food processor.
If using a food processor, add all the ingredients except the butter and pulse until a fine meal has formed. Add the butter and pulse until well combined.
Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of cold water and mix until the dough forms a ball. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Roll out the dough on a floured surface until roughly ⅛” thick. Use a 1” goldfish cookie cutter to cut shapes out of the dough. I used a plastic cookie cutter because that is the only fish-shaped cutter I could find that had several fish in one row, which makes the job of cutting up the goldfish much more efficient. It also is small and gives the most genuine “Goldfish” look. Another option would be a stainless steel cutter, such as these animal shaped cookie cutters that are small (about 1″). You could certainly use any animal shape you want for more variety and fun.

Place the shapes on a parchment lined baking sheet like this…

And bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool before removing from the cookie sheet.

https://foodbabe.com/homemade-organic-caramel-apples-without-corn-syrup/,Homemade Organic Caramel Apples Without Corn Syrup,"When I was a child I remember how fun it was to sink my teeth into a sticky caramel apple. It’s one of my favorite fall treats but I always hold off on buying the caramel apples from the market because I know they are made with corn syrup and some other very processed ingredients.
This year we’re throwing a Halloween party for the kids and I thought… What could be better than serving mini organic caramel apples? It would be such a cute treat for the older kids. But I knew I needed to figure out how to make them at home without corn syrup and other nasties, and that’s when this recipe was born!


Corn syrup is a heavily processed and refined form of sugar that’s usually made from GMO corn, and that’s why you won’t find this in my pantry. Some other “easy’ recipes for Caramel Apples call for using packaged caramels like Werther’s Original – which I wouldn’t want to use either because they are made with glucose syrup (another heavily processed sugar syrup) along with artificial flavors and soy lecithin.

Instead of going down that road, my recipe calls for basic ingredients that you probably have in your pantry already: butter, cane sugar, vanilla extract, heavy cream, and sea salt.  And of course… apples! I like to use the green variety, since they are more tart and offset the sweetness of the caramel.

I like to use organic coconut sugar as a replacement for white sugar when cooking at home, but when I tested these caramel apples with coconut palm sugar, the result turned out very dark and just not as appealing in color. You can certainly use coconut sugar instead of cane sugar in this recipe if you’d like. Coconut sugar is completely unrefined and its vitamins and minerals are intact – making it healthier and less processed.
You can also swirl the apples in fun toppings like chopped nuts, coconut flakes, or chopped chocolate. Look how gorgeous these caramel apples are!


I hope you get the chance to make these fun caramel apples this fall and love them as much as we do. And if you know anyone who loves caramel apples…but not the nasty ingredients…please share this recipe with them.

https://foodbabe.com/the-only-bar-is-here-a-truvani-snack-bar-with-real-organic-ingredients-and-amazing-taste-too-finally/,"The Only Bar is here. A Truvani snack bar with real organic ingredients (and amazing taste, too). Finally!","Ever since we launched our small company, Truvani, I have wanted to make a snack bar that I would be happy to eat.
You see, I’ve always been the type of person to reward myself at the end of a long day with a little treat.
It was a ritual. I’d grab my favorite cup of tea and a treat. Then, I’d sit on the couch and enjoy it. It was a little “me moment” that would help me unwind from the day.
The problem?
Sometimes I would eat a piece of chocolate. Other times it was another snack that would feel good in the moment…and horrible later on.
I needed something better, and that’s why I set out to create something better. I wanted a snack bar. A snack bar that I could happily eat at the end of a long day and feel good about.
I only had one question: “What Makes A Great Snack Bar?”
I had 3 rules:
Ever eat a snack bar that seemingly saps all of the wetness out of your mouth, as if you spent an eternity in a desert?
Or worse, a bar that’s so sticky you feel like you need to wash your hands immediately after eating it?
This is not okay in my book. You see, I believe you should love the way the bar tastes and feels. It shouldn’t leave you with any unpleasant side effects like dry mouth or sticky fingers. NOT OKAY!
Feeling aside, a snack bar should taste great.
Some other bar companies just get it so wrong. They’re either too hard, or too soft. Too sweet or not sweet at all.
And in some cases, it feels like a chore to eat them. NOT OKAY!
When I’m eating a snack bar, I want the ingredients to be found in my kitchen. I don’t want to see weird additives… or soy lecithin… or anything like that.
I want ingredients I could readily recognize at the organic market. And stock in my home kitchen.
This was the hard part. Manufacturers these days can’t help themselves. They want to add all sorts of junk into their food to make their lives easier… NOT OKAY.
Wrong.
If you look at some other bar companies, they get it SO WRONG.
This is one of the reasons why I knew Truvani had to do it better…
It took us 2 years to get it right and today is the day!

Our first flavor is Chocolate Love and I know you’ll love it.
What makes The Only Bar so special?
Look at the ingredient label. We used 6 simple ingredients. Each of which are ingredients you can find in any normal kitchen.
It’s a tasty combination of almonds, dates, maple syrup, cocoa, and cacao nibs. Plus, a dash of sea salt.

Natural flavors? Highly-refined sugars? Soy lecithin? Or other cheap fillers? HECK NO! The Only Bar is made with amazing ingredients. It’s also USDA Certified and has non-GMO ingredients.
The best part? Or maybe it’s the worst part…
It tastes so good you’ll want another one.
And no refined sugar. No artificial flavors. No sugar alcohols. No gums. And no brown rice syrup.
That’s the real deal.

This bar took more than 2 years of development. It wasn’t easy. Every time we wanted to create a bar, they would tell us: “you need this weird ingredient” for some random reason.
After a year, we almost gave up. “Maybe it just isn’t possible…”
You see, one of the main issues we had was “holding the bar together.” The available ingredient options were just… not up to the Truvani standard.
Sometimes they weren’t organic. Other times they were highly refined sugar syrups. Then, one day, someone on our team recommended we try Maple Syrup.
And it worked.
The bar stayed together. It tasted great. We knew we had a winner on our hands…but, we got hit by a big surprise:
You see, when you add Maple Syrup to your bar, it has to be listed as “added sugars” on the nutrition facts panel.
This is a weird labeling requirement. Added sugar was meant to expose companies adding sugar to their product, outside of the sugar found naturally occurring in the ingredients.
For some reason they decided to label Maple Syrup as an added sugar… even though Maple Syrup is found in nature… which has sugar in it naturally.
We argued about this back and forth with the team. “Should we cancel the bar because of the “added sugars” labeling requirement?”
Luckily we didn’t. We knew we made this bar with ingredients that you can find in your kitchen. We knew we were doing the right thing. We knew that our customers would understand…
So, we moved forward with it. And it’s worth it. We may fight this weird label law at some point, but for now… we can just eat the bar with a smile on our face!
The Only Bar by Truvani is made with 6 simple ingredients our customers love: almonds, dates, maple syrup, cocoa, cacao nibs, and a dash of sea salt.
So, if you’re ready to enjoy a snack bar without having to worry about nasty ingredients…order Chocolate Love, the first flavor of The Only Bar today!

https://foodbabe.com/why-i-avoid-these-9-controversial-ingredients-in-my-personal-care-products/,Why I avoid these 9 controversial ingredients in my personal care products,"According to The Guardian (1), the EU has banned (or restricted) 1,300 ingredients found in personal care products. Meanwhile…the US only has banned (or restricted) 11.
How can one group find ingredients so dangerous that they feel compelled to regulate them, while another group lets these ingredients run rampant?
IT’S UNBELIEVABLE!
Over the last decade, I fought for Ingredient Transparency in our food and other daily products (like deodorant, cosmetics, etc).
Even though we’ve made tremendous progress…the truth is that big companies just don’t change fast enough.


I believe we deserve to live in a world where our products can be made without weird – and nasty – ingredients.
Is that too much to ask?
Apparently so. Because we are so far away it’s crazy.
So, I decided to take matters into my own hands.
I launched Truvani and we have one main goal: eliminate nasty ingredients from all daily-use products.
We started with supplements. Now we are creating personal care products. If you want to learn about them, click here to learn more.
I know you’ll like them. And when you see the ingredient labels, you’ll LOVE THEM.
But first, let me tell you everything that’s wrong with personal care…
These are the ingredients I avoid in personal care products…because of the controversy that surrounds them.
Ever look at the ingredient label on a traditional deodorant or antiperspirant?
So many companies use aluminum in antiperspirants. This is a problem.
You see, an antiperspirant is an over-the-counter drug that chokes your sweat glands shut and prevents you from sweating. And they use an aluminum compound to do it.
Why is this an issue?
Well, our bodies sweat for a reason. Why would we prevent it from doing what it wants to do?
Even though it’s deemed “generally safe,” the controversy around this in antiperspirants made me switch to organic deodorant… without aluminum.
Carrageenan can be found in most milk substitute products, infant formula, deli meats, cottage cheese… and also in personal care products.
In some cases, these products can even be certified by the USDA and found in organic products.
…but the controversy around carrageenan is concerning.
Some scientists say it’s a carcinogen. Other scientists say it’s safe. I don’t want to risk it, especially after reading the research published by the Cornucopia Institute.
They show the timeline of events, lack of regulation, and down right shadiness that all led up to carrageenan’s approval in organic products. (2)
Yikes.
It’s so controversial and if you’re mad about it in almond milk… you should be mad about it in toothpaste, too. This is why I avoid it in my personal care products.
Parabens is a widely used preservative in cosmetics – and some personal care items. It’s also sometimes used as an ingredient in manufactured “Fragrances.”
On ingredient labels, they’ll often be listed as: Propylparaben, Isopropylparaben, Butylparaben, or Isobutylparaben.
And I avoid them whenever possible.
The controversy around them is too great. Some scientists claim they’re safe. Other scientists claim they’re dangerous. I claim “it’s not worth it.”
When you see the word “Parfum” or “Fragrance” on an ingredient label, I would personally run for the hills. Here’s why:
Parfums or Fragrances are often a complex mixture of different chemicals and ingredients… and companies are not required to disclose these ingredients. “Because the formulas are patented.”
This is not okay. I believe we deserve to know what’s being included in our products and I avoid these every single time.
(I believe the same for Natural Flavors, or flavoring. If companies can’t disclose what’s being used in their flavors…I avoid those products, too).
Ever wonder why soaps and other personal care products “foam?” Some companies use Sodium Laureth Sulfates (SLES).
Now, depending on how people make this ingredient, this can be contaminated with measurable amounts of ethylene oxide.
Again. This is another controversial ingredient and I don’t want them in my personal care products.
Yes, some cosmetics (and personal care) products use formaldehyde releasing preservatives. And I want nothing to do with it.
The reason why there’s so much controversy around them is because the ingredients slowly (and continuously) release small amounts of formaldehyde.
As someone who cares about ingredients that go in or on our bodies…I avoid these like the plague.
DEA (diethanolamine) and DEA compounds are found in some cosmetic (and personal care) products. It’s often used to make cosmetics more creamy or foamy…
It also can act as a pH adjustor.
What types of products use them? Sometimes you’ll see them in moisturizers… or sunscreens… and others are found in soaps or shampoos.
But I avoid these ingredients, too. If you google it, there’s controversy around whether or not it’s considered “safe.” The main thing that people talk about? Some people suggest it’s a skin and eye irritant.
Petroleum based compounds are often used as thickeners or solvents or softeners or moisture-carriers in cosmetics (and other personal care products).
The big problem? Depending on how people manufacture these compounds, PEGs may be contaminated with ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane.
This is why I avoid PEGs. The controversy around it is too great.
What are BHA & BHT? Well, they are the short-form form of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT).
These ingredients are found in some cosmetics (and other personal care products) because they are synthetic antioxidants. They are also used as preservatives in lipsticks, moisturizers, and even found in food products, too, as food preservatives.
The European Union prohibits the use of BHA as a fragrance ingredient in cosmetics. In the USA, California requires a warning label on product containing BHA, notifying consumers that this ingredient may cause cancer.
Given the controversy, we don’t want BHA & BHT in our products, either.
You see, when I launched Truvani, I wanted to eliminate all nasty ingredients from daily-use products. Yes, we started with supplements. And now we’re moving into personal care.
But the mission will continue way past that.
We want great products. Without nasty ingredients. And we will continue making all the products that fit the bill.

Food Babe Army Strikes Again.,"If you feel like you don’t have the power to get food companies to drop nasty chemical ingredients from their food, I have news for you! Every time you share the truth about these products with your friends you are making a huge difference. Food companies are listening and they are changing. Here’s proof!
A few years back I shared several graphics showing how companies like Kraft-Heinz, Kellogg’s, PepsiCo, and Quaker sell safer, better products overseas while making inferior versions with different ingredients to sell to Americans. You may have seen them. These graphics have gone viral and are still being shared all over the internet. (1)
In the U.K. you’ll find…
I know you’re as appalled as I am, because every time I write about this I get tens of thousands of shares and hundreds of emails asking how we can get these companies to stop selling us inferior products here in the U.S.
I wrote about this (and specifically Quaker’s oatmeal) in my bestselling book Feeding You Lies, which has been read by thousands of people. And my U.S. vs. U.K. comparison graphics have been picked up by the media numerous times. (2)
Now I’m happy to say that because of YOU sharing this information and voting with your dollars, companies are changing.
Sometime in the last year, Quaker quietly changed the ingredients in their Strawberries & Cream Oatmeal here in America.
And the change is DRAMATIC…


Quaker Strawberries & Cream in America originally had NO strawberries at all. Instead they used “Flavored and Colored Fruit Pieces” composed of dehydrated apples, artificial strawberry flavor, citric acid, and the artificial dye Red 40. A total scam! (3)
In the U.K. Quaker doesn’t even attempt to sell that garbage and doesn’t make any products like this. The closest counterpart they have is a product called “Oat So Simple” that has REAL strawberries in it—light years ahead of the popular U.S. version that has been on the market since I was a child. (4)
Quaker now uses REAL STRAWBERRIES in their American version, and it’s now very similar to the U.K. version. (5)
This is a huge deal! Not only are they using real food ingredients instead of conning consumers with fake strawberries, but they are no longer using artificial colors. Artificial colors are one of the absolute WORST ingredients in our food and should be banned. Especially since they are usually in products made for children.



And, they removed the artificial colors and caramel color linked to cancer (7) from Dinosaur Eggs Instant Oatmeal for kids, and replaced these with natural colors made from radishes, spirulina, and turmeric.

They aren’t the only one who has changed their ingredients…
Since our graphics came out, there are a couple more big changes.

We have petitioned Kellogg’s TWICE asking them to remove the preservative BHT from their cereals, as they don’t use this ingredient in other countries, it’s linked to cancer and it’s unnecessary.
Our first petition in 2015 received over 53,000 signatures (8), and Kellogg’s removed BHT from popular cereals like Rice Krispies. Now it’s finally out of Frosted Flakes.
But, they didn’t remove BHT from all of them. And they started inventing even worse cereals for children with artificial colors and BHT, like Baby Shark Cereal. That’s why we petitioned them again a couple years ago. We will not stop until they change.
SIGN THE PETITION: Add your name here and demand that Kellogg’s stop making cereal for children with these controversial ingredients!

Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO) is an ingredient BANNED in Europe, so Pepsico has sold Mountain Dew in other countries without it for years. In 2014, PepsiCo told the media they would remove BVO from all of their American drinks following a viral petition by activist Sarah Kavanagh, but they actually didn’t do it. (9)
I’m happy to see that after years of public pressure, the BVO is gone!!!
Continue sharing the ingredients in processed products with your friends and vote with your dollars by refusing to buy products from these companies until they do the right thing.

And, I love green drinks. I drink a green juice or smoothie made with kale and other healthy vegetables nearly every single day…and have been for over a decade now.
When I first started this habit in my corporate days, it took some getting used to. Even thinking about it now. I’m getting a little… let’s say, choked up 🤢
Back then, I made it a point to drag my coworkers down to the local juice bar. I wanted everyone on board with this whole greens thing.
They’d watch as the shop attendant handed me a wheatgrass shot…and this deep sense of dread would shiver over my body.
Wheatgrass is very powerful stuff and its potency takes getting used to. I have to psych myself up every time I take a shot…but by the end of it all, I’m all smiles.
I knew drinking it would make me feel amazing. But the anticipation of that taste…
Made me gag a little. Okay, a lot.
“Bottom’s up!” I’d say to myself. Then with a plugged nose. I’d shoot it down. Trying to bypass my mouth so I didn’t taste the lawn clippings.

And if you do. You might not munch on these lush veggies daily.
So, if you struggle to get enough greens. Don’t feel bad. Because you’re not alone.

Eating dark, healthy greens every day is hard. (Not everyone loves them.)

Easier said than done, right?
We know skipping our veggies is out of the question. They provide our bodies with important nutrients vital to overall health.
We decided to look into greens powders. When we started researching some other brands… do you know what we saw on the labels?
You guessed it. Unnecessary fillers and additives. Like crystalized cellulose. And artificial sweeteners and stevia.
No way 🙅‍♀️ We KNEW we could do better.
It wasn’t easy. And it took us a long time from conception to finished product.
But it’s finally here!

We created a greens powder that has three of my favorite dark greens:
Broccoli
Kale
Spinach
And four amazing sprouts. Plus the satisfying plant-based vanilla protein Truvani fans love. 
(with a hint of banana for a subtle sweetness).
Protein+Greens delivers 10g of plant-based protein with our favorite leafy greens and incredible sprouts. No cheap fillers. No unnecessary additives. Only the good stuff.
It tastes amazing and blends easily with water or into my favorite morning smoothie.
You can try it today! Save up to 25% when you subscribe for a limited time.
That was no easy feat.
Because we saw that some green drinks did things to mask the ‘green taste.’
Like using artificial sweeteners and “natural flavors.”
Not happening.
It took us a looooong time. But we figured it out.
One of the best things about our powder is the TASTE. It’s got a subtle hint of all the right sweetness. From vanilla bean, banana, and monk fruit (not artificial sweeteners or stevia).
You won’t find any overpowering grassy flavors like some other greens drinks. Which means it blends perfectly with your favorite liquid.
And you can add it to a delicious smoothie or healthy treat recipe. To make a nutritious dessert.
No matter how you make it. It tastes incredible.
So incredible…you won’t believe you’re drinking greens.
Don’t take my word for it. Watch the video testimonials here to see what the Truvani Team has to say about our new Protein+Greens and it’s amazing taste!
We all know the undeniable benefits of eating vegetables. And greens drinks help you get more veggies into your day—the easy way. Plus, greens support alkalinity, daily energy, and healthy digestion.
You can try shots of wheatgrass. A green smoothie. A glass of green juice.
Or stock Truvani’s new Protein+Greens in your pantry. The easiest way of all!
Now you can whip up a green drink in no time and have a painless cleanup.
Don’t get me wrong. I still love juicing. But now I can get all the benefits of extra greens. Even when I’m short on time.

https://foodbabe.com/dont-let-internet-trolls-stop-you-from-sharing-the-truth-about-our-food/,Don’t let internet trolls stop you from sharing the truth about our food!,"I’m coming out bold in 2021.
This isn’t the year to back down and I am going to be fearless in everything I share with you.
I’m going to continue telling you the truth about your food, while also exposing those who are working to destroy our movement.
And this year is already shaping up to be pivotal.
Let me tell you a quick story…
I recently had the amazing opportunity to hang out with Shaun T and be on his podcast, Trust and Believe. I’ve been doing his workout videos for 10 years and am a huge fan, so even though I was 9 months pregnant I jumped at the chance. We chatted about the campaigns that the Food Babe Army has done that inspired changes at billion-dollar food corporations. We also talked about how to be your own food detective and why the BIG FOOD industry is not looking out for our best interests.
When our episode aired this week, Shaun posted a clip of my interview on his Instagram page (with currently 175k thousand views!), and TROLLS were directed by a paid spokesperson by the food chemical industry to go into comment section and go WILD!
I was called “a danger” who was using “dangerous pseudoscience”. People accused Shaun T of “promoting anti-science propaganda” and “fear mongering” just for having me on his show.
Witness it for yourself here:





If you’ve read my 2nd book, Feeding You Lies, you know all about trolls and astroturfing–and how the food industry uses this tactic to discredit the good food movement.
If this is news to you, here’s a recap because you NEED to know about this…
Processed food and chemical corporations (the ones who make food additives and pesticides) hire people to leave comments online in an effort to appear as though they are part of a grassroots movement that stands firmly against a person or an issue. This is called “Astroturfing”.
For example: The chemical company Monsanto had a program called “Let Nothing Go” which was designed to leave no critical comment about them unanswered. As noted in court documents, Monsanto “through a series of third parties, employs individuals who appear to have no connection to the industry, who in turn post positive comments on news articles and Facebook posts, defending Monsanto, its chemicals, and GMOs.”
That’s textbook astroturfing!
Knowing this has made me extremely wary of comment sections. When you see dozens or hundreds of comments that make similar statements, go on the attack, and all appear at once (like a mob), there’s a good chance you’re looking at an example of astroturfing.
“These campaigns are designed to make it appear that an issue has widespread public support (or public opposition) even if it doesn’t. If a campaign sows enough doubt, excitement, or skepticism about a contentious issue or individual, it can shape the opinions of real people. And that’s the primary goal.
We’re social animals, and the theory of groupthink suggests that perceived community support for a patently false “fact” is often all it takes to win over real supporters. Public ridicule and censure also works to cow, silence, or discredit critics who offer dissenting views.
As a result, astroturf efforts can have a profound influence on how we understand and advocate for many critical health-related issues. This is why it’s so important to understand how it works”.
– Turf Wars, Experience Life Magazine
Astroturfing is used to create shame in sharing content online (so we will stop) and to create the illusion that there are negativity and ignorance around the good-food movement. They want to create confusion so you never know who to trust or what to believe. Use your common sense and don’t let anyone silence you.
You also don’t need to be a food scientist or a doctor to learn about ingredients and take control of your food. That is the GIANT LIE that the processed food industry wants you to believe.
(See the video clip that Shaun T posted on Instagram and feel free to leave a comment!)

I’m so looking forward to the BIG things in store for 2021.

https://foodbabe.com/how-cooking-saved-my-life/,How Cooking Saved My Life,"For most of my life I lived in what felt like a foreign body – the food and chemicals I was eating were not serving my health, my weight, or my beauty. I suffered a myriad of health issues that kept me on several prescription drugs just to cope – now I’m on zero.
When I look back at that time, I feel immense sadness. I don’t want anyone to ever feel the way that I did. This is what motivates me to help people like you. You need to know that you don’t need to feel overweight, sick, and tired.
I recently sat down with Dr. Mark Hyman, who I greatly admire and that I’m happy to call a friend. On his podcast, The Doctor’s Farmacy, we discussed how I gained back my health, the sorry state of the processed food industry, and my New York Times Best Selling cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen.

https://foodbabe.com/8-minute-organic-candy-bars-from-food-babe-kitchen/,8-Minute Organic Candy Bars from Food Babe Kitchen,"When you crave chocolate but don’t want to eat the stuff filled with artificial ingredients sold in stores, try my 8-Minute Candy Bars from the Food Babe Kitchen cookbook. They are fast, fun, easy to make, and portable. You can prepare 12 organic candy bars in just a few minutes. To show you how quick, watch me make them in record time on Fox 46 Charlotte:


To make them, you’ll only need about 8 minutes and a bag of organic chocolate chips, brown rice cereal, almonds, vanilla extract, and sea salt.
Like all of my recipes, the most important thing is the ingredients that you choose!

Kellogg’s isn’t organic and they add “malt flavor” and a slew of synthetic vitamins to Rice Krispies. Plus – let’s not support a company like Kellogg’s who makes cereals for children filled with artificial colors, BHT, refined sugar, and all kinds of controversial ingredients.
Vote with your dollars and support companies who are doing the right things. Good organic cereal brands to make these candy bars:
They are made with only 3 organic ingredients and no white sugar, which is a zillion times better than most other brands.

I like to use organic coconut sugar instead of white sugar when I’m baking treats. That’s because it is a perfect 1 to 1 substitute for any recipe that calls for regular old sugar. One of the big pluses of coconut palm sugar – it’s completely unrefined and not bleached like typical refined white sugar, helping to preserve all of its teeming vitamins and minerals. It is naturally high in amino acids, potassium, magnesium, and iron. You can’t say that about regular old white sugar!
To make perfectly shaped candy bars, I set them in a non-toxic silicone mould that holds 8 candy bars. If you don’t have one of those, make them on a 8 x 8-inch baking pan lined with unbleached parchment and simply cut them into bars when they are set.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-teach-your-child-about-artificial-food-dyes-and-become-a-food-advocate-at-home/,How to Teach Your Child About Artificial Food Dyes and Become a Food Advocate at Home,"Someone asked me a very good question the other day…
“What do you do when your daughter’s at a party with cakes and candies full of artificial food dyes? Do you let her eat it? Does she miss out? What do you do?”
My daughter was at a friend’s birthday party recently and the mom whispered over to warn me about the blue & red Spiderman Cake they had baked.
Since she knows me very well she said: “You may not want Harley eating this cake because the kids went really crazy with artificial colors while making it”.
I appreciated her giving me the heads up, so I could be prepared when cake time rolled around!
I’m sure you’ve also found yourself in this situation…you don’t want your kids to feel left out…but there is no way you are going to allow them to eat artificial dyes made from petroleum that disrupt the immune system and are linked to hyperactivity, cancer, and allergies. (1)
So, what do you do?
Now that my daughter is almost 4, she’s encountering artificially dyed, flavored, over-processed foods more than ever, and I know I can’t always be there. I hope to give her all the tools she needs to know what to do when this happens.
Watch the video below to hear how I handled the “blue cake situation” at this party and how I’m raising my daughter to make these decisions on her own as she gets older (jump to 25:50 in the video to hear the story).
Dhru and I also talk about the nasty ingredients in Kellogg’s cereal, why Starbucks removed caramel color from their drinks, and the simple tips and recipes I provide in my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen. Watch or listen below and share it with your friends!

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-avoid-artificial-dyes-at-birthday-parties-and-celebrations-recipes-products-and-tips-i-use/,"How to avoid artificial dyes at birthday parties and celebrations (recipes, products, and tips I use!)","My daughter went to two different birthday parties on the same weekend, and while I love kids parties and my daughter being invited to celebrate with her friends, there was something that made me VERY SAD.
Both of the birthday cakes were covered in brightly colored icing that was dyed with artificial colors. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been surprised. Almost every bakery makes their cakes with a lot of artificial colors and other horrible ingredients. Have you seen the ingredients in those cakes at Walmart?


I don’t eat artificial colors or allow them in my daughter’s diet at all. I have ZERO tolerance for artificial dyes. This may sound extreme – but there are so many reasons why we shouldn’t be eating them, especially children.
Quite honestly, I thought my friends and family already knew this information, but as my daughter attends more parties (and is now in school) I’m still seeing artificial colors EVERYWHERE. That’s when I realized I needed to write about this pronto!
Now, I know that parties are just an occasional thing, so why should you even worry about it?
Even if you aren’t attending many parties right now because of the pandemic, almost everyone is still buying and baking cakes for their family. And, it’s not just parties. Children are being bombarded with artificial colors at every turn!
Products specifically targeted to kids are full of them. They’re in drinks, cereals, snacks, and even school lunches. Artificial colors are in just about every holiday candy out there from Halloween, to Christmas, to Valentine’s Day, to Easter. And, then you’ve got the summertime backyard parties with brightly dyed popsicles.
Even though parties and celebrations aren’t a daily occurrence, I’m not okay with poisoning my daughter’s body with artificial colors made from petroleum and linked to so many health risks. I don’t know about you, but I want my child to have the best. That is why I will not compromise. Not at one party, and not ever.
As parents, it’s our responsibility to teach our children about their food. I have been teaching Harley about dyes and how to spot them. She’s starting to learn that if a treat is covered in brightly colored icing, that it is probably artificially colored and not good to eat. I’ll suggest that she choose a white or chocolate option instead (if available) or to scrape off the colorful icing.
Of course, I don’t want her to feel left out or miss out on enjoying treats. That’s why I’ve educated her about artificial dyes, and we agree to take off the icing at the very least.
I’ve also learned how to make colorful treats without artificial colors at home. And it’s my dream that someday everyone will do this! It may sound like a miracle, but it’s such an easy change to make! Natural colors are so inexpensive and readily available now, there is no reason to keep using the artificial stuff.
These may contain additives and generally are not organic, which isn’t ideal, however they are a zillion times better than artificial colors and very inexpensive. Here are the best brands I’ve found:
You can buy powders made out of 100% freeze-dried produce to dye your cakes and cookies. You can also buy freeze-dried fruit to make your own powder, such as strawberries, which is what I use for the Strawberry Cake recipe in my cookbook Food Babe Kitchen. This way your colors are also nutritious!

You can take a plain white cake and make it look amazing with colorful decorations.
You can blend pureed berries (fresh or cooked) into cakes and frosting very easily to make them more colorful, or use chopped fruit as decoration. Since there is water in the fruit, you may need to slightly decrease the amount of liquid in your recipe.
I was so happy with how this Strawberry Cake from scratch turned out for Harley’s 3rd birthday. I was able to make it this gorgeous shade of pink by using REAL STRAWBERRIES. Unlike those gross cake mixes by Betty Crocker and Pillsbury full of artificial red dye, artificial flavors, and tons of synthetic additives. NOT ONE REAL STRAWBERRY is used to make them. Pillsbury uses “Artificial Strawberry Flavor Bits” to make their cake. 😳 So, I had to create my own version! It was DELICIOUS. I hope you make this cake for your next birthday party or celebration, because it was a real hit!

My cookbook also includes the recipe for the organic birthday cake I made for Harley’s 1st birthday that is sweetened with applesauce, bananas, and a tad of maple syrup! It’s perfect for one-year olds and young children. It turned out so delicious, I plan to make it time and time again for birthdays and other celebrations.
Look for a bakery in your town that will bake without artificial colors. Here in Charlotte, there’s a bakery called Jewell Treats that bakes cupcakes and cakes with natural colors. Also pinkturtlecookies will make their famous sugar cookies with natural dyes if you ask. If you can’t find a natural bakery in your area or if a bakery wants to charge you extra to use natural colors, you can purchase the colors yourself and ask the bakery to use them. I’ve done this multiple times and it works like a charm. I’ve also purchased organic sugar cookies and frosted them myself. Since the frosting is typically the biggest culprit, you can do this with cakes and cupcakes too (simply ask the bakery to use no dyes).
Another option is to use organic cake and cookie mixes to make it easier and to save you time. Homemade tastes best and you can totally control the ingredients you use, but if you don’t want to bake from scratch you can buy mixes and make them colorful and festive with any of the options in this post. Here are some of the best mixes I’ve found…
Cakes:
Cookies:
Frosting:

Almost every popular cake mix and frosting on the market has artificial colors added to it – even some chocolate versions. You’ll find artificial colors in Dunkin Hines Classic Yellow, Pillsbury Devil’s Food, Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow, Pillsbury Moist Supreme Lemon, Betty Crocker Super Moist Red Velvet, and many more. Even vanilla frosting (which is white) has artificial yellow dye in it! This is why you want to choose a certified organic brand, which won’t contain artificial ingredients.




I hope this gives you TONS of options so that you aren’t tempted into skimping and buying cakes and cookies full of artificial dyes. Our kids deserve the best, don’t they? If you agree, please share this post with your friends and family and let them know how we can all have safe dye-free parties together.
Happy Baking!",Food Babe,Unknown

My first book publisher wanted to print my cookbook in black & white! I couldn’t let that happen and begged my agents to get me out of that deal. I wanted full color photos of every recipe, and was able to find a new publisher who saw my vision. Now, Food Babe Kitchen is everything that I dreamed my first cookbook would be!
It has personal photos of myself with my family with all the recipes we make on a daily basis.
At the beginning of the book, this is the first page… And I wish this for children everywhere!

This is the MOST comprehensive food shopping guide I’ve ever done.
I walk you through every single aisle in the grocery store (literally, everything you could ever think of) and tell you exactly what to look for – and what to avoid!
This includes a FULL LIST of every single thing I stock in my pantry, with all the brand names that I love to buy. So there’s no guesswork!
By the end of this chapter, you will be an expert label reader in the grocery store. Guaranteed.
But, I don’t stop there.
You’ll also learn how to avoid toxic mistakes in the kitchen. This includes easy swaps for food storage, cookware and the supplies you use to cook with at home.

Food Babe Kitchen has all the recipes that my family and I LOVE to make and eat together. Our favorite breakfasts, salads, smoothies, weeknight dinners, fun foods, and treats.
Everything from my Sweet Potato Waffles that are perfect on the weekend to my 1-Minute Steel Cut Oats recipes that my family and I eat almost every day.

This is the best fast food in this book. All my delicious favorites are packed in this chapter for you.

Here’s where you’ll get your daily dose of greens with never-boring salads and comforting soups that make great leftovers all week long.

This is where you’ll find Homemade Doritos (yes, really!) and all the little snacks we like to eat at home while watching a movie or having a party.

You’ll get dinner on the table in 30 minutes flat with many of these recipes! Whether you’re making decadent salmon or an entire roasted chicken with vegetables, it can be done almost any night of the week.

If you have a sweet tooth (like me!), this chapter is for you. This picture is of my famous homemade strawberry cake that I made for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. These treats will satisfy you with ingredients that are naturally sweet and relatively low in sugar, or at the very least, made with nontoxic ingredients.

I’ll show you how to feel and look amazing without going on a “diet”.
You’ll develop HEALTHY HABITS so you can finally shed unwanted pounds and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
I want you to know there is an amazing life out there waiting for you.
Get started here now.

The majority of my “food” was composed of man-made materials from a factory. I was not eating real food.
The food was DEAD—which is how I felt most of my life. I didn’t have energy, I had lots of health issues, was on tons of prescription drugs, and felt just like the food I was eating—dead.
I was walking around like a ZOMBIE and I knew why: I was eating overly processed food filled with chemical additives.
I realized that I could no longer give up control to processed food manufacturers. I had to figure out how to make food from living, real food ingredients…
That’s when I taught myself how to cook.
And everything changed in my life!
All the health issues I had—asthma, eczema, allergies—went away.
My excess weight fell off and I began to have more energy.


Cooking at home had saved my life!
And, I’m never going back to my old lifestyle.
I’ve learned how to make delicious, unprocessed meals efficiently—and fast.

I wrote this cookbook for you.
And for everyone who has ever asked what I really eat on a daily basis and how I shop for food. Food Babe Kitchen outlines it all, step-by-step, with beautiful photography.
Food Babe Kitchen gathers together my favorite recipes, the things that I make for my own family every single week — and that they love — all in one place. It’s a way for you to eat healthfully, close to the earth, with the best ingredients that you choose, so when you sit down to enjoy a delicious meal you know what you are eating and you haven’t spent all day in the kitchen!
It includes a picture of every recipe and never before seen photos of my family and I cooking and enjoying delicious healthy food together. If there is anything that spells out what I’m passionate about… this is it! It brings me so much joy to be able to share a glimpse of this happiness in my life with you.

The first 55 pages of Food Babe Kitchen includes a comprehensive shopping guide, so you can easily find the healthiest ingredients and products to stock in your kitchen. This includes easy swaps you can start making immediately.
Plus simple ingredient swaps. The cookbook is flexible to suit vegan, grain-free, and other diets.

https://foodbabe.com/organic-grilled-chicken-tacos-with-fresh-peach-salsa-healthy-mexican-food/,Organic Grilled Chicken Tacos With Fresh Peach Salsa (Healthy Mexican Food),"It’s no secret that I LOVE Mexican food. I’m always looking for ways to make it healthier at home because the food at most restaurants is made with unhealthy refined oils, genetically-modified corn, and factory-farmed conventional meats.
It’s nearly impossible to find organic chicken tacos at restaurants where I live, so being able to make them at home is a lifesaver!
These homemade chicken tacos are quick and easy to make – and kid’s love them too. Simply grill up some pastured chicken and top it with fresh peach salsa and goat milk feta, all wrapped up in organic corn tortillas. Delish!


To make these tacos, I start with the best organic ingredients. Especially when I’m cooking with meat, I am extra careful. Most chickens are raised in despicable conditions where they don’t have room to move freely in cramped barns without access to natural light. They sit in ammonia-ridden waste all day, which is why they are routinely fed antibiotics to prevent disease. These practices disgust me.
This is why I choose to only eat organic pasture-raised chicken. Chickens that are humanely raised on pastures are healthier and more nutritious than their indoors-only counterparts, with higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. When shopping for chicken, look for the USDA Organic label along with the Animal Welfare Approved by AGW, or Certified Humane label.
And don’t feel limited to chicken! This peach salsa is the perfect accompaniment to any type of white fish. You can simply spoon it over baked fish or make fish tacos with this salsa, instead of chicken.

If you have time, mix up the salsa the day before and let marinate in the refrigerator. It’s always better the next day when all the flavors have had time to meld.
These tacos are even MORE incredible with the homemade corn tortillas from the Food Babe Kitchen cookbook! So, you’ll have to give that a try too. Once you make homemade tortillas, it’s really hard to go back to the store-bought ones.

If you know anyone who loves Mexican food as much as I do, please share this recipe with them! It truly is a lifesaver.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/goji-berry-smoothie-an-antioxidant-powerhouse/,Goji Berry Smoothie – An antioxidant powerhouse!,"Let me count the ways I love goji berries…
That’s why adding goji’s to a smoothie is the best idea ever!

Antioxidants are very important because they fight all the free radicals and toxins you can accumulate in your body that cause aging and disease. Goji berries are great for eyesight, skin, and fertility too! (1)
Paired with organic strawberries, raw almond butter, and bananas, they make a delicious antioxidant-rich smoothie that will give you tons of energy. I like to add Truvani Vanilla Plant Based Protein to mine, which makes it a meal that lasts for several hours.

Smoothies are something that I try to incorporate in my everyday diet because they are the ultimate “fast food” which makes it easy to incorporate several nutrient-dense ingredients in one easy to drink shake. Simply whiz it up in the blender and eat.
One thing I don’t do, however, is buy pre-made bottled “smoothies” from the grocery store, such as the ones made by Naked and Bolthouse Farms. These smoothies are very heavily processed, which destroys the beneficial nutrients. Especially when they use “concentrates” which are made by boiling juice into a syrup. If you’re going to drink a smoothie, what’s the point if its nutrients have been boiled to death?!


That’s why my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen, includes a wide variety of smoothie recipes to keep things interesting. So, if you’d like more recipes to shake up your smoothie routine, you’ve got to check it out!

(VIDEO)","I got a very special package this week from my publisher. I was so excited to see my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen, hot off the press…and then something funny happened:





What a head fake – all those tears for nothing lol! 🤣
The second was supposed to be a cookbook after The Food Babe Way was published. But the publisher wanted to print my cookbook in black & white! 😲
I told them there was NO WAY that I could have a black & white cookbook. I wanted full color photographs of every recipe and wanted to create at least 100 recipes for this book. They said they didn’t have the budget for it, which was so heartbreaking. So I BEGGED my agents to get me out of the publishing contract and they helped me find a new publisher who saw my vision.
It is going to be so beautiful, with FULL COLOR photos of every recipe (over 100!) and never-before-seen photos of me with my family enjoying time cooking and eating together.
This cookbook has been YEARS in the making and now we have only a few weeks to go (it hits bookshelves Oct 20th!)…I can’t wait for you to get your copy to see how wonderful it is!

https://foodbabe.com/mango-yogurt-milkshake-a-mango-lassi-tropical-treat/,Mango Yogurt Milkshake – A Mango Lassi Tropical Treat!,"If you love milkshakes, this is for you…
My golden lassi is like a frosty tropical milkshake, made with 100% healthy ingredients.

A lassi is a drink that’s made by blending yogurt with fruit and spices. You can easily make this vegan by using coconut yogurt (CocoYO and Harmless Harvest are my fave!) I also love to use my mom’s homemade yogurt that she makes from grass-fed organic milk. Whatever you do, make sure you choose an unsweetened plain organic yogurt to avoid dairy raised on drugs and GMO grains.
The star ingredient here is the fresh ginger. This is one very special ingredient that I eat almost every single day. Not only does it have a sweet and spicy taste that I love, but it’s great for the body and is a master at fighting inflammation. It’s a true superfood!
Making this lassi couldn’t be easier when you use frozen pineapple and mango that’s already chopped and ready to go. Simply add the fruit, yogurt, ginger, cardamom, and coconut milk to a blender and mix it for about one minute. Once it’s smooth, pour the lassi into two glasses and share with a friend!

Here’s the printable recipe. You’ll want to keep this one handy!

https://foodbabe.com/interview-request-to-kelloggs-ceo-15-min-interview-for-100k-please-share-this-post/,Interview Request to Kellogg’s CEO – 15 min interview for 100k (Please share this post),"My latest post about the new waffles Kellogg’s created for children which are full of artificial colors and other horrible ingredients and a disaster to a child’s immune system has made people ready to hold Kellogg’s accountable.
After seeing the post, my friend Jesse Itzler challenged the CEO of Kellogg’s with an offer only a fool would refuse: $100,000.00 for a 15 minute Live interview on Instagram to discuss their products. Jesse will donate this money to any kids charity of the CEO’s choice.


Isn’t this amazing?!
In his letter to Kellogg’s CEO he says:


I spent last week reaching out to reporters to get an official response from Kellogg’s CEO, Steve Cahillane. I can’t wait to see what he has to say and whether he will agree to be interviewed by Jesse.
Which news agency is going to report on this?
Who is brave enough?
Who cares about our children enough?
Shouldn’t the media question why certain food companies are creating products with ingredients that are clearly making us (and our children) sick?
Will Kellogg’s refuse $100,000 to a children’s charity in exchange for a 15-minute interview about their products?
If so, what are they afraid of?
That’s why they report about how fantastic Kellogg’s new waffles are instead of investigating the ingredients.
Much of the media nowadays is public relations, and not true journalism.
The first reporter to publish a response from Kellogg’s should win an excellence award in journalism. Real reporting takes the bravery to publish what other people (like Kellogg’s) want to keep behind closed doors. The public needs to know the truth about Kellogg’s products, and it’s time for the media to stop pandering to them and start asking real questions.

I know there are many brave reporters who are doing great work. And, I can’t wait to see which one steps up to cover this and gets a response from Kellogg’s headquarters.
Let’s make this happen!

https://foodbabe.com/homemade-fruit-jam-4-flavors-without-corn-syrup-and-refined-sugar/,Homemade Fruit Jam (4 Flavors!) Without Corn Syrup and Refined Sugar,"I don’t know why I didn’t start doing this sooner… because making my own jam at home is incredibly easy and delicious. And, it is absolutely amazing on the homemade biscuits (with real grass-fed butter!) from my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen. Freshly baked biscuits with homemade jam on a lazy Sunday morning are to die for!


Homemade jam is the way to go. The popular store-bought jams like Smucker’s and Welch’s are made with High Fructose Corn Syrup (1) and are not organic. If you follow the EWG Dirty Dozen List of pesticides on produce (2), it tells you that strawberries are the most contaminated fruit or vegetable out there – topping the list with the most pesticides. You’ll also find blueberries and raspberries on the list with high levels of pesticide contamination. These pesticides are hormone disruptors, neurotoxins, or reproductive toxins which are strongly linked to many diseases and health issues (3). That’s why it’s super important to buy organic jam, or make your own with organic berries.

A few cups of berries (fresh or frozen), lemon juice, and some honey. You simply heat the ingredients in a pot and simmer for about 20 minutes… EASY PEASY.

You can reduce or eliminate the honey in this recipe if you’d like to make a fruit-only jam. Just beware that it may not be as sweet as what you are used to unless the fruit is very ripe and sweet. Feel free to use coconut sugar if you’d like to make vegan jam without honey.
The recipes below include 4 flavors of jam: Strawberry, Raspberry, Blueberry, and Mixed Berry. But, don’t feel limited! Have fun and play around with different combinations. Try using peaches, blackberries, cherries, apricots, etc. You will find that if the fruit is naturally very sweet, you may not need to use as much honey (or vice versa if the fruit is tart). Simply taste it after it is done cooking and adjust the sweetness as desired when creating new combinations.
The best way to store your homemade jam is in small glass mason jars (no plastic!). I like to use jelly jars like these here. It can be stored in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks and in the freezer for up to 3 months.

https://foodbabe.com/new-kelloggs-waffles-are-a-disaster-for-childrens-immune-system/,New Kellogg’s waffles are a disaster for children’s immune system,"When I saw these new waffles I wanted to jump on a plane, fly to Kellogg’s headquarters, and give them a piece of my mind.


But given that I am pregnant, I thought that wouldn’t be a good idea because I need to keep stress levels to a minimum. But, I’m not going to be quiet about it!
The same company that brought you Baby Shark Cereal full of artificial ingredients last year (1), is targeting our children again. Kellogg’s just came out with three new waffles for 2020 – Unicorn Cotton Candy Waffles, Mermaid Blue Raspberry Waffles, and Birthday Cake Waffles – which are full of toxic ingredients.

How did the team at Kellogg’s decide that it’s a good idea to release these products during a “pandemic”? How do they EVER decide that it’s okay to poison children with artificial ingredients that are not fit for human consumption?
If food companies cared about our health, they’d be creating more products with organic real food ingredients that are naturally full of vitamins and minerals. And not this garbage. It’s disgusting.
The Birthday Cake Waffles alone have 6 different artificial colors in them, along with refined flour, synthetic vitamins, refined sugar, refined oils, and artificial flavors.


Artificial colors are made from petroleum and can disrupt the immune system. Research has found that “The molecules of synthetic colorants are small, and the immune system finds it difficult to defend the body against them. They can also bond to food or body proteins and, thus, are able to act in stealth mode to circumvent and disrupt the immune system.” (2)
This is one of the many reasons I have a zero tolerance for artificial colors in anything I eat or my daughter eats.
Artificial colors…
Our petition has now reached nearly 54,000 signatures of concerned citizens (add your name now). Kellogg’s has largely ignored our petition – but I’m not going away.

You are joining over 461,618 supporters to make this happen!

I infiltrated their shareholder’s meeting in April and demanded to know if they were removing artificial colors as they had promised to do. They told me that they “will not make compromise is around taste and enjoyment” and will continue to “delight consumers with non-compromising foods”. (10)
There are a lot of people out there who don’t know the truth about the food they are eating and buying for their kids.
What about the parents who trust their doctors and give their children ADHD medications, not realizing that removing artificial colors from their diet could make a world of difference? (11)
What about all the kids out there eating Froot Loops full of artificial colors and BHT? Meanwhile for our neighbors in Canada, Kellogg’s makes Froot Loops with natural colors and no BHT.
You may know the risks of these ingredients – but not everyone does. I’d dare say that MOST people would be SHOCKED if they knew what the government allows in food products.
Did you know that there’s an artificial color in Baby Shark Cereal that is banned from cosmetics because it’s a cancer risk? Yet they put it in kid’s cereal! (This is Red #3). Most people do not know what additives like Red #3, Yellow #5, and BHT could be doing to their health or the health of their kids.
I’ve made it my mission to tell people the truth. And I want companies to change, because it is wrong to sell poisons for profit. Especially when it’s food for our children.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-choose-the-best-ingredients-to-make-a-healthy-pasta-salad/,How to choose the best ingredients to make a HEALTHY pasta salad,"I have been craving a lot of cold, fresh food these days to beat the heat, so I couldn’t wait to share this healthy recipe with you!

Back in the day, I actually believed a box of Suddenly Salad was a healthy option because you “cook” it at home and assemble it yourself. Now I see that it is made with refined wheat flour pasta and risky additives like MSG, sodium phosphate, and caramel color. This is even worse than most salads found in a supermarket deli.

I have yet to find a pre-made pasta salad that is made with healthy ingredients. They use refined flour pasta and unhealthy oils like soybean oil. I avoid soybean oil as much as possible because it is too high in omega-6 fatty acids, which increases the risk of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Also, if it’s not organic, the oil is refined with the neurotoxin hexane – and I don’t want that in my food.


Cooking starts with the ingredients. What you use to make any meal is crucial to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. And dare I say, it’s the only thing you should really concern yourself with when it comes down to how you decide to eat.
1. Choose pasta made without refined wheat flour. Most store-bought pasta is made from refined wheat flour that has been chemically bleached and completely stripped of its nutrients. It is then “enriched” with added vitamins from synthetic sources. The consumption of refined flour increases inflammation in the body and can disrupt the good intestinal bacteria in your digestive system. Most wheat grown today has been hybridized and damaged nutritionally during processing, so it really is “dead food”.
My favorite type of pasta to use is lentil pasta made from 100% organic lentils. This is a healthy alternative to traditional pasta that is very high in protein and fiber, so it helps keep you feeling full longer. It’s easy to digest, and great for people who cannot eat gluten or wheat. I also sometimes like to buy 100% whole wheat pasta, but only if it is organic. It’s best to choose einkorn wheat (an ancient grain) because it hasn’t been hybridized over time and is more nutrient dense than the wheat that is produced today.
2. Choose organic pasta. Wheat is commonly contaminated with the herbicide Roundup, so it’s important to always choose certified organic pasta to avoid ingredients that contain synthetic chemical residues.

After I mix this salad together, I like to let it chill for awhile to really let the flavors marinate together. This pasta salad is delicious and 100% nutritious!

https://foodbabe.com/misting-booths-disinfecting-humans-is-this-where-we-are-headed-please-beware/,Misting Booths Disinfecting Humans – Is This Where We Are Headed? (Please Beware),"When I saw this, I couldn’t believe this was real – but it is. The Denver Broncos installed walk-through misting booths filled with hand sanitizer to disinfect their players.

You can watch the players being sprayed with hand sanitizer in this short video:

Microsure the company that makes the ingredients for this human disinfectant misting system, is actively lobbying school districts.  We’ll likely see disinfectant booths like this in airports, stores, and other public places too – they are already doing them in Asia.
Remember – your skin is your largest organ. And what are these chemicals going to do when they get in your ears and eyes?


There are a lot of questions we need to be asking before we just conform to this madness.
When you destroy all germs that our bodies encounter, you weaken your body’s defenses.
I cannot sit back and let our world get over-sanitized without saying something. I’m not saying there’s not a place for sanitizers – like if you’re a medical professional (Purell stations by the thousands in every office are quite the sight, though).
The constant use by the general public is out of control and creating a bigger problem.
Good old fashioned hand washing is the best alternative. I use wipes that contain 99% water and 1% citrus extract on the go for my daughter.
If you don’t want to be subjected to disinfectant spray booths everywhere you go, it’s time to make your voice heard!
Please note: An active ingredient in this sanitizer – Benzalkonium Chloride – promotes antibiotic resistance, decreased fertility and can irritate the skin, eyes, and lungs.


We campaigned in the past to get restaurants to stop using meat raised on antibiotics (and we won!) (8) That’s because the overuse of antibiotics in the meat supply creates resistant bacteria that is spreading to humans, making antibiotics less effective when we need them. (9) Antibiotic-resistant bacteria infects at least 2.8 million people and kills more than 35,000 each year in the U.S. (10) We need to do whatever we can to protect the integrity of our antibiotics – and the overuse of disinfectants is detrimental!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/peanut-butter-almond-butter-to-never-buy-again-my-top-brands-ultimate-nut-butter-buying-guide/,Peanut Butter & Almond Butter To Never Buy Again + My Top Brands (Ultimate Nut Butter Buying Guide),"One of my favorite indulgences is almond butter. I eat it almost every day… I’ll put a scoop in my morning oats, in my smoothies, and spread it on celery.


When I was growing up, we always had a jar of Peter Pan Peanut Butter in the house. To me, that sweet heavily-processed spread was the only real peanut butter there was – and I really didn’t realize until well into my 20’s that there are MUCH healthier options out there.
Today, the nut butter section is one of the most confusing sections in the grocery store. You’ve got creamy, crunchy, no-stir, stir, reduced fat, sweetened, unsweetened, palm oil, no palm oil, raw, roasted, natural, and organic. It’s no wonder that one of most popular questions I get is what brand of nut butter I use.
In this post, I’m going to walk you through practically every brand of nut butter that you’ll see on the shelf and tell you what I look for. And, the absolute first thing I look at is the ingredient list.
Flip over all the major brands of nut butter and read the ingredients. It’s common to find hydrogenated oils (soybean and cottonseed) or palm oil added, which is used to keep it from separating on the shelf and keeps it fresh without refrigeration. This may be more convenient, but those heavily processed and refined oils are not good for your health.
Also, you’ll usually find sugar added to nut butter, which is an ingredient that most people eat way too much of. If you are eating nut butter on a regular basis, you especially want to make sure it is not sweetened. Occasionally, I may choose an organic nut butter that’s sweetened with coconut sugar (such as JEM brand), but I would treat this as a dessert. My everyday nut butter doesn’t contain any added sugars – just nuts!
Let me give you a perfect example. Jif has three types of peanut butter (regular, Simply, and Natural) that all contain white sugar and additional oils.

Other popular brands such as Skippy, Peter Pan, and Reese’s are also filled with hydrogenated oils and white sugar.

Barney Butter, Justin’s, and Jif Almond Butter may sound healthier, but they also add oils to their nut butters so that stirring isn’t required.
The oil in nuts naturally separate in the jar and float to the top, that is why you have to stir it the first time you use it. This can be messy, but one trick I’ve found is to store an unopened jar upside down in your pantry. When you’re ready to open and use it, it is much easier to stir without making a mess because the oil has largely incorporated into the butter and settled at the bottom of the jar, instead of the top. After stirring, make sure to store the opened jar in your fridge.

Some brands (Adams, Smucker’s, Crazy Richards, Trader Joe’s, and Kirkland) make nut butters with only nuts, but they are not certified organic. It’s very important to choose organic nut butter because conventional nuts and peanuts are known to be heavily treated with synthetic pesticides and fungicides. Especially when it comes to peanuts because they are a legume (not technically a nut) and their pods grow underground, which allows pesticides to be more readily absorbed and concentrated. Couple that with the fact that peanuts are often rotated with cottonseed crops (1) (the world’s most pesticide-ridden crop) and you’ve got a breeding ground for massive pesticide contamination. (2)
Conventional almonds and peanuts can be contaminated with Piperonyl Butoxide (3) a pesticide ingredient that is classified by the EPA as a possible human carcinogen (4) and linked to liver damage. Conventional almonds can also be contaminated with Chlorpyrifos (5), a controversial pesticide which is a neurotoxin. (6) Glyphosate (Roundup) herbicide is used on conventional peanuts and nuts (7) – and it’s known to cause cancer (8). Products are usually not tested for these chemicals, but residues of glyphosate have been found in Skippy Natural Peanut Butter. (9)


There are several organic brands with one ingredient (which is good), but they are made with roasted nuts instead of raw nuts. If it doesn’t specifically say the nuts are “Raw” on the label, it is safe to assume the nuts are roasted. Roasted nut butters taste really good, I’m not going to lie – but if you want to choose the best one, raw nuts are healthiest because…

Raw peanuts may be contaminated with Aspergillus flavus, a type of mold which produces the cancerous toxin aflatoxin. (11) Roasting peanuts prohibits the production of aflatoxin and may also reduce aflatoxin content (12) – so roasting may make peanuts safer to eat. Also, the fat found in peanuts is fairly heat resistant and less likely to oxidize. (13) It’s rare to find raw peanut butter on the market, but you can make it at home.
Note: All almonds grown in the U.S. are pasteurized (typically with steam if they are organic) to destroy any pathogens such as salmonella. So there are not any truly raw U.S. almonds, but they are not cooked to the extent of roasted almonds. Beware that if the almonds are NOT organic, they may be pasteurized with the toxic chemical propylene oxide – which is classified as a probable human carcinogen. (14) Yet another reason to only choose organic!

For example, the brand MaraNatha makes conventional almond butters, but also has a raw organic version that I like. The packaging looks NEARLY IDENTICAL, which is why reading the ingredient list is so important.

To make it super easy for you, here’s a list of brands that meet my criteria. I personally buy the Artisana Organics brand often – which is found in natural grocery stores and online. If you have a nut allergy, I also listed my picks for seed butters. This includes pumpkin seed butter, which many people find better tasting than sunflower seed butter.

https://foodbabe.com/healthy-organic-4th-of-july-cookout-recipes-entire-meal-mix-match/,Healthy & Organic 4th of July Cookout Recipes (Entire Meal Mix & Match!),"Back in the day, 4th of July to me was a big BBQ with hot dogs, potato salad from the supermarket, and popsicles full of artificial colors and corn syrup.
Eating this type of food – even just on a holiday – made me feel horrible. I woke up with a food hangover, my face looked puffy, and I was tired all the time.
I’ve since learned that it’s not worth it to sacrifice my health and weight with additive-filled processed foods on holidays – and now I’ve figured out how to celebrate with fun and festive food that is actually healthy.
Healthy food doesn’t need to be boring!
I put together a round-up for you of my 4th of July cookout favorites, and it features a couple new recipes from my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen. Look at all this fun, healthy food…




I feel like you can’t have a 4th of July cookout without burgers, that’s why the main dish for both of these menus are burgers! The Grilled Pineapple Turkey Burgers from Food Babe Kitchen are absolutely incredible. There’s something so special about adding sliced grilled pineapple to burgers. The sweet-and-savory combination takes turkey burgers up a notch and really hits the spot.


I’m always concocting new veggie burger recipes at home, now that I no longer buy packaged or processed veggie burgers because of the scary ingredients and additives they contain. The Quinoa Veggie Burgers from Food Babe Kitchen are FABULOUS and too EASY not to make ASAP. You can make several ahead of time and either freeze or refrigerate them to enjoy later. Just have the grill master plop them on the grill to reheat and you’ve got a delicious plant-based, protein-packed meal.


This healthy 7 layer dip is absolutely fabulous to and perfect for the 4th – it’s fun to prepare and a good opportunity to get a load of vegetables in to get the party started! I love how I sneaked in some kale – I promise no one will notice. I like serving it with organic corn chips and celery sticks. I like to alternate between the two so I don’t eat so many chips at one sitting.

Other appetizers to try:
My family goes bonkers for homemade ginger ale. When I realized that store-bought ginger ale is usually made with no real ginger, I was so disgusted. Manufacturers use “natural flavors” instead, because it is cheaper than using real ginger. That’s why I came up with this recipe. It’s sweet, spicy, and sooooo refreshing on a hot day.


Other drinks to try:
The star salad here is my Grapefruit Goddess Salad from Food Babe Kitchen . This tart, sweet, crunchy, and juicy salad is such a nice departure from typical salad ingredients. The combo bursts with flavor and has an amazing ability to zap sugar cravings too, which is a great side benefit!


Other sides to try:
These Blueberry “Cheesecake” Bars are fun and festive. You can garnish with sliced strawberries to give them a red, white, and blue look for the 4th. The best part is that they are no-bake and served cold from the freezer, so they are super refreshing and won’t weigh you down.


Other desserts to try:
If you’d love more recipes like this, you’ve got to check out Food Babe Kitchen. It includes all of the recipes that my family and I love to eat on regular basis – including snacks, desserts, salads, drinks, and everything you need to eat healthful delicious food without spending a ton of time cooking or relying on processed foods.

https://foodbabe.com/drinking-alcohol-every-night-to-get-through-this-why-its-the-worst-idea-ever/,Drinking alcohol every night to get through this? Why it’s the worst idea ever.,"We are going through a crazy time. Undoubtedly the craziest time in my lifetime.
I’ve been having long, personal conversations with my friends about everything going on, doing what we can to build each other up. And many of them expressed frustration about one thing…
Ever since the quarantines started they’ve been drinking more alcohol…way more than they normally do. What used to be maybe a weekly (or monthly) occurrence, is seriously becoming an every night of the week habit that is getting out of control.
They aren’t working, they’re bored and completely stressed out – and turning to booze to make them feel better.
I hate to be a buzzkill, but honestly, I have to say it….
Drinking all the time, especially during this crisis, is one of the worst things you can do right now. You are relying on something that (ironically) is horrible for your health because you are feeling stressed out. There are better ways to handle this situation.
I know you probably don’t want to hear this, but hear me out.
You’ve heard alcohol is bad for your liver – but that’s not the only organ it’s affecting.
Drinking too much alcohol disrupts the healthy balance of bacteria your gut. You see, we all have a garden of bacteria living in our intestines (1), which is vitally important to the health of our immune system as a whole (2). The “good” bacteria in your gut helps to keep you healthy (3, 4, 5). When you drink – you create an imbalance in your gut bacteria (6) – which in turn compromises your body’s ability to fight infections (7).
Further down the line, this can lead to leaky gut syndrome (8) – which creates tiny little holes in our digestive system organs that leak out the good bacteria we need to stay healthy and keep our immune system strong.
When you drink, certain white blood cells that are your “front-line” of defense against infections essentially get shut down and are only about ¼ as effective as fighting viruses as they usually are (9). It is a major blow to your natural immune defenses.
Heavy drinking can lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well, because it impairs your body’s ability to absorb nutrients (10). Without necessary nutrients, you’re more susceptible to infections and won’t be able to heal as quickly.
And if all this isn’t enough, drinking too much alcohol is known to specifically increase the risk of respiratory infections (11), such as pneumonia and ARDS. Knowing what we know so far about COVID-19 and how it affects the respiratory system… do you think those nightly drinks are worth the risk?
It’s not just the alcohol that’s shutting off your immune system. Most alcoholic drinks are filled with unhealthy ingredients that are sabotaging you.
Ever wonder what makes Bailey’s Irish Cream so deliciously brown, or Blue Curacao so tropically blue? What makes Malibu Rum so sweet, or what gives Captain Morgan its golden hue?
The alcohol industry has lobbied for years against ingredient labels because they don’t want you to know what you’re drinking. As a result, we know more about what’s in a bottle of Windex than we do about the world’s most popular drinks. After we petitioned beer companies (12) to tell us what’s in their beer, the two largest beer manufacturers began listing their ingredients online (13) – but there is still a lot we do not know.
My research for The Food Babe Way uncovered a slew of unlabeled additives (14) and crazy ingredients you’d never guess you were drinking. To give you a recap, this might be lurking in your favorite drink:

NOTE ABOUT WHITE CLAW: White Claw says their full ingredient list is “proprietary” – which means it is a secret. “The alcohol in White Claw Hard Seltzer comes from fermented sugars derived from malted gluten-free grains” – which could mean corn syrup, but who knows? They haven’t responded to an inquiry from my team to clarify this yet.



I enjoy wine, champagne, and tequila every now and then. When I do, I make the best choices I can. Having alcohol is not a judgment call that any of us should make for others, unless excessive drinking is ruining someone’s health, family, and personal life. The important thing is to be educated about alcohol, what’s in it, how much should be consumed, and whether you feel it’s something you want to have in your lifestyle.
If you are finding yourself drowning your quarantine-sorrows in booze, there are healthier and more effective ways to handle your stress.
So, set down that cocktail and let me show you some strategies that work for me to keep my sanity, which I’m sure could help you as well.

https://foodbabe.com/introducing-truvanis-plant-based-omega-supplement-its-vegan-and-carrageenan-free/,Introducing Truvani’s Plant Based Omega Supplement! (It’s vegan and carrageenan-free),"I have great news for you today: Truvani’s Plant Based Omega is finally available!

This new supplement can help support brain health, heart health, and overall wellness within your body. There are over 30,000 studies supporting the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. But, when we set out to develop our omega supplement, we faced a few obstacles.
We wanted to create a product that:
You’d think this is easy to accomplish, but it’s not. This product wasn’t easy to make. And it almost didn’t happen.

The biggest problem was…
Even though you can’t certify plant-based omega supplements as organic, some organic supplements use sunflower oil to help deliver nutrients and keep the product stable.
Sunflower oil can be organic, and for some reason manufacturers refused to replace their non-organic sunflower oil with organic sunflower oil.
We pressed them. And I was stunned at their response:
“There’s no demand for it.” Meaning they wouldn’t use it.
REALLY?!?!
I WAS demanding it.
And I wasn’t going to compromise.
Not for this product, or any product with the Truvani label.
So, we put the product on hold immediately.
Even though it created some major headaches, it was worth it. We built Truvani into a brand people can trust. And saying NO to bad ingredients is our motto.
We didn’t lose hope. We kept looking for ingredient suppliers, and now, after a year, we finally found one. So, our new product is now possible… and it’s amazing.
Watch the video to learn more…
These little details are what makes Truvani products bar none. So, if you ever thought about trying an Omega 3 supplement, I highly suggest you check it out.
Plus, since it’s brand new, we are offering up to 25% off. We like to reward our most loyal customers with the best possible pricing.

Truvani’s Plant Based Omega is made with responsibly-sourced algal oil, delivered in a banded capsule that is carrageenan-free and gelatin-free. (Many Omegas come in soft-gels. Soft-gels often have carrageenan. Sometimes they don’t call it carrageenan and disguise it as “seaweed extract.” Truvani doesn’t use soft-gels).
It gets better, too.
The #1 complaint for omega supplements is “Fish burps.” Because most omega supplements are made from fish oil. However, we use algal oil, which is plant-based. Plus, we use a water-based extraction process, so no chemical solvents involved. This process removes impurities, too. Which means no nasty fish burps. No gross smell. Just a clean-tasting, shelf-stable omega-3 supplement that you’re going to love.
I will always put up a fight to make sure each product meets the high-quality Truvani standards. Even if it means we delay a product. Or cancel it altogether.
Luckily we could make this product happen and I hope you’ll try it out.
Snag a bottle of Truvani Plant Based Omega at special launch pricing.

Vani

https://foodbabe.com/announcing-my-first-cookbook-food-babe-kitchen-cover-revealed/,Announcing my first cookbook – Food Babe Kitchen (Cover Revealed),"I went on a live broadcast the other day and dropped a couple hints about what I’ve been working on lately… and yes, the rumors are true!


Writing a cookbook is something I’ve been dreaming about for a very, very long time. And it’s something that everyone keeps asking for. If you’ve ever wondered what I really eat on a daily basis and how I shop for food, this cookbook outlines it all, step-by-step, with beautiful photography. There’s a picture of every single recipe and never before seen photos of my family and I cooking and enjoying delicious healthy food together. If there is anything that spells out what I’m passionate about… this is it!

This picture on the cover was taken on a porch just outside my kitchen where we grow vegetables. My husband has an incredible green thumb and takes requests every season to grow the plants we like to eat, in aboveground planters that we fill with organic soil and water with filtered water. Being able to just walk right outside and grab our own homegrown organic produce to make a salad is my dream come true. When we shot the cover of this cookbook, we had an array of the most delicious spicy arugula. It’s so fresh and tastes amazing—even Harley eats it. There’s truly nothing better. It brings me so much joy to be able to share a glimpse of this happiness in my life with you.

https://foodbabe.com/i-infiltrated-the-kelloggs-shareholders-meeting-and-what-the-ceo-said-will-shock-you-video/,I infiltrated the Kellogg’s shareholders meeting and what the CEO said will shock you (VIDEO),"I have some outrageous news for you today…
If you’ve been reading this blog – you know that Kellogg’s sells cereals in the U.S. with artificial colors, artificial flavors, and BHT, while they make the same cereals without these risky ingredients in other countries.
We petitioned Kellogg’s, asking them to remove artificial ingredients from all of their cereals in the U.S. just as they do in other countries. This petition has now reached over 50,000 signatures of concerned citizens (add your name now).
Kellogg’s has largely ignored us. And, due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, I was unable to go in person to the Kellogg’s annual shareholder meeting to deliver these petitions.
So I had to come up with another plan…
I was authorized by a Kellogg’s shareholder to act as their representative at Kellogg’s virtual meeting last week.
I was only permitted to submit written questions, and there was the risk that the moderator would ignore my questions. Only one of my questions was read and answered during the meeting.
During your 2015 2nd Quarter Earnings Call, Paul Norman, former president of Kellogg North America stated: “we have been working to remove artificial colors and flavors across Kellogg’s branded cereals and a variety of Kellogg’s branded snack bars as well as Eggo frozen foods. Our goal is to complete this transition by the end of 2018.”
Kellogg’s currently is still selling cereal made with artificial colors, such as Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks. In addition, artificial flavors and colors are in some limited-edition cereals, such as Baby Shark Cereal. What is Kellogg’s current position on this? Does Kellogg’s still have a goal to remove artificial colors and artificial flavors from their entire line of cereal?
I then asked a 2nd question regarding the status of removing BHT from all of their cereals. This question was also ignored.

My question: What is your current position on removing artificial colors from all your cereals, such as Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks?
Steven Cahillane, CEO of Kellogg’s: “We have made tremendous progress in removing artificial ingredients from all of our products including our ready-to-eat cereal products. Where we will not make compromise is around taste and enjoyment, and so, to the extent that we can continue to make progress and delight consumers with non-compromising foods, that’s our north star.”
In 2015 this was all over the news…
“Kellogg to stop using artificial ingredients by 2018” – USA Today
“Kellogg to Eliminate Artificial Ingredients in Cereal” – NBC News
“Kellogg to stop using artificial products in cereals, snack bars” – Reuters
“Kellogg announces removal of artificial colors, flavors” – Food Dive
“Kellogg’s to dump artificial ingredients from cereal by 2018” – Fox News
I’m sure they loved all the good publicity! Well, now everyone can know that they are LIARS.

The truth is that Kellogg’s is not making “tremendous progress” removing artificial ingredients from their cereals, and continues to create brand new cereals FOR CHILDREN with them.

All the while, Kellogg’s sells safer cereals with better ingredients in other countries. We’re not asking Kellogg’s to start at square one and to reformulate their cereals without artificial ingredients, as this has already been done!



Just like when we petitioned Kraft and I arrived uninvited at their headquarters with thousands of your signatures, they reluctantly agreed to meet with me. And, I’ll never forget what they told me…
Kraft said, “We’ll have to agree to disagree” and that their customers like Kraft Mac & Cheese just the way it was, with artificial colors. Well, we all know what happened next! Kraft removed the artificial colors after all. We influenced Kraft to change their iconic Mac & Cheese and I know in my heart that we can influence Kellogg’s to do the same with Fruit Loops, Apple Jacks, and all of their cereals.
I’m so thankful to all of you who have stepped up in such a huge way in support for this petition. You’re truly remarkable.
We can do this, but we all need to continue sharing our petition everywhere! Go, Food Babe Army, Go!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/over-100-snacks-better-than-goldfish-for-kids/,Over 100 snacks better than Goldfish for kids,"If I can stop one goal of the BIG food industry in the way I raise my daughter it would be this:
Refuse to buy junk food designed to be addictive that has no nutritional value.
And refusing to feed my daughter Pepperidge Farm Goldfish fits the bill brilliantly. But why is this snack something almost every child in America eats in the first place? Parents buy them by the gallon carton full at Costco. Preschools and day cares serve them. It’s time for this to stop.


First, let’s talk about what’s not on the label. The majority of wheat in this country is sprayed with glyphosate (Roundup weedkiller) as a drying agent before harvest (1), which is ending up in finished products on the shelf. Tests have specifically found residues of glyphosate in Goldfish Crackers (1). This chemical is known to cause cancer (2).
The cheese in Goldfish Crackers is not organic. That means it comes from factory farmed cows that were raised on an unhealthy diet of food that was not organic and probably sprayed with glyphosate and other pesticides (3). When you buy Goldfish crackers, you are supporting the industrial complex of crap food. And you don’t need to do that. Kids will be just fine without Goldfish Crackers and I will prove it to you.
When you combine the blood sugar spiking ingredient white flour, cheap oils likely produced with hexane with an addictive flavoring like autolyzed yeast which is just MSG disguised as another name – you create the perfect food for hooking your brain to crave it over and over again. Autolyzed yeast is an excitotoxin, purely used to increase food cravings and irresistibility, so you eat more than you should. I personally don’t want my child’s taste buds to be hijacked by foods like this. We need to stop the habit of brainless munching of low quality foods that has led millions of Americans to diseases like obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.

But here’s the good news…
I put together a list of over 100 snacks that are a zillion times better than Goldfish Crackers.
This is for all the moms and dads out there who think they need Goldfish Crackers to have snacks on-the-go for their kids. You can stash any of these alternative snacks in your bag or car, or wherever you go and you’ll always have a healthy snack handy for your child that is non-white flour and non-white sugar.
It’s time to stop letting our kids get hooked on nutrition-less dead food! Big food has done of enough damage to our health. Let’s break their control together.
Choose organic whenever possible. I linked to the products to make shopping easy for you.
Note: this list doesn’t include the myriad of fresh fruits and vegetables and homemade snacks you can make in your kitchen – which are the snacks I offer most to my daughter.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-make-rice-krispies-treats-without-controversial-ingredients-like-bht-and-corn-syrup/,How to make “Rice Krispies Treats” without controversial ingredients like BHT and corn syrup,"DISCLAIMER: I can polish off a half of a pan of these Rice Krispie Treats in one sitting, so before you start reading, don’t get mad at me – you’ve been warned.
Seriously, though it makes me incredibly sad that so many children are eating “treats” full of corn syrup, artificial flavors, BHT, TBHQ, DATEM, and all kinds of additives that are linked to health issues. (1) I grew up with homemade Rice Krispie Treats – they were a staple in my mother’s kitchen. Since then, Kellogg’s came up with this processed crap that makes its way into kid’s lunches everywhere.


This ingredient list is CRAZY to me, especially since you can make similar treats at home without all that nonsense. Here’s how I make mine, but first let’s talk about the ingredients.
There are 3 basic ingredients you need to make Rice Krispies Treats: (1) butter, (2) crispy rice cereal, and (3) marshmallows. But you need to be extra careful on how you choose these ingredients…
1. Butter: Look for a pastured grass-fed butter. Here’s why – Conventional non-organic butter comes from cows fed almost entirely GMO corn and soy. The harmful pesticides used on GMOs (like glyphosate) is also being eaten by these cows too and can end up in their milk – and thereby, butter. (2) You’ll also want to stay away from margarines made with inflammatory oils like soybean oil that are most surely GMO (unless specified otherwise). They also can contain hidden trans fat additives (like mono and diglycerides), flavors, and artificial preservatives. (2)
2. Crispy Rice Cereal: Choose a certified organic brand. This is the best way to protect yourself from synthetic pesticides. (3) I like to use 365 Organic Brown Rice Crisps from Whole Foods, as it has no “flavors” added like the Kellogg’s version does.
3. Marshmallows: This is the most tricky ingredient, but very important to choose correctly because most brands are AWFUL. Unfortunately, I have (yet) to find 100% certified organic marshmallows unless you make them from scratch. So, until then, I use SmashMallow brand, which are made with organic cane sugar and no artificial colors. Did you know they dye most marshmallows with Blue 1 made from petroleum? Steer clear of Kraft Jet-Puffed Marshmallows which are full of GMO Sugar and awful ingredients!



All you do is melt 3 tablespoons of pastured butter on the stove in a saucepan. I like to use a GreenPan saucepan, so the marshmallows don’t stick. Then you toss in a bag of marshmallows and melt them all together (One of my friends made these with two bags of marshmallows and said they were great. You can use two if you’d like, but I think it would be too sugary! But now I wanna try it, LOL)
Then you’ll take it off the heat and mix in 6 cups of rice cereal…
After it’s mixed up well, you pour the mixture into a buttered baking pan and press it down well.
That’s it!
Here’s the printable recipe…

https://foodbabe.com/how-i-am-supporting-my-immune-system-right-now/,How I Am Supporting My Immune System Right Now,"This week I was supposed to be in California attending the biggest natural products show in the U.S.
I prepared weeks for this show. Everything from lining up meetings, to preparing frozen meals to take with me for my daughter to eat while I was busy working and lots and lots of packing!
It was stressful but it was going to be so worth it. Truvani was going to have their first booth at this major trade show.
But on Monday night right as I finished putting all the last minute things in my bag, I got a text.
The trip was cancelled because of the global health emergency going on right now.
When I told my daughter we weren’t going to California – she looked at me and almost cried. And I did too.
Health scares always make me think about my overall health and mortality. And it reminds me of why I got into eating better in the first place.
It all started with a hospital trip. Even though it was for something that was completely out of my control, it made me realize that I was ignoring my overall health.
Then, everything changed.
I started blogging about food and ingredients on Food Babe. I also launched my company Truvani, where I sell remarkable supplements.



We are also running a sale on some of our newest products, specifically Under The Weather, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D.
I love taking these – not only because they are organic and the best in class – but because they give me peace of mind that I am doing everything I can.

https://foodbabe.com/you-wont-want-to-put-this-down-feeding-you-lies-now-in-audio-paperback/,You Won’t Want to Put This Down – Feeding You Lies now in Audio & Paperback,"I’ve been waiting months for this, and now it’s time!
My bestselling book Feeding You Lies is now available in two new versions…
Paperback and Personally-narrated audiobook


This book was not easy to write. But I wrote it for you. Your friends. Your children. Your family.
I hoped it would help people to stop believing the lie that everything on the shelf is safe and that even foods advertised as “healthy” are often far from it. In this book, I wanted to make it easy for people to stop falling for food industry tricks and transform their food choices. That’s why it makes me SO HAPPY to see reviews like this…
“Just when I thought my family was eating good, BOOM……MIND BLOWN !! After reading this book, our family will never shop for our food the same way again! We are now in the process of slowly restocking our kitchen and refrigerator with nothing but “real” food with the knowledge and ideas from this book.” – Terry
“This book is the real deal. Big bucks are paid by companies to NOT get the word out on how our food supply has poisoned us. If you feel GMO is fine, conventional foods are fine, etc, you’ve been duped. The propaganda of big bucks has influenced you. READ THIS BOOK. And don’t stop there. Continue to educate yourself on good nutrition. You’ll live a lot longer, feel better, look better, and be a lot happier. Most Americans are addicted to garbage foods. AS I SAID, read this book.” – Emily
“I shudder to think how much trust I had previously put into “Big Food”, most especially as it relates to my child and the foods I thought “must be safe or they wouldn’t be selling it”. This book is a MUST if you want to protect your loved ones. It’s horrifying to discover how much damage can be caused by ingesting dishonest foods and this book arms you with the tools you need to make the best decisions.” – Amazon customer
“We’ve been eating clean for years, but I still learned a LOT from reading this book. I can’t believe that food companies have the power and ability to manipulate the press the way they do. Just goes to show you that there is not a single news outlet out there that you can trust anymore. There is no such thing as an unbiased view when it involves making or losing money. Big Food has been winning at this garbage for TOO LONG! It has to stop.” – Happy Shopper
Calling out specific food brands, industry experts, and front groups is VERY RISKY to report on. Newspapers, TV networks, and publishers don’t want to touch this information because it could hurt their ad accounts (yes, I’ve been told this point blank). And although I struggled to get a publisher who was courageous enough to move forward with this book, my persistence has been worth it. I’m really thankful that I didn’t let the naysayers and critics scare me off from writing it. This book has already helped so many people, and for that, I’m so grateful!
I wrote this book to expose the unethical tactics used by certain corporations who are feeding the world, because they are hurting and misleading a lot of people with their lies. And it needs to stop. We need to tell everyone all about this – and that is why this book is so important.
It’s a tell-all on the food industry in one book that’s super easy to share with your friends and family. You’ll learn how to cut the toxins from your food and improve your health.
And now you can listen to the audiobook (narrated by yours truly!) while you’re out running errands or while you’re cooking dinner. Or, pick up the paperback that you can easily pack and read anywhere. It makes an incredible gift too.

https://foodbabe.com/valentine-candy-showdown-what-to-buy-and-not-to-buy/,Valentine Candy Showdown – What to buy and NOT to buy,"Valentine’s Day has always been one of my favorite holidays. I love seeing all the hearts everywhere and it brings back fond memories that I cherished as a child… making cute little valentines for all my friends, and of course, all that candy!
One thing I’m not looking forward to though is when my daughter starts going to school and gets offered candy like this to celebrate Valentine’s Day. I wish I could wipe all the candy like this from the earth…


But you don’t need to use risky and potentially toxic ingredients to make delicious candy. Of course, candy isn’t supposed to be healthy, but you don’t need to poison yourself (and your kids) just to have fun celebrating a holiday.
❌ ARTIFICIAL COLORS (like Red 40 and Blue 1): Derived from petroleum and linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which requires a warning label in Europe. May also be contaminated with carcinogens such as benzidine. (1)
❌ ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Artificial flavors are complex chemical mixtures made in a lab using various substances like crude oil or coal tar, and can contain upwards of 100 ingredients (including some recently banned). Food companies don’t need to tell you anything about the ingredients actually in their artificial flavors – they just slap “artificial flavors” on the ingredient label – and we are left in the dark about what we are really eating. (1)
❌ BHT: Risky preservative linked to cancer. Unnecessary and much more heavily regulated in Europe or Australia. (1)
Instead of candy, many parents are buying fruit snacks for their children to exchange at school. Unfortunately, the popular brands are not any better than traditional candy…


Even organic fruit snacks usually contain added sugar and I consider them candy. Organic fruit snacks are a slightly better candy option because they don’t contain artificial colors and a slew of unnecessary gums and emulsifiers. A much better option to candy would always be organic dried fruit.

Quaker Chewy Granola Bars may look like a healthier option to candy with “17 Grams of Whole Grains” and “No High Fructose Corn Syrup” called out on the front of the packaging. But don’t be fooled. They’re still PACKED with refined sugar and corn syrup along with sorbitol, artificial colors (Red 40, Yellow 6), refined soybean oil, and artificial flavors.
Luckily for us, not all candy is made with controversial ingredients. There are many choices available that are delicious (and some are actually even nutritious). I plan to indulge in some decadent chocolates on Valentine’s Day – I love it, but I don’t buy the toxic stuff.
As a general rule, I like to choose organic food whenever possible, to lessen my exposure to pesticides and artificial additives (2). When it comes to chocolate, the cocoa bean is one of the most heavily sprayed crops in the world, so it’s very important to choose organic chocolate. Organic chocolate is made with organic dairy, which comes from cows raised without hormones, antibiotics, and GMO feed (3). Organic candy also doesn’t contain artificial colors, which are one of the worst additives found in children’s candy (4).
I have a big list of Valentine’s candy swaps for you below. If you have little ones in school, many of them come in mini-packs which are great for valentine exchange parties. While these aren’t all perfect in terms of ingredients and not something I recommend eating on a regular basis (it’s candy!)… these options are way, way better than conventional Valentine’s treats, and you can find them at natural foods grocery stores or online (links provided below).


If you know anyone who would love these candy swaps, please share this post with them.
This Valentine’s Day, I want you to know how much you mean to me and to all of us here at Food Babe. We truly love you so much for being on our team and helping us change the food system. We’ve got a lot in store for you this year that we know you’re going to love. I can’t wait until you see what’s coming.

Back in the day, I’d pick up some of these fun items as gifts for my friends – but not anymore. I’ve since learned about all the toxins in these products…
Beauty products from The Body Shop, Bath & Body Works, and Victoria’s Secret are made with a slew of artificial ingredients that are linked to cancer and other health issues. This also goes for drugstore brands like Bodycology and Dr. Teal’s.
Those popular scented lotions and body washes from The Body Shop and Bath & Body Works are dyed with artificial colors made from petroleum, like Yellow #5 and Red #40. These dyes may be contaminated with carcinogens (1) and are readily absorbed by shaven skin (2) where they can go right into your bloodstream (3).


The body washes and bath products from Bath & Body Works, The Body Shop, Dr. Teal’s and many others are foamy with the help of the chemicals Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) and/or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). The ingredient SLES may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane (4), which is linked to cancer (5), and SLS irritates the skin and scalp by stripping away the natural oils that protect it.
And SLS becomes even more harmful when combined with the ingredient Triethanolamine (TEA), where it creates the nitrosamine NDELA – a carcinogen (6).
You’ll also want to watch out for “PEG-100” or other “PEG” compounds on the label, these can be contaminated (7) with Ethylene Oxide (8) and 1,4 Dioxane (4), which are both linked to cancer.

Cosmetic companies don’t tell you what is in these fragrances and they can include highly toxic ingredients (9), hormone disruptors, and carcinogens (10). They also often contain alcohols, which can irritate sensitive skin and make you appear older (Kinda crazy for a “beauty” product, right?)
And for years I struggled with rashes and eczema – and came to find out that many of these big-name skincare products were making my problems worse! It’s better to keep your beauty regimen simple and use natural techniques to fight wrinkles, eczema, rosacea, acne, and other skin issues.
Your skin is your largest organ. It covers and protects everything on your body and what you put on it, is absorbed into your blood and can affect your overall health. Make sure that the products you are using (and giving to your loved ones as gifts) are safe and made with natural, organic ingredients.

https://foodbabe.com/6-reasons-why-youll-love-this-protein-powder/,6 Reasons Why You Need To Buy This Protein Powder,"If you like protein powder, I think you’ll love Truvani’s Plant-Based Protein powder.


Here’s why:
When Lisa Oidvin tried our Chocolate Plant-Based Protein Powder, here’s exactly what she said:
“It’s delicious!! I’ve had the hardest time finding a protein powder that I like and that my body likes.. I can’t have dairy and whey and I’m picky about taste… You guys [Truvani] totally nailed it!! Thank you for creating this.”
Watch this to learn more:
There are many plant-based protein powders on the market, and you might be wondering, “Why Truvani?”
Take a look at these two ingredient labels:
The first label is Truvani’s Chocolate Plant-Based Protein Powder. The second is a “typical” plant-based protein powder.
Truvani focuses on cutting all additives that are either (a) potentially harmful or (b) don’t need to be there. And our ingredient label proves it with 6 simple ingredients and no random “weird stuff”.
(P.S. “Luo Han Guo” is the official name for “Monk Fruit” if you were wondering).
Imagine it’s 3:00pm on a weekday. It’s been a looooooong day. Suddenly, you can’t stop thinking about food… Cookies. Chocolate. SUGARY SNACKS!
You know you shouldn’t, but sometimes you just can’t resist. Well, how about replacing an unhealthy snack with a Truvani Plant-Based Protein Shake?
It tastes great. It satisfies your sweet tooth… without overwhelming you with sugar. And the protein can help curb future cravings.
It is very important to choose a certified organic protein powder to limit your exposure to synthetic pesticides – many of which are hormone disruptors, neurotoxins, or reproductive toxins which are strongly linked to many diseases and health issues.
At Truvani, we believe in using the best ingredients available. Always.
Here is just a handful of what our customers have to say:
When you receive Truvani’s Plant Based Protein Powder, we have a simple promise: fall in love with it within 30 days or you can get a refund. No questions asked. The countdown for the refund policy will begin on the day you receive your product and expires 30 days later.
So…

https://foodbabe.com/whats-the-best-way-to-stay-hydrated-and-other-news-you-should-never-believe/,What’s the best way to stay hydrated? (And other news you should never believe),"I was instantly suspicious when I saw this recent headline on a major news outlet: “Which drink is best for hydration? Hint: It isn’t water.” They reported the results of a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition which found that milk, soda, and sports drinks are all MORE hydrating than water. Water was ranked down as 10th on the list. (1)(2)


I always follow the money trail when reading something that goes against my common sense about food and promotes junk food or sodas as healthy options. As I wrote about in Feeding You Lies, a major way that the Big Food industry fools the public is with shady paid-for science, producing studies that are actually thinly veiled marketing ploys. They’re also really good at manipulating the media into reporting messages that support the processed food industry.
To suggest that sodas and sports drinks filled with high fructose syrup, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, and caramel color linked to cancer are a good choice is outrageous. If anything, these toxic concoctions are destroying your health one sip at a time.

I just knew that the soda industry had to be behind such a study that would ridiculously promote that idea that guzzling down Coke and Powerade is a good way to stay hydrated.
And it turns out my suspicions were right…

Coca-Cola spent £4.86 million setting up the EHI – a group that promotes the consumption of soda and sports drinks. Coca-Cola remains listed as a founding partner on EHI’s website. (3) EHI’s Director, Jane Holdsworth, worked in marketing for the dairy industry and founded her own marketing consulting firm. She counts Coca-Cola, Kellogg’s, Kraft, and Pepsico as previous clients. (3)
None other than Rhona Applebaum, former chief health and science officer for Coca-Cola, sits on the Board of Trustees for EHI. (3) Rhona famously retired Coke in 2015 after the New York Times and Associated Press exposed how Coke funded another front group (the Global Energy Balance Network) to fool people into believing sugary drinks don’t cause obesity. (4)
The lead researcher in the hydration study had worked hand in hand with the soda industry as well. Ron Maughan was an emeritus professor at Loughborough University, which received almost £1 million from Coca-Cola. (5) He is currently sits as chairman on the EHI’s scientific advisory board. (3)
I know it’s frustrating when there is so much conflicting health information being fired at us from all directions. Here are some tips for how to separate the TRUTH from the FICTION in health news:
Yes it often takes quite a bit of time and effort to figure out the facts. However, when it comes to your health, it’s absolutely worth it to determine what’s real and what’s not. At the end of the day, it’s nobody else’s responsibility to tell you what’s true.

https://foodbabe.com/truvanis-new-immune-supporting-supplement-is-here-and-its-called-under-the-weather/,Truvani’s new immune-supporting supplement is here!,"When I was a kid, my mom used to make a special tea for me whenever I was feeling “under the weather”.
It wasn’t like any normal tea that you’d buy at the grocery store. It was more like an elixir because it was filled with many different herbs that she’d pick up from the Indian market.
It felt so soothing to drink and always made me feel better. But even though she’d make her tea with all the love in the world, I didn’t truly appreciate it until I started learning about the ingredients in my food.
You see, some of the ingredients she used like ginger are remarkable ingredients that have been used for centuries to support overall wellness.
This got me thinking…
While I’d love to make homemade elixirs with fresh ingredients from the farmers market, I’m a working mom and sometimes I just don’t have the time.


It is made with a blend of organic berries, herbs, and roots that support your immune system, which we can all use this time of year!
This is important even if you’re eating healthy and getting plenty of exercise and sleep. Because if you’re like me, even with the best intentions things don’t always go according to plan…
Work. Travel. Family. Holidays. Weather Changes.
These things pull us out of routine, and also take a toll on our immune system.
That’s why I take this supplement at the first sign of feeling ‘not myself’ and also during seasonal changes, when I travel, or when life feels extra stressful. Truvani’s Immune Support is like having an abundant garden of botanicals used for centuries in an easy-to-swallow tablet.
When you look at the ingredient label, you’ll see how remarkable it is. First, you’ll notice what we DON’T include in the product…
You won’t find Synthetic Vitamins, Artificial Flavors, “Natural” Flavors, Artificial Colors or Preservatives. We keep it simple.
Second, you’ll notice it’s made with nutrient-dense ingredients…
Some companies blend together many different superfoods – and then lace their products with synthetic vitamins and minerals to make it appear more nutrient-dense on the label. These supplements are just a sprinkle of this and a sprinkle of that without enough of anything to be effective. In reality, much of the nutrition doesn’t actually come from the fruits and vegetables in the product… it comes from the synthetic vitamins and minerals that are added to the product.
We don’t do that at Truvani. We keep it simple and use nutrient-dense, real food ingredients.

We set out to create a properly dosed immune-supporting botanical blend with research-backed ingredients… all in tablet form.
It wasn’t easy – but we finally did it.
I look forward to hearing what you think.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/6-proven-health-benefits-of-vitamin-d/,6 Proven Health Benefits of Vitamin D,"Vitamin D is different from other vitamins in that it actually functions like a hormone in your body. Interestingly enough, nearly every cell in the body has a receptor for vitamin D! (1) It is essential to good health and effects everything from your bones, to your brain, to your heart, to your immune system. It’s been called the “sunshine vitamin” because your body can make it from sunlight! Let’s look at the proven health benefits of Vitamin D that are backed up by research.


Vitamin D Promotes Healthy Bones: D3 plays a huge supporting role in the absorption of calcium and other minerals important for bone strength.
Vitamin D helps your body regulate and absorb the calcium from your diet, along with maintaining the level of phosphorus in your blood (2). These nutrients are crucial to maintaining the strength and health of your bones. Without vitamin D, much of the calcium that you eat would not be absorbed and would end up being excreted by the kidneys. This is why a lack of vitamin D in the body can lead to poor bone density or osteoporosis in older adults.
Supports Healthy Immune System: D3 turns on key peptides in the body responsible for a healthy immune response.
Vitamin D regulates the expression of thousands of genes in the body which fire up your immune system into gear to fight bacteria and viruses. Vitamin D induces and antimicrobial peptide gene expression so your body can effectively fight infections (3). Keeping your vitamin D levels in a healthy range has been shown to reduce the risk of contracting the flu, colds, and other respiratory infections (4, 5, 6, 7). In fact, it is theorized that 5,000 IU/day doses of vitamin D may prevent colds and the flu, and higher doses may be helpful in treating full-blown flu patients (8).
Vitamin D Supports Healthy Brain Function: D3 supports the growth of new brain cells, playing a big role in brain development and function, as well as, a mood boost.
The human brain contains receptors for Vitamin D, many of which are located in areas of the brain that are linked to depression (9). Vitamin D is known to help with the release neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which relieves feelings of depression. One study of adults who supplemented with high doses of vitamin D (4,000 IU/day) experienced an improvement in their depression symptoms after only 2 months (10).
Vitamin D greatly affects brain function as well. Animal studies have shown that Vitamin D supports “neurogenesis” which is the formation of new brain cells (11). Higher vitamin D levels in the body is associated with better short-term and working memory  (12), and reduced risk of cognitive impairment that comes with aging or following a stroke (13). Vitamin D regulates the enzymes in the brain that are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and nerve growth, and research suggests that vitamin D protects the neurons in the brain from damage (14).
Vitamin D Maintains Healthy Blood Sugar Levels: D3 maintains healthy blood glucose levels that are already within the normal range.
There is an abundance of vitamin D receptors in the cells of the body which regulate blood glucose. One study found that when obese adults (who were at risk for type 2 diabetes, but did not have diabetes) took a daily Vitamin D supplement (2,000 IU), their blood glucose levels and insulin secretion from the pancreas improved (15). This shows a potential for Vitamin D to play a role in slowing down the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes in obese adults. In another study, adults with diabetes supplemented with 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day, after which their fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c, insulin resistance, waist circumference, and body mass index all decreased (16).
Vitamin D Supports Respiratory Health: D3 is a breath of fresh air in supporting healthy respiratory and healthy lung function.
A lack of Vitamin D can contribute to poor respiratory health and lung function. A 2018 Australian study found that respiratory illnesses (such as asthma and bronchitis) were more common in people with low levels of vitamin D (17). Likewise, the researchers found that those with high levels of vitamin D had better lung function. One study found that patients with COPD improved their respiratory muscle strength and could exercise longer after supplementing with vitamin D (18). Further research shows that vitamin D helps to reduce airway inflammation, which explains why low levels of vitamin D are linked to increased risk of asthma attacks and vitamin D supplementation reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations (19).
Vitamin D Promotes Heart Health: D3 doesn’t skip a beat to protect the heart and supports healthy blood vessels and cardiovascular muscles.
Heart disease is the #1 killer in America, so this is a very important health benefit of vitamin D. The heart and blood vessels in the body host several vitamin D receptors, which rely on optimal levels of vitamin D to properly function (20). Vitamin D prevents an excessive buildup of proteins that raise blood pressure and stiffen the arteries (21). Studies have found that low levels of vitamin D increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and clogged arteries (22, 23, 24).
According to the New England Journal of Medicine that nearly 1 billion people worldwide have insufficient levels of Vitamin D, which can put your health at risk.
If the level of vitamin D in your body is too low for an extended period, you may experience muscle weakness, bone loss, and fractures. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes, non-Alzheimer’s dementia, and high blood pressure (25, 26, 27, 28). This is why it is important to keep your vitamin D levels up!
Vitamin D deficiency is a big problem, so the question is: How do we get Vitamin D in the first place?
Exposing your skin to the sun is widely considered the best way to get your vitamin D. Energy from the sun turns a chemical in your skin into vitamin D3, where it can be used by your body. In order to get enough vitamin D from the sun, you should expose bare skin (arms and legs without sunscreen) to strong sun (UVB rays) for 15-30 minutes a day.
However – this is not easy for most of us. Depending on where you live, the weather, and the time of year, you may not be able to get this much quality sunlight on a daily basis. And, if you live above 37 degrees north or below 37 degrees south of the equator, you likely won’t produce any vitamin D from the sun during the winter. This is anyone north of San Francisco and Philadelphia in the U.S. (29). Also if you wear sunscreen or have darker skin tone, you won’t produce as much vitamin D from the sun and it could take much longer. This is also the case for older people.
It can be difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone, as there are not many foods that contain an amount significant enough to give you benefits. Here are the approximate amount of vitamin D that you’ll get from these foods considered good sources:
Wild Salmon: One serving of wild salmon (3.5 ounces) provides about 988 IU which makes it one of the best food sources! However, the amount of vitamin D varies greatly per fish and it is very important to choose wild salmon (and not farmed salmon). Farmed salmon only provides a meager 250 IU of vitamin D per serving.
Cod Liver Oil: You’ll get about 450 IU per teaspoon. Cod liver oil is also a good source of vitamin A, however it is so high in vitamin A that you need to regulate how much cod liver oil you eat to avoid vitamin A toxicity. This can make it difficult to get enough vitamin D from cod liver oil alone.
Egg Yolk (pasture-raised): Conventionally raised egg yolks contain about 18–39 IU of vitamin D each, however, yolks that come from pastured hens can contain 4 times this amount! Still, most people do not eat more than 2 eggs per day, so you would be unlikely to gain enough vitamin D from eggs alone.
Canned Light Tuna: Each serving (3.5 ounces) contains about 236 IU of vitamin D. Keep in mind that canned tuna can be high in mercury, so most experts advise eating tuna no more than a few times per month.
Fortified foods: These are packaged foods that are fortified (supplemented) with extra vitamin D – but they are almost always heavily processed foods that I wouldn’t recommend eating. Also, the type used is almost always Vitamin D2, which is not the more bioavailable form and not considered by health experts to be suitable for fortification. You’ll often find vitamin D2 added to fortified milks, drinks, and cereals in the U.S.
Wild Mushrooms: This is widely considered the best vegan food source of vitamin D, yet they need to be wild grown mushrooms and not the commercial varieties which are often grown inside. Wild mushrooms get their high vitamin D content from sun exposure and can be found at specialty markets and some farmers markets. Wild mushrooms can contain up to 2,300 IU per 3.5 ounce serving (about 1 cup chopped) serving.
As you can see, unless you eat a significant amount of eggs, fish, and seafood, you likely aren’t getting the benefits of vitamin D from your diet. Likewise, if you aren’t spending significant time outside in direct sunlight each day, you also are not getting the benefit of the “sunshine vitamin”. This is why vitamin D supplements are so popular and crucial for good health. That being said, not all supplements are created equally.
Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol): This type is found in wild mushrooms, fortified foods, and some supplements. Vitamin D2 is less effective at raising the level of Vitamin D in the body.
Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol): This type is found in oily fish, seafood, egg yolks, and some supplements. This is also the type that your body makes from sunlight. Vitamin D3 is more effective at raising vitamin D levels in the body, so it is the preferred type.
When you take vitamin D, it takes time for the level in your body to increase (it may take weeks or months) but it is a fat-soluble vitamin that can be stored in your body for a long time. You can find out the level of Vitamin D in your body by requesting a simple blood test from your doctor. You can also order a vitamin D test kit to check your levels from home. It is generally believed that blood levels of vitamin D that are above 30 ng/ml are sufficient and 50 ng/mL to 70 ng/mL is considered optimal to experience the health benefits (30, 31). You should aim for having your levels checked every 2-3 months to see if you are on the right track.
If you know that you are already deficient in Vitamin D (most of us are) then you need to increase your dose until your level is brought up. To maintain already healthy vitamin D levels in the body, the Institute of Medicine recommends 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D daily (10-20 micrograms), however, many health experts believe this amount is far too low, especially if you don’t spend significant time in the sun. It is safe and effective for most people to take a daily vitamin D supplement in the range of 1,000 to 4,000 IU (25 to 100 micrograms). Studies have found daily supplementation of 2,000 IU per day sufficiently raises the vitamin D in the blood to the target of 30 ng/mL of vitamin D (32). If your vitamin D levels do not increase with this dosage, your healthcare provider may recommend a specific dose to meet your needs.
It is very, very rare for someone to experience Vitamin D toxicity, which causes dangerously high levels of calcium and phosphates in the blood. This can only happen when someone takes vitamin D supplements in extreme excess, as you can not overdose on vitamin D from sun exposure. There are a handful of toxicity cases in people who have supplemented with very high doses of vitamin D (over 50,000 IU) every day for an extended period of time (33). Research shows that taking up to 10,000 IU/day is safe and does not cause toxicity and most supplements contain far less than this. Yet, it is best to stick with the recommended dosage levels of 1,000 to 4,000 IU per day, as amounts in excess are generally unnecessary.
Most people do not experience negative side effects from taking Vitamin D, but like any other vitamin supplement, it’s recommended that you discuss it with your healthcare practitioner. This is especially true if you suffer from health conditions such as kidney problems, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung diseases, or any other chronic condition. If you are taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, they may interact with vitamin D, such as:
As mentioned above, one of vitamin D’s great benefits is its ability to help your body absorb calcium. The vitamin K2 steps in to move this calcium to the right places in your body and keeps it out of places that it shouldn’t be – like your arteries. Without K2, excess calcium may get directed to soft tissues where it may be harmful. If you are taking vitamin D in very large doses this may be an issue (34), which is why many experts recommend also taking a vitamin K2 supplement if you are taking a lot of vitamin D. Others argue this isn’t necessary when taking moderate doses of vitamin D.
There are some companies marketing Vitamin D supplements with added Vitamin K to prevent the risk of Vitamin D Toxicity, which may lead to calcification and hardening of the arteries. However, according to research, Vitamin D Toxicity has been observed in people who take 60,000 IU of Vitamin D per day over the course of several months. Most supplements fall within the recommended range of only 2,000 IU per day, which is far less than the amount shown to cause issues.
Magnesium aids in the activation of vitamin D so it can be used by the body (35). In fact, some experts argue that without magnesium, vitamin D isn’t beneficial. One study found that people who consume a lot of magnesium are less likely to have low vitamin D levels (36). You can get magnesium from good sources like almonds, avocados, spinach, pumpkin seeds, whole grains, cashews, and clean magnesium supplements.

https://foodbabe.com/the-1-reason-to-take-digestive-enzymes/,The #1 Reason To Take Digestive Enzymes,"You’ve heard the phrase “You are what you eat.”
But the truth is:
We are what we digest and absorb.
And that’s a hard truth to swallow…
Because like me, you may do everything in your power to feed yourself healthy food. You might be eating all your veggies and cook meals from scratch with the healthiest ingredients. And it’s all worthwhile, because what goes into our bodies matters. However – if food isn’t properly digested and absorbed, it can lead to some not-so-fun problems like:
* Gas and bloating
* Heaviness in the stomach
* Embarrassing burps
* General stomach discomfort
* Pieces of undigested food in your stool
Our bodies may also have a harder time absorbing important nutrients found in our food.
That’s why taking a digestive enzyme before my biggest meal gives me confidence knowing I’m not only absorbing the nutrients my body needs, but I’m feeling the way I should after eating my favorite foods (including healthy ones, like kale!) – energized. Not sluggish and bloated.
I have been taking digestive enzymes for the past 8 years, and couldn’t wait to create one that could meet Truvani’s strict ingredient standards…
Right now, you can take advantage of our special launch pricing.


Compared to other options on the market (made from animals), our enzymes are 100% vegan and grown on plant matter here in the USA. These diverse, plant-based enzymes aid in the digestive process so your body can better absorb and use nutrients from your diet.
In a perfect world, we’d have all the enzymes we need in our gut. But there are many factors that can affect our body’s ability to produce enough enzymes…
So, even though you eat well and live a healthy lifestyle, your body might not produce enough digestive enzymes.
You do A LOT to give you and your family the best quality food… so make sure your bodies are getting the support they need!

** IMPORTANT: Please share our petition with everyone you know. Simply hit the social share buttons to share instantly. It takes 2 seconds.
We are getting Kellogg’s attention. I made an appearance on Fox46 this morning to discuss how important this petition is and we received an official response. Watch the news clip here:

You are joining over 461,618 supporters to make this happen!



The truth is that Kellogg’s has made NO PROGRESS. This brings up questions about their real intentions.
Why is Kellogg’s creating brand NEW cereals with artificial ingredients if they truly want to remove these chemicals?
Kellogg’s makes Froot Loops and Unicorn Cereal in other countries without artificial colors or BHT, so they already have the formula. They know how to do this.


Back in 2015 Kellogg’s said that 75% of their cereals were made without artificial colors. Now they are saying that 87% of their cereals are without artificial colors. And they call this “significant progress”? What has Kellogg’s been doing for the last 4 years? Which cereal did they remove artificial colors from? You’ll still find it in their ever-popular Froot Loops and Apple Jacks.
And again, they keep churning out new children’s cereals full of them…

They refuse to address the preservative BHT in their U.S. cereals. In 2015 Kellogg’s told reporters they were “actively testing natural alternatives” to BHT. So, are they going to remove it like they do in other countries?
Does Kellogg’s really intend on dumping the artificial ingredients? They keep saying one thing, but doing another. This is unethical. Don’t you agree?
We’ve got to hold Kellogg’s accountable. Artificial colors should NOT be in food – especially in food marketed with cartoons aimed at our children. These dyes require a warning label in other countries because they cause hyperactivity in children. Kellogg’s knows this. This is outrageous!
Even if you’re not a parent, or would never ever feed your child Kellogg’s Baby Shark Cereal, your support for this petition is helping others. Not everyone knows what these artificial ingredients are doing to their kids. I get emails like this one all the time…
“After being told about your blog by family members, I have completely changed how I shop and feed my family. And have seen improvements in my kids when we’ve cut out food dyes from our diet. I have one son that is borderline ADHD, has classic symptoms, and when he’s had a red Gatorade, for example, he’s off the chart crazy and goes bonkers. It’s insane what is in our food system in the USA, of all places!! It drives me crazy when I talk to moms who’s kids have actually been diagnosed with ADHD and are medicated for it, but they give them colored gatorade or Cheetos or other foods that have food dye in them that are just pouring fuel on the fire and they don’t even know it. So, I gently point them to it because it’s crazy how unaware most consumers are. It makes me sick and I for sure put my money where my mouth is and only shop organic and brands I know are striving for more whole natural foods. Thank you for all you do to push this agenda!! “ – Emily

My daughter, who is 2 years old, LOVES Baby Shark – and I knew when she saw this she would beg me for a box! Just look at all those artificial ingredients…

In 2015, Kellogg’s announced plans to remove artificial colors and artificial flavors from all of their cereals by the end of 2018, and this was widely reported by the media (1).
They never did.
Kellogg’s uses these five artificial food dyes in their cereals: Red 40, Blue 1, Yellow 6, Yellow 5, and Red 3.
Artificial food dyes…
In recent months there has been Kellogg’s Peeps Cereal, Kellogg’s Unicorn Cereal, and Kellogg’s Caticorn Cereal… filled with artificial ingredients and BHT.

It’s time for Kellogg’s to stop churning out cereals like this. Why should American children needlessly consume these controversial chemicals if Kellogg’s has already figured out how to make their cereals without it?
Kellogg’s Unicorn Cereal without Artificial Colors or BHT in Australia:

Kellogg’s Froot Loops without Artificial Colors or BHT in Australia and Canada:

Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes without BHT in the UK:

“With all the reports of pesticides in cereals and what not, today while walking down the cereal aisle looking for my organic oatmeal I came across a cereal that just mortified me, as a parent and a responsible consumer doing my best to shop for better foods for my family I was so disgusted to see a cereal named Unicorn cereal by Kellogg’s. Not only that, but a family with 3 little girls in front of me were struggling to get past that cereal without a breakdown because the girls wanted the pretty unicorn cereal! I took some pics which I will attach and hope that this finds you in some way. It’s so incredibly off putting that a cereal company would do that to families.” ~ Irene
Kellogg’s is targeting young children, toddlers even, knowing they will get excited when they see a cartoon-covered box of Baby Shark Cereal at the store, begging their parents to buy it for them.
“We know ‘Baby Shark’ is a catchy tune that has captured the hearts of many families… New Kellogg’s Baby Shark cereal was created to expand on the joy families feel in a tasty way.” – Kellogg’s Press Release, July 2019
This is an absolutely disgusting marketing ploy by Kellogg’s to snag in the youngest consumers out there and get them hooked on their products.
Kellogg’s packages up Apple Jacks, Froot Loops, and Chocolate Frosted Flakes especially for schools across the country. Millions of children are eating risky artificial additives and BHT for their most important meal of the day.


PETITION
Dear Steven Cahillane, CEO of Kellogg Company:
In 2015, Kellogg’s announced they would remove artificial colors and artificial flavors from their U.S. cereals by the end of 2018. This was widely reported in the media.
It is now 2019, and Kellogg’s still sells several cereals with artificial colors such as Froot Loops and Apple Jacks. In addition, Kellogg’s has recently launched new cereals made with artificial colors and/or artificial flavors (Baby Shark, Peeps, Unicorn, and Caticorn). These cereals are directly targeted towards young children and toddlers.
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a policy statement in 2018 warning that some chemicals found in food colorings, preservatives, and packaging materials may harm children’s health and best be avoided. Artificial colors have been banned in countries like Norway and Austria and the UK has imposed a voluntary ban. They may be contaminated with carcinogens and cause an increase in hyperactivity in children. Artificial colors add absolutely no nutritional value and are used solely for aesthetic purposes.
There are risks that come with artificial flavors as well. A governmental agency does not approve the safety of artificial flavors. Instead, a flavor industry trade group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA), has assembled their own panel of scientists who review and approve new flavors as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). These scientists are paid by FEMA (who ultimately get their funding from flavor companies). Public advocacy groups have questioned FEMA’s processes and called on the FDA to ban certain flavor substances that have known links to cancer, but little has been done. In 2019 the FDA banned seven ingredients used to make artificial flavors that have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Any food company using artificial flavors has been given 2 years to remove them from their flavors, so they are still on store shelves.
Your children’s cereals are preserved with Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT). BHT is linked to cancer in some animal studies and is an endocrine disruptor that interferes with hormones. Although the FDA has granted it GRAS, BHT simply hasn’t been proven safe and researchers agree that more studies need to be conducted. BHT has been classified as one of the top “Dirty Dozen” food additives to avoid by the respected Environmental Working Group.
Kellogg’s sells some of the same cereals (Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, and Unicorn) in other countries with safer ingredients. In Europe and Australia for instance, Kellogg’s takes artificial colors and the risky preservative BHT out of their cereals completely. We deserve the same, safer cereals that other countries get.
These unnecessary and potentially harmful ingredients are not in Kellogg’s cereals sold overseas – so they shouldn’t be in ours. The simple fact that you don’t use these ingredients elsewhere is proof that they are not needed.
I urge you to remove Artificial Colors, Artificial Flavors, and BHT from all of your cereals here in North America and worldwide.
Sincerely,
[Your name]

https://foodbabe.com/introducing-truvanis-glorious-gut-probiotic-supplement/,Introducing Truvani’s Glorious Gut Probiotic Supplement,"I’m a big believer that your overall (mind and body) health starts in the gut. After experiencing a health crisis and changing my diet, I found an incredible health practitioner who recommended I start taking a probiotic. They explained to me that this would help to restore healthy bacteria in my gut, which has a dramatic effect on your overall health. So, I began taking a probiotic – this was the first health supplement I ever took. Now over ten years later, I still take one daily. This one simple change helped support my health more than anything else I tried. After just a few weeks of working on balancing my gut, I started to notice some little things… My mind felt clear. My body felt good. My skin looked fantastic!
Since taking a probiotic was a BIG turning point in my health journey, when I co-founded Truvani I knew I had to create one.
And I’m not the only one who’s a mega fan of probiotics. It’s been our #1 most requested product since we launched Truvani. But the thing we learned is formulating a great probiotic is no small task. We considered making a probiotic powder, a probiotic tablet, a probiotic drink… and none of them were good enough. And a lot of funny things happen while working with these live strains of bacteria… like when we created a liquid one and it outgrew the container (yikes!) So, I went with my gut (pun intended) and waited until we got our product juuuuust right, and….
In the end we created one awesome probiotic capsule supplement. One that contains 15 incredible strains of healthy bacteria to support a balanced gut.
I’m proud to introduce Truvani’s Glorious Gut Probiotic. It’s been a long time in the making… and it’s available today at our special launch pricing!


Up until recently, the health of our gut has been largely ignored. But now, researchers are even calling this remarkable system our “2nd brain”, and some doctors have dubbed it “A new clinical frontier”. Thanks to all this research pouring out, we now know that much of our health is controlled by our gut. And it’s one of the reasons why everyone keeps talking about “Gut Health”. Silly health fads can get a little obnoxious… But gut health isn’t a fad. It’s a revolution.
Watch this video to see why gut health is so important and how Truvani’s Glorious Gut is the best probiotic on the market:

When it comes to probiotics, different bacterial strains have different benefits. So when formulating a probiotic you can choose to include ones that focus specifically on skin health, or immunity support, or digestive health. Well, I wanted one to do it all…
So, I put together my DREAM formula.
Most brands don’t do this. The cost to create a probiotic with more strains costs more money… and some companies cut strains to cut costs. But here at Truvani we believe in creating the best. We put our customers first, and if you can get all the good stuff in one probiotic, I say we do it.
We included 15 properly dosed strains to deliver a wide range of benefits. Some other brands “strain wash” their probiotic. This means the bulk of it only contains 2 or 3 strains, lightly “dusted” with other strains to save money and look better on the label. We don’t take shortcuts at Truvani.
All of this is why I can proudly call Glorious Gut the best probiotic on the market. It’s vegan and non-GMO with 15 Strains and 15 Billion CFU’s per capsule.
And right now, you can get Glorious Gut at special launch pricing.
If you ever thought about trying a probiotic, now’s the time to do it. Gut health is extremely important and I love giving my gut everything it needs to handle the day ahead. It’s going to be a game-changer for you too!
Xo,
Vani
P.S. There is a lot of complicated (sometimes conflicting) medical research about gut health. But really it all comes down to this: Your gut is a garden. It is where the seeds for health and beauty are planted. Probiotics are like fertilizer, they help the good stuff in the gut grow. This keeps our gut strong, so that bad bacteria (kind of like weeds), don’t overtake our beautiful blooming gut flora. Healthy soil makes for beautiful blooms, and a healthy gut makes for beautiful skin and a happy you.

https://foodbabe.com/here-are-the-55-ingredients-in-a-chick-fil-a-sandwich-should-you-eat-them/,Here are the 55 ingredients in a Chick-fil-A Sandwich. Should you eat them?,"
QUICK LOOK:
Read More Investigations Exposing The Food Industry Here
I had an early love affair with Chick-fil-A. While in college, I’d eat there at least 3 to 4 times a week, sometimes more. I’d pick up one of their sandwiches on my way back from the gym and thought they were healthy because they were only around 400 calories. If only I knew then what I do now.
One of my first restaurant investigations was into Chick-fil-A (about 7 years ago!) That’s when I posted the ingredients in their chicken sandwich on my personal Facebook page and got an intense reaction from my friends and family – everything from horrified to “no one is going to stop me from eating those 100 ingredients of deliciousness….”
Ha ha, yeah, I once thought those sandwiches were delicious too. But I finally came to a point in my life where I realized that eating “food” full of artificial additives was making me feel and look horrible. It was not worth it.
I went on to write several blog posts about Chick-fil-A during the summer of 2012, exposing the unholy ingredients in the company’s sandwiches from antibiotics, to MSG, to artificial food dyes, to GMOs and TBHQ (1). This eventually got the attention of the executives at Chick-fil-A, and to my surprise they invited me to their headquarters to consult with them on how they could change their ingredients. I came to them prepared with a laundry list of what it would take to improve their food. I tried my hardest to convince them that they’d be surprised by how many people would choose clean, organic chicken sandwiches, if offered. And if Chick-fil-A did make their menu items additive-free, I promised them that I’d rent a cow costume or whatever they wanted and run up and down the street on live TV. That promise still stands!

They did some outstanding work in implementing a No Antibiotics Ever policy for their chicken – the #1 suggestion I made to them (2). (UPDATE: On March 22, 2024 Chick-fil-A reversed their “No Antibiotics Ever” policy and now allows for the use of antibiotics in their chicken).
They also dropped the TBHQ and high fructose corn syrup – another suggestion I made (3). And then they made a big announcement about dropping artificial dyes from their sauces a few years back (4). Well…
Those same artificial dyes are still in the pickles found on nearly every Chick-fil-A sandwich. And there are dozens more health-wrecking additives still in their food.


This is the complete list of ingredients in the Chick-fil-A Sandwich – some items appear more than once because they are used in multiple items, like in the chicken, and again in the bun.
CHICKEN:
1. Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast Filet – Not organic or pasture-raised, Chick-fil-A’s chicken is raised in large barns where the chickens likely spend little to no time outdoors (5).
2. Salt
3. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) – What is it that makes Chick-fil-A sandwiches so addicting? This ingredient is the main culprit! MSG is a flavor-enhancer and excitotoxin that excites brain cells to death, increases food cravings, and makes you eat more than you should (6).
4. Sugar – Refined likely from GMO sugar beets.
5. Spices – We asked Chick-fil-A what exactly is in their “spices” in the Chick-fil-A sandwich and they said the spices are: “black pepper, paprika, and mustard” and confirmed that this is the complete list in this sandwich.

6. Paprika
CHICKEN COATING:
7. Enriched Bleached Wheat Flour – Heavily processed flour treated with bleach to quickly make it white. It has no nutritional value and is essentially dead food, so they “enrich” it with synthetic vitamins that are not from nature (6).
8. Sugar – Again, likely from GMO sugar beets.
9. Salt
10. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) – There wasn’t enough MSG added to the chicken itself, so they add it to the coating too.
11. Nonfat Milk
12. Baking Soda
13. Sodium Aluminum Phosphate – Stabilizer additive that contains aluminum, linked to neurological problems, and on EWG’s Dirty Dozen Additive Watch List (9).
14. Monocalcium Phosphate – Rising agent found in baking powder
15. Spice – This ingredient is listed twice in this sandwich.
16. Soybean Oil – One of the most unhealthy vegetable oils, known to increase the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases (6). It’s most likely made from GMO soybeans, which have been shown to contain high levels of residues from the herbicide glyphosate (Monsanto’s Roundup) compared to non-GMO soybeans. Glyphosate was deemed a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO). To extract the oil, the soybeans are typically subjected to intensive chemical refining with toxic hexane, bleach, and deodorizers (6).
17. Color (Paprika)
18. Water
19. Nonfat Milk
20. Egg
21. Fully Refined Peanut Oil – A heavily processed oil that is treated with bleach and deodorizing chemicals. All of the heat and processing that it goes through creates free radicals (10) – which are renegade molecules that damage cells in the body, triggering a host of diseases from liver damage (11) to cancer (12). Peanut oil is also very high in omega-6 fatty acids which promote harmful inflammation in the body.
22. Dimethylpolysiloxane – The main ingredient in Silly Putty is used as an anti-foaming agent in their cooking oil. This substance was also commonly used as a filler fluid in breast implants, which is being phased out due to safety concerns, but supposedly it’s “safe” to eat (6). It also can be preserved by formaldehyde according to the FDA.
BUN:
23. Enriched Wheat Flour – Refined wheat flour in which the healthy part of the wheat is removed. The refining process removes most of the fiber, vitamin E, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, and B vitamins from the wheat. Some synthetic vitamins (not from nature) are added back in to “enrich” it (6).
24. Water
25. Sugar – This is the 3rd time refined sugar is added, this time in the bun. There are 5 grams of sugar in the entire sandwich – equivalent to eating about one heaping teaspoon of sugar.
26. Yeast
27. Soybean Oil – The 2nd time this unhealthy oil is found in this sandwich, and it will show up again.
28. Wheat Gluten – This additive is an isolated form of gluten, which is already present in the wheat flour used in the buns. It’s added to improve texture.
29. Salt
30. Cultured Wheat Flour
31. Vinegar – Likely made from GMO corn like most white vinegar in the U.S.
32. Calcium Sulfate – Also known as “plaster of paris”, this ingredient is used in some breads for many reasons, commonly as a dough conditioner/strengthener (13).
33. Monoglycerides – An emulsifier made from oil byproducts including partially hydrogenated canola and soybean oils – which contain artificial trans fat, making this additive a potential source of trans fat. Even trace amounts of trans fat are considered harmful to the heart (6).

34. DATEM – Another potential source of trans-fat, this dough conditioner is usually derived from soybean or canola oil (GMO crops) (6).
35. Calcium Propionate – Considered a safer preservative, but research published in the Journal of Pediatric Child Health links it to “irritability, restlessness, inattention and sleep disturbance in some children” and long term consumption has been shown to damage the stomach lining and induce ulcers (6). 

36. Ascorbic/Citric Acid – Although citric acid is naturally found in lemon and other fruits, the additive form is typically derived from mold made with GMO corn. Ascorbic acid is the synthetic form of vitamin C typically derived from corn too.
37. Enzymes
38. Soy Lecithin – Another super processed additive that comes from GMOs. Just like the soybean oil, it’s extracted from GMO soybeans with the neurotoxin hexane (14).
39. Potassium Iodate – This additive is banned from flour in Europe and several more countries as it can negatively affect thyroid function (15) but in the U.S. it can be used as a maturing agent in dough.
BUN OIL
40. Soybean Oil – That buttery-looking substance on their buns is not butter at all. Instead of real butter, Chick-Fil-A uses oils that are colored and flavored to taste and look like butter. Unhealthy soybean oil is the main ingredient.
41. Palm Kernel Oil – This semi-solid oil is used by the industry as a trans-fat-free replacement for partially hydrogenated oils (which were recently banned). Unfortunately, not only is it unhealthy for the body, but the cultivation of it is killing orangutans and destroying rainforests (16). This ingredient should be banned.
42. Soy Lecithin – The 2nd time this processed emulsifier is found in this sandwich.
43. Natural Flavor – The only difference between natural and artificial flavors, is that natural flavors are derived from things found in nature. Natural flavors are a proprietary mixture of chemicals and each flavor may contain up to 100 ingredients, including sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol (none of which are labeled) (17).
44. Beta Carotene – A yellow color additive derived either from vegetables or synthesized in a lab from chemicals (18). This makes their “buttery” spread look yellow.
PICKLES
UPDATE 3/11/22: Chick-fil-A quietly changed their pickles recently. The new pickles do not contain artificial colors (Yellow 5, Blue 1), Alum, or Polysorbate 80. New Pickle Ingredients as of 3/11/22: Cucumbers, Water, Vinegar, Salt, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate [Preservative], Turmeric Extract [Color], Natural Flavor, Dill Pickle Spice, Beta Carotene [Color], Garlic Emulsion.
45. Cucumbers
46. Water
47. Vinegar
48. Salt
49. Alum – This ingredient used to make the pickles more firm is comprised of aluminum (a neurotoxin) which can build up in your body over time (19).
50. Calcium Chloride – Another additive used to make pickles more firm.
51. Potassium Sorbate –This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer (20).
52. Natural Flavor – The 2nd time this proprietary ingredient is added to this sandwich.
53. Polysorbate 80 – An emulsifier linked to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems (21).
54. Yellow 5 – Artificial dye derived from petroleum that is linked to allergies and hyperactivity in children. Artificial dyes have been found to be contaminated with carcinogens, such as benzidine (6). This is used to brighten up the color of the pickles, but simple turmeric could be used instead.
55. Blue 1 – One of the worst artificial dyes because it has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. This dye is also linked to hyperactivity and an increased risk of kidney tumors. Some research suggests it is a potential neurotoxin (6).
Does Chick-fil-A really need all these risky and artificial ingredients to make one delicious tasting sandwich??? Of course not. Most of these ingredients cut costs and make their food addicting so we keep coming back for more. This all means more money in their pocket, which comes at a great expense of our health if we continue to eat there.

When I heard Chick-fil-A say their Mac & Cheese is a  “classic” blend of cheddar, Parmesan and Romano… I didn’t believe it for one second.
It’s mostly made out of “Pasteurized Processed Cheese Spread” – which is like that cheese in a can.
This is NOT real cheese. It’s made by mixing and heating cheese together with colors, emulsifiers, whey, salt and preservatives. This makes a “cheese food” like product that doesn’t separate when heated or get moldy as fast as real cheese.
Then they blend this FAKE cheese with FAKE butter… “Margarine”.
Margarine is made by heavily processing vegetable oils so that they’re solid at room temperature. Since partially hydrogenated oils were banned by the FDA (due to trans fats that are horrible for the heart) the food industry has found out how to skirt by this issue by blending unhealthy refined oils with “mono- and diglycerides” and palm oil.
I can only imagine how many kids are going to be eating this Mac & Cheese along with chicken nuggets.

When I examined the ingredients in the Chick-fil-A Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Grilled Cool Wrap, I still found soybean oil, yeast extract (alternative form of MSG), and natural flavors.

The chicken on their salads is spiked with MSG, unhealthy refined oils, flavors, and more preservatives. Those colorful chips on top are artificially colored with Red 40 and Blue 1. Why can’t they just use uncolored chips?
The cheese comes with a side order of “powdered cellulose” (i.e. wood), which keeps the shredded cheese from sticking together but is also linked to weight gain and digestive problems (22).

What COULD be a super healthy menu item – kale and broccoli – is ruined with the addition of yeast extract (a form of MSG), natural flavors, synthetic preservatives, and unhealthy oils (soybean and canola). It even rings in with over 30 ingredients – many of them completely unnecessary. Chick-fil-A really missed the mark here.

I’d order their Market Salad without the chicken, nuts, granola, or dressing, as that is where most of the unhealthy ingredients are in this item. Or maybe the Superfood Side without the unhealthy dressing and toppings, which just leaves me with kale and broccoli. But… we both know that’s not going to happen – it’s just as easy for me to just make a salad at home and no one is forcing me to eat there. And, who really wants to go to Chick-fil-A and not have their chicken?!?
I figured out how to make a “Chick-fil-A sandwich” at home that tastes exactly the same (even better, seriously!) with none of the nasty preservatives, dyes, and MSG. Ok, yes, it takes a bit more effort than standing in line at Chick-fil-A, but it’s actually pretty simple to make and you can even enjoy it on Sunday!
If you know anyone in a serious love affair with Chick-fil-A, please share this blog post with them. Who knows, maybe they’ll surprise you with a deliciously organic homemade “Chick-fil-A” sandwich next time you see them!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/the-key-to-feeling-happy-isnt-what-you-thought-this-makes-all-the-difference-organic-vitamin-d3/,The key to feeling happy isn’t what you thought. This makes all the difference! (Organic Vitamin D3),"Several years ago I worked in a corporate office environment and lived in a city condo. I’d wake up, walk down to the indoor gym in my condo, and then drive from one below-ground parking garage to another. I literally NEVER went outside. Then I’d work all day in a building that had tunnels to get to various lunch spots. The next day I’d do it all over again…again.
After awhile I noticed that I just didn’t feel like myself and was starting to feel depressed. I’ve always felt it’s important to trust your intuition and listen to your body. Because if you don’t, who will? So, I went in to get some blood work done and my doctor told me that my vitamin D levels were low. This made perfect sense! You see, exposing yourself to sunlight every day is a primary way to keep your vitamin D levels up. And since I was basically hiding inside all day long, my vitamin D levels to PLUMMETED.
Even if you don’t work in an office, this could be happening to you too. Experts say over 1 billion people today don’t get enough vitamin D and if you don’t get enough, you may feel:
And since it’s tough to get a good quality Vitamin D supplement in a form that’s easy to take and absorb, we decided it was time for Truvani to step in to help. Watch the video to see how and why Truvani created the best Vitamin D supplement available today:

Your body CAN get vitamin D from exposure to sunlight. However, expert’s opinions vary when it comes to how much time you need to spend outside, and how much of your skin needs to be exposed. Other factors like the time of the year, where you live, and the color of your skin also affect how much time you need to spend in the sun to get the D that your body needs.
The bottom line is:
It’s not as easy as you might think – particularly with more and more of us working indoors and slathering ourselves with sunscreen, which blocks UV rays.
But don’t worry, you can get all of the crucial vitamin D that your body needs, by taking Truvani’s Sunshine in a Bottle Organic Vitamin D3 Supplement.

Supplementation is the easiest way to get your body the vitamin D that it needs. Truvani’s 100% vegan Vitamin D3 is unlike regular old vitamin D supplements. Ours is created using algae-like plants called lichens. These lichens accumulate D3 as they grow, and gets extracted at the source to ensure maximum freshness and potency.
So if you’re living life like I was…
Or experiencing any of the symptoms listed above… and perhaps your doctor has even recommended vitamin D…
You need a good source of this potent vitamin.
With Truvani’s Bottled Sunshine, you’ll experience the benefits of the “sunshine vitamin”, regardless of the weather.
Or lack of weather (lol)
So, if you’re ready to stop living your life in a fog and ready to brighten up your days…

https://foodbabe.com/why-you-shouldnt-rely-on-orange-juice-for-vitamin-c/,Why you shouldn’t rely on orange juice for Vitamin C,"One of my favorite things to do is take my daughter Harley to music class…
She’s 2 1/2, so this is a fun time for her to get some social skills and meet other kids. But meeting new kids comes with meeting new germs that can be tough for her immune system to handle. Of course, I wash Harley’s hands before and after class, but DURING class things get a little tricky. Especially when a little 6-month-old decides to drool all over the drum Harley wants to play with… RIGHT BEFORE Harley decides to rub her face. Perfect.
As a mom – you can see it all unfold right in front of your eyes in slow motion. You don’t even have time to grab a wipe and before you know it, her immune system can’t cope and she ends up getting sick. And then it spreads…
I get sick… my husband gets sick… it’s a vicious cycle.
When I was sick as a child, my mom would give me orange juice. It’s a great source of vitamin C and good for your immune system, right? Well, not quite. Watch this video to see why orange juice isn’t the best way to get your vitamin C and what we now use instead…

Orange juice does have vitamin C, and it can help support our immune system. But, nowadays, most people don’t get Vitamin C from oranges. We fill our bodies with vitamin C supplements made from Synthetic Vitamin C. Isn’t it about time we started thinking about what we get our vitamin C from?
First of all, shouldn’t it be REAL?
Believe me, you don’t want your vitamins made in a lab. Synthetic vitamin C is made from ascorbic acid, and not only is this form difficult for the body to absorb, it can even upset your stomach. Why feel better in one way and feel awful in another? That’s like curing a headache with a nosebleed.
Second, shouldn’t it be STRONG?
Most people think oranges have the most vitamin C, when in fact, they are super low on the list. Oranges are like most politicians. A lot of promise. No delivery. Other fruits and vegetables aren’t that much higher, and you’d need to eat A LOT of them to get enough vitamin C.
But, there is ONE that’s higher in Vitamin C than them all…
The Amla Berry.
And after months of research and development, I’m so excited to share with you…
Truvani’s Immuno-C: An organic Vitamin C supplement made from organic amla berries.

The majority of the top vitamin C supplements on Amazon are synthetic and most “real food” supplements use less expensive ingredients, such as conventional citrus fruits. Truvani’s Immuno-C supplement was created with organic amla berries because they’re the only fruit that can retain their potency through the drying process and deliver the highest concentration of vitamin C. In fact, fresh amla juice contains 20 times as much vitamin C as is present in orange juice. Who knew right?
And EVERYONE needs some help in the immune support department… Vitamin C is key for giving yourself a fighting chance against the immune compromising condition known as “daily life”.

https://foodbabe.com/tired-anxious-and-irritable-the-one-thing-missing-from-your-health-routine/,"Tired, anxious, and irritable? The ONE thing missing from your health routine!","Back when I was working my high-powered corporate job, I was a mess. I wasn’t eating well. I was full of anxiety and stress.
I DEFINITELY wasn’t sleeping well. And I got very irritated by the smallest things too. Actual footage of me screaming into a pillow at night after work…





You’ve probably been there too…
You know, those times when you’re staring at the computer screen and can’t concentrate. Those times you’re banging your head against the wall, trying to remember something. And how about those times that you get a little too heated while talking to a loved one. We have ALL been there! And, you know where much of this irritability and frustration comes from?
Lack of sleep.
So what can you do when you find yourself unable to face the day?
More Coffee?
You’ve already had two cups and are starting to twitch.
A Sugary Snack?
You don’t need that junk.
These solutions only help treat the symptoms and NOT the cause. You’re tired. And a good day begins with GOOD sleep. So why not start there?
Prioritizing sleep is how I got out of my funk – and you can too. Watch this to see how I “sleep like a baby”, each and every night:


Magnesium is a naturally occurring mineral that is an extremely important nutrient for the human body. In fact, it handles over 300 reactions in your body. Sounds pretty important right? Especially since 70-80% of the American population is deficient in magnesium!
Since food has become the massive mono-cultured travesty that it is, our fruits and veggies just don’t have as much magnesium in it as it did for past generations. We also lose magnesium when we sweat and use the bathroom… and a lot of people out there just don’t realize they’re losing magnesium at an alarming rate.
Truvani’s Mineral Magic Magnesium is sourced straight from the nutrient dense Dead Sea. Magnesium compounds from the waters of the Dead Sea are of superior quality with significantly low levels of heavy metals lead, arsenic, aluminum, and mercury.
Bottom line:
It’s got all the stuff you need, and not what you don’t.
Truvani’s Mineral Magic Magnesium can help ease anxiousness and quiet all of the swirling thoughts in your head. Imagine being able to erase the extensive to-do list that pops up as soon as you close your eyes.
You wouldn’t need a white noise machine, ear plugs, or even a sleep mask.
You could just put on your pjs, crawl under your cozy covers, and enjoy hours of uninterrupted sleep.
Sure, life may never stop coming at you…
But at least you’ll rest as best as you can.

https://foodbabe.com/are-you-a-victim-of-healthwashing-find-out-the-ways-food-companies-trick-you/,Are you a victim of healthwashing? (Find out the ways food companies trick you),"When I first started researching ingredients and food over 8 years ago, the industry was so different than it is now…
More people are aware of what’s in their food – we’re reading ingredient lists, juicing, taking supplements, and eating more real food. That’s why we’re now seeing a wave of new “healthy” products flooding the market as some food brands are hoping to cash in on the health food movement…
But some brands aren’t going about it the right way.
You’ve heard of greenwashing, right? That’s when a company makes their product appear more environmentally-friendly than it really is. Well, the same is happening to our food. Health-washing is EVERYWHERE.

“Health-washing” is when a food company adds synthetic and processed additives to food to make it appear healthier and more nutrient dense than it actually is. Food companies will also add specific labels to the packaging, which imply a product is healthier than it actually is.
They are targeting people like you with these products, people who care about their food and are trying to make the healthiest decisions. Health-washing is getting RAMPANT out there – that’s why you need to know how companies do this so you can protect yourself. Here are 6 ways food brands health-wash their products:


8Greens tells you it’s got “As much Vitamin C as 6 Oranges”… “As much Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) as 15 cups of Broccoli”… and “As much Vitamin B6 as 6 cups of Spinach”… but actually these nutrients in 8Greens are NOT coming from oranges, broccoli, or spinach. 8Greens adds in synthetic vitamins (i.e. artificial vitamins) that are made in a laboratory. Deceitful right?
“The eight greens themselves (spinach, wheatgrass, kale, blue green algae, spirulina, chlorella, barley grass and aloe vera) naturally contain vitamins, but we have added extra vitamins to make sure that 8Greens is a more effective supplement. These are those extra vitamins and minerals that you see added to our formula and listed on the nutrition label. These extra vitamins on the label are synthetic… Any naturally occurring vitamins are not listed and such breakdown isn’t available however our green proprietary blend is 686 mg per tablet.” – 8Greens Customer Support (June 2019)
Right on the package it says “Made from Real Greens” but really the majority of the product is coming from synthetic vitamins. How much actual “greens” are you feasibly eating in that small 8Greens pill? You’d be getting a lot more by drinking a green smoothie, I can tell you that much! Products like this make consumers feel like they are getting their daily greens, but in reality, it is just a high-priced synthetic vitamin supplement.
Now, you might be thinking this doesn’t matter. All vitamins are healthy, right? Not if they are made in a lab from a variety of questionable sources like coal tar, petroleum and GMOs. Lab-created vitamins differ from their natural counterpart, and thus aren’t often believed to be absorbed by your body as well as naturally present vitamins that you get from whole food and supplements with vitamins derived naturally from whole foods (1). Natural vitamins still contain cofactors that aid in absorption and bioavailability – enzymes, bioflavonoids, minerals, etc. Real food and natural vitamins are always best.
Here’s another example…
Good Health Veggie Pretzels look like snack-time gold! Right there on the package, they tell you you’re getting the same amount of Vitamin A as 2 ½ cups of broccoli… the Vitamin C in 3 ½ beets… the Vitamin E in 5 tomatoes… the Vitamin B6 in 7 cups spinach… and the Vitamin K in 2 carrots. Wow – sounds like you’ll be eating a ton of produce, huh? Nope. Turns out they are playing the same dirty trick as 8Greens by just adding all those synthetic vitamins in to make it look like you are getting nutrients from real food. MAJOR FAIL.

Adding probiotics to a Double Chocolate Muffin full of sugar doesn’t make it better for you. It’s widely known that sugar destroys good gut bacteria (2)… and sugar is literally the first ingredient in these FlapJacked Double Chocolate Mighty Muffins, essentially negating benefits that you might be getting from the probiotics added.
The FDA is not regulating how much (if any) actual living probiotics are in products like this (3). Probiotics are fragile living organisms that are typically killed by heat, so the type FlapJacked uses is heat-resistant designed to survive heavy processing (4)… but that doesn’t mean I’m not skeptical that nuking a Mighty Muffin in the microwave on high (their recommended cooking method) isn’t going to kill many of the probiotics. They claim the microwaved muffins have been tested and contain live probiotics. Either way – Wouldn’t you rather get your probiotics from healthy fermented foods and high quality probiotic supplements than from sugary processed muffins? There are much healthier and cost-effective ways to get your probiotics in each day and this is just one way food companies try to “health-ify” junky food.
There’s no doubt that organic food is the safest choice and I’m a huge advocate of organic farming. That being said… some organic brands make some really unhealthy products. This is where the organic label can be a bit deceptive. Many people equate “organic” with “healthy” – but that is not always the case. Even worse – I often see the most unhealthy organic products made especially for babies and children. Shouldn’t they be starting out with the healthiest food? If you find yourself assuming organic products are healthy and buying them without reading the ingredients, just remember to repeat after me: The organic label does not mean a product is healthy…

Clif Bar Organic ZFruit Strawberry Snack is made with ZERO strawberries (maybe that is what the “Z” stands for? LOL).
To illustrate this… a Clif Bar ZFruit (made with apple puree concentrate and juice concentrate) contains 14 grams of sugar and less than 1 gram of fiber. They add in synthetic Vitamin C (ascorbic acid). If you were to eat 1⁄2 cup real strawberries instead, you’d eat only 4 grams of sugar with about 2 grams of fiber – and lots of valuable vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients. This is why whole fruit is best.

Stonyfield says YoBaby is “Made with only organic whole milk and the kind of ingredients you would use yourself” – Ummm not true. I wouldn’t add refined white sugar and “natural” flavors to yogurt…especially if I was feeding it to my baby (6). It’s super simple to add “flavor” to plain grass-fed yogurt at home by stirring in some mashed berries or bananas…YUM…and no sugar needed.
UPDATE 8/29/19 – I received the following from Stonyfield in response to this investigation:
“We saw your recent post regarding natural flavors and organic sugar in our YoBaby Vanilla yogurt and I wanted to send along some additional information for context.
All of the natural flavors we use in our products are always derived exclusively from natural sources like spices, fruits or fruit juices, vegetables or vegetable juices, and plants. We choose our suppliers very carefully to make sure that they are as committed as we are to producing natural flavors without the use of any artificial components.
Regarding sugar, the sugar we do add is organic sugar, because we never use artificial ingredients and would never use artificial sweeteners – both of which are not allowed with organic as you know. Maybe most importantly, we do offer three lines of baby yogurt that have zero added sugar – our YoBaby Banana Mango, YoBaby Purple Carrot /Sweet Potato, and YoBaby plain. We feel it’s important to offer several flavors and plain, all without added sugar.
We care about the amount of sugar that people consume, including in our yogurts. In fact, this is why we reduced sugar across our entire portfolio, starting with our Kids brand in 2017. Stonyfield Kids yogurt has up to 40% less than the leading kids brand of yogurt. You can read more here: https://www.stonyfield.com/organic/healthy/sugar-reduction
Ultimately though we offer the choice to the consumer, and offer almost 100 different organic products. And, for those who do want to restrict their sugar intake, we offer plain versions of our nonfat, lowfat, whole milk and Greek yogurt without any added sugar in addition to the YoBaby yogurts I mentioned above.
I hope this helps provide a bit more context for you! We greatly respect the work you do to educate consumers around the world about their food choices, and we want to make sure you were up to date with information around our yogurts.”

Little Duck Organics Fig Bars are the perfect example of how some organic brands make healthy products, while also making some not so healthy ones. I’ve bought products by Little Duck before, but I wouldn’t buy these. When you look closely at the ingredient list you’ll find 4 types of added sugar before any actual blueberries or kale (Brown Rice Syrup, Dried Cane Juice, Concentrated Apple Juice, Coconut Palm Sugar) along with unhealthy refined canola oil and lots of processed flours/starches (1). You’ve got to wonder how much blueberry and kale are really in these too – I bet it’s negligible. On the other hand, Little Duck also makes “Tiny Fruits” that are simply 100% freeze-dried organic fruit that I buy for my daughter Harley as a little snack to have on trips or when we go out to an event.

Taking a super unhealthy product and adding extra protein to it does not transform it into a health food – especially when it’s soy protein isolate. When soy is isolated to just its protein state, it becomes severely denatured and can cause hormonal disruptions because of the excessive amount of estrogen contained in it (1). Soy also contains an abundance of phytic acid, which leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body. Plus – over 90% of the soy produced in this country is GMO and contaminated with Roundup herbicide. Kellogg’s Special K Protein Cereal is also spiked with refined sugar, fake flavors, and BHT (a preservative linked to cancer)(7) – not a good protein-packed way to begin your mornings. Try a healthy green protein smoothie instead!

Protein-infused Protein20 water looks like a health supplement, but it’s sweetened with one of the worst sweeteners out there – Sucralose (aka Splenda). This artificial sweetener is linked to leukemia and other blood cancers in animal studies (1). It’s also been shown that artificial sweeteners like Sucralose are doing little to help people lose weight and are actually linked to weight gain (1).
The type of protein in these is another popular protein supplement – conventional whey protein isolate – which is highly processed. Most whey protein isolates start from ultra-pasteurized “Monsanto Milk” raised on GMOs, antibiotics, and other drugs. This milk is then exposed to acid processing, which strips out alkalizing minerals and naturally occurring vitamins and lipids. This processing makes whey protein isolate overly acidifying in the body. And, chronically consuming whey protein isolate without appropriate balance of alkalizing foods can acidify your body, which over time can increase your vulnerability to degenerative disease.

Despite that big strawberry on the cup, there is not one strawberry in there. “Two Good” yogurt by Dannon is extra processed to remove natural sugars in the milk and then flavored and colored to look and taste like there is fruit in it – but it’s all fake. They also add thickeners (tapioca starch, gellan gum) to replace some texture lost from all that processing. Natural flavors used to make it taste like fruit are not actually “natural” at all (6). These fake flavors are made in a lab to mimic the taste of fruit and are designed to keep you coming back to eat more. As explained by flavor manufacturer Nature’s Flavors, “The trick to making a product taste good is to give the customer only enough flavor to tease their taste buds. You never want to completely satisfy their tastes” (8). Do you really want to eat fake flavors that were manufactured to keep you unsatisfied and wanting more, or would you rather just eat real fruit and all the nutrients that come with it?


Sara Lee and BFree say their products are good sources of fiber, but they add cellulose to artificially pump up the fiber content. The type of cellulose that food companies typically use is made from wood. Cellulose is much cheaper to obtain from wood than fruits and vegetables, and is manipulated in a laboratory to form different structures (liquid, powder, etc) depending upon the food product it is used in (9). According to the Center For Science In The Public Interest, cellulose is a cheap way to boost the fiber content on food labels, but it isn’t as healthful as fiber that comes from natural foods (10). Recent research links this additive to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems (11). Get your fiber from whole grains, fruits & veggies instead.
We’re not gonna add probiotics to sugary snacks…

https://foodbabe.com/everyone-needs-one-of-these-in-their-kitchen-i-use-mine-every-day/,Everyone needs one of these in their kitchen. (I use mine every day!),"You may have heard some of the public outcry to ban plastic straws. Well, there’s definitely something to it…
In America alone, we use over 500 million plastic straws each day. That’s A LOT of waste. Plus these straws are made using potentially toxic petrochemicals. One study showed that a third of the tested plastic products released toxic substances. And it gets worse. These toxins leached out of the plastic samples when exposed to organic substances. In other words, the toxins come out when contacting our food.
And if you’re like me… You DO NOT want to use anything toxic in your food. Or home.
Fortunately, the world is moving away from plastic straws. In fact, California has become the first state to outright ban plastic straws from restaurants. That’s a BIG win.
So, what other options do we have?
Well, some restaurant chains are offering paper straws… but have you ever used a paper straw? THEY’RE HORRIBLE! They seemingly disintegrate in liquid.
Then, there are these collapsible metal straws. They seem like an O.K choice… Until you realize that option it’s VERY difficult to ensure cleanliness (due to the opaque metal, you can’t see inside easily).
Then you have my favorite option: A sleek, modern, glass straw.


I love these because they are see-through, which makes checking cleanliness a breeze (They also come with a handy cleaning brush). And they’re surprisingly sturdy… Harley uses them to drink her green smoothies too!

I use one each morning when I drink water with fresh squeezed lemon and cayenne pepper. I also like using them in smoothies because it’s wider than a normal straw, which makes drinking thicker beverages a breeze. Each time I use mine it puts a smile on my face knowing I’m not ingesting toxins or other nasty pollutants. Plus, it’s a great feeling to begin each day with an environmentally-conscious choice.
This is one of the reasons why we offer these remarkable smoothie straws at Truvani… and today we’re offering a special deal on them.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/need-motivation-to-change-your-diet-see-what-she-did-lost-100-pounds/,Need motivation to change your diet? See what she did (lost 100 pounds),"I receive countless emails each year from people who’ve lost significant weight and dramatically improved their health when they stopped eating processed food… but this email that I’m sharing with you today simply Blew. Me. Away.
“I have been disabled for 23 years and even had a wheelchair, a cane, and was mostly bedbound. I have diabetes, fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, depression, anxiety, and used to have sleep apnea. I started doing research into my food and health. I read a lot about what FoodBabe said and cut the toxins from my food, started changing my diet, and trying to walk a little every day. I have been able to lose over 100lbs, get off of most of the meds that I was on including methadone which was killing me and gave me central sleep apnea as well as obstructive apnea. I was able to wean off it and with the weight loss got rid of sleep apnea altogether. I brought my diabetic a1c test down from 7.9 to 5.6. I have 50 more lbs to lose and hope that I can get off insulin then. I am on a fraction of the insulin I used to be on, no more psych meds, and now I am able to work part-time with other people with disabilities. Thank you, Food Babe, for the information you gave that helped me change my life for the better.” ~ Kimberly W.


Go, Kimberly, Go!
Isn’t her story inspiring? This is what happens when you stop letting the food industry dictate how you eat.
Instead of looking for that next diet “challenge” or “skinny” shake to help you fit into your swimsuit this summer, you only need to make one simple change…
Stop eating processed food.
That is it. I promise on all of the green juice in the world that when you stop eating processed food and get back eating homemade food that you prepare yourself with the best ingredients, you will make incredible changes.
That is because the big food industry isn’t looking out for you. They don’t care if you get cancer or develop an unhealthy addiction to their product. They don’t care if you can’t lose weight or struggle to keep your energy up during the day. They are in the business of making money and are selling you empty promises they can’t keep.
In my latest book, Feeding You Lies (only ~$15 on Amazon right now), I walk you through a 48-Hour Toxin Takedown that helps you rid toxic processed foods from your pantry and your life. I developed this simple detox meal plan to supercharge your health in a short amount of time. You’ll avoid chemical onslaughts from food, end your sugar and processed food addictions, maximize your detox powers, and rejuvenate your energy levels. The best part? You’ll learn how to never diet again!

https://foodbabe.com/my-saving-grace-in-combatting-pollen-allergies/,My Saving Grace In Combating Pollen Allergies,"The news shared this photo of the pollen over Durham, North Carolina (not far from where I live) and yikes… just looking at it makes my lungs hurt…

They are calling this green cloud a “pollenpocalypse” – which is kinda funny, but seriously – all of this pollen is no joke to anyone suffering from seasonal allergies. And it’s not just the pollen in the air making us feel bad…
These substances lead to headaches, poor sleep, hormone imbalances, lethargy, and have been linked to a greater risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and cancer. Your air quality may be affecting your health right under your nose. Take this short quiz below to find out.
Do you…
One place that I can control the quality of my air is in my home. I use a high quality air purifier (made by my partner Intellipure). Ever since I started using it I’ve slept better and don’t suffer from seasonal allergies – even during this pollenpocalypse!
The Intellipure is the most effective air purifier on the market. Here’s why I love it:
As I always want to share with you what works for me, my team was able to negotiate a special deal just for the Food Babe Army:
Even if I’m eating the purest, most organic food in the world and drinking the cleanest filtered water around, I know that the air I breathe is just as important! If I wouldn’t drink unfiltered water, why would I breathe unfiltered air?
If you can’t get an Intellipure right now, other ways you can protect the air around you is to thoroughly dust surfaces in your home with a damp cloth, mop floors, and vacuum often. Also get some indoor plants, which help to purify the air. I hope that we all get some relief from all of this pollen soon!

https://foodbabe.com/is-hormel-is-scamming-people-with-their-100-natural-deli-meat/,Scam alert…You could be eating SPAM meat,"Think back to the last time you were grocery shopping for meat. What labels did you look for? Are those 100% natural, hormone-free, antibiotic-free, and nitrate-free meats really the best choice or are you being SCAMMED?
Unfortunately a lot of people are getting totally scammed…
Food companies are legally allowed to put misleading labels on their products to fool customers. To see how screwed up regulations are when it comes to meat labels, look no further than a recent lawsuit against Hormel. They got sued by the Animal Legal Defense Fund who alleged the advertising for Hormel’s Natural Choice Deli Meats was misleading consumers (1). They argued that Hormel advertises this deli meat as “100% Natural” but raises the meat in factory farms with risky drugs and antibiotics. That is FAR from natural, right? Hormel shouldn’t be allowed to advertise this meat as “natural”, right?
Actually they can. Last week, the court dropped the lawsuit (Hormel won!) because they found that the claims they are making about their deli meat, such as “100% Natural” are legally approved by the USDA (in other words, our government allows it) – so Hormel is free to use these terms in both their advertising and packaging even though this meat is raised on antibiotics and growth-promoting drugs in a factory farm (2).
A big surprise in court filings revealed that the pork used to make Hormel’s Natural Choice Ham Deli Meat is the same pork they use to make SPAM (3). This pork is raised in inhumane large-scale factory farms where the pigs dine on GMO grains laced with growth-promoting drugs to bulk them up on less food (which bulks up Hormel’s profits too).


Insane, right? How could this be?
It’s shocking because of the way Hormel advertises this deli meat. They even call it the “NATURAL CHOICE” right there in the name! Products like this disgust me because they are preying on consumers who are trying to feed their families healthy food but don’t know that food companies are allowed to use labels that are not really truthful.
To see how Hormel has been able to scam so many people into believing their Natural Choice deli meat is a healthy choice, let’s look closely at the labels on this package…

“100% Natural”: Companies can call their meat “Natural” if it has no artificial ingredients and is minimally processed. Natural meat is often raised in the same horrible factory farm conditions that conventional meat is – with antibiotics, hormones, ractopamine, GMO feed, etc. This is why it’s perfectly legal for Hormel to call their meat natural – but that doesn’t mean it’s ethical for them to do so! Remember this applies to fresh meat too (not just deli meats).
“Pork Raised Without Added Hormones”: This label infuriates me. Why? Because pork farmers are not allowed to use hormones – it is prohibited (4). This means that all pork and ham are raised without added hormones (the same goes for chicken & turkey). So, why does Hormel add this label to their pork and turkey? It is 100% pure marketing B.S. They know that the average customer sees this as a sign that their meat is somehow raised better, but it literally means NOTHING. They do use hormones to raise their beef as regulations allow this, and this is why you won’t find this label on Hormel’s Natural Choice Deli Roast Beef.
The lawsuit revealed that some of Hormel’s pigs are raised with the growth-promoting drug ractopamine (5). This drug is BANNED in Europe, Russia, and China and causes pigs to suffer from “hyperactivity, trembling, broken limbs, inability to walk and death” (6). Using ractopamine is just as bad, if not worse, than growth hormones… so don’t be fooled!
“No Nitrates or Nitrites Added”: This is misleading because technically nitrates are added. You see, Hormel doesn’t add synthetic sodium nitrate or nitrite like you’ll find in most deli meats – which is good because these additives are linked to cancer and heart disease (7). Instead they use cultured celery powder and cherry powder, which are both naturally high in nitrates (8). There is controversy surrounding whether naturally-derived nitrates are any safer for you when added processed meat, because they may still create cancerous nitrosamines (9). Some “natural” processed meat products with celery powder have been shown to contain very high levels of nitrates – even more than conventional varieties (10).
“No Preservatives”: Hormel does use cultured celery powder and cherry powder to preserve the meat, so I wouldn’t consider this preservative-free.
Some brands to try: Kol Foods Oven Roasted Turkey, Organic Nuna, Organic Valley Turkey or Roast Beef, and True Story Organic Turkey.
Yes, these organic deli meats may cost more than conventional deli meats raised in factory farms. But rather than judge the value of food in terms of dollars, think of its value in terms of nutrition – and your health. The only way factory farm practices will change is when enough people refuse to buy meat that was raised this way.

https://foodbabe.com/they-just-banned-this-chemical-in-europe-but-its-still-used-on-american-food/,"They just banned this chemical in Europe, but it’s still used on American food.","Have you ever traveled to Europe and noticed how different their food is compared to America?  I’ve had friends tell me…
“I can eat bread only when I’m in France”
“I lost 10 pounds eating whatever I wanted while in Europe, but came home and gained it right back”.

Our food is filled with things not on the label… like pesticides, hormones, and drugs that aren’t in the food in Europe.
Why is their food so much better?
Europe takes a precautionary approach towards food safety (1). This means they are proactive in banning chemicals that MIGHT harm people. The U.S. takes the opposite approach. It does not ban chemicals from our food supply until they have been PROVEN dangerous – which can take a very long time because it’s filled with industry influence or people have to start dying from long term exposure – as was the case with trans fats (2). This makes Americans literally the lab rats while the food and chemical industries rake in the profits at the expense of our health.
They banned it after a scientific review found it possibly causes DNA damage (which can lead to cancer) and also to steep declines in bumblebees. This fungicide is used on wheat and barley crops, as well as some fruits and vegetables. The USDA has found residues primarily on cucumbers, celery, summer squash, peaches, and berries in recent years (wheat and barley haven’t been tested for chlorothalonil) (4).
The good news? This fungicide is NOT used on organic crops and the USDA hasn’t found residues of it on organic foods tested (4).
In my latest book, Feeding You Lies, I show you simple ways to avoid the chemical onslaught on our food, despite all of the lies on product pages like “natural”, “healthy”, and “diet”. You’ll see how to protect yourself from unhealthy foods that cause weight gain and health problems down the road.

https://foodbabe.com/food-labels-are-lying-to-you-spot-these-lies-on-the-package/,Food Labels Are LYING To You. Spot These Lies On The Package!,"Imagine the following scenario…
You’re grocery shopping and trying to find a safe cooking oil. You’ve been cleaning up your diet and want something healthy to saute all those veggies you’ve been eating. Since you’ve read my investigations, you know that canola, soybean, and other processed oils are out because they are ridiculously bad for you. You see a shelf lined with cooking sprays like PAM, and recall hearing that those aren’t healthy for you either, until you see this one…

It says simply “100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil” right there on the front of the can.
100% means 100%, right?
So you think, “Bam! This is perfect! It contains just 100% olive oil without any nasty unhealthy additives”.
Smucker’s (the maker of Crisco) has been sued for misleading the public into believing this cooking spray contains 100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil – because it simply isn’t true (1). This cooking spray actually contains Soy Lecithin, Dimethyl Silicone, and Propellant, which could be found discreetly listed on the ingredient label on the back of the can (which the average consumer doesn’t look at):
Soy Lecithin: This emulsifying additive is “produced by degumming crude soy oil extracted from soy flakes with hexane” (2). Hexane is the neurotoxin (3) that comes from gasoline production. It’s possible that some hexane remains in the finished product (4) and almost all toxicology research on hexane focuses on the industrial use and inhalation of hexane, so no one knows exactly how dangerous eating it is – but it surely isn’t healthy.
Dimethyl Silicone: This silicone ingredient is commonly used in lubricants and hydraulic fluids (2). Again, not much research has been done on what happens when we actually eat it.
Propellant: This is used to propel the spray from the can, but it’s not simply compressed air. According to the lawsuit, the ingredient is “Propane and Isobutane, substances that are classified as ‘Hazardous Ingredients’ by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration” and Crisco is “violating state and federal law by refraining from disclosing the common or usual name” of these ingredients on the packaging (2). In other words, even the ingredient label is lying to you.
This just goes to show how far they were willing to go to mislead customers and didn’t change until they were caught and sued. It’s just so outrageous because when a product says that it’s 100% of something, don’t you think it should really be 100%?



I could go on. I can’t count how many times I’ve been shopping and found a product with a marketing claim on the front of the package that was so misleading that it was hardly true.

https://foodbabe.com/the-ultimate-guide-on-how-to-avoid-roundup-weed-killer-in-your-food/,The Ultimate Guide On How To Avoid Roundup Weed Killer In Your Food,"The other day I got an email from another concerned mom, “What are we supposed to eat when all of our food is contaminated with Roundup??!!!”
She had just heard the news…
Earlier this week, a federal jury unanimously determined Roundup weed killer is responsible for causing cancer (1). In this case, Edwin Hardeman claimed Roundup exposure caused his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and the jury has yet to award damages. This follows an earlier case in which Monsanto was ordered to pay $78.5 million in damages to a California man after a jury found them liable for failing to warn that Roundup causes cancer (2).
Despite the risk – Roundup is the most widely used herbicide in the world. It continues to be used on food crops, parks, playgrounds, and by homeowners everywhere. It is now so rampant in our environment that it has been found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies, crackers, oatmeal… the list goes on.
So, it’s pretty scary when you realize you are probably eating Roundup every day. Most Americans are. You’ve likely seen news headlines like these…
“Roundup Weed Killer Chemical Found in Cheerios and Quaker Oats, Researchers Say”
“Carcinogenic pesticide found in Ben & Jerry’s ice cream”
“Weedkiller found in granola and crackers, internal FDA emails show”
“Oat cereals, snack bars test positive for trace amounts of weed killer in Roundup”
“FDA Finds Monsanto’s Weed Killer In U.S. Honey”
“Cheerios, Kellogg’s Corn Flakes and Doritos among products found to contain GM crops WEEDKILLER that has possible link to cancer”
“Monsanto’s Roundup Found in 75% of Air and Rain Samples”
“FDA Tests Confirm Oatmeal, Baby Foods Contain Residues of Monsanto Weed Killer”
“Traces Of Weed Killer Linked To Cancer Found In 95% Of Wine And Beer”
It’s maddening to find out Roundup weed killer was found in your daughter’s favorite cereal, your baby’s food, and in the ice cream you like to treat yourself with on Saturday nights.
I dedicated an entire chapter to this subject in my latest book, Feeding You Lies, because this has become a major issue. In this chapter I explain how this happened, what foods we know are contaminated, and how to protect yourself.

Thankfully, there are ways to greatly reduce your exposure to Roundup, and I summarized my top strategies for you below.
You’ve probably heard organic food contains Roundup too, which is so disheartening. This is true to some extent, but has been overblown. I have gotten SO MANY emails about this, so I think you’ll be happy to hear that it’s not as bad as you may have heard.
For example, in 2018 the Environmental Working Group (EWG) tested popular oatmeal products for glyphosate and did not find ANY detectible levels in most of the organic products tested (3). Nature’s Path Organic Granola, Kashi Heart to Heart Organic Honey Toasted Cereal, Cascadian Farm Organic Harvest Berry Bars, 365 Organic Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats, and Simple Truth Organic Instant Oatmeal all came out clean (3).
In contrast, the EWG found glyphosate in EVERY non-organic product they tested. They detected glyphosate in only two organic brands – Nature’s Path Organic Old Fashioned Oats (at 30 ppb) and Bob’s Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned Rolled Oats (at 20 ppb) – which is negligible compared to how much glyphosate they found non-organic brands like Quaker Old Fashioned Oats (at 1300 ppb). EWG’s child-protective health benchmark for daily exposure to glyphosate in food is 160 ppb – and the organic foods all fall well below this range (3).
As you know, I don’t preach “the dose makes the poison” mantra, as I believe any amount of Roundup of our food is TOO MUCH – but based on the evidence I’ve seen so far, it looks like the vast majority of whole organic foods are not contaminated.
So, if you know anyone who is worried about all the Roundup being found in our food, please share this post with them. Isn’t it good to know there are ways for us to protect ourselves from this cancerous chemical?",Food Babe,Unknown

https://foodbabe.com/food-in-america-compared-to-the-u-k-why-is-it-so-different/,Food in America compared to the U.K. (Why is it so different?),"Want to know what really opened up my eyes to how food companies exploit us? I spent years investigating the differences between European and American food products, and what I found disgusted me.
A college buddy of mine decided to go live in London for a few years. While she was there, I often had her go to Tesco and other European grocery stores to take pictures of the ingredient lists for me and send me boxes of products. I’d compare them with the same brand of American products side-by-side and saw completely different ingredient lists.
Companies like Kraft-Heinz, Kellogg’s, PepsiCo, and Quaker sell safer, better products oversees while making inferior versions to sell to Americans. The evidence of this runs the gamut from fast food places to boxed cake mix to cereal to candy and even oatmeal— you can’t escape it. This is what set me down the path of advocating for change in the food system and I’ve never looked back.


Let’s start with McDonald’s French Fries. They make their iconic french fries in the U.K. with a few simple ingredients: potatoes, oil, dextrose, salt—but in the U.S they’re made with “natural beef flavor” and sodium acid pyrophosphate, and are fried in oil laced with the anti-foaming agent dimethylpolysiloxane – the main ingredient in silly putty (1).  They’ve somehow figured out how to cook their fries without all these extra ingredients overseas, so why not here?

Did you know Quaker Oats Strawberries & Cream has ZERO strawberries? In the U.S. Quaker mimics the look and taste of real strawberries by using “Flavored and Colored Fruit Pieces” comprised of dehydrated apples, artificial strawberry flavor, citric acid, and the artificial dye Red 40. It’s a total scam!
Meanwhile in the U.K. Quaker doesn’t even attempt to sell that garbage and doesn’t make any products like this. The closest counterpart they have is a product called “Oat So Simple” that has REAL strawberries in it—light years ahead of the popular U.S. version made with artificial dyes and artificial flavors.

Pick up a bottle of Mountain Dew in the U.K. and you’ll find that it gets its bright yellow color simply from beta carotene (a natural color derived from carrots and other plants). Meanwhile, PepsiCo sells a very different version of Mountain Dew in America. Here in the States, instead of using natural colors to give it a tantalizing look, Mountain Dew is artificially colored with a petroleum-based dye called Yellow #5. Although artificial dyes are common in America, that doesn’t make them okay to eat. They’ve been linked to several health issues and may be contaminated with carcinogens (2). They certainly are not as safe as beta carotene. And it gets worse…
The U.S. version of Mountain Dew contains brominated vegetable oil (BVO) – which is an ingredient BANNED in Europe (3). Way back in 2014, PepsiCo announced they would remove BVO from all of their American drinks following a successful petition by activist Sarah Kavanagh (4). But they still have not removed BVO from Mountain Dew, nearly 5 years later. Meanwhile, they continue to sell BVO-free Mountain Dew in other countries.
You know what you’ll find in almost every restaurant in America? Heinz Tomato Ketchup. Heinz ketchup is GMO-free in the U.K. (5) but full of GMOs and High Fructose Corn Syrup in the U.S., along with lab-produced “natural flavoring” that helps create an addiction to their product (6). Think of this next time you’re dipping your fries in and can’t stop! While Heinz makes a “Simply Heinz” version of ketchup in the U.S. (still with natural flavors but a cleaner ingredient list), why don’t they just make this their regular ketchup? There is no need for the heavily processed version that you’ll find in most restaurants and homes in America.

Both versions of Doritos are horrible, but American Doritos are covered in artificial dyes made from petroleum (Red #40, Blue #1, and Yellow #5). These dyes have been found to be contaminated with carcinogens, such as benzidine (2) In the U.K., these dyes require a warning label that says “May Have an Adverse Effect on Activity and Attention in Children” (7). No one wants to put that on their product! That’s why they don’t use artificial dyes in Doritos overseas and instead color Doritos more simply with paprika extract and annatto. The Doritos in the U.K. are also non-GMO, while the American versions are made with GMO corn contaminated with glyphosate weed killer (8).

At first glance the ingredients in Frosted Flakes in the U.S. and U.K. look nearly identical. The main difference is the addition of the preservative BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) in the U.S. version. Controversial research links BHT to cancer (9) and it’s believed to be an endocrine disruptor that interferes with your hormones (10) BHT isn’t permitted in cereals in Europe, so Kellogg’s reformulated their cereals to sell them legally overseas. Following our 2015 petition to get BHT out of American cereal (11) Kellogg’s removed BHT from several brands (like Rice Krispies), but still use it 4 years later in Frosted Flakes despite selling it BHT-free in the U.K.
I’ll tell you why. Europe takes a “precautionary principle” approach towards food additives that are potentially risky. They ban or add warning labels to these additives for their citizens. The U.S. takes the opposite approach. It does not remove additives from our food supply until they have been proven dangerous – which can take a very long time and a lot of red tape. This means Americans are literally the lab rats.
The U.S. government allows food companies to largely police itself, deciding which ingredients, chemicals, and additives are “safe” to use in their products (12). This clearly isn’t a wise approach – is it?
If a company can get away with using cheaper ingredients, they will. Given a choice, they’ll always opt for the cheaper flavor enhancer, and the cheaper color additive, and the cheaper preservative, and the cheaper GMO ingredient, even if these cheaper alternatives have a negative impact on our health.
I dedicated an entire chapter in my latest book, Feeding You Lies, to this subject because there is so much more you need to know! The food industry doesn’t care about your health, so you really need to. It is now available in bookstores everywhere.

https://foodbabe.com/watch-listen-how-the-food-industry-is-lying-to-us-and-what-to-do-about-it/,WATCH & LISTEN: How the food industry is lying to us (and what to do about it!),"The last few weeks have been a whirlwind! My daughter turned 2, and then we flew across the country to California to promote my new book Feeding You Lies, had a huge launch party here in Charlotte, was on the cover of a magazine, had a road trip to welcome a new baby nephew and do a talk/book signing in Charleston, SC, and have been on what feels like a million interviews.
These interviews and events have been crucial in getting the word out about how the food industry is lying to us and what we can do about it. The more people listen to them and share – the more we have the chance to change the world. So that’s why I am sharing some of my favorites here today…
If you want to know what makes me tick, why I became a food activist, and how I REALLY eat – grab some (organic) popcorn and listen in! And, I’d love to know your thoughts and questions – leave them in the comments below.
Can you guess what I had to practically sneak on the plane on my way to this interview? It’s a pretty funny story. I had a blast sitting down with Shawn to talk about my latest project too.

There’s something simple I ask myself before I sit down to eat… I share it all with Lewis Howes.
Seeing myself on the cover of a magazine is a strange feeling! In this interview I discuss my journey to health, how I started blogging, and some of the ways that the food industry dupes us. Best Self is offering Food Babe readers a free 1-year subscription on their mobile app.

I sat down with Lauryn and Michael to discuss what’s happening to food these days – and we had so much fun! After you listen in, let me know if you’d still eat McDonalds 😉

Dhru Purohit and I discuss how the media, big food, academia, and “trusted” sources silence activists like myself and how they are being exposed in my new book. I also walk you through exactly what I eat on a daily basis (and what my daughter eats too!) It might surprise you how simple it is.
We discuss how the non-GMO label isn’t all that it seems and how the food industry has made us believe that it’s complicated to eat healthy. Thankfully, it’s easier than it looks!

I had a great time sitting down with Kate Northrup and Mike Watts to discuss what’s going on behind the scenes in the food industry and why I had to write Feeding You Lies.

I absolutely loved this interview with Danny Zederman on the Armchair Nutritionist Podcast. We talked about tricky food labels, how the food industry dupes us into buying junk food, and my honest thoughts on the Keto diet.
In this interview with Ben Greenfield Fitness we discuss a new study that found eating phosphate additives (like the preservative sodium phosphate) can decrease your endurance and cardiovascular fitness level. You’ll find these additives in many fast foods like Taco Bell and McDonald’s, and processed food from the grocery store. The good news is it’s easy to spot on an ingredient list.

https://foodbabe.com/breaking-roundup-found-in-beer-wine-samples-see-the-brands/,BREAKING: Roundup found in beer & wine samples (See the brands),"We all know that alcoholic drinks are not a health food – and alcohol itself is linked to cancer. But, these new findings are just further evidence that this hazardous weed killer is ending up in almost everything that we eat and drink. How much weed killer are we each eating every day?
Breaking new tests conducted by the consumer interest group U.S. PIRG finds that many popular beer and wine brands are contaminated with – glyphosate (the main ingredient in Roundup).
Roundup is the most widely used weed killer in the world. In 2015, the World Health Organization’s cancer arm declared glyphosate a probable human carcinogen. Last year Monsanto lost a HUGE lawsuit filed by a California man with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma – the jury decided that Roundup caused his cancer and awarded him millions. This was the first of thousands of lawsuits filed.
The wine brands that tested positive for glyphosate are Beringer, Barefoot, Sutter Home, Inkarri Estates (organic), and Frey (organic). Sutter Home wine rang in with the most glyphosate at 51 ppb (parts per billion).
The wines that came out with the least amount of Roundup were both organic – Inkarri Estates Malbec Organic (5.3 ppb) and Frey Organic Natural White Blend (4.8 ppb).

(Source: U.S. PIRG report)

The beer brands that tested positive for glyphosate are Budweiser, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Sam Adams, Samuel Smith (organic), New Belgium, Corona, Heineken, Guinness, Stella Artois (beer and cider), Ace Perry, Sierra Nevada, and Tsingtao. The beer with the most glyphosate was Tsingtao at 49.7 ppb, followed by Coors Light, Miller Lite, Budweiser and Corona.



(Source: U.S. PIRG report)
I was a bit surprised seeing Samuel Smith’s organic beer coming up with some glyphosate in it. It’s worth noting that the organic beer and organic wine had the LOWEST amount on the list. This is because glyphosate is prohibited to be used on organic crops – and glyphosate in them is the result of contamination through water, rainwater, or drift from nearby crops. It wasn’t directly applied to their crops if they are certified organic.
Organic winery Frey Vineyards told USA Today that they do not use herbicides and “glyphosate in trace amounts is now found in rainwater because of its application to conventionally farmed agricultural land. Glyphosate in trace amounts can be found in many food products across the United States. We urge consumers to speak up to ban all use of glyphosate.“
The one brand tested by U.S. PIRG that had no detectible glyphosate was Peak Organic brand beer.

Even though Roundup is strongly linked to cancer, Roundup has NOT been banned. It continues to be used on food crops, parks, playgrounds, and by homeowners everywhere. Glyphosate is sprayed on 80% of crops in this country and is now so rampant in our environment that it’s found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies, air samples… the list goes on.
Just remember this… Monsanto/Bayer has tried to hide the dangers of Roundup from the public and regulators for years. Monsanto has colluded with regulators at the EPA – and the “safe levels” for glyphosate in our food were raised by the EPA at the request of Monsanto. Are we supposed to trust Monsanto that these levels are safe? If there is Roundup in everything that you eat and drink today, are you still consuming a “safe” level?
Critics say that scientists disagree with my work and that we should trust them because they are the real experts. They branded me “pseudoscience” because I avoid GMOs and conventional foods grown with glyphosate.
The truth is: Science is always evolving. It’s not always “settled” and it is riddled with industry corruption.
Just look at what Big Tobacco has done during the last 80 years, as they tried to hide the grave dangers of cigarette smoking from the public. Monsanto’s playbook is the same and they use many of the same tactics. Roundup is the new tobacco.
Internal emails published in Feeding You Lies show how many of these critics received money from Monsanto and Bayer. These companies enlist experts to spin the story on glyphosate and lie to the public about its dangers. They also enlist experts to discredit activists like myself who are telling the truth about their products. It’s disgusting.
If you want to know the TRUTH about how to avoid Roundup in your food and who is LYING about its dangers – you need to read Feeding You Lies!

https://foodbabe.com/fda-banned-ingredients-linked-to-cancer-but-they-are-still-all-over-shelves/,FDA banned ingredients linked to cancer – but they are still all over shelves,"I went into a news stand at the airport with my 2-year old daughter trying to occupy her for a moment before our flight. The next thing you know, she was playing with the packages of M&Ms, Skittles, and Twix – just going back and forth, admiring all the colorful packages. They were all lined up at her eye level and I can only imagine how captivating they looked. She’s two, you know?
Then I said to her, “Hey, I just want to let you know, these things are yucky, and these are things that Mom is teaching people about. The ingredients in them are not good for your body.”
She just kind of looked at me, and goes, “Yucky?” And I go, “Yup, yucky.”
Now anytime we see those candies… guess what she says?
The food industry doesn’t want people to know the truth. They want you to believe everything in stores is “safe” to eat…
But the safety of our food system is a lie.
There are products (many marketed towards children) on store shelves right now with ingredients that have been banned by the FDA… and no one is doing anything to prevent it. Please share this information with those that you love, here’s what’s happening…
The FDA recently banned 7 ingredients used to make “artificial flavors” that have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals (1-2). These ingredients were originally approved in 1964, so have been in our food for decades. This ban would have never happened if it wasn’t for the FDA petition and lawsuit filed by several consumer protection organizations who put persistent pressure on the FDA to take action (3-4).
The banned ingredients are benzophenone, ethyl acrylate, eugenyl methyl ether, myrcene, pulegone, pyridine, and styrene* – but you won’t see them on an ingredient label
So any product that lists artificial flavors as an ingredient may contain them, but food manufacturers are not required to tell you.
Artificial flavors are complex chemical mixtures made in a lab using various substances like crude oil or coal tar, and can contain upwards of 100 ingredients (including those just banned). Food companies don’t need to tell you anything about the ingredients actually in their artificial flavors – they just slap “artificial flavors” on the ingredient label – and we are left in the dark about what we are really eating.
Any food company using artificial flavors has been notified of the 7 ingredients banned, but the FDA has given them TWO YEARS to remove them from their artificial flavors.
The FDA and the industry trade group representing these companies has refused to disclose which companies use the banned flavors. And there haven’t been any companies voluntarily telling the public either, because they are not required to.
In other words – if you see “artificial flavors” on an ingredient label, it could contain these banned cancerous substances and food companies are not going to warn you. Up until October 9, 2020 this is perfectly legal!
This is what’s wrong with our food system. Food companies are allowed to continue selling you products with ingredients known to cause cancer in animal studies – without any warning. It’s so outrageous.
The FDA doesn’t care either. In their statement about the banned flavors they said,”rigorous scientific analysis has determined that they do not pose a risk to public health under the conditions of their intended use. The synthetic flavoring substances that are the subject of this petition are typically used in foods available in the U.S. marketplace in very small amounts and their use results in very low levels of exposure and low risk.”
Should we have cancerous ingredients in our food in any amount? Why take that risk? What about children, who may be more susceptible to these substances? How much are we really eating if we eat multiple products with artificial flavors each day? This is not being addressed. This is why I wrote my new book, Feeding You Lies. You can’t trust food companies or government agencies to care about our health.

Feeding You Lies

As soon as I learned that the FDA banned these ingredients, I started investigating which food brands were using artificial flavors… Doritos, Cheetos, Jell-O, Oreos, Trix, and Lucky Charms are all spiked with them. But there is one food corporation that I noticed as a BIG offender.


They admitted they’re in the process of removing the banned ingredients from their artificial flavors. This means, yes, these ingredients shown to cause cancer in animals have been used in their products. They are complying with FDA regulations requiring companies to remove them within 2 years.
Our next question was…
What products are these in? Are these banned ingredients in M&Ms? What about Snickers? Skittles? Eclipse Gum?
Here’s the kicker. They refused to tell us.
Their reasoning is that they didn’t want to give us inaccurate information because they are in the process of removing them. We then asked how long they anticipate it will take, and they simply said “as fast as possible”. How fast this is, is anyone’s guess. Remember, the FDA has given food companies two years to stop making products with these flavors – so this does not include products already on store shelves, vending machines, or in your own house. As candy and gum has a very long shelf life, it is likely that even after two years some of the products with these banned ingredients will still be on shelves.
Since they won’t, you might want to err on the side of caution and just avoid ALL of their products with artificial flavors. And that isn’t the only reason to avoid these products – as they are filled with other risky additives like artificial dyes (5) and BHT (6)…





The best way to change the food industry is with a grassroots movement. This is why I’ve done petitions – they are quick and effective at making people aware as to what is really in the food they’re buying. This is also why I recommend voting with your dollars by refusing to buy products from companies who are poisoning us for profit with cheap and dangerous ingredients. How you choose to spend your money is VERY powerful.
On the other hand, expecting our government agencies (like the FDA and the USDA) to take action often takes decades of intense pressure. Consumer advocacy groups spent YEARS pushing the FDA to take action on these carcinogenic flavors – and even had to file a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals (4) to force them to do anything. We cannot rely on the FDA to protect us. And we certainly can’t trust Big Food to self-police. After all, the food industry has consistently shown that it will only remove dangerous and unhealthy ingredients when they are forced to do so.

https://foodbabe.com/why-ingredients-in-beer-matter-and-what-beer-companies-arent-telling-you/,Why Ingredients in Beer Matter – And What Beer Companies Aren’t Telling You,"I was having a blast watching the Super Bowl last weekend… and it had NOTHING to do with the game! Bud Light started advertising that they have No Corn Syrup in their beer, and texts like this kept rolling in…

You see, we launched the petition that started the conversation about beer ingredients and why they matter. And now, Bud Light is spending millions of dollars on a marketing campaign to tell us that corn syrup isn’t in their beer – but there is SO MUCH MORE to this story.
A little over 4 years ago I was sitting at Anheuser-Busch headquarters trying to convince their executives to develop an organic beer. At the time they told me they had tried one in the past, but it didn’t sell. Stone Mill Organic Pale Ale was the first one they produced many years ago, but they took it off the market…
The original organic beer as seen at the Anheuser-Busch headquarters
Well, so much has changed since then, and not only did they end up coming out with an organic Michelob Ultra Pure Gold beer, but they advertised it during the Super Bowl! I couldn’t have been more happy to see that. I remember sitting in their board room, wondering if my arguments for an organic beer were convincing enough or just falling on deaf ears.

Meeting with executives at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, MO

I’ve been investigating the ingredients in alcohol for the last 6 years and dedicated an entire chapter (chapter 7!) to it in my first book. The ingredients in beer are not required by law to be listed anywhere on the label and manufacturers have no legal obligation to disclose the ingredients. The beer industry is regulated by the U.S. Treasury Department (the people who collect taxes) instead of the FDA like most other food and beverages. This is why we know more about what’s in a can of Coke than what’s in our beer.
Since beer companies aren’t required to tell us their ingredients, I knew I needed to investigate this for myself and what I found shocked me. I grew concerned after discovering there is a long list of additives the government has approved for use that beer companies don’t need to tell you about… corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, stabilizers linked to intestinal inflammation, artificial colors, caramel coloring, and genetically modified ingredients, to name a few.
I knew people wanted to know more about what was in their beer (especially since my husband loves beer), so I launched a petition in 2014 asking the two biggest beer manufacturers in the world (Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors) to publish their ingredients online (1). The response was HUGE. Within the first 24 hours the petition received 43,000 signatures and Anheuser-Busch publicly agreed to publish the list of ingredients online (2). MillerCoors quickly followed.

The petition we started in 2014
Thanks to the work of the Food Babe Army, we made history that day. And that’s when Anheuser-Busch invited me to St. Louis to see how their beer was made.

Behind the scenes at Anheuser-Busch
If you watched the Super Bowl, you likely saw Bud Light’s ads about how they don’t use corn syrup in their beer. They also threw Miller Light and Coors Light under the bus for using corn syrup in their beer…Which is completely true.


I LOVE how they played the part of “Food Babe Army” in listing out the ingredients for everyone to see in these flyers. But as I wrote about in my first book, Bud Light actually never used corn syrup in their beer, so I found that misleading.
Anheuser-Busch (the parent company for Bud Light) is insinuating that just because one product is “clean”, all of their other products are a better choice, when that couldn’t be further from the truth. They are using the same ingredients as Miller Light and Coors Light in some of their other beers.
Bud Light spent millions of dollars on a marketing campaign to tell us that corn syrup isn’t in their beer, but other beers by Anheuser-Busch still use it. And this didn’t go unnoticed by their competition. During the SuperBowl, MillerCoors called them out online for putting high fructose corn syrup in some of their beers…

The battle is brewing between Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors. And while it’s great to see them open up the conversation around beer ingredients and transparency, it would have been better to see Anheuser-Busch remove all corn syrup from their beers before making a such a spectacle.
You’ll find corn syrup in several of their most popular beers like Rolling Rock, Kokanee, and Busch beer…



When MillerCoors first published their ingredients online following our 2014 petition, they did not list “corn syrup” as an ingredient (3). While the media was eating up the story, they simply reported the ingredients in Coors Light and Miller Light as “water, barley malt, corn, yeast, and hops” (4). More recent updates to their website shows the ingredients as this…
Coors Light: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Dextrose), Yeast, Hop Extract
Miller Light: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Dextrose), Yeast, Hops and Hop Extract
Was MillerCoors not telling the whole truth about their ingredients 4 years ago or did they recently add corn syrup and hop extracts?
Corn syrup isn’t typically used as a sweetener in beer, rather it’s used as a cheap sugar which ferments. The reason why you wouldn’t want to drink beer made with corn or corn syrup is because almost all corn is genetically modified (GMO)(5) and if you don’t want to support GMOs, Monsanto/Bayer, and the chemical companies who are poisoning our food and environment with Roundup herbicides linked to cancer (6) – you don’t want beer produced with GMOs. Beer is traditionally brewed with malted barley, a non-GMO grain (7), and not corn.
Hop Extract: Rather than using whole hops or hop pellets, beer companies use a chemically altered hop extract to add bitterness while reducing the amount of actual hops in the beer. This is a cheaper way to produce beer.
Caramel Color: This brown coloring is used to make some beers appear darker. It’s manufactured by heating ammonia and sulfites under high pressure, which creates carcinogenic compounds. Newcastle removed this from their beers in 2015 (8) after we called them out for this. It appears Stella Artois (by Anheuser Busch) also no longer contains caramel coloring, as we had reported finding it listed as an ingredient on an overseas website in 2014 (3).
It is CRAZY that Anheuser-Busch would base an entire multi-million dollar campaign on ONE product that doesn’t have corn syrup or hop extract – while their other products still use these ingredients.
Bud Light VP Andy Goeler was quoted as saying “While ingredient labels are not required, consumers deserve to know more about their beer. We brew Bud Light with the finest ingredients and we’re happy to proudly display them on our packaging. When people walk through a store, they are used to seeing ingredient labels on products in every aisle, except for the beer, wine and spirits aisle. As the lead brand in the category, we believe increasing on-pack transparency will benefit the entire beer category and provide our consumers with the information they expect to see.” (9)
It’s just common sense. Don’t bash other products that use corn syrup and hop extract when you are doing the exact same thing. Either clean up your beers or don’t. I hope Anheuser-Busch learns from this and realizes this is not the way to win customers. We are smarter than that.
In just two short weeks my new book hits shelves and I’m so excited for you to read it. It is very eye opening. In Feeding You Lies, I delve deep into the lies that food and beverage companies tell us to get us to keep buying their products. My hope is that it will change the food industry again, by encouraging them to use more transparent practices and improve their products.

https://foodbabe.com/heres-4-examples-of-fake-health-news-and-how-to-spot-it/,4 Examples of Fake Health News – And How To Spot It.,"How many times have you read a new study promoting the benefits of things that you love to consume- whether it be candy, chocolate, or diet soda? It’s so comforting to see that some of these foods could have benefits to your health, right? Well don’t get too excited – because it’s all a BIG SCAM by the food industry. Here’s what’s really happening behind these “studies” and fake health news…
When I read the CBS News headline—“Does candy keep kids from getting fat?”—I went nuts. If this were true, it would be a shocking scientific finding, especially since it would contradict decades of research into the hazards of sugar (and also contradict common sense!).
The study that inspired this ridiculous headline was funded by a candy trade association that represents the makers of Snickers, Skittles, Butterfinger, and other big candy brands (15). Their research was based on government surveys that asked people to recall what they had eaten in the past 24 hours. The problem with this methodology is that people often don’t remember what they ate, which is what led the researchers to admit that their data “may not reflect usual intake” and that the study was “thin and clearly padded” (16).
Translation: the results were bogus and a perfect example of how the news media is used by the food industry to fool us into thinking candy is ok for our kids. The purpose of the study isn’t to convince us that candy is healthy, but rather, make us less concerned about its affects on our kids so we keep buying it.

A small milk brand – Fifth Quarter Fresh – paid the University of Maryland to study their “high protein” chocolate milk and it’s apparent ability to help athletes recover from concussions. Their chocolate milk was also atrociously high in sugar – 42 grams per serving – making it very unhealthy by any estimation (17).
Emails show that Fifth Quarter Fresh coincided the release of their findings with the release of the Will Smith movie Concussion to help boost publicity for the study (18). After the seemingly positive results were announced to the public, some school districts were clamoring for their sugar-laden chocolate milk. One superintendent announced that he planned on buying $25,000 worth of their chocolate milk for his athletes (19)… YIKES.
The study was suspect because the actual study findings weren’t made available, the results were preliminary and not peer reviewed. Thankfully, the university conducted an internal investigation, disavowed the study, and returned the research funds to Fifth Quarter (20).


Anyone who ever says diet sodas are better than water clearly hasn’t looked into their ingredients. A small 3-month study funded by the American Beverage Association (a Coca-Cola and Pepsi lobbying group) found that participants who drank diet soda lost more weight than people who just drank water. This contradicts numerous other studies that show artificial sweeteners in diet drinks cause people to crave sugar, suffer from increased food cravings, and gain weight (21-27). Soda companies love to use short-term studies like this that don’t show the overall health or weight impact of what happens to people who are drinking diet soda long term consuming risky artificial sweeteners that are linked to leukemia and other cancers (28-29).


When I was growing up there was one staple that my family ate to celebrate countless birthdays: Pepperidge Farm Golden Layer Cake. It came out of the freezer section in a white box. I remember struggling to wait while it thawed on the counter. I always begged for a second piece.
One thing we didn’t know then is that it was filled with Partially Hydrogenated Oil – an ingredient that has now been banned by the FDA because it’s very harmful to the heart (1).
You may know this as the stuff that made up margarine and Crisco shortening. That oily goo was a staple in the processed food industry, and basically, if you ate anything processed in the last few decades, you were eating this substance.
“Partially hydrogenated oil” is made in a factory by taking a liquid vegetable oil (like the soybean and cottonseed oil that Pepperidge Farm used in their cake) and transforming it into a semi-solid by adding hydrogen to it. The food industry LOVED to use this heavily processed, solidified oil because it was CHEAP… much cheaper than using real butter and allowed them to create foods with a really long shelf life…
But they had a problem…
Buzz started generating in the 1950’s that it was giving people heart attacks (2). As the years went on, more and more research backed up the harmful effects of partially hydrogenated oils on the heart (3)(4). Yet the FDA turned a blind eye and allowed it in our food for DECADES. Why, you ask?
Big Food companies (Kraft and Procter & Gamble) hired scientists to SPIN THE SCIENCE and hide the dangers of partially hydrogenated oils so that the industry could keep using this cheap ingredient (5).
Besides squelching worries that partially hydrogenated oils (particularly the trans fats they contain) were bad for the heart, they took it even FURTHER, and were successful in convincing almost everyone that partially hydrogenated oils were HEALTHY (6).
Any scientist who tried to state otherwise couldn’t get research funding or they were ridiculed and smeared by their peers so that their research would be viewed negatively (7-8).
With the FDA’s blessing, the industry went on to market margarine as GOOD for your heart… and fooled sooooo many people (my own family included!) Maybe you remember seeing ads like this?


Thankfully, there were some good nutrition researchers who pressed on the truth and eventually forced the FDA to ban these heart-wrecking partially hydrogenated oils – but it took over 60 years and a lawsuit! (9-10)
They did it once, and they can do it again.
During that time, researcher Walter Willett theorized that 30,000 people were killed each year from trans fat consumption (11). That is 30,000 people (EACH YEAR) whose lives could have been saved had the FDA done its job and banned partially hydrogenated oils decades ago. We’re talking nearly 2 million people here.
I also believe the Big Food industry should not be paying scientists to defend their products. It’s absolutely shameful and people need to know the truth behind these tactics.
What’s interesting is that most researchers who take dollars from food and chemical companies do not believe that it will affect their research (12). They flat-out will say that where the money comes from will not change the results of a study. But this is NOT TRUE (13).
Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor from NYU, demonstrated this well. She cataloged 168 studies which were either directly funded by the food industry or done by researchers who had food industry connections. She found that 156 out of the 168 studies (93%) of them had results that were favorable to their industry sponsors (14). That’s a lot more than by just chance I’d say!
Industry-funded researchers may not consciously realize that they are biased, but the data shows that $$$$ from industry = results that help the industry.
Many studies might seem convincing, but are thinly veiled marketing ploys that undermine our health. If a headline seems too good to be true… it probably is. Especially if it favors a heavily processed food industry product!
Unfortunately, the food industry isn’t going to stop paying for science to promote their products any time soon. So, please, SHARE THIS POST and spread the word about this practice. Warn your friends to pay close attention to who is funding the “science” they are using to make their food decisions.",Food Babe,Unknown

https://foodbabe.com/the-video-i-was-afraid-to-show-you/,The video I was afraid to show you,"I didn’t want to share this video with you, because every time I think about it, it’s too painful to relive. And quite honestly, I didn’t want to deal with the backlash that I knew I’d get… but now it’s time.
In this video below, I’m talking to over 3000 people at the World Domination Summit in Portland, Oregon. It is the first time that I publicly express my reaction to the industry onslaught against my character. After we successfully influenced several multi-billion dollar corporations to change for the better, I became a target – and it was unlike anything I’d ever experienced in my life. Although this was a very exciting time for us and I was overjoyed with the response to our campaigns rippling throughout the food industry – it came with a cost. The personal attacks became so vicious, that at one point I almost stopped what I was doing, but realized I NEED to continue.
Now three years later, I am feeling much stronger. I’ve worked through why and who was behind these attacks. I uncovered compelling evidence showing how certain critics were connected to and were taking money from the food and chemical industries. I also uncovered how the industry will stop at nothing to keep their unhealthy products on the market, even if it means lying repeatedly to the public. I couldn’t allow them to silence me. This is why I wrote my newest book, Feeding You Lies.
I’m sharing the video of my talk now, because I’m starting a new chapter – and I’d love for you to see how far we have come.
WATCH MY TALK HERE (Warning – graphic language):


Feeding You Lies is not like any other health or diet book. You can learn more about the book here. I’ll just say that certain individuals and companies do NOT want their lies to be published and that’s why I know this book is going to really open me up to attacks again. And, this will not be easy for me. That’s why I really need your support right now, and the best way is to order a copy here today.
Feeding You Lies
If you’ve already read the book, THANK YOU.
Please share this post with your friends! The best way to make Big Food’s lies less effective is to show people the TRUTH – and that is what this book does. I’m counting on you to get this book into the hands of everyone you know.

https://foodbabe.com/emails-reveal-coca-colas-shocking-plot-to-take-us-down/,Emails Reveal: Coca-Cola’s Shocking Plot To Take Us Down,"While working on my new book last year, I received a STARTLING email from U.S. Right To Know. They had obtained an internal email from Coca-Cola… and when I read it, I was shocked.
Right there in black in white, I read how Coca-Cola tried to lobby the FDA against us, the Food Babe Army.
In the months following our successful campaigns to get “yoga mat” out of Subway, the artificial dyes out of Kraft Mac & Cheese, and the caramel coloring out of Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, Coca-Cola took aim at our ability to convince major food companies to change. You see, we were hurting their bottom line, and they wanted to put that to a halt.


As I read through Coca-Cola’s correspondence I couldn’t believe the lengths they had gone to try to stop our movement. An email proposal was sent to the head of the FDA, written by none other than Alex Malaspina. Alex is a former senior vice president at Coca-Cola who founded the front group International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) way back in the 70’s (1). This front group still operates today, funded by Coca-Cola, Nestlé, McDonald’s, Pepsico, and other processed food and chemical companies (2). Notice how Alex greets FDA head Michael Taylor in his email…

“Dear Mike: How are you? I hope with the summer you have slowed down a little; Our friend Mat Echols, whom you met at our breakfast is asking, as per his email, if you would have an interest in becoming involved in this most important debate. i assume that, if your time would allow you, you will try to consider this task as this would be so important in FDA bringing good science to the table and as a result help people make the proper choices in such critical health issues. If you are interested, and could do it, please contact Mat directly to obtain all the details. Many, many thanks. Warmest personal regards. Your Friend. Alex”
Pretty interesting to see that “friend” Alex Malaspina, Mat Echols (a senior vice-president at Coca-Cola), and the head of the FDA had been breaking bread together. Makes you wonder if they’ve worked together in the past, doesn’t it? Sure sounds like they have a close relationship.
And, there’s more. The email thread included a FDA Roundtable proposal written by Coca-Cola…
“Recent events—the vaccine scare in California, investigations by AMA and others into Dr. Oz, criticism of the Food Babe’s misuse of science and pledges by food service establishments and companies to remove ingredients in response to ‘consumer pressure’—have created a window of opportunity to drive an important message about the pervasiveness of pseudo-science and the unintended consequences it creates among consumers who now fear perfectly safe and beneficial products.”
Hah. I’ve heard many outlandish things from Big Food companies, but I never thought I’d hear someone defend soda as “beneficial.” And, this is what they wanted the FDA to do…
“POSSIBLE EXECUTION:
FDA chairs a roundtable discussion on “Junk Science Reporting and its Unintended Consequences on Consumer Confidence, Consumer Choice and Public Policy. FDA convenes experts from a variety disciplines from nutrition policy, food science/academia, healthcare and journalism. During the discussion the experts will examine case studies where junk science is driving media attention, corporate action and consumer decision-making. They will look at how this information is communicated, its effectiveness in raising concern among consumers and how it could be addressed in the future to prevent alarmism and risks to consumer health and wellbeing.”
Risks to consumer health and wellbeing? Isn’t removing risky additives linked to cancer and other health issues helping consumer health and wellbeing? Who’s really risking consumer health here? Could it be that Coca-Cola’s PROFITS were at risk because of all the caramel coloring and additives they use in their products?
I’m not the first person to be targeted by Big Soda… and I certainly won’t be the last. They will try every tactic under the sun to trick the public into buying their unhealthy products, and that includes infiltrating our government agencies. When the food industry can’t get people to trust them, they use front groups to help weasel their way in. And ILSI (that front group partially funded by Coca-Cola mentioned above) has been successful at this…
A new report published in The BMJ and The Journal of Public Health Policy document that ILSI has huge influence in China (3). So much in fact, that ILSI operates from inside the government’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing. Pretty crazy.
What’s most ludicrous is that ILSI is supposedly “fighting” the obesity epidemic in China… organizing obesity conferences and paying scientists to attend these events. They’ve launched public health campaigns heavily promoting the idea that obesity is caused by a lack of exercise – and not from drinking sugary sodas and processed food. Anything to make sure people keep loading up their grocery carts up with Coke, right?
You may remember that Coca-Cola tried the same tactics here in the U.S. and it backfired BIG TIME when they were caught secretly funding a nonprofit group called the Global Energy Balance Network. Emails obtained by the Associated Press and U.S. Right To Know outlined how “the group would use social media and run a political-style campaign to counter the ‘shrill rhetoric’ of ‘public health extremists’ who want to tax or limit foods they deem unhealthy” and “quickly establish itself as the place the media goes to for comment on any obesity issue.” (4) The group disbanded and Coca-Cola’s chief health and science officer retired after the scandal broke. (5) They might have been caught then – but we both know they are going to try another tactic. And another. And then, another.
This is the reason why I wrote my book Feeding You Lies.  Not only are the food companies using front groups to feed us lies in the U.S., but they are doing it across the globe. It’s happening everywhere and they won’t stop until they are exposed.
There’s more to this story too. I have so much more to share and put all of the information you need to know in Feeding You Lies. Just like the tobacco industry lied to us about the dangers of cigarettes, the same untruths, cover-ups, and deceptive practices are occurring in the food industry.
It’s more important than ever that people know about this. Feeding You Lies is written for you – it’s a tell-all on the food industry in one book that’s super easy to share with your friends and family.

https://foodbabe.com/what-are-the-healthiest-non-dairy-milks-to-drink/,What Are The Healthiest Non-Dairy Milks To Drink?,"The other day I was ordering an organic smoothie at a local shop and as I watched her put the kale into the blender and grab a carton of almond milk, I stopped her just in time…
Right before she poured the milk into the blender I asked, “Would you mind if I read the ingredients on that?”
She handed me the carton, and, wouldn’t ya know it… The almond milk was filled with all kinds of crazy ingredients that I’d never use in my smoothies at home…
So I simply asked, “Can you use water instead?”
I personally eat very little dairy and usually opt for nut milks to make smoothies and recipes. Almond, coconut, and cashew milks are great alternatives to dairy – but I don’t buy the majority of popular brands at the store, like Silk, So Delicious, or Almond Breeze. Here’s why…


Common ingredients to avoid in dairy-free milk:
Added sugars: Eating too much sugar (which is easy to do, because it’s in almost every processed food) leads to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer (1) – but its detrimental effects can take years to surface. There is no reason to add sugar to milk and we all could use a little less sugar in our life! Some brands have sweetened and unsweetened versions – so always choose the latter. Guilty brands: Silk Original, Almond Breeze, Califia Farms (non-organic), Ripple Original, Milkadamia Original, Pearl Organic Soymilk.
Natural flavors: Natural Flavor is practically the exact same thing as Artificial Flavor, but it’s derived from substances found in nature (plants, animals, etc). Chemists create these complex formulations in a lab, isolating and blending specific flavors extracted from upwards of hundreds of compounds, some of which may be GMOs. These compounds can come from substances that are nowhere close to the actual thing. For example, they might take some castoreum from a beaver (2) to make a flavoring that resembles vanilla – without ever using any vanilla beans. But, hey, it’s “natural” because it’s from a beaver! Common additives in flavors include: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol (none are required to be labeled by the FDA). Natural flavors are a complete mystery ingredient and completely unnecessary (3). Guilty brands: Silk, Almond Breeze Vanilla, Califia Farms (non-organic), Ripple, So Delicious, Milkadamia, Pacific Foods Almond, Simple Truth Coconut Milk, Westsoy Vanilla Soymilk, Pearl Organic Soymilk.
Carrageenan & Gums: Carrageenan is linked to intestinal inflammation and cancer (4). Since so much awareness has been raised about the risks of consuming carrageenan, a lot of brands have removed it (yay!) but – they often end up replacing it with gums to thicken the milk, like gellan gum and guar gum. In my opinion, these are safer than carrageenan, but not really something I want to consume often – as they’re linked to bloating and gas (and again, simply unnecessary) (5). Guilty brands: Pacific Rice Milk Original, Simple Truth Coconut Milk, Pearl Organic Soymilk.





I get this question a lot. I personally don’t drink soy and rice milks. Here’s why –
Soy can cause hormonal disruptions because it has estrogen-mimicking properties. Soy also has an abundance of phytic acid that leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body (6). And, if soy milk is not organic it is almost surely made from GMO soybeans. GMO soybeans have been shown to be contaminated with Roundup herbicide, which might end up in your glass of soy milk (7).
As for rice, it is notoriously contaminated with arsenic (a carcinogen) – even organic rice – (8) and tests by Consumer Reports have found arsenic residues in rice milk (9). Unless a brand says that they test their rice milks for arsenic, I don’t feel confident that it is safe. Rice milk is also higher in sugar than most non-dairy milks.
I typically stick with organic coconut and almond milks. Organic store-bought hemp milk or oat milk is hard to find, but is a good choice too.
Oat milk is gaining in popularity right now and you’ll probably start seeing a lot more of it popping up in coffee shops and stores. Recently the Environmental Working Group (EWG) did some testing (10) and found many popular oat-based cereals, oatmeals, granolas and snack bars contaminated with glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup weedkiller). Oat milk wasn’t specifically included in their testing, but it’s good to be aware that conventional oats (non-organic) oats are commonly sprayed with Roundup as a drying agent before harvest, which makes them more likely to be contaminated. Organic oats are not sprayed directly, but are sometimes cross-contaminated. Thankfully, what the EWG found was that organic products were less likely to be contaminated and had far fewer residues than conventional products. The cancer arm of the World Health Organization considers glyphosate to be a probable carcinogen (a substance that causes cancer) – so you don’t want that in your food! That’s why it is safest to look for oat products that are certified organic, and ideally, that have been certified by a third-party to be free of glyphosate.
Oatly is one brand that isn’t organic, but carries the Glyphosate Residue Free certification by The Detox Project. If you buy the Oatly brand, just make sure to pick up what they call the “low fat” version, because Oatly’s regular oat milk contains added rapeseed (canola) oil and other unnecessary additives. I normally wouldn’t recommend a product labeled as “low fat”, but in this case it simply means they didn’t add unhealthy oil to it. And, check out my recipe for homemade organic oat milk below – it’s soooo simple to make.
Ripple Milk and some other brands like Silk’s Protein Nut Milk and Milkadamia are made with pea protein. I’m now very cautious about consuming pea protein as I learned something very shocking about this ingredient while developing protein powder for my company Truvani...
Our protein powder is made primarily with organic pea protein. We have strict ingredient standards that not all brands have – all ingredients need to be organic, non-GMO, and pass heavy metal testing. We reached out to dozens of ingredient suppliers and every single sample of pea protein failed the heavy metals test and was coming back contaminated with LEAD. I couldn’t believe it. We had such a hard time finding a clean source of pea protein that I thought we would need to scratch the recipe altogether and completely reformulate it without pea protein. We eventually found a pea protein source that passed testing, but it was an exhaustive process that I know most food brands don’t bother doing.
I’m not saying Ripple Milk, Milkadamia, or Silk’s Protein Nut Milk is contaminated with lead. I can’t say that because I haven’t tested them for lead – and I don’t know anyone who has. That being said, given how common lead is in our pea protein supplies, it is a risk and it’s not one that I’m personally willing to take – especially after my personal experience with pea protein! My team has reached out to these companies and we haven’t heard back yet – but we’ll update this blog post when we do.
UPDATE 2/1/19: Following this investigation, Ripple made the following statement on their Instagram page: “We confidently stand by the integrity of our products and we want to give our fans complete peace of mind, so we tested several bottles of each flavor of Ripple Milk for lead. We tested bottles from different production runs, produced over a few months, using a strict EPA-standard testing method (EPA 6020) at an independent laboratory. As expected, all test results came back negative. This means that the amount of lead in the product is either zero, or so small that highly sensitive analytical equipment could not detect it. Thank you for reaching out to us with your concerns! We know how important it is to feel confident about the products you and your family rely on.”
Ripple Milk is not certified organic, contains added flavors, and contains added refined (white) sugar (unless you buy their unsweetened version). Especially watch out for Vanilla Ripple Milk with 15 grams of sugar per serving. I try to avoid added sugar in foods that I’m eating regularly (that are supposed to be healthy!) Think about it: We get bombarded with added sugar all over the place… do we really want it in our daily drinks? I sure don’t.
Of course, making homemade dairy-free milk is the best option… but I realize we all don’t have time to soak, blend, strain, and bottle it up every few days! When shopping for almond, coconut, oat and other dairy-free milks follow these two tips:
Some better brands are MALK Organic Almond and Cashew Milks, Oatly (low fat version), Three Trees Organic Almondmilk, New Barn Organic Almondmilk, Whole Foods 365 Organic Unsweetened Almond Milk, Thrive Market Organic Almond Milk and Organic Oat Milk, Simple Truth Organic Unsweetened Almond Milk, Califia Organic Almond Homestyle Nutmilk, and Native Forest or Natural Value Coconut Milk (canned). Be careful, because these brands may have some other versions with added sugar and flavors.







This is how I make homemade coconut milk from a can in less than 5 minutes. And if you’ve got a little bit more time…here is a recipe for fresh pistachio milk that is out of this world.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-make-a-change-in-the-new-year-that-lasts/,How to make a change in the New Year that lasts,"Last week I shared the right (and wrong) way to do Keto in our latest investigation on the blog. The timing was appropriate, too…
Right about now you’re probably *overwhelmed* with new diets, fitness challenges, and “new year, new you” promotions.
However, there’s one BIG PROBLEM – even with the most well-intentioned resolutions. I’ll explain.
The reason 99% of New Year’s resolutions fail is: People try to do too much at once… and end up with nothing.
Sure, an overnight “lifestyle change” sounds exciting today. But will it stick?
You have a crazed work schedule. Or a newborn. Or both. Your plate is about as full as it could be… So how are you suddenly going to fit in 57 new healthy habits? You can’t. And it’s not your fault – it’s just unrealistic.
That’s why it’s better to take a different route…
Something that’s easy. Something that’s instantly rewarding. Something that fits perfectly into your already crazy-busy life.
But why focus on SELF CARE?
Because so many of us – especially we moms – always put ourselves LAST!
Work, kids, family… you take care of everything and everyone.
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?
I learned this the hard way: If you don’t take care of yourself today, you won’t be here to care for those that matter to you tomorrow. It’s like they tell you on the plane, “Put YOUR oxygen mask on first.”
If you don’t, sooner or later, bad things will happen… You get anxious and irritable. You feel tired ALL THE TIME. You start to feel unattractive and undesirable. You lose your energy AND your confidence. And you can’t be there for the ones you love either.
So, even if there’s a voice in your head telling you otherwise…
Self-care is NOT SELFISH.
Self-care IS SACRED.
Actually, it’s easier than you think. You can start each day off by doing one easy morning ritual for yourself…
Everyone is talking about marine collagen right now because it’s a remarkable supplement.
And there are three reasons why I LOVE taking marine collagen as a self-care habit:
There are many areas of self-care, but the truth is, when I feel like I look my best, I feel my best. My confidence soars. And people notice it.
Now, to help you make 2019 the year you finally make YOU a priority, I have something special for you:

That said, there’s a more important reason this matters: plastic pollution… It’s a serious problem that causes terrible harm to marine animals. Don’t google it. It’s heartbreaking. So, by using a GLASS straw, you can help reduce plastic waste.
Plus, you should know…
Truvani’s Marine Collagen is made from the skin of WILD CAUGHT fish. Meaning, it’s made from a byproduct that otherwise often goes to waste. So, you’re not adding to the problem of overfishing by using Truvani’s Marine Collagen.
Let’s make 2019 the year of YOU. And self-care starts with loving the skin you’re in. One easy way to start is Marine Collagen, and right now’s the perfect time try it:

https://foodbabe.com/is-the-keto-diet-healthy/,Is The Keto Diet Healthy?,"When I was in my 20’s overweight, upset and ready to change my life – I went on a diet.

This is why I think it’s important to demystify the latest diet trends to help people see through the lies they promise. One of the biggest trends in the diet world right now is KETO. Here’s what I’ve uncovered for you…
The word “keto” comes from the word “ketosis” – which is a metabolic state that your body can go into to efficiently burn fat when you dramatically reduce the amount of carbohydrates you consume. In the Keto diet, it is typical for fat to make up about 70% of what you eat. Your remaining diet on Keto is roughly 15-25% protein and 5% carbs. These amounts vary a bit by person, but carbs are severely restricted to fewer than 50 grams per day (some need to go as low as 5-15 grams to reach ketosis). To put this in perspective, the average person eats over 200 grams of carbs (from sugar, grains, fruit, etc) per day. The reduction in carbohydrates is similar to the first phase of the popular Atkins Diet in the 90’s.
It’s common for people to lose significant weight on Keto – especially at first. After a few days on the Keto diet, your body will kick into ketosis and starts burning fat for energy instead of glucose (carbs). When you stick to it, you dramatically change how your body processes these nutrients – leading to weight loss without food cravings and increased energy (1). (At least that’s what most people who’ve done Keto say about it.)
You’ll eat lots of healthy foods on Keto… like avocados, wild salmon, coconut oil, and leafy greens. When Keto is done right, you won’t eat processed food and will eat way more vegetables than the average person. And, you’ll stop eating sugar. Eating too much sugar is truly toxic to the body – and sadly, it’s super easy to overdo it. Sugar can be implicated in many cases of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer (2). It’s the hidden link to so much pain and suffering. So, the fact that the Keto diet helps people get off of sugar (a highly addictive substance) is AMAZING. On Keto you typically won’t eat meat at every meal either, which is better for the planet.
Besides losing weight, Keto lowers inflammation in the body, may fight cancer, and can be used to help manage type 2 diabetes. The Keto diet has been used to treat symptoms of epilepsy in children for over 100 years (3).
Not everyone on Keto is eating healthy food. The diet is not focused on the source of ingredients (organic, grass-fed, etc…) or whether the food is nutritious. It’s okay to eat pork rinds and factory-farm salami for example. Organic, grass-fed, and unprocessed animal products are FAR healthier than conventional versions, with more healthy omega-3 fatty acids, and without residues of antibiotics, artificial hormones, and other drugs that are given to most farm animals. It’s especially unhealthy to eat processed meats like salami with cancerous nitrates and other risky additives like BHT (4).
There are also packaged Keto snacks and drinks coming out that are filled with processed additives. To sweeten them up without carbs, they’ll often use sugar alcohols (erythritol, xylitol) – or even worse, they’ll sometimes use artificial sweeteners like sucralose. Sugar alcohols may be low carb, but they are made in a laboratory with a complex fermentation process (often from GMO corn) and consumption may wreak havoc on gut health and cause gastrointestinal issues (4). Sucralose is an artificial sweetener linked to leukemia and should be avoided at all costs (4).
You’ll also find fiber additives like cellulose in many of these products. We should be getting our fiber naturally from fruits, vegetables, beans, seeds, whole grains, and not from processed fiber additives that were manufactured in a lab. The industry calls these “functional fibers” but they do not function in your body the same as fiber in real food (5).


Keto can be done healthfully (olive oil, avocados, nuts, organic grass-fed dairy) or unhealthful (“sugar-free” candy, conventional cheese, processed sausage and bacon). It’s a lot easier to do the latter… but the “right” way to do Keto is with home-cooked whole foods.
You can’t eat fruit for instance. Maybe a small handful of berries per day, but that’s about it. There’s a long list of healthy foods that you aren’t allowed to eat on Keto if you want to stay in ketosis which includes almost every fruit, sweet potatoes, lentils, beans, quinoa, brown rice, and oatmeal. Some say you can eat a few bites of non-Keto fruits, like 1/3 of a banana a day, but these healthy foods are pretty much banned from the Keto diet…

Avoiding these foods doesn’t come without a cost! You’re missing out on all the beneficial vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients abundant in some of the healthiest foods on the planet (6) which may lead to nutrient deficiencies over time. You’re lowering your fiber intake significantly, which is detrimental to your gut heath. A healthy gut is crucial for healthy digestion, clear skin, and a strong immune system (7).
The lack of fiber is one reason why people on Keto commonly get constipated. The other reason is that your electrolyte levels go out of whack…
While on Keto, your kidneys become more efficient at expelling excess sodium and water. This can leave you dehydrated and constipated. The mineral potassium commonly gets depleted too, which is essential for healthy heart and muscle function. This is why many people on Keto supplement with electrolyte supplements and drinks (which are sometimes heavily processed with added flavors, colors, and artificial sweeteners).

Almost everyone experiences the “Keto flu” for about a week when starting Keto. You’ll feel tired, headachy, queasy, light-headed, and moody while your body gets used to burning fat instead of carbs for energy. This happens when you drastically cut out sugar from your life, and isn’t dangerous for a healthy person… but will throw you off for a few days, and some people throw in the towel at this point because it’s so uncomfortable.
This may explain why coffee is sometimes consumed in excess on Keto (to compensate for loss in energy that carbs provide). Drinking too much coffee makes the body acidic and can lead to problems sleeping – so this can really backfire.
Keto can also give you some nasty smelling breath. “Keto Breath” happens because acetone is a byproduct of ketosis, which is expelled in breath, making your breath smell metallic and fruity (8)
Women on Keto may start experiencing irregular periods or their periods may stop completely. This isn’t a healthy or safe side-effect and should be evaluated by a doctor if it happens to you.
It’s easy to knock your body out of ketosis if you eat one too many bites of the wrong thing. Having a second helping of sweet potatoes at dinner or too many blueberries in your smoothie might just do it. Even eating too much meat can set you back for days getting back into ketosis. Keto “treats” made with certain sugar alcohols can cause blood sugar levels to rise in some people (my father who has diabetes experienced this). Keto hardly allows for any “cheating” and is really strict for this reason. Once cheating takes you out of ketosis, it can take 1-3 days to get back in, during which carb cravings skyrocket. So, you have to be very diligent and very careful about counting each and every macro to make sure you are eating the right amount of protein, carbs, and fat. If you occasionally like to indulge, Keto isn’t for you.
Most experts recommend not doing Keto forever (9) so at some point, you’re going to want to go off of it – and you don’t want to gain all your weight back when you do. There’s a very specific way to transition out of ketosis, which not everyone is aware of – such as forgetting to reduce fat intake when adding carbs back in. Going right back to eating fruit, oatmeal, and other healthy carbs will likely lead to weight gain after you’ve restricted carbs for an extended time, leading to an endless cycle of extreme dieting. If you’re not careful, you’ll be yo-yo dieting in no time.
I don’t want to stop eating juicy oranges, crunchy apples, and savory sweet potatoes. It seems absurd to me to avoid these healthy foods. And, who doesn’t like to have some real chocolate chip cookies from time to time? During the holidays, I wouldn’t want a second helping of sweet potatoes to completely steamroll my diet. When I travel, I love to partake in the local cuisine… croissants in Paris and pizza when in Italy! I also love to eat Indian food – which is full of medicinal spices and healthy coconut milk, but generally way too high in carbs to be considered Keto. I can’t imagine life without dal and dosas!
My philosophy when it comes to eating is to create healthy habits that I can stick to for life and take with me wherever I go. I want my diet to be sustainable day after day, not feeling guilty if I eat something that is otherwise healthy, but not on “the plan”. Instead of worrying about how many grams of carbs or fat something contains, I have found it easiest to choose foods that are nutrient-dense, organic, and unprocessed. For me, this has helped me feel amazing. I can still enjoy basically any food, anywhere, at any time – I just make sure it’s made with healthful ingredients. Eating this way is how I lost excess weight when I was younger and how I am able to effortlessly maintain my weight now for over 10 years. Losing weight is one thing, and getting healthy is another. I want the best of both worlds.

Keto can be helpful for people with certain conditions and can help break an addiction to processed food and sugar – but I consider it extreme for the average person who just wants to drop some pounds. I believe there are healthier, safer, sustainable, (and more enjoyable) ways to lose weight and keep it off.
With as popular as Keto is right now, you are going to start seeing lots of new processed Keto snacks, treats, bars, drinks, etc, in stores. If you do decide to go Keto – make sure you do it the right way with organic whole foods and stay away from processed products full of sugar alcohols, natural flavors, and conventional meat and dairy.

https://foodbabe.com/pumpkin-cheesecake-bites-dairy-free-grain-free/,Pumpkin Cheesecake Bites {Dairy-Free & Grain-Free},"I call these Pumpkin Cheesecake Bites “unbelievable” because once you take a bite, it’s hard to believe these decadent treats are made with no white sugar, no grains, and no dairy – just 100% healthy deliciousness in a pan. Plus, it’s great for the holidays – if you’re baking lots of cookies and have your oven tied up, this recipe is perfect to throw into the mix! No baking involved – it just takes about 15 minutes to assemble and pop into the freezer.

The filling in these Pumpkin Cheesecake Bites is made with healthy pumpkin (of course!) but instead of blending it up with tons of white sugar, I use just 1/4 cup of coconut sugar and a couple tablespoons of maple syrup. Coconut sugar has a lower glycemic index than white sugar (meaning it doesn’t spike your blood sugar levels), plus it’s completely unrefined, helping to preserve all of its teeming vitamins and minerals.
That’s why whenever I’m baking at home, if any recipe calls for “sugar”, I’ll cut the amount down (sometimes in half) and swap it with coconut sugar (and sometimes maple syrup or dates). Coconut sugar is easy to do, because you can swap it out at a perfect 1:1 ratio with regular sugar, so there is no guess work!
To give these bites that rich “cheesecake” taste without the cream cheese, I add organic cashew butter to the pumpkin mix. And, instead of using flour, I make this incredible crust out of unsweetened coconut, pecans, and dates… mmm mmm!
To get started, you’ll want to use your food processor to easily blend the ingredients. You could also use a high powered blender if you don’t have a food processor. Add a cup of pumpkin puree, half a cup of cashew butter, a quarter cup of coconut sugar, and two tablespoons of real maple syrup, along with the vanilla and spices to the food processor…

Blend until all of the pumpkin pie filling ingredients are very smooth. Remove the smooth filling from the food processor, place it in a bowl and set it aside.
Clean your food processor so that you can use it again to make the pie crust…
Add a cup each of unsweetened shredded coconut, Medjool dates, and pecans along with a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the food processor. Save a handful of pecans to use as a topping. Blend the ingredients until a dough-like consistency is achieved. It should look like this…

Take out an 8×8 baking dish and evenly press pie crust mixture into the dish. To make it easier to make pretty squares later, you can line the baking dish with unbleached parchment paper before pressing the crust into the pan. This will allow you to easily take out the Pumpkin Cheesecake Bites in one piece in which you can then cut into pieces…

Grab the pumpkin pie filling and scoop it on top of the crust, spreading it around as evenly as you can… Garnish it with those pecans you set aside and place in freezer overnight to serve chilled the next day.

Try to save some to share!…

https://foodbabe.com/healthy-holiday-sweet-potato-casserole/,Healthy Holiday Sweet Potato Casserole,"There’s just nothing like a homemade sweet potato casserole during the holidays… it’s almost like dessert (but healthy!) I always use fresh sweet potatoes or yams to make this casserole, and NEVER the canned versions. Those cans are packed with tons of added refined sugar and especially after you’ve had the real thing you realize they taste awful too.
Instead of refined sugar, I add only three tablespoons of organic maple syrup to the entire casserole. It comes out sweet, savory, and incredibly delicious. This sweet potato casserole is one of my all-time favorite holiday recipes.

To get started, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Scrub eight medium-size sweet potatoes and poke each one all over with a fork. Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until tender – about for 60 to 70 minutes, depending on the size of your potatoes…

After allowing them to cool for a little bit, scoop out the insides of the sweet potatoes and place in a bowl…

Add in a teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla extract, a pinch of nutmeg, half a stick of softened butter, two eggs, two tablespoons maple syrup and a pinch of salt and pepper. You can omit the eggs by subbing in two tablespoons ground flaxseed mixed with six tablespoons of water. Blend with a hand mixer until well combined…

Scoop the sweet potato mix into a casserole dish and bake for 30 minutes…
Now, it’s time for the fun part! You can top it with a streusel made with pecans and maple syrup (my favorite!) and/or natural marshmallows. It’s even delicious without any topping if you prefer a healthier version.
If you want to make the pecan streusel, make it while the casserole is baking. In a small bowl, mix together one cup of pecans, one tablespoon of maple syrup, two tablespoons butter, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Set aside until ready to use.
When the casserole is done baking, remove it from the oven and set the oven to its broil setting. Top the casserole with the pecans and/or marshmallows and place under the broiler for a couple minutes to toast. Enjoy!

For me, it’s when I’m either pressed for time, on the go, or in a place with no healthy food options. Especially this time of year, when we are traveling to visit with family and running around like crazy trying to get a million things done. It’s HARD to find healthy, filling snacks when you’re out and about. Think about when you’re at…
There are times when it feels like you only have TWO options:
This isn’t your fault… When all the available food choices are full of additives and sugar, what are you supposed to do?
When I used to travel a lot for work, I went to great lengths to bring healthy food and snacks with me. Now, I always keep a quick and easy snack in my purse, because I never know when I’ll need it. And I know I’m not the only one. A friend told me, “When I travel I put my Protein Powder in ziplock bags, and I get really weird looks!”
That’s why I think you’ll appreciate this new product is available NOW…

https://foodbabe.com/how-the-food-industry-tries-to-silence-us-my-appearance-on-cnn/,How The Food Industry Tries to Silence Us (My Appearance on CNN…),"I got a request to be on CNN last Sunday night asking me to discuss the romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak. But here’s the crazy thing…
My appearance on national TV really pissed off some people. And no – not because it was on CNN. (My stance on national media has always been to take the opportunity to spread the truth, no matter what outlet).
So why would anyone be enraged that I went on TV to talk about lettuce?

Let me explain…
There are a band of food industry people who follow my every move and do whatever they can to bring our movement down. This includes people who work with Big Food and chemical corporations and public relations firms who represent these companies. They don’t want an activist like me to have an audience and to tell people the truth about our food supply. This threatens their profits… and when you are a threat, you become a target. It can be scary at times, but I do my best to not let it sway me.
So after my appearance on CNN last weekend, I found myself again being targeted with a tactic called “astroturfing”. This is something they have done to me in the past, often after I make a big public appearance or launch a successful campaign or petition.
When an astroturf campaign is launched, it will look like there are swarms of people on one side of the issue, when in all actuality, it is a small group of people working together backed by public relations firms or special interest groups. Astroturfing is designed to shape and distort media messages to fit a industry-friendly narrative and manipulate public opinion.
For instance, when we petition a Big Food company and ask them to drop a harmful additive from their food, hundreds of social media profiles (some real, some fake) are activated and flood Facebook with messages in opposition to what we are asking the company to do. When we asked In-N-Out Burger to stop the routine use of antibiotics, several profiles came to In-N-Out’s Facebook Page and told them specifically not to change and not to listen us “fear mongers.” The same happened when we wrote about the risky additives in Boar’s Head deli meats and asked them to improve.
Astroturfing also happens behind the scenes and off of the pages of social media. When I am invited to speak at events, a swarm of social media profiles spam the organization who invited me to speak. When I was on the cover of Experience Life magazine and when Yahoo Health featured me in some videos, they tracked down the editors of these publications and swamped them with complaints. It appeared on the surface that the complaints were coming from dozens of separate individuals, but it was actually a small group of people working together to make it appear that way.
The shocking insults and name-calling…
The relentless bullying…
The defamatory allegations…
The canned “industry-friendly” responses…
After you’ve seen it a few times, it becomes glaringly obvious.
It encourages people to talk smack about a person – like Dr. Oz is a “quack” and Food Babe is a “fearmonger” – versus the real issues of having Roundup weedkiller in our food and artificial dyes in our mac n’ cheese. They fear an honest discussion with what’s wrong with these chemicals in our food.
An astroturfing campaign was kicked off by a woman who calls herself “Farm Babe” (wonder where she came up with that name?!). She is a conventional farmer who has worked as a “social media influencer” for Domino’s Pizza, Arctic Apples (GMO), Tyson Foods, and Elanco (maker of livestock drugs). She writes a regular column in Ag Daily – a publication backed by Monsanto and Bayer. Numerous makers of conventional farm feed and GMOs have hired her to speak at their events. She is literally working directly with Big Food and Ag brands. She also has a personal stake in the industry. On her farm she grows corn, soybeans, alfalfa and raises conventional beef on a feedlot that uses grains and growth hormones.
She works with many of the big players in Ag who are proponents of factory farming – something I want to change – so of course, she does not like what I stand for. So it was no surprise that she posted this on her Facebook page after my appearance on CNN:


I’ll address her comments about sewage sludge and antibiotics, but as you see below, her post engaged a swarm of people to send emails to CNN to complain about me and tell them to never have me on their network. Here are just a handful of responses to her post:



As you can see – there were swarms of people contacting CNN about my appearance.
I don’t know exactly how she got wind of it – but if I was a betting woman (and in this case, I would love to take a bet if I someone is daring enough to come forward to tell the truth about what happened here) – I would bet she was tipped off by Farm Babe herself or other industry-aligned people with an agenda.
The journalist Tanya Basu tried to fact check what I said – but instead FAILED miserably…
In fact she completely disregarded what I said and made up a narrative that suited the FDA’s response.
On CNN, I said I choose whole heads of lettuce (over bagged cut lettuce) because there are fewer points of potential contamination. I also made it clear that this wouldn’t always eliminate the risk and that you cannot wash E. coli off of contaminated lettuce.
I said I like to minimize the touch points in the supply chain when I make food choices. The less processing a product goes through, the better. And this isn’t wrong – especially when it comes to lettuce.
Lettuce is known to be particularly tricky when it comes to food safety as everything ranging from “production practices, harvesting, packing, processing and food handling have all been linked to illnesses associated with leafy greens. E. coli can get into food through manure, contaminated water used during growing or harvesting, or improper food handling at a store, restaurant or home”. Buying a whole head of lettuce does minimize these touch points.
She went on to state that some scientists have said my “hatred of additives” is rooted in “anti-science” and “perpetuates myths”. To back up this statement, she quotes Kevin Folta criticizing our successful campaign to remove azodicarbonamide from Subway’s bread. It is irresponsible that she uses this argument for two reasons. One – scientists do back up the fact that azodicarbonamide breaks down into carcinogens when baked. Secondly – Kevin Folta was the scientist quoted who is a known shill for the chemical industry.
Also, I am correct in stating that the overuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs that can’t be treated with antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization, “The high volume of antibiotics in food-producing animals contributes to the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, particularly in settings of intensive animal production… Many of the bacteria (such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli) carried by animals can also cause disease in people. These bacteria, which are frequently antimicrobial-resistant, can contaminate our food supply from farm to fork, such as through slaughtering and processing. Fruits and vegetables may also be contaminated by such bacteria at the farm or later through cross-contamination.”
As you can see, they try to mince my words on purpose to try to destroy my credibility.
What a journalistic fail on this writers fault. She does a real disservice to public safety by spending her time attacking me.
They want to control the narrative – so that everything you see on TV, in the news, on billboards, and on food packages is pro-processed food, pro-chemical, pro-Big Ag, and pro-Big Food.
I refuse to let them silence me. I will not back down from telling people who will listen what I know. And plenty of people are listening. And this is WHY I wrote my new book Feeding You Lies.
I know these types of attacks will be ramping up as this book is hitting stores in a few short months. In the book, I go into greater detail on the many different ways the industry pulls stunts to fool the public (and the media). It’s eye-opening and you need to know what’s going on!

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-travel-with-a-baby-still-eat-organic-food/,How To Travel With A Baby & Still Eat Organic Food,"One of the biggest joys in my life is traveling. Now that I’m a mom, that hasn’t changed – and even more so, as I want to show my daughter the world. I have taken a lot of trips since she has been born and I always take her with me. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, trying to always eat 100% organic while traveling would make me go crazy. Unless I’m traveling to a place like New York or California where everything is at your fingertips, it isn’t always possible. I’ve had to remind myself over and over again that the joys and experience of travel outweighs eating organic which relaxes my anxious mind when I think about all the things I know about our food. Once you learn something you can’t unlearn it… but you can just grin and bare it, right? haha.
My rule of thumb is when I’m in control and have the choice, I’ll choose organic. But if I don’t have the choice, then I’ll make sacrifices. The same goes for naps. I know Harley will be perfectly fine if she misses a nap and gets a little off her normal routine. During travel delays and other unexpected situations, Harley always surprises me! She is a trooper!

Pictured above: Napping at the Nassau Airport after our flight got delayed 5 hours, Harley in a suitcase at 3.5 months old in St. Barts, and Harley checking out the cockpit in Denver.
Before I had kids, I heard many parents complain of the hassles of travels and I’ve had to consciously drown out their voices in my head. Some have been so negative, that they choose to not go anywhere with their kids. Of course, it takes work and there is a lot of preparation and special things you need to pack, but I believe the joys of taking my child to see a new place with their own eyes and experience it for the first time so far outweighs any hassle it takes to travel. (Like my in-laws always tell me – to enjoy the good things in life, it takes work) Watching Harley see a sea turtle for the first time in the Bahamas (and a stingray and shark!) was pretty amazing – and also for her to come home with this new vocabulary was so awesome. Her making a little fish face and expressing her excitement over what she saw… that is worth everything.

Pictured above: Celebrating my birthday in the Bahamas at Baha Mar
The first big trip we took with Harley was to the French West Indies for two weeks when she was about 3 1/2 months old. It was a very easy trip because her food source was on me and it was easy to breastfeed her on the plane, which helped keep her calm and happy the whole flight. And, basically whenever we went to restaurants she would either breastfeed or just stay in my arms or in my wrap – she was very portable and the easiest to travel with at this age.

Pictured above: Our first trip as parents to the French West Indies – St. Barts
Traveling with her became more complicated when she started really eating solid foods (around 9-10 months). Around that time we took a work trip to L.A. and have made many trips since then – and so I’ve learned several things about what works well (and what doesn’t) when we travel. I’ve managed to keep her super healthy and eating as clean as possible by following these tips…

We go everywhere with this travel high chair – it’s awesome.

https://foodbabe.com/why-i-almost-stopped-writing/,Why I almost stopped writing.,"I almost let corruption win.
When I started revealing how big food manipulates us, I thought everyone would be happy. And most people were.
But what about the companies we demanded change from? They were mad. And before I knew it, I became the target of a national smear campaign.
They called me a quack, a fearmonger, and a pseudoscientist. And they threatened me.
All I wanted to do was show people how to live a healthier life, and there I was. Getting death threats.
I became a mom, and I didn’t know whether it would be safe for me and my family. So, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to publish my new book…


…but then I realize it’s not just about me and my family. It’s about all of us. It’s about you. Your friends. Your children. Your family. And that’s why I knew I had to finish my book Feeding You Lies.
And wow. Yesterday was one of the best days ever. My book is finally available for pre-order, and seeing your reaction gives me hope…
“I am blown away that you wrote a book instead of cowering, it shows amazing courage” – Tammy“Just pre-ordered my copy. Thanks for taking this on!” – Elaine
“We are all with you! Fight the good fight!” – Pam
“We’ve have learned from you so much and continue to learn. We look forward to your new book!” – Ozzie
“LOVE IT! PREORDERED DONE!!!! Thank you Vani for sticking your neck out there. We are RIGHT BEHIND YOU!!! Xxx” – Lindsey
“Keep up the good work. Don’t let them stop you. Personally I have learned from you and I look forward to what’s new from FOODBABE. You have helped open my eyes and made me more inquisitive. Thank you for fighting.” – Sandi
“You got your army behind you! Thanks for all that you do to make us live a healthier life”– Jessica
Thank you so much.
Pre-ordering is very important in the book world.
It sends a signal to bookstores everywhere that they should carry Feeding You Lies when it comes out in February.
It also helps to ensure that bookstores are stocked up with enough copies. We need to get this book into the hands of more people, as quickly as possible, when it hits stores.

Feeding You Lies

It’s so exciting to see this book come to life. It was a VERY emotionally draining book to write – but it had to be done.
I could not sit on the piles of information I’ve been compiling over the last 4 years and just keep it to myself. I want you to know everything that I now know about WHY and HOW the food industry manipulates us.
Even more so, I want to show you how to identify their lies, so you can move past them into a healthier way of life.
It’s not like any diet or health book you’ve ever read…
Feeding You Lies isn’t only a manifesto that recounts the sins of the food industry. I go beyond that…
I give you ACTION STEPS that protect you from cheap, processed, unhealthy foods and the health problems and suffering they cause.
I provide you with the knowledge you need to make informed decisions.
I help you overcome the obstacles standing in the way of your taking greater responsibility for your health.
I help you dig deeper and look for evidence of deception in today’s food world.
I help you take control of your life—and change it for the better.
Thank you SO much!!! Please forward this email to your loved ones to let them know about this book too.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/i-am-going-to-be-attacked-for-writing-my-next-book-feeding-you-lies/,I am going to be attacked for writing my next book: Feeding You Lies,"I was naive when I started blogging on Food Babe back in 2011.
I thought everyone would be happy about what I wrote because I was helping people.
I had no idea that my investigations into the food industry would produce such a firestorm.
I thought if I just told the truth on my blog, everything would get better.
I thought the food industry would change because people would demand it once they learned the truth.
After we succeeded in changing dozens of food company ingredients and food practices for the better, we (the Food Babe Army) became a TARGET. Droves of critics were unleashed to take me down. They were organized by people with deep pockets, with a mission to protect the billion-dollar processed food and chemical industry.
Now that I look back, I see how ignorant I was to think that nothing would happen to me.
This group of critics weaseled their way into major newspapers all over the place, and said horrible things about me (that I was crackpot and a bimbo, and worse). This was done to damage my credibility and to make me look like an uneducated crazy person.
And at the time, reporters believed that these critics of mine were independent experts – without financial ties to the food industry – and so they allowed them to be the antagonist in these stories about me as an activist.
At first, I couldn’t pin down exactly what was going on. I had my suspicions, of course, but I couldn’t really prove that these people were getting money from the industry.
And then slowly, but surely, the truth started to reveal itself.
I submitted freedom of information act (FOIA) requests and received hundreds of internal emails. I met with someone who admitted he had edited my Wikipedia page, because he was paid by a firm to discredit my work. I talked to other experts and went behind the scenes to really figure out more about what was going on.
My eyes were opened to a whole world of corruption…
What I have now found, is compelling evidence showing how these critics were connected to and were taking money from the food and chemical industries. I also uncovered how the industry will stop at nothing to keep their unhealthy products on the market, even if it means lying repeatedly to the public.
And, this series of events led me to realize that… whoa, there are SO MANY LIES that the food industry has told us over the years. They manipulate us to buy their products and they use dirty tactics just like what the tobacco industry has done. I had an epiphany. I knew I had to tell people all about this.
I knew I had to get this out to the public and my next book was born…
This book – which I call FEEDING YOU LIES – is being printed this week and getting ready to hit bookstores in just a few months. It is not something that has ever been written before. It’s told from my perspective and shares personal stories on how I figured out the lies that needed to be exposed.
When I decided to write this book, I was pregnant and pitched it to publishers, and by the time I got a publisher and was ready to write it, my baby was born. I spent the last two years becoming a mom, trying to figure out how to raise my daughter and continue being an activist. And, now that she is almost 2, I am back.
I’m ready to get back in the fight again. Now is the right time for this book to come out.
Certain individuals and companies do NOT want their lies to be published and that’s why I know this book is going to really open me up to attacks.
And to be honest, this will not be easy for me. That’s why I really need your support.
The best way you can support my new book is by pre-ordering a copy. The book will be shipped to you on its release date on February 19, 2019, so you will get to be one of the very first people to read it!

Feeding You Lies


The reason why pre-ordering the book is so helpful is that this sends a signal to bookstores everywhere that they should carry FEEDING YOU LIES when it comes out in February. We need to get this book into the hands of more people, as quickly as possible, when it hits stores.
I really want every single one of you to pre-order this book and to tell your local bookstores to carry it. That is the only way we are going to get it out there…
The media likely won’t be reporting about it. Do you think that the morning shows are going to have me on their network while their sponsors are Kellogg’s and General Mills?
I’m not going to rely on traditional media to get this book out…
I’m going to be relying on you.
I’m relying on you to help get this book into the hands of more people.
This will continue to educate the public about the lies of the food industry and let them know how they’ve been duped. We exposed their dirty ingredients in the first book, and we are exposing their dirty tactics in the second.
Many food corporations have NO DESIRE to help us be healthy. They want to continue selling us their sugary, toxin-ridden products. There is nothing admirable about selling food that makes people sick. Just like we got major multi-billion dollar corporations to change in the past, we will do it again when their lies are finally revealed in this book.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart for supporting the pre-order of this book, asking your local bookstores to carry it, and for sharing this with your friends. You are courageously helping me stand up to the Big Food industry that always puts their profits over people. It needs to stop.

https://foodbabe.com/the-healthiest-vanilla-protein-powder-is-now-available/,The Healthiest Vanilla Protein Powder Is Now Available!,"Earlier this year when my new company Truvani launched our Chocolate Plant-Based Protein Powder, the #1 thing people asked me was, “When will you make Vanilla?”
I couldn’t have agreed more. I really WANTED a vanilla protein powder too.
And, I’m so excited to let you know that vanilla is now available!


If you’re wondering why it took us a little while to come out with this vanilla version, let me share some behind-the-scenes of what it took to make this product…
You see, just like all Truvani products, we wanted to create the best tasting organic plant-based protein powder with the CLEANEST ingredients. We focus on using real whole food to make our products and we weren’t sure if we could pull it off for Vanilla. There were two reasons why:
First…
The price of Vanilla Bean – how you get the “real” taste of vanilla – skyrocketed, and we were worried that it would force us to charge too much for a Vanilla Plant-Based Protein Powder.
Most other brands would use “natural flavors” to get a vanilla flavor at a fraction of the cost. We refuse to cut corners like that!  We’d have to use the real stuff – vanilla bean. And that would drive the price of the product up too much.
Second…
We weren’t sure if people would like the “real” taste of vanilla. As we started to share our Vanilla Protein Powder with people, they kept saying: “It tastes great. But it’s not the vanilla I’m used to…”
And they were right. It wasn’t a vanilla “natural flavor” engineered in a laboratory. It was Vanilla Bean… or as we like to call it… real vanilla.

However, back in September we had a big breakthrough.
The person in charge of product formulation sent me a sample. I opened it, I smelled it and was immediately overcome by the aromatic scent of real vanilla. I couldn’t believe it – it smelled so good!
As I mixed it into water, and took the first sip… I knew we had a winner.

It smelled great.
It tasted great.
It’s awesome.
It’s only made with 5 simple ingredients: Organic Pea Protein, Organic Pumpkin Seed Protein, Organic Chia Seeds, Organic Vanilla Powder, Organic Monk Fruit. (Yes, that’s it!)
I’m sure you’ll love it to…
And, I’m so confident that you will that we have a “love the taste guarantee.” You can try it, and if you don’t love it, email our support team and we’ll issue you a refund.
The best part?
We pushed back on our ingredient suppliers so that we’d be able to offer this REAL VANILLA organic protein powder at a reasonable price (this also allowed us to LOWER the price on our chocolate protein powder. Amazing right?)
Truvani’s VANILLA Plant Based Protein Powder will ship the week of November 19, 2018 and is available to order now…
I can’t wait to hear what you think of our new Vanilla Plant Based Protein!

https://foodbabe.com/they-say-mcdonalds-is-removing-artificial-ingredients-but-the-menu-is-still-full-of-them/,They Say McDonald’s Is Removing Artificial Ingredients – But The Menu is Still Full Of Them!,"This story about McDonald’s was all over the news… Did you see it? Here are some headlines:
“McDonald’s removing artificial additives from its burgers” – CNN Money
“McDonald’s burgers: New recipes remove artificial ingredients” – CBS News
“McDonald’s Nixes Artificial Ingredients from Its Burgers” – Food & Wine
Sounds pretty good, right? At first, I was very intrigued.
But after doing a little digging, I got ticked off by these news stories.
These types of headlines can lead people into believing that McDonald’s has made sweeping changes and that their food is no longer made with artificial ingredients but that is FAR from the case, as I’ll demonstrate below.
High fructose corn syrup is still in ALL of the classic McDonald’s burgers.
McDonald’s didn’t remove high fructose corn syrup from the ketchup or Big Mac Sauce that they put on their classic burgers.
And that’s not all these news stories left out…
The “new” ingredient list at McDonald’s is a who’s who list of ingredients to avoid. Artificial dyes, artificial flavors, artificial emulsifiers, and artificial preservatives are still very DOMINANT on their menu.


I’ve written about the artificial emulsifiers DATEM and Mono-and-Diglycerides in the past. These two ingredients are not exactly safe because they can contain trans fats. Trans fats have been linked to heart disease and the CDC has attributed them to up to 7,000 coronary heart disease deaths each year in the U.S.
You’ll find these artificial emulsifiers in essentially all of the sandwiches at McDonald’s… the Quarter Pounder, Big Mac, Cheeseburger, Hamburger, McChicken, McMuffins – every McDonald’s sandwich made on with a sesame seed bun, regular bun, english muffin, or artisan roll.
The pickles on almost every McDonald’s burger contain the emulsifier Polysorbate 80. A 2015 study links Polysorbate 80 to significant weight gain and inflammatory bowel disease. This is NOT a necessary ingredient in pickles… the ones I buy sure don’t have it! And, they are artificially preserved with Potassium Sorbate, which some evidence finds to be genotoxic to white blood cells.

McDonald’s can get away with saying it contains no “artificial colors” because the industry considers caramel color “natural”… but I sure don’t! Caramel color is typically made in a laboratory by reacting corn sugar with ammonia and sulfites under high pressure and temperature. When caramel color is made like this, it produces the byproduct 4-Mel. A U.S government funded study found that feeding mice caramel coloring IV (which contained 4-Mel) increased their risk of developing lung cancer and leukemia, at every dosage level. And the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies 4-Mel as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”.
To be fair, there are safer forms of caramel color available for the industry to use. Which is why I gave McDonald’s the benefit of the doubt and asked them what type of caramel color they use. I was told that this information is “proprietary and not available”. (I’ll leave it up to you to decide whether you think they use a safer version after that response!)
The bottom line is that caramel color is totally UNNECESSARY and POTENTIALLY RISKY. It’s only used to add a brown color… and does McDonald’s really need to color their “special sauce” brown to make their customers happy? I doubt it. This is the same ingredient that we campaigned Starbucks to remove from their drinks – and they did! If Starbucks can do it, I know McDonald’s can too.
Back when I investigated McDonald’s in 2015, they used the artificial preservative BHA in 10 menu items. BHA has now been removed. Gone is also the propyl gallate and TBHQ. The artificial dough conditioner azodicarbonamide (yoga mat) was used in nearly all of their buns – and now it’s only in one (a “bakery style bun” that may be used in some locations, but is not a core item). These are big wins!
…and, that’s because they did not contain artificial colors to begin with!
McDonald’s really only adds artificial dyes (like Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40, Blue 1) to some shakes and the Frappe Mocha. And, they still do today…

You’ll find artificial dyes in McDonald’s EggNog Shake, Shamrock Shake, and Frappe Mochas. As I’ve written many times before, these dyes are derived from petroleum and linked to health issues ranging from cancer to behavioral issues in children. They have no business being in our food.


McDonald’s is once-again ranked as the #1 most popular fast food chain in America, surpassing everyone else in sales. This means a lot of Americans are eating there – even if you don’t.
No one should be eating these risky ingredients at the most popular fast food restaurant in America. Don’t you agree?",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/what-my-toddler-eats-in-a-day/,What My Toddler Eats In A Day…,"Feeding my daughter Harley real organic food has been one of my highlights as a Mom. From the very start, I’ve had so much fun introducing as many vegetables as possible to Harley and teaching her about where her food comes from. We started a large vegetable garden when she was first born and now picking the vegetables is one of her favorite activities. We love to visit farms in the spring and fall to pick fresh produce and see farm animals. She definitely takes after my Mother and my husband – who both love to garden! And the obsession is serious – she bangs on the front windows of our home screaming to go outside and “pick matos!” from the large above ground wooden planters we have. Mato is her name for tomato at the moment 🙂

I exclusively breastfed Harley for 6.5 months before introducing solid food (and still breastfeeding as she turns 21 months). Avocado was her first food and I continued with various vegetables before I exhausted the options and then introduced all the fruits, some meats, eggs, oats and quinoa. At the moment, she does not tolerate dairy too well but loves almond butter – so I plan to make her fresh almond milk one day soon.
Here’s what a typical day in the life looks like in terms of what Harley eats. Please note – she doesn’t always finish her plate, but this is what she starts with and what I offer her. Also – I usually serve the meal in courses, unless we are in a hurry to get somewhere or running late. And keep in mind, she still breastfeeds first thing in the morning, several times throughout the day, and before bed. I serve all of her meals with water.

Breakfast is always what we are eating, plus a few of her favorites. I love making steel cut oats in a crockpot overnight on low so it’s ready to roll first thing in the morning. She loves them and I love them.
We always pair it with some ground flaxseeds, cinnamon and fruit – her favorite is pomegranate seeds and blueberries. For her egg muffins, I follow this recipe but leave out the cheese. I also bake them in mini silicone cups (which prevents sticking and makes them easy to store in the freezer). I thaw them out in our toaster oven at 300 degrees for 6 minutes.

Pictured: Steel cut oats with pomegranate seeds, 1/4 of a banana, and an egg muffin made with red peppers and onions.
Snack #1 is usually leftover breakfast. A lot of days, Harley is so full from nursing first thing in the morning, she will just eat a little of her breakfast. Instead of throwing away her food, we’ll offer it to her again as a snack and then usually thaw out one buckwheat pancake – I make a bunch and freeze them separated by parchment paper. I use this store-bought mix, but add an extra egg and add one mashed banana to the mixture instead of honey.
Lunch on this day was one steamed vegetable, some type of bean and her favorite pasta and some fruit. If she is still hungry, she’ll dig out of my salad bowl till she’s satisfied (I almost always have a salad for lunch these days, or I’ll offer her some avocado or almond butter (she eats it by the spoonful!)

Pictured: Steamed yellow squash and lima beans with grass-fed butter, and Tolerant elbow macaroni with Yellow Barn pasta sauce, and a side of grapes.
Snack 2# happens after she wakes up from her nap. She likes to nurse and then have a mini zucchini muffin plus some fruit (watermelon balls are the current favorite). Harley also started eating rice crackers recently, and likes to dip those in almond butter. She loves organic dried fruit like goji berries and golden berries and will ask for most snacks by name and knows what she wants!
For Dinner we always almost eat the exact same meal as Harley. On this day, I made wild salmon, quinoa, sautéed purple cabbage and sautéed kale in olive oil and she had some frozen peas, raspberries and pomegranate seeds for dessert.

https://foodbabe.com/13-proven-health-benefits-of-turmeric/,13 Proven Health Benefits of Turmeric,"Years ago, I had a bad fall and injured my tailbone. It was one of the WORST pains I’d ever experienced. All the nerves surrounding my spine and lower back felt like they were on FIRE…Yoouuch!!!
I was traveling for work at the time, and had to be pumped full of morphine just to get on the plane back home. I was bedridden for 3 weeks and miserable. I desperately tried every natural remedy I knew about to bring down the inflammation… and some things worked better than others.
One of the most effective herbal supplements I took was a daily turmeric supplement. Thankfully, after several more weeks of turmeric supplements, acupuncture, and taking it easy, my tailbone had a full recovery.
This was the first time I experienced for myself how powerful turmeric is. I’ve since learned that turmeric is even more amazing, and that it is literally PACKED with health benefits that can improve your skin, your heart, your mood, and even your waistline!
To show you how remarkable this spice is, here’s a breakdown of research on 13 proven health benefits of turmeric.


Turmeric is Anti-Inflammatory: The active ingredient in turmeric is curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory that helps maintain healthy inflammation responses.
The typical western diet (think lots of processed foods, sugar, and alcohol) leads to what is called “chronic inflammation” in the body. Doctors believe this inflammation is a silent killer, because it sets the body up to be the perfect host for diseases like heart disease (1), cancer (2), Alzheimer’s, and even obesity (3).
That’s why you want to do everything you can to bring down inflammation, including eating more unprocessed whole vegetables and fruit along with specific spices (like turmeric) and herbs known to fight inflammatory responses.
One of the main anti-inflammatory components of turmeric is called curcumin (4), which one scientific study found to be as effective as some over-the-counter drugs (5) in bringing down inflammation in the body. The researchers actually found that aspirin and ibuprofen (active ingredient in Advil) were the LEAST effective out of all of the anti-inflammatory compounds they studied.
Turmeric Supports Healthy Joints: Beneficial in promoting overall joint health and mobility.
As the curcumin in turmeric is an anti-inflammatory, it can benefit the joints and help keep them from getting inflamed and swollen. This was demonstrated in a scientific study (6) on rheumatoid arthritis patients. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes painful swelling in the joints. Researchers found that 500 mg. of daily curcumin was more effective than the prescription drug Diclofenac when given to RA patients.
When it comes to taking turmeric for your joints, it was shown most effective when taken before symptoms kick in (7), as a preventative measure to keep your joints healthy, pain-free, and mobile. But some studies have demonstrated it can help treat osteoarthritis (8) (a degenerative disease of the joint) as well.
Turmeric Promotes Heart Health: The properties support the overall health of the cardiovascular system.
There are several lifestyle factors and conditions in the body that can lead the heart disease – which is the #1 cause of death in the world. As discussed earlier, chronic inflammation plays a major role in heart disease, so taking turmeric as an anti-inflammatory can help prevent heart disease (9) and heart attacks (10).
One of the most interesting benefits of curcumin is how it can improve the lining of blood vessels (known as the endothelium). When the endothelium isn’t working properly, it can’t properly regulate blood pressure and clotting, which can lead to heart disease (11).
We’ve all heard that exercise is good for the heart, right? One study showed that taking curcumin is as effective as aerobic exercise (12) at improving vascular endothelial function.
Turmeric Encourages Healthy Cholesterol Levels.
High cholesterol is known to be caused by oxidative stress (13), brought on to the body by chronic inflammation and high blood sugar. So, again, reducing inflammation in the body supports healthy cholesterol levels.
One study found curcumin comparable to prescription drug Lipitor (14) on endothelial dysfunction in reducing in inflammation and markers of oxidative stress. An earlier animal study (15) showed similar results on the body.
One study of human volunteers found that taking 500 mg. of daily curcumin dropped their total cholesterol by 11.63% (16), while their HDL (the “good” cholesterol) went up 29% in just 7 days.
Turmeric Boosts Stress Tolerance: As an adaptogen, it helps counteract the adverse effects of everyday stress on the body.
If you feel stressed, adaptogens should be your new best friend! In herbal medicine, some botanicals are termed “adaptogens”, which means they have the ability to modulate the release of stress hormones from the adrenal glands. This can help you adapt better to physical and emotional stress and be more resilient to anything that comes your way. They also help to keep your hormones balanced.
The curcumin in turmeric is a known adaptogen that has the ability to decrease the secretion of stress hormones in the body (17). In 2011, researchers in India found that turmeric had several adaptogenic properties that help with body weight, memory, blood sugar, and moreover that it helps the body maintain healthy stress hormone levels (18).
Turmeric Supports Weight Loss: Curcumin can positively influence weight management in overweight people.
Elevated stress can cause sudden weight gain. When stress hormones (cortisol) get out of whack, fat accumulates near the stomach (19) because the cells in the stomach are more sensitive to cortisol, and very effective at storing energy. As turmeric can help you balance your stress hormones, it can help stop that extra spare tire from forming around your waist.
The anti-inflammatory properties in curcumin are able to fight obesity too. One study actually found that taking curcumin can reduce the growth of fat cells (20)!
Turmeric Supports Healthy Metabolism: Aids in maintaining normal blood sugar levels.
Turmeric has been used to treat diabetes (21) in Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine for years. A 2013 review of scientific studies (22) found that curcumin stabilizes glucose levels in the blood and also helped with complications related to diabetes. In one study, 100 overweight people with type 2 diabetes took either 300 mg. of curcumin or a placebo for 12 weeks. The researchers found that those taking curcumin had significantly lower fasting blood glucose (23).
There is promising research suggesting curcumin may reduce the risk of developing diabetes in high risk people too. In a 2012 study, all participants who took curcumin extract for 9 months didn’t develop diabetes (24), although they were prediabetic. While 16% of the prediabetic participants who took a placebo did develop diabetes after the 9 months.
Turmeric Optimizes Vitality: Its powerful antioxidant properties fight excess free radicals in the body that can damage cells and diminish health.
Antioxidants zap free radicals in the body that can lead to cancer, neurodegenerative disease and other disorders. With all of the processed “dead” foods that creep their way into our diets… we can all use more of antioxidants in our life! The curcumin in turmeric is a powerful antioxidant (25). Even better, curcumin is special in that it’s been shown to boost the antioxidant enzymes (26) in your body, giving you even more benefit (27)!
Turmeric Supports Brain Health: Helps maintain healthy cognitive function and working memory.
Curcumin has the amazing ability to boost a protein in the brain called BDNF (28). This important protein – brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (29) – is responsible for helping the brain grow. It’s been shown to increase neurons and form new connections in the brain – two things we really need as we get older. BDNF builds up the “roadway” in your brain so that neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine can travel more easily where they need to go. Which is why high BDNF levels are linked to better memory (30) and mood… And, when BDNF levels are low, the risk of Alzheimer’s (31) and depression (32) goes up.
Turmeric Promotes Radiant Skin: By providing proper nourishment, it helps your body produce more radiant and healthy-looking skin.
Turmeric is an anti-aging powerhouse (33). Given that it’s an antioxidant – it can fight oxidative damage and boost the overall look of the skin. It’s anti-inflammatory properties help fight the appearance of aging skin (34) as well. A scientific review of studies in 2016 found that turmeric has the ability to improve numerous skin conditions (35) when it’s either ingested or applied directly on the skin.
Turmeric Improves Mood: Curcumin helps to reduces symptoms of mild mood changes.
As the curcumin in turmeric boosts the brain-builder protein BDNF, it may help prevent depression (36). Curcumin can also give a boost to serotonin and dopamine (37) – two “happy” chemicals in the brain. It shows promise for helping people who already have depression too. In one study, 60 people diagnosed with depression were given either Prozac, curcumin, or a combo of the two. Those who took just the curcumin had improvements in their mood on par with Prozac (38) – while those who took both had the best results during the 6 week study.
Soothes Digestion: Reduces symptoms of bloating and gas related to occasional indigestion.
Turmeric has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine (39) to improve digestion and heal gut inflammation – likely due to its nature as an anti-inflammatory. Also the curcumin in turmeric stimulates the gallbladder (40), helping your body produce bile to break down food and improve digestion. One study found that turmeric has the ability to reduce bloating and gas symptoms (41) in people who have indigestion. Some research shows curcumin can help people with ulcerative colitis (42) too – an inflammatory bowel disease that causes sores in the digestive tract.
Reduces Risk of Cancer: Curcumin’s anti-cancer properties may inhibit the growth of tumors and reduce the spread of cancer.
The curcumin in turmeric may be able to slow the development and growth of cancer in the body. Animal research indicates that cucurmin has the ability to actually kill tumor cells (43) and inhibit tumor growth (44). This may prevent cancerous cells from growing (45) in the body.
When it comes to preventing cancer before it starts, one human research study found that taking 4 grams of daily curcumin reduced the number of precancerous lesions (46) in the colon by 40%. The research suggests that curcumin is most beneficial in breast, bowel, stomach, and skin cancer (47).
Curcumin has been shown to enhance chemotherapy (48) treatments for colon cancer. Another 2017 study found that curcumin enhanced tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy (49) in pancreatic cancer, indicating that it is useful in combating chemo-resistance.
Turmeric has been used in ancient medicine for over 4,000 years, going back to when residues of turmeric were found in ancient pots in New Delhi, India. Turmeric is still in use in Ayurvedic medicine today, an ancient medical system that originated in India. It’s medicinal properties and components (primarily curcumin) have been the subject of thousands of peer-reviewed and published studies.
There are three basic forms of turmeric. Each option has its own benefits, depending on what you want to do with it.

What to look for in a Turmeric Supplement:
The primary reason to take a supplement is to provide your body with nutrients that are not already abundant in your normal diet. Ironically however… it’s easy to sabotage your health with supplements if you’re not careful. Look for turmeric supplements that…
(Try the Truvani Daily Turmeric Supplement here)
Fresh turmeric: The best way to store fresh turmeric root is in the refrigerator. You will first want to clean and completely dry the turmeric root. Then wrap the root in a paper towel and place in an airtight container. Fresh turmeric will last 1-2 weeks or more if refrigerated.
Ground turmeric: To store turmeric powder it is important to keep it in a cool, dry place. Ideally this will be in a cabinet or pantry away from heat or excessive light.
Turmeric supplements: Ideally, turmeric tablets should be stored in an amber glass bottle, to provide UV protection. Keep it away from excessive heat and light as much as possible.
Side effects from eating turmeric or taking supplements are rare, but it’s important to know about them. When turmeric is taken in high doses, it may lead to upset stomach, dizziness, or diarrhea. Some people are allergic to turmeric and have an allergic reaction. During pregnancy, turmeric is not recommended because it is associated with stimulating the uterus.
Known drug interactions for turmeric include medications that slow blood clotting, because turmeric is also known to slow blood clotting. So, be careful when taking turmeric with these types of drugs such as such as aspirin, Plavix, ibuprofen, naproxen, and warfarin. Always check with your healthcare provider before taking turmeric.
1. Brew Turmeric tea: Bring 1 cup of water to a boil and then stir in ¼ teaspoon of organic ground turmeric, fresh grated turmeric or an uncoated turmeric tablet. Allow it to simmer for 10 minutes. You can stir in honey or fresh lemon juice for added flavor.
2. Mix up a curry powder: A basic curry powder can be made with 8 parts ground coriander, 4 parts ground cumin and 1 part each of ground turmeric and cayenne or paprika. You can decrease the cayenne and use paprika instead if you don’t want it spicy, and store this in a glass container in your pantry for up to 6 months.
3. Blend it into a smoothie: Add organic turmeric powder, grated root, or uncoated turmeric tablets to a flavorful smoothie and you won’t even taste it! Granted… it may change the color of your smoothie, since it’s got such a strong pigment.
4. Juice it: When making fresh pressed green juice, add in up to 1″ of organic fresh turmeric to your juicer (per serving).
5. Season roasted veggies: Toss some fresh vegetables (like diced potatoes, cauliflower, or brussel sprouts) with a dash of olive oil and ground turmeric, along with any other seasonings you like. Roast at 400 degrees, tossing once until done, usually about 30-40 minutes.
Here are some of my favorite recipes that I cook in my own kitchen with turmeric. Give them a try, I’m sure you won’t be disappointed!

https://foodbabe.com/5-ways-to-naturally-get-glowing-beautiful-skin/,"5 Ways To Naturally Get Glowing, Beautiful Skin","Your skin is your largest organ. It covers and protects everything on your body. How you treat it is incredibly important to your health. However, the skin is one of the most unappreciated organs, and one that I used to totally take for granted, slathering products full of toxic chemicals on it day after day.
I’ve since learned that many of those big-name skincare products were making my problems worse! It’s better to keep your beauty regimen simple and use natural techniques to fight wrinkles, eczema, acne, and other skin issues.
There are some simple healthy habits you can do that help your skin glow from the inside out. Instead of slathering on expensive lotions and potions, add each of these to your regular routine and watch you skin get its glow back!


The average American diet is full of refined carbs and chemical food additives, coupled with residues from plastics, pesticides, and antibiotics from factory farms – all of which destroy healthy bacteria in the gut. You see, not all bacteria is bad. In your gut, you want to have good bacteria to fight off bad invaders.
An imbalance of healthy gut bacteria can show up in your skin, in the form of acne, eczema, rashes, or other ailments. When you get balance back, these skin issues can improve dramatically and your skin will glow from the inside out.
Fortunately, you can easily increase the amount of good bacteria in your gut simply by eating fermented foods. The bacteria found in fermented food is likely more varied, and more easily assimilated in the body than what you can get from most probiotic supplements. Adding these foods to your diet restores healthy bacteria in your gut, which can help improve your skin (and other health benefits as well!)
Fermented foods like kombucha, kimchi, and yogurt are inexpensive to make at home. It can be as simple as making homemade sauerkraut with just cabbage, water and salt. You also might want to try store-bought organic miso paste or tempeh.
Dry brushing from head to toe rejuvenates the skin and stimulates the lymphatic system. It helps make skin glow and keeps it soft without needing to use very much moisturizer. Dry brushing has also been known to improve the appearance of cellulite (temporarily), increase circulation, and unclog your pores.
It’s like a spa treatment, without the expensive spa! You only need to do it about three times per week to see the benefits.
Do this technique with a large dry brush before you shower on completely dry skin. In small circular motions, brush your skin starting at your feet and move up towards your head. Dry brush your stomach last.
After you’re done brushing all of your skin, hop in the shower and use a mild natural soap to cleanse your body. After showering, moisturize with organic sesame oil, olive oil or coconut oil mixed with a little bit of organic body lotion.
Eating refined sugar (the white stuff) makes us age faster than we should and destroys the look of our skin. In a process called glycation, sugar molecules attach to collagen and elastin, two proteins that keep skin looking young, and create Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs). AGEs weaken your skin’s support structure and lead to lines and wrinkles.
Refined sugars processed from cane, corn, or beets, such as table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are the baddest of the bad. These sugars have been chemically stripped of their minerals, so when you indulge in these sugars, you get no nutrition and your body becomes more acidic. Because these sugars are devoid of minerals, they are acid-forming causing inflammation – which leads to skin disorders.
Instead of processed white sugar – use natural sweeteners that don’t cause this skin-wrecking inflammation. These include dates, coconut sugar, honey, maple syrup, or monk fruit.
They don’t call it “beauty sleep” for nothing. Your skin cells renew themselves while you sleep, at almost double the rate as during the day. This is when your skin is repairing itself from the stressors of the day. During deep sleep phases, growth hormones rise in the body that help repair damaged cells and rejuvenate the skin, fighting the aging process. As you sleep, the hydration in your skin is replenished, which plumps it up, hiding fine lines.
When you don’t get enough sleep, not only does your skin not get to properly repair itself, but it doesn’t recover moisture – which leads to dry skin, visible wrinkles, and bags under the eyes. Lack of sleep also causes your cortisol levels (a stress hormone) to rise, triggering inflammation in the body. This inflammation can make skin look dull, and acne, eczema, psoriasis and other skin issues may start to pop up.
Aim for getting 8 to 9 hours of quality sleep each night. To help you get a good night’s rest, turn off the electronic devices and avoid big meals at night – and make your bedroom cool, comfortable, and quiet as possible. Your skin will thank you in the morning!
Collagen is a unique protein that plays an important role in our skin as we age. It’s naturally found in the skin, ligaments, and connective tissue throughout your whole body. It functions like a scaffolding that supports our skin, keeping it nice and smooth.

As we age, our body’s collagen production slows down and research shows that collagen in your skin drops by about 1% every year. Seems small, but this means that by the time you turn 40, you’ve lost more than 30%!
You can start turning back the clock by eating collagen-rich foods. Cutting-edge research suggests that getting more collagen into your system can promote youthful looking skin by supporting skin elasticity.* Collagen fights the signs of aging by helping to maintain the skin’s youthful tone, texture, and appearance.*
This is why I make sure to eat a collagen-rich diet by adding Truvani Wild Caught Marine Collagen Powder to my breakfast.

One of the best ways to add Truvani Collagen to your diet is to mix it in with your morning coffee or tea. You won’t taste the powder. It’s virtually tasteless and dissolves smoothly without clumps in cold or hot water.
Of course, you can also blend it into your smoothie, oatmeal, yogurt, and more. I love adding it to whatever I’m having for breakfast. It’s now become part of my morning routine so I don’t forget to take it.

I hope these tips help your skin shine bright and radiant! As it turns out, beauty does come from the inside – literally. Because when you’re healthy, you feel great about yourself. And when you feel better, it shows.

https://foodbabe.com/the-best-wild-caught-marine-collagen-source-revealed/,The Best Wild Caught Marine Collagen Source Revealed!,"I’m turning 40 soon. And even though I feel better than when I was in my 20’s (yes, really), the subtle signs of aging have caught me by surprise…
The other day I asked my husband, “Did I always have this wrinkle on my forehead?!” And I couldn’t help but think… “Wow. I really am getting older”… even if no one else seems to notice.
I now know more than ever that sticking to healthy daily habits is worth its weight in gold when it comes to aging gracefully.
That’s why I start my mornings with lemon water…exercise…a green drink…and fit in as many superfoods into my diet as I can. This includes a few incredible health supplements.
Truvani Wild Caught Marine Collagen is the newest product in my arsenal that helps me look and feel my best. Why do I love it? Let me count the ways…



Wondering how collagen can help you?
You see, as we age, our body’s collagen production slows down. Like WAY down.

Cutting-edge research suggests that getting more collagen into your system promotes youthful looking skin, healthy hair, stronger nails, and provides support to the body’s connective tissues and joints.*
And these are just SOME of the amazing benefits.
But before you run out and buy a jar of collagen pills, remember this…
Not all collagen supplements are equal.
Truvani’s Marine Collagen Powder comes from the skin of wild-caught fish, fresh off the coast of France and the waters surrounding Iceland as well as the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea, and other cold, Northern waters. The skin is a valuable source of collagen that often goes to waste. So, using it is good for you AND the sustainability of our food system.
Some brands use farm-raised animals, that come contaminated with antibiotics and nasty substances.
We don’t use shellfish or jellyfish, and we don’t source our collagen from questionable “Aquafarms.” This ensures our Marine Collagen is Non-GMO, and you don’t have to worry about forbidden chemicals or antibiotics being present that may have been used by fish farmers. 

Mercury-contaminated fish is a serious concern too.
That’s why we test each source – before it even gets to our facility. Then we test our formula in-house and send the final product out for 3rd-party testing. This is how we ensure our product is safe and contains no harmful contaminants. These rigorous checks are simply part of The Truvani Standard.
And don’t worry – just because Truvani Collagen comes from the skin of fish, it doesn’t mean it will taste fishy! In fact, you can barely taste it at all when you mix it in your coffee, smoothie, or food.

It’s EASY to mix, too. The powder dissolves smoothly and without clumps in hot OR cold liquids.

Plus, there’s no need to pop one of those big, nasty “horse pill” supplements: Add our powder to your morning coffee, tea, or smoothie, and you won’t forget to take  it! Easy peasy.

I love that I am finally able to create the healthy products I always wanted to see in stores, not just for myself – but for you too. My ultimate goal is to give you the tools you need for a healthy and organic lifestyle, allowing you to look and feel your best – for life.
I can’t thank you enough for your support!
Xo,
Vani

https://foodbabe.com/clean-up-your-beauty-routine-how-to-find-safe-makeup-cosmetics/,Clean Up Your Beauty Routine: How To Find Safe Makeup & Cosmetics,"Years ago I took a hard look at all the beauty products I was using daily… everything from my shampoo, to my lotion, to my lipstick. I found that not only were most of them filled with controversial chemicals, but I was using way too many products that were not even necessary. That was a big wake up call.
That’s when I decided to majorly clean up my beauty product routine. I started getting rid of risky products and slowly replaced them with the safest (and simplest) products I could find. I’m happy to say that now my daily routine is super simple and I feel so much better knowing I’m not slathering potentially cancerous chemicals on my skin day after day.
Next time you’re walking down the makeup aisle at the drug store, pick up any cosmetic off the shelf – and you’ll likely find at least one ingredient that is linked to cancer.
Some cosmetics contain ingredients that damage the skin and end up making you look older. Pretty ironic for “beauty” products, right?
That’s because cosmetics are not regulated as strictly as food products. Companies can get away with using these risky ingredients because they have been used for years and there is not enough pressure for them to change their ways. There are safer alternatives, but it all comes down to using the cheapest ingredients to pad their bottom line – even though it comes at the expense of our health.
Just take a look at what’s in some popular products, like Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, which is made with some very risky ingredients linked to cancer…


Quaternium-15 slowly releases small amounts of formaldehyde, a substance which can cause cancer.  The triethanolamine (TEA) is known to react with other chemicals found in beauty products, creating the nitrosamine NDELA – a carcinogen. Parabens (methylparaben and butylparaben) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems.
You’ll also find parabens in CoverGirl’s Clean Professional Loose Powder, but I’d say the worst ingredient in this product is the first ingredient: Talc.

Talc in cosmetics can be contaminated with asbestos, a carcinogen that is especially dangerous when airborne. Talc containing asbestos is linked to lung cancer (when inhaled) and to other cancers near where it has been placed on the body. That’s why you want to avoid using talc-based makeup powders, as it can easily get into the air where you inhale it right into your lungs.
Not all talc is contaminated with asbestos, and I don’t know if CoverGirl’s powders are contaminated, but I would avoid makeup made with talc as a precaution. There are safer alternatives (which I will tell you about below). Talc is a very common ingredient in powders, eye shadows, bronzers, and highlighters… so keep an eye out for it!
Here you’ll find talc as a main ingredient in Neutrogena “healthy skin” concealer – but it also contains a couple other ingredients linked to cancer…

“PEG” compounds in makeup can be contaminated with Ethylene Oxide and 1,4 Dioxane, which are both linked to cancer. Also, the preservative BHT is a suspected endocrine disruptor that can mess with hormones in the body – another risk for cancer.
The preservative methylisothiazolinone is believed to trigger eczema and allergic reactions. According to the EWG, some research suggests that it may be neurotoxic.
One of the most sneaky ingredients you’ll find in cosmetics is “fragrance”. Just like “natural flavors” in our food, cosmetic companies don’t tell you everything that is in these fragrances and they can include highly toxic ingredients, hormone disruptors, and carcinogens. They often contain alcohols, which can irritate sensitive skin and make you appear older.
L’oreal’s True Match Lumi Foundation is filled with FOUR different parabens: methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, and ethylparaben…

One study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology found that methylparaben dried the skin and made it appear more wrinkled, because it decreases collagen levels in the body (which is what makes the skin look young and supple).
This foundation also includes Octinoxate sunscreen, which is an endocrine disruptor that can interfere with thyroid function and may increase risk of breast cancer.
Simple lip balm can be laden with risky chemicals too…
Baby Lips by Maybelline is made with ingredient Petrolatum (petroleum jelly) – a byproduct of petroleum refining. If petrolatum is not properly refined, it may be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) – a group of chemicals that are widely linked to cancer. This ingredient is commonly found in lipsticks, so make sure to check the ingredients in yours.
Be careful about what you wash that makeup off with too…

Most face washes use various sulfate ingredients which create that lathered up foam that makes you feel like you are getting clean… but are not exactly safe. Ingredients like sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) and ammonium laureth sulfate (ALS) may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which is linked to cancer. You won’t see 1,4-dioxane on an ingredient list because it forms during manufacturing and the FDA doesn’t require a warning label.
The preservative DMDM hydantoin slowly releases small amounts of the carcinogen formaldehyde every time you use it. Another substance you won’t find on the label.
I believe exposure to carcinogens even at low levels is unnecessary – especially in products I use daily or often. Here’s how to clean up your beauty routine:

https://foodbabe.com/why-baby-toddlers-hate-vegetables-and-what-to-do-about-it/,Why Babies & Toddlers Hate Vegetables (and what to do about it!),"This post might be a rude awakening for some parents and it’s not meant to be a slap in the face, but I think it’s important to share the truth about foods that are marketed towards babies and toddlers. Especially since eating a processed food diet is the #1 reason why kids don’t like vegetables.
When my daughter started eating solid food, I didn’t buy any jarred baby food. I never bought a single jar of pureed peas, pureed bananas – or any of those other jars of pureed baby food. I also didn’t blend up pureed fruits and veggies at home to make my own homemade “baby food”.
When I tell some people that, I can tell they are confused and wonder what in the world I fed my daughter when she first started on solids.
There is an entire industry dedicated to selling jarred and pureed baby food and parents are led to believe that this is what you are supposed to buy for your baby (unless you make homemade pureed foods). Yet in my experience, babies can start with small soft finger foods and become eaters on their own.
Letting a baby feed themselves after the age of 6 months is called Baby-Led Weaning, and this has worked amazingly for Harley.

Harley eating green beans for the first time

My Advisory Council member, Dr. Jonathan Aviv, studied the ingredients and composition of jarred baby food and discovered that even organic versions are surprisingly acidic compared to whole foods. For instance – a jar of banana baby food contains the additives “citric acid” and “ascorbic acid”, which can turn the entire jar of food acidic About 100 times more acidic than a regular banana! This increased acidity can have an effect on the digestion of food and give your baby acid reflux.
Jarred banana baby food is not the same as a mashed banana.
Dr. Aviv says if you see the ingredients “citric acid” or “ascorbic acid” to be wary, as it can turn the entire contents of the food acidic.

You’ve got Pasta Pick-ups, Lil’ Crunchies, Arrowroot Cookies, and Lil’ Meat Sticks. With these products, the industry is helping put young children on the processed food bandwagon so that it only seems natural to them to eat food from box, bag, or jar. This is the stage that my daughter is at now – and just like I never bought her jarred baby food – I don’t buy these products either. When she sees me or her Dada pick up anything processed, she’s curious and wants a bite too – this is more motivation not to eat processed foods in front of her and keep the junk out of our house.
I was pretty shocked looking at the number of ingredients on the back of this package of this Gerber toddler food…and even more shocked Gerber is allowed to produce food for small children with hidden MSG that stimulates your taste buds to the point of addiction – not to mention the mysterious “flavoring” which could mean anything and the carrageenan linked to digestive issues. Sheesh!

Instead of the additive monosodium glutamate (MSG), the food industry sneaks in other additives – such as “autolyzed yeast extract” and “torula yeast” which contain free glutamic acid – the main component of MSG that makes food addicting. This is a super shady trick by the food industry that allows them to use MSG right under our noses and get us hooked on processed food.

These Gerber Lil’ Crunchies are nothing more than Cheetos for babies. They seriously have almost identical ingredients to Cheetos. Instead of using monosodium glutamate in Cheetos, they sneakily use “Autolyzed Yeast Extract”. This is one of the most infuriating products out there. I’d take heed of that warning to “Keep Package Away From Children” a bit further and run… run far away from these products.

I’m not the only one appalled. A reader sent me this note about Gerber ‘Lil Sticks:
“I found this while grocery shopping for my baby. This was in the baby aisle and can not possibly be healthy. I can’t wait to see what your investigations turn up with baby products… What is Gerber trying to feed our kids?”
Yep… just more MSG-like additives, flavors, and sugar added to conventional processed meat. Yikes. Gerber should be ashamed.

Babies and toddlers can be exposed to a wide variety of vegetables from a young age without having to resort to help from processed food. This isn’t just common sense, it’s backed by science too. Researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine found that a big reason kids don’t seem to like green vegetables is because they are not nurtured to like the flavor and bitterness of them from a young age. While babies naturally love sweets, they need to be exposed to dark green vegetables on a regular basis to learn to love them. The researchers further found that a major contributor to the problem was all of these prepared baby foods out there that don’t prominently contain vegetables. Out of 548 foods they found only 52 of them were single-vegetable products and NONE of them were dark green vegetables.
It’s best to start introducing vegetables right when they begin eating solids, as babies between 4-7 months are the most receptive to new tastes. When very young children eat processed baby and toddler foods they are reinforcing a love for sweet and heavily processed foods instead of for the healthiest foods on our planet… vegetables. And, I can speak from some experience. I’ve been giving Harley vegetables at nearly every meal since the beginning and she already really loves just about every single one… she even picks the kale out of her pasta and eats it before anything else.
A lot of parents love squeezy packs, and I can see why. They are super convenient to travel with, don’t require a spoon, kids love them, have simple ingredient lists, and are easy to find organic. That being said, I don’t buy them for Harley.
From a very young age, children develop habits and start to form opinions about food. Think about this… squeezing pureed pear into your mouth from a sanitary pouch with a spout is nothing like picking up pieces of fresh pear and putting them in your mouth. When you eat real pears, you can see it. You can feel the juicy texture in your fingers and smell it. This helps you to learn more about what you are eating and learn to love real food (versus food that comes in a shiny package with a cartoon character on it). When they see pears in the grocery store, they will start to associate them with the real pears they have been eating at home. If they’ve been sucking pears through a pouch, it’s unlikely they’ll make that connection. Offering real whole foods (whenever possible) is how you help foster healthy eating habits for life.
Quite simply, even if the ingredients are simple, these are not the same as eating real food and not something I would rely on a regular basis.
What is “added refined sugar”? This is processed sugar that is added to a product that isn’t part of a whole food (So, it wouldn’t include the sugar naturally found in a whole banana, for instance). Here are some common examples of added refined sugar you may see on an ingredient list:
You may have heard the guidelines that say that adults are supposed to eat fewer than 25 grams of added sugar per day for good health. Well, it’s even more strict for young children. In fact, it’s recommended that toddlers under the age of two not eat ANY added sugar per day, and that the only “sugar” in their diet should include those naturally found in whole foods.
Yet, the processed food industry doesn’t care – they still add refined sugar to virtually everything. Almost all of the store-bought toddler snacks out there have added refined sugar… even organic ones!

Of course I always preach the gospel of eating mostly homemade, whole foods – and it’s no different when feeding my baby or toddler. But, ever since Harley was born I’ve been getting lots of baby food questions from other new parents out there looking for healthy store-bought options:
“Hi Vani, My name is Tania and I am a first time mom of a beautiful 14 month old girl. Until now she has been enjoying her breast milk and solid foods 3x a day, but as she is getting older and we spend more time outdoors and with other kids, she has gotten really interested on snacking 😕 as she sees all the other kids with Cheerios and cookies… I honestly want to stay away from giving her snacks, but at the same time I want to be able to have options. It is beyond sad to see organic and non-gmo kids food brands to have “natural flavors” to their puffs, bars, etc. Therefore, I wanted to ask you (as a first time mom yourself to such a beautiful baby girl) if you have any recipes for such things or if you have discovered any store brands that you would feel comfortable giving to your daughter! Also, do you use any Food storage containers to keep her baby food warm other than what you shared on a recent post you had? Your help, as always, is greatly appreciated.” ~ Tania
“I was wondering if you had any information about food choices in general for toddler diets (brand to avoid and which ones you recommend)… Any and all info on what to feed our kids would be awesome. Reality is we can’t always travel and be on the go with fresh foods and time is truly a barrier to making my own food for my child. Thank you for everything you do!” ~ Amanda
Thankfully, there are some packaged options that are a better choice and are more convenient than making everything from scratch yourself. And, there are some processed foods that I buy for Harley on occasion. Here are some good options I like:
“My daughter will be going to daycare come September and the daycare she will be attending provides the AM/PM snack. This would be great, however the snacks they provide include cheerios, goldfish, nilla wafers, pretzels, etc. I do not want my daughter eating processed snacks on a daily basis, and I am hoping I can send in my own snacks. However, I don’t want her to feel like she will be missing out. I was hoping you could recommend some alternatives to the snacks listed above that would be better for her but appear similar so she wouldn’t know the difference (she is only 15 months)? Thanks in advance.” ~ Alicia
Whole real fruit should always be an option at day cares and if it’s not, I would lobby the management to start allowing it. But, if you’ve got no other option than packaged food, give these a try (but don’t rely on them on a regular basis when at home and have the choice):
I shared a recipe for healthy Mini Muffins with vegetables that Harley absolutely LOVES. They are so quick to make and stash in the freezer for snacks… it’s almost as easy as processed food! Get the recipe for Harley’s Mini Muffins here.
I hope this helps you find better choices to feed your little ones healthy foods, which will set them up for a lifetime of loving real whole food (instead of heavily processed products in a can, bag, or box). If you know anyone who has a baby, toddler, or is expecting… please share this post with them.

https://foodbabe.com/scientists-said-monsanto-chemical-was-safe-they-were-wrong-it-causes-cancer/,"Scientists Said Monsanto Chemical Was Safe, They Were Wrong. It Causes Cancer.","This is Shocking news. Monsanto was ordered to pay $289 million in damages after a jury found them liable for failing to warn that their weedkiller Roundup causes cancer.
This lawsuit was filed by a California man, Dewayne Johnson, who is suffering from Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma at the young age of 46. He was a school groundskeeper who regularly used Roundup, and the jury decided that Roundup caused his cancer.
The jury also decided that Monsanto KNEW how dangerous Roundup was and failed to warn people about the risk. As Carey Gillam reported, the jurors found “there was “clear and convincing evidence” that Monsanto’s officials acted with “malice or oppression” in failing to adequately warn of the risks.”
The judge echoed that Monsanto “acted with malice, oppression or fraud and should be punished for its conduct”.

Monsanto has tried to hide the dangers of Roundup from the public and regulators for years. In 2015, the World Health Organization’s cancer arm (International Agency for Research on Cancer – IARC) declared the active in ingredient in Roundup, glyphosate, a probable human carcinogen.
When this happened, Monsanto’s PR machine went into full effect. They immediately tried to discredit IARC’s decision and spin the story in their favor.
The media played right into Monsanto’s hands, painting a picture that “experts” around the world believe Roundup is “safe” and that the scientists at IARC were wrong in linking Roundup to cancer.
Perhaps you read this in the news…
“Glyphosate has been widely considered among the safest pesticides” – NPR, March 2015
“You can drink a whole quart” of glyphosate “and it won’t hurt you” – Dr. Patrick Moore in the Huffington Post, March 2015
“Weedkiller suspected of causing cancer deemed ‘safe’” – The Guardian, July 2015
“I can tell you glyphosate is safe. The data that they look at, they cherry pick it and then they interpret the studies completely different than research who actually did it” – Monsanto scientist Donna Farmer to CBS News, June 2016
“U.S. EPA says glyphosate not likely to be carcinogenic to people” – Reuters, December 2017
“Agencies across the world say glyphosate is safe and the IARC report is a flawed analysis” – Gordon Stoner from the National Association of Wheat Growers to Reuters, December 2017
“The chemical is not carcinogenic” and it’s “less toxic than common chemicals like aspirin” – Slate, January 2018
Less toxic than aspirin? REALLY?
How did so many news publications miss the truth?
When the World Health Organization revealed how dangerous Glyphosate (and Roundup) could be to humans, the media quickly took ahold of Monsanto’s talking points.
They listened to the lies fed to them by “experts.” Experts that may have been “paid for” by Monsanto.
I’ve written about Monsanto’s Roundup and its link to cancer numerous times in the past – warning consumers that this chemical has been found in Cheerios and Ritz Crackers, and how Monsanto has been working behind the scenes to cover up its dangers… in cahoots with the EPA… ghostwriting news stories… setting up front groups… hiring trolls on social media… and enlisting “independent” scientists to further their agenda.
All of these moving pieces have been working together with one goal in mind – to fool the public and our regulators so that Monsanto can keep making BILLIONS off of Roundup sales.
It. Is. Disgusting.
This is a personal issue for me, because I’ve been dragged through the mud by people calling me an ignorant fearmonger for writing about the dangers of Roundup and conventional agriculture (which uses Roundup extensively).
Critics of mine have been saying that scientists disagree with my work and that we should trust them because they are the real experts. They branded me “Pseudoscience” because I avoid GMOs grown with Glyphosate and trust information from The World Health Organization.
The truth is: Science is always evolving.
How many times has something been deemed “safe” only to later find that it is making people sick?
Scientists are not always right. Science is sometimes riddled with industry corruption. Scientists sometimes make big, horrible, mistakes.
Just look at what Big Tobacco has done during the last 80 years, as they tried to hide the grave dangers of cigarette smoking from the public. One unethical tactic was advertising with doctors, dentists and nurses recommending packs of Camels and Lucky Strikes. The tobacco industry did this because they knew the public trusted these medical experts and would fall for the tobacco-industry talking points in these ads (the “doctors” weren’t even real doctors!)
Monsanto’s playbook is the same, they use many of the same tactics – and the media has been falling for it… hook, line, and sinker.
Roundup is the new tobacco. Only this time we are all smoking and don’t have a choice. Roundup is the most widely used weed killer in the history of our world – and because of this, we are being exposed to Roundup daily.
It’s in our food. It’s in our water. It’s in the air. It is contaminating our environment on a grand scale. It has now been decided in court that it can indeed cause cancer and that Monsanto has known about this risk for DECADES.
Sure, this $289 million dollar judgment is a drop in the bucket for a multi-billion dollar company like Monsanto… but the tipping point is HERE and I truly believe the END of this company is on the horizon.
The roughly 4,000 pending Roundup lawsuits now have this amazing precedent to back their claims. These cancer victims have a better shot at winning their cases – and could cost Monsanto millions more.
It starts a valid discussion around banning Roundup use in our schools, parks, communities, stores, and even nationally.
More people will now be aware that Roundup is indeed dangerous and will stop buying it. That is the biggest win of all.
After years of being an activist, I realized that big companies will NEVER change. They will continue to line their pockets at the expense of human beings.
And that’s why I started my new company Truvani.
Over the last few years, the Food Babe Army has made tremendous progress against big corporations. But I was tired of sitting back and waiting for them to change.
The world needed a company that cared about the ingredients in their products, and whether or not these ingredients are safe.  And my company Truvani will join the ranks of companies leading the charge. Every Truvani product will be certified organic (where applicable), because Roundup is not permitted to be sprayed on organic crops.
As I know organic crops can still be contaminated with Roundup (it’s so prevalent in our environment), I’m taking it a step further in testing Truvani products for glyphosate to make sure they do not contain excessive levels.
I want to do everything in my power to ensure my products are as clean as possible. This is the standard I believe EVERY company should have… Don’t you? And that’s why it’s so important to find good companies… doing the right thing… and vote with our dollars. Companies that do the right thing need our support, and maybe, one day, these big conglomerates will finally start caring about humans.
I also urge you to buy certified organic food as much as possible. This is currently the most viable way to protect yourself from glyphosate – and other harmful chemicals that are used in conventional food products. It may be more expensive, but I believe it may save you thousands in medical costs down the road. Health is wealth, right?",Food Babe,Unknown

https://foodbabe.com/the-differences-between-artificial-flavors-natural-flavors-organic-flavors-and-other-added-flavors/,"The Differences Between Artificial Flavors, Natural Flavors, Organic Flavors and Other Added Flavors","I bet if you go to your kitchen cabinet right now and pick up the first food package you see, you’ll find the word “flavor” somewhere on the ingredient list. Am I right?
Yep, the processed food industry adds flavors to almost EVERYTHING. When a food is heavily processed with machinery in a factory, pumped full of preservatives, and poured into a package that gets shipped across the country to get stored on a shelf for months it loses flavor. That’s why there is a multi billion dollar flavor industry dedicated to creating chemicals that make all that processed food taste like… well… real food.
Not only do these flavors make fake food taste real, they also give it a special “kick” that keep you coming back for more. The natural and artificial chemicals that flavor manufacturers engineer are contributing to what David Kessler (former head of the FDA) calls a “food carnival” in your mouth. The inability to stop eating because the flavors they have synthesized trick your mind into wanting more and more.
Why do Americans eat more calories than any other industrialized nation? It’s not because we have more money or are more hungry. It’s because our food supply is chemically produced and enhanced with these “flavors” and it’s EVERYWHERE and we are being TARGETED.
You see, they don’t want you to have the full essence of the strawberry – they want you to only experience the best 1 millionth part of the taste – so you get “addicted” and keep having to go back for more and more, searching continuously for gratification – eating more of that product which in turns fills Big Food Companies pockets. The Big Food Companies are “hijacking” your taste buds one by one.
The term “flavors” on a package highly misleading. It sounds innocent and is on SO MANY products that we are desensitized to it. Flavor companies own these proprietary formulas… making it near impossible to find out exactly what’s in them. You’d like to think that “natural apple flavor” is just some juice extracted from an apple and inserted into the food. Nope. That “natural apple flavor” needs to preserved and stabilized and has agents added to help it mix well into a product. This is why flavors can contain upwards of 100 ingredients like propylene glycol, polysorbate 80, BHT, BHA… all considered “incidental additives” not required to be labeled by the FDA. The FDA doesn’t require companies to tell you what is in the flavors they use. It’s a complete mystery ingredient.


The fox is guarding the hen house. You see, a governmental or independent agency does not approve or oversee the safety of the food flavors. Instead, a flavor industry trade group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA), has assembled their own “independent” panel of scientists who review and approve new flavors as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). These scientists are paid by the FEMA trade group (who ultimately get their funding from flavor companies).
And, of course, these FEMA panel scientists are supposed to be independent and free of conflicts of interest, but many questions have been raised about their closed-door evaluations and lack of transparency with the public. The fact that this panel is assembled and paid for by a flavor company trade group is concerning to say the least, don’t you think?
Public advocacy groups have questioned FEMA’s processes and called on the FDA to ban certain flavor substances that have known links to cancer, but little has been done. Some chemicals used to make flavors, like Diacetyl (which is used to make buttery flavor), are highly dangerous for those that work around them… but we are supposed to eat them and be okay? Consumers want to know what’s in these flavors and what research has been done proving their safety, but we essentially get the door slammed in our faces when we ask.
The laws surrounding these flavors are lax to say the least, and companies don’t have to tell you much about what they really are. Labels on food typically just say “natural flavors” or “artificial flavors” and don’t explicitly tell you what differences are between them.
It’s good to know that there are some stark differences between artificial flavors, natural flavors, natural strawberry flavors, organic raspberry flavors, natural essences, organic extracts, etc… And while these are all largely the same, some of the flavors added to food are better than others.
So, if you’re like me and want understand exactly what you’re eating and to know more about what these labels all mean, I created this Flavor Cheat Sheet below to break it all down.

Now let’s go over some real world product examples, let’s start with the worst flavors in our food… Artificial Flavors.
(Note: “X” stands for a specific flavor such as “Strawberry” or “Vanilla”)

Artificial flavors are chemical mixtures made with synthetic (not natural) ingredients in a lab. They’re produced by fractional distillation and chemical manipulation of various chemicals like crude oil or coal tar. Artificial vanilla flavor can be made from wood pulp. With artificial flavors, chemists can make anything taste like a strawberry without any actual strawberries (or any actual food for that matter), which is a really horrible thing if you care about health. But it’s a great thing for food manufacturers because artificial flavors are much cheaper than using real food (or even natural flavors).

Natural Flavor is practically the exact same thing as Artificial Flavor, but it’s derived from substances found in nature (plants, animals, etc). So, the flavor is DERIVED from natural things, but it’s important to remember that this isn’t all it contains. Remember, flavors typically contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other “incidental additives”, which can make up 80% or so of the formulation. Some of the most common incidental additives in flavors include: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol (none of which are labeled).
Chemists create these complex formulations in a lab, isolating and blending specific flavors extracted from upwards of hundreds of compounds, some of which may be GMOs. These compounds can come from substances that are nowhere close to the actual thing. For example, they might take some castoreum from a beaver to make a flavoring that resembles a raspberry – without ever using any raspberries. But, hey, it’s “natural” because it’s from a beaver.

In general, if you see something like “Natural Cinnamon Flavor” this means that the flavor is derived solely from the named fruit, vegetable, animal or plant, which in this case is cinnamon. In other words, if you see “Natural Raspberry Flavor” on a product, the flavor didn’t come from a beaver, but actual raspberries. The reason food companies use this kind of flavoring is because it’s cheaper than using the actual ingredient in it’s raw form. The flavor also can be synthesized to be the best “one millionth” part of the taste of a substance – something definitely not found in nature. Incidental additives still apply, of course.

You’ll see a label like this when there are both natural and artificial flavors in a product. It doesn’t necessarily mean any of the named source (ie. a cherry) is used.

Sometimes on the front of a package you’ll see the statement “Raspberry Flavor With Other Natural Flavor”…which sounds redundant. This means the food contains a flavor derived from raspberries, but ALSO other natural flavors that don’t come from raspberries. This doesn’t need to be disclosed on an ingredient list, but is required on the front panel of package if they want to describe the flavor on the front.

A lot of people have told me they’re surprised that organic foods can contain natural flavors. While it’s not ideal, at least “Organic Natural Flavor” is made just like other organic ingredients and needs to follow the same regulations. That means that organic flavors won’t contain synthetic solvents or preservatives, and no GMOs. Some the the “incidental additives” banned from organic flavors include propylene glycol, mono and diglycerides, BHT, BHA, and polysorbate 80.

Sometimes you’ll just see “natural flavors” listed on a certified organic product (instead of “Organic Natural Flavors”). This means that the flavor itself is not organic, but it is compliant with organic regulations – such as no synthetic ingredients or GMOs. So, ultimately, these flavors will have a cleaner profile than the average natural flavor in a conventional product.

In products that don’t carry the USDA Certified Organic label, but are made with some organic ingredients, they still need to use organic “compliant” flavors. This means the flavors in any product labeled as “Made with Organic” ingredients can only contain flavors that are compliant with organic regulations as far as no GMOs, sewage sludge, or ionizing radiation used, and also cannot contain synthetics or artificial preservatives. However, the flavors themselves do not need to be certified organic.
An essence captures the hint of flavor from a fruit or vegetable. To make a strawberry essence for instance, they may start with a strawberry juice concentrate and heat it to collect the steam and that becomes the essence. It should contain no additives or other ingredients.

An extract is as pure of a flavor you will get and the closest thing to real food. It’s similar to how you could make homemade vanilla extract by putting vanilla beans in an alcohol solution to extract out the flavor. Due to how extracts are produced, they can have some nutrients in them too. Organic Lemon Extract is derived solely from organic lemons and is in compliance with organic regulations (no GMOs, no synthetic preservatives, etc).
I hope this helps you sort out all the added flavors, essences, and extracts in our food.

Easy Protein Oatmeal Packs,"When I used to travel a lot for work, I’d always pack my own food to bring with me…While others ate junky fast food and hotel buffets (loaded with preservatives, additives, sugar, etc), I ate healthy. And it was super rewarding. Especially when it came to breakfast. I don’t like starting my day with a sugary processed breakfast. It puts me into a food coma. I need something full of nutrients to keep me focused and ready for the day. And that’s why I loved these easy “On-The-Go Protein Oatmeal Packs.”
Watch This Video To Learn How I Made My Favorite “Travel Breakfast Food”
Now that I’ve created my very own protein powder that is the cleanest on the market, I always use it to make these packs.

Truvani’s Plant Based Protein is organic, non-GMO, and has only six simple ingredients. You won’t find nasty additives, sugar, or harmful chemicals in our protein. And, it tastes better than any other protein powder I’ve tried!
But, don’t take my word for it. Here are real reviews from people who had the opportunity to taste it:
“The fact that my 2 year old loves it should say everything about this product! He kept asking for “mo.” – Corinn T.
“I’d give 2 thumbs up to this chocolate protein powder – all natural, very minimal ingredients, no artificial sweeteners and yet it tasted sweet and delicious. I’d definitely be happy to drink this for breakfast every morning!” – Stefani M.
“I’ve tried a lot of vegan protein powders and I am very impressed with Truvani protein powder. It taste great, mixes well and the texture is nice. I’ve had protein powders that tasted chalky before and was pleasantly surprised to find that this one is not chalky or gritty at all.” – Melinda A.
I know it tastes great. And that’s why we also offer a no questions asked “Love The Taste” Guarantee. Meaning, if you try our Protein Powder, and dislike the taste, just email our team and refund your order. Easy.
As you see, the entire Truvani team worked meticulously for months to get our protein powder just right, and we’re happy to say it tastes AMAZING mixed in only water – it’s not chalky or lumpy like other brands. Even though it’s great on it’s own, I love to use it in healthy recipes like these Protein Oatmeal Packs. Here’s the printable recipe:

I love how you can use Truvani Plant Based Protein Powder in more than just smoothies and protein drinks. Use it to bake protein muffins, pancakes, and even desserts!
Knowing that I have my own clean organic protein powder makes me so happy!
As I was involved in every step of its production, I know all about what went into it and how incredible this new product is. This is something that I never dreamed would happen.
Remember, I never set out to create my own product line, but after years of fighting against Big Food and forcing big companies to change, I knew I had to take matters into my own hands.
The only real way to make lasting change in our food system is to fight them head-to-head as a competitor. So, when you buy a Truvani product, you should know this:
You will get a remarkable product, with some of the best ingredients available, and you’ll also be helping us build a company that has a big vision of changing the food industry.
Truvani is still in its infancy (we have three products so far!) and those of you who have supported us this early on are helping us make more healthy products a reality. That’s why we like to reward our early supporters with preferential pricing:
If you know anyone else who would be interested in trying the cleanest, best-tasting protein powder on the market, please share this post and recipe with them. Maybe you can blend up a Radiant Recharge Smoothie together and go relax at a pool. That sure sounds like a nice way to enjoy your Truvani Protein, doesn’t it?

https://foodbabe.com/the-horrible-stuff-in-protein-powder-is-it-in-yours/,The Horrible Stuff In Protein Powder (Is it in yours?),"My favorite protein powder got recalled. And you’re never going to guess why…
Unlike most recalls, it wasn’t contaminated with an allergen… And they also didn’t find some deadly bacteria in it…
Nope, it was much worse.
Okay, maybe not worse, but I was completely disgusted.
They found rat droppings in it. Gross, right?!!
This was years ago, before I really got deep into investigating food. I’ve since learned that rat droppings are not the only crazy, disgusting (and super unhealthy) substance found in protein powder.
After I did a deep dive into protein powders, I realized that most of them were full of nasty things that I never want to eat.
Which is really surprising for something that’s considered a health food, right?
Almost everyone has a tub of protein powder in their house, do you? Go grab it and let’s go over what to watch out for…


Over 90% of the soy produced in this country is GMO and contaminated with Roundup herbicide. And if that’s not bad enough, there’s another reason why you should avoid it:
When soy is isolated to just its protein state, it becomes severely denatured and can cause hormonal disruptions because of the excessive amount of estrogen contained in it. Soy also contains an abundance of phytic acid, which leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body. There are healthier forms of plant-based protein, which I’ll get into later in this post!
Whey protein isolate is highly processed, and that’s why I suggest you avoid it. Here’s how they do it:
Most whey protein isolates start from ultra-pasteurized “Monsanto Milk” raised on GMOs, antibiotics, and other drugs. This milk is then exposed to acid processing, which strips out alkalizing minerals and naturally occurring vitamins and lipids.
This processing makes whey protein isolate overly acidifying in the body. And, chronically consuming whey protein isolate without appropriate balance of alkalizing foods can acidify your body, which over time can increase your vulnerability to degenerative disease.
Artificial flavors are chemical mixtures made with synthetic (not natural) ingredients in a lab. They’re produced by fractional distillation and chemical manipulation of various chemicals like crude oil or coal tar. Artificial vanilla flavor can be made from wood pulp. Want your protein drink to taste like strawberries? Blend it with some real strawberries!
Natural Flavor is practically the exact same thing as Artificial Flavor, but it’s derived from substances found in nature (plants, animals, etc). But that’s not all! Flavors typically contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other “incidental additives”, which can make up 80% or so of the formulation, even the “natural” ones. None of these are disclosed on the ingredient list. All of the top 10 plant-based protein powders on Amazon contain natural flavors, so this is hard to avoid… but I’ll show you how, keep reading!
Sugar is addictive, makes you fat, tired, depressed, age faster, makes your skin dull, weakens immunity and when consumed in excess causes all sorts of diseases. It’s added to protein powders in many different forms – you’ll see ingredients listed like corn syrup solids, fructose, maltodextrin, dextrose, and sometimes just sugar. The good news? You don’t need sugar to make a protein drink taste sweet. Real food does the trick too… read on for more info on that!
Acesulfame Potassium and Sucralose are the two most common found in protein powders. Although they have no calories, research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. Both of these additives have been linked to cancer in animal studies too, so it’s really not worth the risk.
To make erythritol most manufacturers start with genetically engineered (GMO) corn and put it through a complex fermentation process to come up with chemically pure erythritol. Sugar alcohols like this can harm healthy gut bacteria and function, which leads to a whole host of diseases and if you’re trying to lose weight or stay slim, keeping your gut healthy is vital! Erythritol is also known to cause diarrhea and stomach upset.
This thickener and emulsifier is widely known to cause digestive problems and intestinal inflammation. It’s also linked to cancer, as tests have found as much as 25% degraded carrageenan in “food-grade carrageenan” (the kind used in protein powder and other foods). Degraded carrageenan is classified as “Possibly carcinogenic to humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
This anti-caking agent and thickener is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring when found in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems.
Refined vegetable oils like soybean oil, canola oil, and sunflower oil are added to many protein powders as a defoaming and thickening agent. These oils go through an insane amount of processing with chemical solvents, steamers, neutralizers, de-waxers, bleach and deodorizers, and unless organic, are extracted with the neurotoxin hexane – it’s literally bathed in it.
Brown rice is often contaminated with arsenic, a highly toxic substance classified as “Carcinogenic to Humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Arsenic is even found in organic brown rice, so you need to be very careful about the source and make sure it’s been tested. You’ll find brown rice in many plant-based protein powders, but there are safer plant-based protein sources, which I’ll tell ya all about in a minute!
Vitamins are healthy, right? Not if they are made in a lab from a variety of sources like coal tar, petroleum or GMOs. These vitamins differ from their natural counterparts, in that they aren’t believed to be absorbed by your body as well as naturally present vitamins that you get from whole food. You’ll see these listed on the ingredient list like: Vitamin A Palmitate,Thiamine (vitamin B1), Riboflavin (vitamin B2), and Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C). Want vitamins in your shake? Blend in some leafy greens and berries. Real food is always best.
Most protein powders are packaged in plastic tubs that contain toxins like bisphenol A (BPA), which can leach into the food. This was evidenced in recent tests that found BPA in 55% of protein powders. This substance is linked to birth defects, cancers, and neurological disorders. What kind of packaging does your protein powder have?
Most protein powders on the market are not certified organic. That means they likely contain GMO ingredients and most definitely are tainted with synthetic pesticides that are potentially toxic with long-term exposure. Pesticides used on conventional farms are hormone disruptors, neurotoxins, or reproductive toxins which are strongly linked to many diseases and health issues. The whole basis of organic farming is to produce food without the need to use toxic pesticides. Crops are managed in a way that prevents the need to use these risky chemicals. This is why choosing certified organic protein powder is very important.
Heavy metals (like lead, cadmium, and mercury) accumulate in the body when you are repeatedly exposed to them and are highly toxic, particularly to the brain. This isn’t an ingredient that you’ll find on an ingredient list because heavy metals are substances that contaminate ingredients, similar to pesticides. Certain ingredients are more likely to be contaminated with heavy metals, and plant-based protein sources are often contaminated… and not always labeled as such on the packaging. I know this from personal first-hand experience (keep reading, as I’ll tell you what happened!)
Remember how I told you they found rat droppings in my old favorite protein powder? At the time I remember thinking, “Maybe one day I’ll make my own protein powder.”
Well… That day has come!
Truvani Plant-Based Protein Powder is here…

Truvani’s new protein powder is made with 6 simple ingredients…

In this short video, I explain what makes these ingredients so special…






Our unique protein blend of organic pea, hemp seed, and pumpkin seed protein creates a complete plant-based protein that is easy to digest and is smooth (not chalky and lumpy like the other brands!)
We also avoid the plastic tubs that other protein powders use to avoid BPA contamination.
Let me tell you, creating this clean protein blend has been an exhaustive process… it was near impossible to find plant-based protein sources that met my standards. Even though so many of you asked me to create a protein powder, I actually thought we’d never be able to create this product. Here’s why…

We have strict criteria each ingredient supplier must meet before we’ll consider using them and then we hold them accountable by independently testing their ingredients. For instance, our ingredients need to be not only be certified organic and non-GMO, but they need to pass heavy metal testing as well.
We reached out to 52 ingredient suppliers and most of them failed our initial questioning. The few that did pass sent over a sample for testing… and each source failed the heavy metals test.
And there was one ingredient in particular that gave us the most trouble… Organic Pea Protein. Every sample was coming back contaminated with LEAD.
I couldn’t believe it.
This was a COMMON ingredient found in many other Plant Based Protein Powders. Why was it so hard to find a clean version?
I felt so defeated. Pea protein was essential to the protein blend I wanted to create and so we kept searching and testing. I’m happy to say that my tenacity paid off! We FINALLY found a pea protein that passed. Can you imagine how relieved I was?
And, you’ll NEVER guess why it passed!
I explain how our pea protein is different and passed the heavy metals test right here.
The bottom line is: No one tests ingredients like Truvani does.
And that’s good news because that means our protein powder is the cleanest you’ll find anywhere.
And unlike other clean protein powders you may have tried in the past, it tastes GREAT– even when it’s just mixed with water!
But don’t take my word for it. Here are real reviews from people who had the opportunity to taste it:
“The fact that my 2 year old loves it should say everything about this product! He kept asking for “mo.” – Corinn T.

“I’d give 2 thumbs up to this chocolate protein powder – all natural, very minimal ingredients, no artificial sweeteners and yet it tasted sweet and delicious. I’d definitely be happy to drink this for breakfast every morning!” – Stefani M.

“I’ve tried a lot of vegan protein powders and I am very impressed with Truvani protein powder. It taste great, mixes well and the texture is nice. I’ve had protein powders that tasted chalky before and was pleasantly surprised to find that this one is not chalky or gritty at all.” – Melinda A.
I know it tastes great. And that’s why we also offer a no questions asked “Love The Taste” Guarantee. Meaning, if you try our Protein Powder, and dislike the taste, just email our team and refund your order. Easy.
It’s fantastic in recipes too and when you place an order for the new Truvani Plant-Based Protein Powder – It’s not just for smoothies and protein drinks. I’ll show you how to use it to bake protein muffins, pancakes, and even desserts.

When you order this week, we will send you my new eBook “23 Positive Habits for a Healthy Life” when you buy a pack of Truvani Protein. It’s full of tips and recipes to help you eat healthy every day!
This free eBook is available when you order any Truvani Protein here.
Remember, we don’t compromise on ingredients. I created Truvani on the belief that we should have real food without added chemicals, products without toxins, and labels without lies.

Simple, really. You shouldn’t have to compromise on health. Or taste, for that matter. Other companies claim to be “clean” or “natural.” At Truvani, we really mean it.

https://foodbabe.com/the-cleanest-organic-plant-based-protein-powder-is-here/,The Cleanest Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder is here!,"People always ask, “Vani, what protein powder do you recommend?”
I have tried so many, and none of them met my ingredient standards.
And they tasted bad, too. Some were chalky. Some were way too sweet. Some were just plain gross.
I knew I eventually wanted to create my own protein powder, and I’m proud to say the time has come.
I created an organic Plant Based Protein Powder that I fully stand behind, and I LOVE IT. It’s the best tasting powder I’ve ever had, and I know it’s the healthiest.
In this video, I share what inspired me to start working on this product in the first place. Something awful was found in a protein powder I used to like… it’s a weird (and disgusting) story…




Read all about the ingredients in Truvani’s Plant Based Protein here + learn how you can save up to 35% with special Launch Pricing!
It has just 6 simple ingredients that are certified USDA organic, non-GMO, and vegan. Each ingredient was hand selected by me and the Truvani team. We tested each of them for heavy metals, and they lived up to our standards.
And believe me. This testing is important.
Many companies claim to use high quality ingredients, but I’ve discovered this isn’t always true. Even though many of the ingredients found in our Plant Based Protein Powder are relatively common, the quality of our ingredients are much better.
I’ll prove it…
When I was sourcing ingredients for this product, I contacted 52 separate sources.
Most of them failed our initial questioning, and the few that passed sent over a sample for testing… and each one failed the heavy metals test.
And there was one ingredient in particular that gave us the most trouble… Organic Pea Protein.

I couldn’t believe it. This was a COMMON ingredient found in many other Plant Based Protein Powders. Why was it so hard to find a clean version?
Each time another failed source came back I felt so defeated.
Then we finally found ONE supplier who did something unique with their Organic Pea Protein, and it made all the difference. It has a much better texture that mixes perfectly in water with no chalky feel in your mouth. What makes our Organic Pea Protein different?
I tell the rest of the story here.
The bottom line: No one tests their ingredients as thoroughly as Truvani does. It’s just that important to us.

I never set out to create my own product line, but I got sick and tired of playing “whack a mole” with these Big Food companies. The world needs a company that actually cares about the products they create. And even though it means I have to be careful in some ways, it also means I can start hitting these companies where it hurts the most… their bottom line.
Remember, at Truvani we believe in real food without added chemicals. Products without toxins. Labels without lies. We will be transparent with our ingredient sourcing and pick the best ingredients available. Always.
So, when you buy a Truvani product, you should know this:
You will get a remarkable product and you’ll also be helping us build a company that has a big vision of changing the food industry.

https://foodbabe.com/announcing-my-next-book-feeding-you-lies/,Announcing My Next Book: Feeding You Lies,"My mom called yesterday and said “Have you turned it in yet?” – I responded with a big “YES! It’s done.” And we both rejoiced. I have been heads down for the last year working on something very important.
I’m so thrilled to announce that I just turned in the manuscript for my next book!!!
My new book, Feeding You Lies: How to Unravel the Food Industry’s Playbook and Reclaim Your Health, will officially hit stores in February 2019.


The research in this book is cutting edge and I couldn’t be MORE EXCITED to get this information in your hands. This book is very different from my first, The Food Babe Way…
In Feeding You Lies I expose the shameless lies we are being fed about our food by the very people we should be able to trust for health information… lies about its nutrient value, effects on our health, label information, and even the very science on which we make our food choices. It’s investigative, hard-hitting, and scandalous. If you love my food investigations, you definitely will love this book. Here’s what it covers:
Want to be one of the first to read it? You can pre-order a copy now.
Get it locally near you here or at Barnes & Noble or Amazon
When you pre-order, the book will be shipped to you to arrive on the release date – so you’ll be one of the first people to get it and won’t even need to make a trip to the store.
Your early support means a lot – it will send a message to bookstores everywhere to carry this important book. We’ve got to get this out there so we can expose the food industry lies once and for all.
If the food industry felt threatened by my first book, they aren’t going to know what hit ‘em when Feeding You Lies hits stores. This book will change you forever. It did that for me, I’ll never look at food the same way again.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/mini-zucchini-banana-muffins-no-added-sugar/,Mini Zucchini Banana Muffins (No Added Sugar!),"I’ve been wanting to share this recipe for a long time! Harley’s been eating these Zucchini Banana Mini Muffins up and the best part? They have no added sugar! I always have a batch of these ready in the freezer for a quick snack or to add to one of her meals. They take minutes to thaw out in a toaster oven and she loves them! They are super moist, taste absolutely delicious and perfect for kids and adults.

Did you know toddlers under the age of two are supposed to avoid ALL added refined sugar? The only “sugar” in their diets should come from the sugar found in whole foods (like the sugar in a whole banana for instance).
Yet, the processed food industry doesn’t care – they still add refined sugar to virtually everything. Almost all of the store-bought toddler snacks out there have added refined sugar, natural flavors and other processed ingredients I don’t want my daughter eating on a regular basis… even organic ones!

I try to give Harley vegetables with every meal, and thankfully she loves them. If your kids aren’t veggie lovers yet, the zucchini in these muffins is a great way to sneak in some veggies, you don’t even know they are there. Just make sure to buy organic zucchini to avoid those that are GMO.
When I bake for Harley, I often use organic oat flour – it is unrefined and a good source of fiber and nutrients. Oat flour is made from just 100% whole oats. In fact, if you can’t find oat flour at the store you can make your own by placing organic steel cut or rolled oats in a food processor or spice grinder and pulsing until it has become a “flour-like” consistency.

To make these Zucchini Banana Muffins, start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees. Then measure out one and half cups of oat flour into a medium-size glass bowl. Whisk in a teaspoon each of cinnamon and baking soda, a quarter teaspoon of baking powder, and half a teaspoon of sea salt. Mix until well combined…

In a larger separate bowl you’ll add all the wet ingredients… two eggs, half a cup of applesauce, a mashed banana, a cup of grated zucchini, and a third cup of organic butter or coconut oil…

I haven’t tried it, but you can use “flax eggs” to make these muffins vegan. For each egg (remember there are two in this recipe) simply mix together one tablespoon organic ground flaxseed with three tablespoons water (Let it sit for 15 minutes to thicken before using.)
Whisk the wet ingredients just until combined…

Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just combined. Resist the urge to overmix the batter…

Using a small ice-cream scoop makes this next step super easy. Line a mini muffin pan with non-bleached paper liners or grease your muffin pan with coconut oil. Fill each cup only three-quarters the way full so they don’t overflow…
Place them in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes until done.
You could probably make these in a regular-size muffin pan too. For that, the baking time will be about double (I would say 20-22 minutes).

Let cool slightly before eating to ensure the muffins stay together. I know it’s hard to wait… but it’s worth it!
Store extra muffins in the freezer. You can reheat them in a toaster oven or oven… or let them thaw overnight in the fridge or on the counter the day you want to eat them.


I hope your family loves these muffins as much as we do. If you know anyone looking for healthy snacks for their kids, please share this recipe with them!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/how-i-lost-the-baby-weight/,How I Lost The Baby Weight,"First of all, I should let you know that I debated calling the title of this post something different. In fact, the title of this post makes me cringe a little. The Food Babe lifestyle has never been about the number on the scale, nor do I ever want it to be. I also don’t want to encourage any feelings of self-doubt about body image for new Moms. Feeling good after having children should not come at the price of obsessing about weight, or trying to get your “pre-baby body back” because if you are a mom – you know your body (and mind and spirit) has been changed forever. Becoming a mom has been the greatest thing I have ever achieved in my life – nothing will ever come close and no extra weight on my body will ever take away the joy I have from giving birth and getting to spend time with my little girl. But there is a reality of wanting to look and feel like your best self again and this post is all about that.

When I became pregnant I didn’t know what exactly would happen to my body. I spent so much time over the years cultivating habits that made me feel healthy, energetic and vibrant… and then all of the sudden I was nauseous, had the burps, and was tired all the time. Although I had a great pregnancy – I felt pretty good and didn’t really have much to complain about – let me tell you, I was no longer feeling my best! For example, I suddenly found myself hating to cook because everything smelled funny (only in my first trimester – thank goodness) and hating to travel (my favorite hobby!) Sitting in an airplane seat was the most uncomfortable position ever! I realized that the symptoms I was experiencing were just caused by everything the body goes through while creating a little human. You know, you’re making a baby after all… and so of course you’re not going to feel like your normal self. This was a bit of an adjustment for me, but of course was all worth it.
Fortunately, I was able to workout all the way up until I gave birth which I know helped keep my mood stable, digestive system happy, my circulatory system working great and kept any swelling down. I did a mixture of weight-lifting, walking and light cardio throughout my pregnancy. I was around 155 pounds when I gave birth, gaining about 35 pounds during my pregnancy – I also developed varicose veins and had new cellulite on my legs.
After I gave birth, I was head over heels obsessed with my baby (and still am!). That obsession took priority and helped me not worry too much about how I looked after giving birth – although to be honest, it was always in the back of my mind, I wanted to get back into my old clothes. I always envisioned myself as an active and fit mom – someone that will be able to keep up with my kids, climb mountains and run around.
Instead of going on a fad diet, I kept my focus on making sure I was getting appropriate nutrition so that my breastmilk would be as nutrient dense as possible without harmful chemicals. Making sure my breast milk was clean of processed chemicals and other toxins kept me from eating badly. The health of my baby comes first, so it was great motivation. I did this by eating an organic and unprocessed diet, avoiding packaging as much as possible – and as a result, the extra pounds I gained during my pregnancy came off without having to do anything special (the varicose veins and cellulite vanished too).
By 5 months postpartum, I was already back into my pre-pregnancy clothes which I was very happy about but at the same time, my hair started falling out. This was FREAKY. Every time I took a shower and washed my hair, it was like a murder scene! I had to wear my hair up for weeks so my daughter wouldn’t be covered in it while she breastfed. I had a lot of postpartum hair loss on the top front of my head, but thankfully after two months, it stopped falling out and started to grow back. All that lush pregnancy hair was gone but thankfully my hair is almost back to normal and it was only temporary (and completely normal according to my doctor). And now a year later, I’m down another 10 pounds, but that wasn’t my goal. My goal wasn’t to be thin, it was to feel good. Feeling good as a mom means I have good energy, a good mood and can do all the million things I need to do without getting stressed out. Eating clean, unprocessed food makes me feel so good!
If you would have asked me over 10 years ago, “Can I lose 40 pounds after pregnancy?”, I’d tell you that I thought it would be MUCH more difficult and maybe not possible. I’d be counting every calorie and caught up in the old mentality that I had about food. Focusing on the quality of my food helped my weight struggles vanish for good and stopped that yo-yo state of dieting I always used to find myself in.

Above are candid selfies of 40.5 weeks pregnant and 1 year later in the same nursing bra. I also debated not sharing these, considering the comments I might receive, but nothing can be worse than what I have already experienced online sharing my life. I am proud of my healthy body post-pregnancy that continues to nourish my baby through breastfeeding and no one can take that away from me.

If you are wondering how and what I ate, I’ve put together a free E-Book for you. I hope this helps all you new Moms out there feel the best you can feel!
Here’s a sample of my after-pregnancy life, along with recipes and a meal schedule. Simply enter your email below:


1. Consistency
2. Take Walks And Exercise
3. Make Good Use Of Your Slow Cooker
To make your prep and cleanup time as quick as possible, use a small slow cooker. For breakfast, I would throw all the ingredients in a slow cooker the night before and wake up to a delicious and nutritious meal. Once you clean out the slow cooker from the morning, feel free to do the same with soup for dinner. Add some chopped vegetables, spices, protein and stock to the pot and set on low for 8 hours. Get over 50 of my favorite slow cooker recipes here.
4. Plan Out Your Snacks
One of the easiest ways to sabotage your success is lack of planning. Snacks are one of those areas where if you’re not careful you can easily overeat or eat foods that will promote weight gain. Take 5 minutes at the beginning of the week to ensure you have stocked your pantry or refrigerator with healthy snacks such as chopped vegetables, nuts or nut butter, brown rice crackers, etc.
5. Soup Is Your Best Friend

https://foodbabe.com/healing-turmeric-hummus-10-more-turmeric-recipes/,Turmeric Hummus + 10 Healing Recipes!,"As you know I launched my new product company Truvani this year. It’s been a wild ride and very exciting – not to mention, seriously stressful at times.
To source the best ingredients, it takes time, money and a lot of trial and error. We are in the process of developing new products, but in the meantime, I wanted to share this brand new amazing free eBook we put together about Turmeric (full of brand new recipes!) It’s my gift to you. You can download it right here.
I’ve been getting a ton of questions about turmeric lately. Like, how I cook with it… what makes it healthy… what are different ways to use it… etc.
In this new 35-page eBook, called The Ultimate Guide to Turmeric, I answer your questions and give you 10 New Recipes that make it easy to add it to your everyday diet. I also explain why turmeric is an ingredient that I like to eat daily!


I’ll also give you 8 simple ways to use turmeric at home and in your food, some of which you’ve probably never considered (…like using it to whiten teeth!) Plus, you’ll learn the 12 core benefits of turmeric that help to make me feel amazing and vibrant. This eBook is jam packed with valuable information! I hope that you learn to love turmeric as much as I do.
To give you a little taste of some of the beautiful recipes from this eBook, I’m sharing the Healing Everyday Hummus recipe below. Doesn’t it look amazingly delicious?!…
I’ve been making my own hummus for many years. I don’t buy the premade stuff for lots of reasons… namely, most brands are made with inflammatory soybean oil or canola oil and simply don’t taste anywhere near as good as fresh homemade hummus does.
Hummus is very nutritious if made fresh and can be a great pick me up that replaces processed junk in vending machines at work or pre-packaged “health” bars. It’s got a combo of protein and fiber to keep you from craving junk. I love to snack on hummus with red bell pepper, carrots, or celery sticks almost every day. It’s too easy.

The best part? This turmeric hummus just takes 10 minutes to make. You just throw it all into a food processor or blender and blend! I love healthy recipes that are quick and easy… don’t you?

After you make this hummus (or any of these new turmeric recipes), I’d LOVE it if you’d share a pic on social media by tagging me @TheFoodBabe with the hashtag #Truvani. I can’t wait to see your creations and all the beautiful pictures.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/you-wont-believe-this-new-fast-food-packaging/,You Won’t Believe This New Fast Food Packaging!,"When I first started this blog (7 years ago), I had no clue what an adventure it would be. I had no idea that anyone besides my own friends and family would read what I wrote. I certainly never knew that my investigations would inspire some of the largest companies in the world to change their ingredients and become more transparent.
I was shocked when I investigated the food I was eating and saw what was really in it. And once I realized the food that I was eating, wasn’t actually real food but full of processed chemicals, my health began to soar! Reading ingredient lists and knowing what’s in your food is one of the most important things you can do to protect your health.
When we ask what’s in our food – companies should tell us. Period. We all deserve to know exactly what we are eating.
That’s why I was pumped to hear what the new restaurant chain The Organic Coup is doing.
The Organic Coup was the first certified organic fast food chain and has quickly grown to 12+ restaurants. It is even in Levi’s Stadium where the San Francisco 49ers play. I can’t wait for them to be on my side of the country! The founders Erica Welton and Dennis Hoover are formerly from Costco and spearheaded bringing organic offerings there, helping to make it the largest organic retailer in America.
Although The Organic Coup had their ingredients published online since inception, now when you eat there, there will be no question about what you are eating as it will be RIGHT THERE when you get your food. I know of no other restaurants who are doing this, and I think this is remarkable. Wouldn’t it be awesome if all chains did this?



If a restaurant wants to be a leader in the industry, they should have nothing to hide. Unfortunately that is not the case. Many big restaurant chains refuse to tell you what is in their food if you ask, let alone publish the ingredient list online. The FDA doesn’t require restaurants to disclose this information, so they are given a free pass to hide their ingredients from consumers. Restaurants will tell you that they won’t disclose ingredients for “Proprietary” reasons… as if they’re worried a competitor will steal their recipes. We all know this isn’t the real issue. The biggest restaurant chains like McDonalds, Subway, Taco Bell, and Burger King have had full ingredient lists published on their websites for years.
Nonetheless there are some big holdouts. Big chains like Bojangles, Shake Shack, Quiznos, Panda Express, and Sonic Drive-In downright refuse to disclose what’s in their food (except for allergen info). When we called Little Caesars corporate offices last week, they told us they wouldn’t disclose the full ingredient list in their pizza unless we had a DOCTOR contact them. Isn’t that ridiculous?!! Is there a doctor in the house who wants to give them a call and get the ingredients for us? Other big restaurant chains like Red Robin will eventually provide ingredients if you call and pester them to death… but most customers don’t have that kind of tenacity. These restaurants serve millions of customers who have no clue what they are really eating.
Years ago, one of my first big investigations was into Chipotle. They called themselves “Food with Integrity” – yet at first, they blatantly refused to tell me what was in their food. I found this astonishing, and of course, felt compelled write about it. I made it loud and clear on my blog that no one should trust a company that is not willing to disclose their ingredients. I wrote, “How can we trust Chipotle’s definition of ‘Food with Integrity’ when they refuse to post their ingredients or send the information to customers who ask?” People got so angry and frustrated that they stormed Chipotle’s social media pages. Someone even started an online petition on my behalf to pressure the company into being honest about how their food was prepared. We gathered 2,000 signatures almost immediately. Ultimately, this petition came to the attention of Chipotle’s corporate offices and the next thing I knew they were contacting me and agreed to publish their ingredients on their website. This was a huge win for consumers!
As you can see – putting pressure on companies to change their practices leads to actual results. Consumer activism and demanding transparency is very effective. We together are changing the food system and I could never do this alone.

This simple action can make sweeping change and takes very little effort. To give you an example… here’s a message that I just sent to Shake Shack this morning. I will be sending similar messages to the entire list of chains below. Feel free to copy what I wrote, or make it your own… but please take a minute to ask your favorite restaurants to do the same:
“Please publish the complete ingredient list for your food on your website. Customers are increasingly seeking ingredient information because they are concerned about food additives and their relation to health, or have other allergies and food sensitivities that are not provided on your allergen statement. Without full ingredient disclosure, consumers are left in the dark, which prevents them from eating at your restaurants.
Most big restaurant chains like KFC, Subway, McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King, publish their complete ingredient lists online. I simply ask that you do the same. I thank you in advance for listening to your customers and doing the right thing.”
Here’s a list of contact information for popular chains that refuse to publish their ingredients online. Pick one (or a few) and join me in asking them to be transparent and publish their ingredients:
Over the last few years, we’ve convinced some multi-billion dollar corporations, like Chipotle, Starbucks, and Anheuser-Busch, to finally publish their ingredients for the first time in history. And, we can do it again! Everyone deserves to know exactly what he or she are eating and our job will not be done until we all have this information.
Also, take a moment to thank The Organic Coup for spearheading the transparency movement by putting their ingredients right on the package. You can find them on Facebook here.

https://foodbabe.com/carrot-cake-muffins/,Carrot Cake Muffins,"These carrot cake muffins make a fun breakfast or snack on the go, but you can also frost them like cupcakes to make a festive Easter treat! They’re gluten-free and have no added refined sugar, but are super moist and delicious. I can’t wait to bake another batch… they don’t last long in my house!


These Carrot Cake Muffins are a great replacement for those heavily processed carrot cakes found in supermarket bakeries, which are loaded with sugar and additives.
Sugar, Carrots, Cream Cheese (Pasteurized Milk And Cream, Cheese Culture, Salt, Carob Bean Gum), Bleached Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Soybean Oil, Vegetable Shortening (Palm Oil, Soybean Oil, Mono- And Diglycerides, Polysorbate 60, TBHQ and Citric Acid, Eggs, Pineapple, Pecans, Raisins, Semi-Sweet Chocolate (Sugar, Chocolate Liquor, Cocoa Butter, Butter Oil, Soy Lecithin, Vanillin, an Artificial Flavor), Modified Food Starch, Baking Soda, Cinnamon, Natural And Artificial Flavors, Salt, Baking Powder (Corn Starch, Bicarbonate of Soda, Sodium Aluminum Sulfate, Acid Phosphate of Calcium), White Syrup (White Syrup (Corn Syrup, Water, Fructose, Natural And Artificial Flavor, Salt, Potassium Sorbate, Natural Color (Glycerine Nd Beta Carotene), Yellow 5, Yellow 6.
Yikes. It’s really not worth your health to buy pre-made cakes like that.
Oat flour is unrefined, full of fiber and compounds that help to reduce inflammation in the body. Oat flour is made from just 100% whole oats. In fact, if you can’t find oat flour at the store you can make your own by placing organic rolled oats in a food processor and pulsing until it has become a “flour-like” consistency. I also use almond flour in these muffins, but if you want the recipe to be nut-free, you can omit the almond flour and increase the oat flour to 2½ cups. They’ll be just as delicious!
To get started, turn your oven on to preheat up to 350 degrees and get out a large mixing bowl. Add all the dry ingredients to the bowl (oat flour, almond flour, baking soda, baking powder, sea salt, and ground cinnamon) and whisk it all together until well combined…
Pull out a smaller mixing bowl and crack in one pastured egg. Or, you can use a “flax egg” to make it vegan. Simply mix together one tablespoon organic ground flaxseed with three tablespoons water (Let it sit for 15 minutes to thicken before using.)
Whisk in one mashed banana, half a cup of maple syrup, 3/4 cup almond or coconut milk, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. One quick way I use to mash the banana is by breaking it into chunks and placing it in a measuring cup. I then use a whisk to mash the banana down. Mix it all together well…

Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix gently, just until combined…
Take about three medium sized carrots and shred them until you have 1¼ cups. Fold the carrots into the batter…

Line a cupcake pan with liners and fill each cup until it’s about three-quarters of the way full…

Before I stuck them in the oven I topped each muffin with shredded coconut and pecans, but you can use any toppings you like. You can make a homemade streusel or top with cream cheese frosting after baking for a more decadent dessert.

Bake in your preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. I know once you smell ’em, you’re gonna be excited to take a bite, but it is best to let these muffins sit for a little while after taking out of the oven to cool completely so they don’t fall apart… don’t say I didn’t warn ya!

Are you going to enjoy these muffins for breakfast or frost them for a treat? Let me know in the comments! And, please share this recipe with your loved ones.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/lush-bath-bombs-not-think/,Lush Bath Bombs Are Not What You Think,"If you read ingredient lists like me, I hope that doesn’t stop at just food.
Food chemicals are nasty, but the skincare and cosmetics industry is even worse. The FDA doesn’t regulate cosmetics as rigorously as pharmaceuticals or food – allowing companies to get away with using potentially harmful ingredients that are banned in other countries. Many cosmetics, lotions, soaps, and body scrubs contain toxic petrochemicals made from oil, known carcinogens, reproductive toxins, and neurotoxins.
If you’ve got teen girls at home, it’s a pretty safe bet you’ve heard of Lush bath bombs. It’s not just teens going crazy for their wide array of colorful bath bombs, lotions, and soaps, but adults are too. Lush has a full line of products all claimed to be “handmade”, “fresh”, “natural”, “cosmetics with nothing to hide”…
Unfortunately when a company markets themselves like this, many people buy up their products without considering what the ingredients are, and that can be a huge mistake. Do you have any Lush products or have kids begging you for a bath bomb?


A member of my team was telling me how she’s freaking out about the Lush bath bombs her daughter’s buying because she doesn’t think they’re safe.
“Please reinvestigate Lush boutique. There is such a craze going on with our preteens and even adults at that bath/body boutique. The salespeople are usually uneducated on what the products contain. They just say they are “all natural” blah blah blah and stick to their script. I read the ingredients of some products quickly that contained carrageenan and food dyes. Please educate everyone on this.” ~ Jonna H.
“I am constantly working to change the products in our home into something healthier with no chemicals, but that isn’t always easy. I have become so frustrated lately at how deceiving products are. I used to love the company Lush until I found out they use parabens and sulfates and gosh knows what else. I feel like they are so misleading because you walk into the store and supposedly everything is natural and fresh.” ~ Wioletta
I was instantly suspicious the first time I saw what a Lush Bath Bomb does to a bathtub full of water. You throw that chalky bomb into your bath and watch it slowly dissolve and fizz, while it releases a rainbow of swirls and glitter into your bathwater. It’s pretty cool looking…but the idea of soaking my body in a brightly colored concoction of chemicals isn’t my idea of a good time. To me, a bath should be a healing experience and not one that could put my health in jeopardy.
Artificial dyes made from petroleum – Those famous Lush Bath Bombs are loaded with synthetic dyes like Yellow 10, Blue 1, and Red 28, which are readily absorbed by shaven skin where they can go right into your bloodstream. These dyes can be contaminated with carcinogens. Blue 1 has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and some research suggests it’s a neurotoxin. Do you really want to soak your entire body in potential carcinogens and neurotoxins?  You’ll find these in some: Lush Bath Bombs, Soaps, Lipsticks, Fresh Face Mask, Luxury Bath Oil, Massage Bars, Bubble Bars, Shampoo Bars, Shampoo, Shower Jelly, Scrubs, and Fun.


Parabens – Preservatives like propylparaben and methylparaben are endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems. Parabens can be absorbed by the skin. There are brands using safer preservatives, and there’s no reason Lush can’t too. Using a small amount doesn’t protect you because endocrine disruptors are known to have a big effect at very low levels of exposure. You’ll find these in some: Shampoos, Conditioners, Cleansing Lotions, Eye Creams, Shaving Cream, Lotions, Masks, Scrubs, Eyeliners, Moisturizers, Skin Tint, Eyeshadows, Mascara, Hair Treatments, and Toner.

Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) – May be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which is linked to cancer. You won’t see 1,4-dioxane on an ingredient list because it forms during manufacturing and the FDA doesn’t require a warning label. I don’t like the idea that something I wash my body with can potentially cause cancer over time. I believe exposure to carcinogens even at low levels is unsafe – especially in a product you wash your entire body in or use daily, like shower gels and soap. You’ll find this in some: Shampoos, Shampoo Bars, Shower Gels, Bubble Bars, Shower Jelly, Fun, Bath Bombs, Shower Creams, and Soaps.

Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) – If you have dry itchy skin and dandruff, this could be the culprit. SLS irritates the skin and scalp by stripping away the natural oils that protect it. You’ll find this in some: Soaps, Shampoo Bars, Conditioners, Solid Conditioners, and Hair Treatments.


Triethanolamine (TEA) – Particularly dangerous when combined with products that contain SLS (see above). That’s because when SLS combines with TEA it creates the nitrosamine NDELA – a carcinogen. This is a chemical cocktail that you don’t want to combine on your skin (such as using soap with SLS and then spreading on moisturizer with TEA). You’ll find this in some: Body Conditioners, Shaving Creams, Scrubs, Skin Tint, Color Supplements, Styling Creams, Eyeliners, Eyeshadows, Mascaras, Scrubs, Lotions, and Eye Creams.

PEG Compounds – When you see “PEG-100” or other “PEG” compounds on the label, these can be contaminated with Ethylene Oxide and 1,4 Dioxane, which are both linked to cancer. You’ll find this in some: Shampoos, Shampoo Bars, Bath Bombs, Bath Oils, Solid Conditioners, Hair Dressings, Facial Scrub, and Beard and Facial Wash.

Fragrance – It sounds so innocuous, but it’s not. Just like “natural flavors” in our food, cosmetic companies don’t tell you everything that is in these fragrances and they can include highly toxic ingredients, hormone disruptors, and carcinogens. My team contacted Lush and they said when you see “fragrance” listed as an ingredient on their website in black this means it contains some synthetic ingredients – but they could not disclose what they were. You’ll find this in some: Bath Bombs, Soaps, Shampoos, Conditioners, Shampoo Bars, Fun, Bubble Bars, Lotions, Masks, Cleansers, Shower Gels, Hair Treatments, Shaving Creams, Bath Oils, Scrubs, Deodorant, and Dusting Powder.
“The fragrances we use in our products are our very own unique creations, so for that reason we don’t provide an ingredient list for them on our website. They’re never petroleum or alcohol-based and we blend each fragrance by hand, using the highest-quality and most ethically-sourced essential oils and synthetic fragrance components (such as Synthetic Musk) to achieve our products’ unique personalities. Anytime you see the word “fragrance” printed in black that indicates that some part of it has a synthetic component. If it is a blend of purely natural or organic oils, it would be written in green.” ~ Email from Lush Customer Care
If you’re worried about the chemicals in your food, the skincare and cosmetics industry is even worse.
You’ve got to be your own advocate when it comes to what you slather on your skin. The FDA doesn’t regulate cosmetics as rigorously as pharmaceuticals or food – allowing companies to get away with using potentially harmful ingredients that are banned or not used in other countries.

The other day I was posting some pictures from a Truvani video shoot and a few of you were asking about the lipstick I’m wearing…

For the video shoot, I was wearing a bit more makeup than I normally do. Even then, I made sure to use only the safe cosmetics that I love, and that includes this lipstick – 100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Pomegranate Oil Anti-Aging Lipstick in Poppy. I really love this color! The best part is I know that I’m not coating my lips with toxic chemicals.
I recently partnered up with 100% Pure. All 100% Pure products are made with organic unrefined ingredients, no synthetic chemicals, and are cruelty-free. They even test each ingredient for pesticide residues!
And, all of those controversial ingredients I just discussed (that Lush and many other brands use) are not in any 100% Pure products… there are no parabens, SLS, SLES, or synthetic fragrances. Instead of using artificial dyes, all 100% Pure products are pigmented using fruits and vegetables. How cool is that?
Best of all, they’ve also got amazing bath products, body scrubs, moisturizers, and shampoo – so if you love Lush products, now is the time to make the switch!
Get 15% OFF all orders through FRIDAY 9/7  when you use the exclusive code FOODBABE.
Plus, get a FREE gift valued at $121 when you spend $70 or more – WHILE SUPPLIES LAST!
Your gift includes all this…
This gift from 100% PURE is crazy good (worth over $120). There are a LIMITED NUMBER of these gifts available, and when they run out, they run out. This is a rare deal that doesn’t come around often.
Whenever I’m headed out and want to wear a little makeup, these are some 100% Pure products I personally love to use…
What works for me, may not work for you – there are so many great natural products available now, you WILL find some that suit you. It might take you some time navigating through the world of natural beauty! God knows, I’ve been through several trials and errors.
I hope this information gives you inspiration to replace some of your toxic products with safer alternatives. If you know anyone who has kids begging them to buy rainbow colored Lush Bath Bombs (or if they’re buying Lush products for themselves!) please share this post with them. Let’s spread the word about what’s really in the products at Lush and not be swindled by their marketing any more!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/whats-healthiest-fast-food-burger-chain/,What’s The Healthiest Fast Food Burger Chain?,"If you’re careful about what you eat, you probably don’t frequent chains like McDonald’s or Burger King, but where do you go when you want a burger? There are several higher-end and “farm-to-table” burger chains popping up, advertising their “all natural”, “organic” and “grass-fed” burgers. So I had to find out, are they really legit? Are they serving GMO ingredients? Do they really serve grass-fed burgers? Or, is their meat really just from a filthy factory farm with a slick marketing campaign?



After investigating how food is produced and raised in this country, one of the first commitments I made was to stop eating “factory farmed” meat. That’s why I usually opt for veggie burgers and vegan dishes when eating at restaurants, where almost all the meat is “conventionally” grown on a factory farm. Whether I’m eating at home, a friend’s house, or at a restaurant – I try my best not to eat meat unless I know it wasn’t grown in some dirty feedlot in horrible conditions.
Most cattle in this country live crammed together in inhumane living conditions (aka “factory farm”), subsisting on a diet of chemical-laden GMO grains (instead of grass) which makes them bulk up fast for mass production and an early slaughter. They are further fattened up with added hormones (linked to cancer), growth stimulating drugs, and antibiotics – a system fraught with numerous environmental and health problems.
When you eat conventional meat, you’re probably eating hormones, antibiotics, resistant bacteria, steroids, and chemicals created by the fear and stress suffered by the animal during slaughter.
This is NOT how we should be raising animals for food. These animals are not healthy. And when we eat animals that are not healthy – we become unhealthy. If you want to change the food industry, your body, and get healthy, you have to make the commitment to stop eating conventional (factory farmed) meat.
Raising cattle on grass takes too long for the typical factory farm. When cows are raised on grass, they aren’t eating “Roundup Ready” GMO corn and candy like Skittles to fatten them up insanely fast.
Cows’ digestive systems are not designed to easily process starchy foods like corn and candy, and these can make conventional cows sick. That’s one reason why grass-fed cows are rarely given antibiotics. They are less likely to get sick, spending more time outdoors and not in a crowded and filthy feedlot. Sustainably raised grass-fed beef is also less likely to harbor deadly bacteria, such as E. coli and S. aureus (a bacteria that produces a toxin that is not easily destroyed by cooking).
100% grass-fed cows are fed grass and forage that grows on the pasture during the growing season, and during the winter they’re fed hay and compacted grass. This has a major effect on the nutrient composition of their meat. These cows produce meat with significantly more omega-3 fatty acids and almost twice as much CLA (a fatty acid that is good for you and associated with fat loss). It’s also packed with more vitamins A and E than conventional beef.
Sometimes “grass-fed cows” are moved off the pasture and into a feedlot where they’re fed GMOs and live in the same horrible conditions as conventional cows before slaughter. Meat from these cows can still be called “grass fed” because this term is not properly defined by the USDA. That’s why ultimately you want to look for meat that is certified 100% grass-fed and finished.
Unfortunately most restaurants do not serve 100% grass-fed burgers and there is a lot of greenwashing going on – so you’ve really got to do your homework and search them out.
You’ve got Shake Shack’s “100% all-natural Angus beef”… Five Guys “handcrafted” burgers… Red Robin’s “gourmet” burgers… Smashburger’s “fresh, never frozen beef”…
That all sounds nice, but be aware that terms like 100% pure beef, all-natural, Angus, gourmet, free range, and handcrafted really don’t tell ya a whole lot.
These terms DO NOT mean…
According to USDA regulations, you can call your meat “Natural” if it’s minimally processed and has no artificial ingredients in the meat itself. This applies to most fresh meat, so that’s why the natural label doesn’t mean much.
As for “Certified Angus”, this is just a breed of cattle that has met some quality requirements, none specifying how the cows were raised. When a hamburger has “100% pure beef” that simply means that no other meats were added to the burger patty – it’s just beef.
In all these instances, this beef could be (and likely is) conventional. Don’t fall for these marketing terms! Instead, look for burgers made with organic ingredients and 100% grass fed and finished beef.
Shake Shack – They admitted to us, “our beef is produced within the conventional farming industry and is not GMO free”. Although they never use hormones or antibiotics, it is still grain-finished. They refused to provide complete ingredient lists for their food, but confirmed the ShackSauce contains canola oil (high risk GMO ingredient) which is “not listed as “non-GMO.” Something to note: I always refuse to eat at any establishment that hides their ingredients from consumers.
Smashburger – The beef at Smashburger is “pasture-fed corn finished”. That means it is not 100% grass-fed. And, it may have been raised with hormones and antibiotics. They told us, “There may be hormones used in the growth of the beef cattle. We do not specify or source hormone free beef. Antibiotics may be used in both our ground beef and chicken as a precautionary step to prevent illness. They are not used as part of a regular or routine process. We do not specify that either product be antibiotic free.” What they are sprinkling on top of those burgers is not very good either. Smashburger’s burger seasoning is packed hidden MSG additives like hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extract, which cause you to eat more than you should and are linked to health issues. They sent us the ingredients in their food (oddly listed in alphabetical order), but you can see their burgers are PACKED with controversial additives… (and see what’s in their fries here)…

Five Guys – The beef is grain-fed. They told us via email their beef comes from cattle “mainly raised on corn” and “a diet… that includes vitamins, corn, and etc”, who “will be administered Anabolic Steroids only if the animal gets sick and needs to be nursed back to health”. When pressed for more information on antibiotics, Five Guys said animals may receive antibiotics if sick and not “without good reason”. They only provided a partial ingredient list for their buns, claiming their bread is “proprietary”, but admit it’s “not GMO free” and contains soy.
Carl’s Jr. – Contacting Carl’s Jr. was like talking to a brick wall. They did not respond (at all) to multiple undercover emails and phone calls. They apparently do not want to discuss their meat which makes me want to run far away from this place and never look back. We were told when we called that they’re in the process of discontinuing their “All-Natural Burger” (which was made with grass-fed beef without hormones, steroids, or antibiotics) – so now you’ll only be able to buy their burgers made with conventional beef. No thanks. Just look at all those nasty additives and high fructose corn syrup in their burgers…

Red Robin – According to Red Robin’s website, “Our Gourmet Burgers are made with all-natural, domestic, Government-inspected beef.” In other words – it’s conventional. They told us, “We do not mandate our suppliers to use GMO free food. We also do allow our suppliers to treat sick animals with antibiotics.” The Red Robin sesame seed buns are filled with high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil.

The Habit Bar & Grill – The beef is “corn fed”, not grass fed and not organic. They refused to provide ingredients in their burger, but we were able to confirm that the seeded bun contains soybean and cottonseed oils (both high risk GMO ingredients).
In-N-Out Burger – The meat comes from one of the largest factory farms. I posted a video of what it looks like on Instagram – check it out here. Critics call it “cowschwitz” because thousands of cows can be seen crowded and walking in their own excrement. After our investigation and working together with consumer advocacy groups, In-N-Out told the media that they’re phasing out routine antibiotics – but there is no timeline. They still do not publish their ingredients online and hide the ingredients in their burgers.
Culver’s – I recently asked on Facebook where you like to get burgers, and this spot was the winner. I’m really sorry to say that Culver’s burgers come from cows that live in a feedlot during the last few months of their lives, where they are given hormones and eat corn/grain diets. They also may be administered antibiotics if deemed necessary. Culver’s buns are also made with high fructose corn syrup, soybean oil, and additives like DATEM and artificial flavors.

Umami Burger – The beef is grass fed, but grain-finished. Umami said that although they have “antibiotic free” meats available from their supplier, they don’t request those and “most of them use antibiotics”. Although they don’t use MSG additives in their food, they wouldn’t provide us with a list of ingredients.
Elevation Burger – They are doing the right thing as far as their meat goes in sourcing 100% organic grass-fed beef and organic chicken… but I hate to tell ya that the rest of their burger ingredients are pretty horrible. I was incredibly disappointed to find that only their meat is organic, and their buns and toppings are full of additives. Elevation’s buns and sauces are not verified Non-GMO, so they may contain GMOs. They really could do better by cleaning up the ingredients, stopping the use of soybean oil in practically everything, getting those artificial colors out of their sauce, and serving organic buns. Elevation Burger’s “Veggie Patty” isn’t a good option either because it’s not organic and spiked with “autolyzed yeast extract” a hidden form of MSG. A better option is their organic “Vegan Patty”, but ultimately if I ate at Elevation burger, I would stick with their Elevation Salad (sans their dressing) instead of a burger. You could top that with organic grilled chicken tenders or an organic burger without the bun and toppings. Another option would be a lettuce wrapped burger, without the Elevation Sauce.


BareBurger – The meat is completely grass-fed and finished and not given antibiotics or hormones. But, where I really get hung up is on their buns. Corporate offices didn’t respond to several emails asking for the ingredients in their bun, whether it is organic, and if they use any GMO ingredients. One restaurant told us the buns are NOT organic. Another restaurant told us the brioche buns contain sugar, margarine, soy oil, and canola oil which are all high risk GMO ingredients. I’d say the healthiest option is to wrap your burger in a nutrient packed organic collard leaf (they have this option) and skip the bun. Beware that they serve the “Impossible Burger” as a vegan option which is made with SLH (soy leghemoglobin), a new protein made in a lab with GMO yeast. This protein has never been in our food before and even the FDA has questioned its safety.
B.Good – They are transparent about their suppliers and use (partially) grass-fed beef without antibiotics or hormones. That being said, sadly they are not organic and their beef is grain-finished. Their buns are also not organic and contain GMO sugar. B.Good is doing some good things and are far better than most chains, but I would love to see them go organic and 100% grass fed. I personally love their salads and bowls.
BurgerFi – The meat is grass-fed and grain finished, and they never use antibiotics or growth hormones. We have contacted them for ingredients and will update when we hear back from them.
Next Level Burger – This vegetarian burger place uses organic buns and toppings, but beware that not everything is organic. Their “house-made” burger patties are organic, but the “meaty patty” is not. I want to love this place, but they said their ingredients are “confidential and proprietary”, so we have no clue what additives may be lurking in there. (We are still trying to obtain ingredients (we contacted the owner), and will update this post if they disclose).
Amy’s Drive-Thru – This vegetarian 100% organic fast food place is pretty great (but with reservations). They provide ingredient lists at the register, so you can see exactly what you’re ordering. They are good in a pinch, but beware their burgers contain some unhealthy ingredients like hydrolyzed soy protein and soybean oil.
Farm Burger – The beef is 100% grass fed and finished and never fed antibiotics or growth hormones. Their buns are not organic, but they are baked locally without additives. They also have amazing chicken burgers! I hope you’re lucky enough to have one of these in your area, I love this place.
True Food Kitchen –  For their beef burgers, they use sustainably-raised 100% grass-fed beef and an exclusive Dave’s Killer Bread bun. They did tell us though that the bun is not organic and that they follow the Dirty Dozen for their produce. When I’m traveling I love to eat here. I personally prefer to eat their turkey burger.

Seek out local farm-to-table restaurants in your area. If that isn’t an option, your best bet is to buy some grass-fed beef from local farmers or Butcher Box (my partner) and make burgers at home. Butcher Box is offering an exclusive $10 off + 2 lbs grass-fed ground beef free (for a limited time to new customers).
If the answer is NO, it likely was raised on some grains or GMO feed. You can also ask:
Our demand for beef is escalating out of control and the only way that we can transition to more sustainable farming methods is for all of us to eat less meat.
Let’s all stop eating factory farmed burgers together, okay?",Food Babe,Unknown

https://foodbabe.com/one-biggest-regrets-heres-im-now/,One Of My Biggest Regrets. Here’s What I’m Doing About It Now!,"I hope by now you’ve heard the big news. I’m launching my own product line called Truvani and my first product is officially available to purchase next Monday… Yeah!!!
I chose our first product very carefully. I wanted it to be something that I already use and love. I wanted it to be something that was nutrient dense and could benefit health. I really wanted it to be something that could help a lot of people.
These are some of the many reasons why I chose to create the first ever USDA certified organic, glyphosate residue-free turmeric supplement.
Turmeric has been a normal, everyday part of my life for as long as I can remember. I grew up in one of the only Indian families in Charlotte, North Carolina. Turmeric was a staple in the many masalas my mom has made over the years… it’s stained our counter… and fresh turmeric root was often in our grocery shopping cart (even though most people I knew outside of my family probably didn’t know what it was!)
Turmeric is at the foundation of Indian cooking and culture that has been passed down to me from my mother, which I hope to pass on to my daughter as well. I dug up some old family photos to help share with you how my love for turmeric has grown in recent years…

First, it is anti-inflammatory*. The active ingredient in turmeric is curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory that helps maintain healthy inflammation responses*. This is my personal favorite reason why I love this product and plan to take it daily. It is also beneficial in promoting overall joint and heart health, while supporting weight loss and helping the body produce more radiant and healthy-looking skin*. Turmeric’s powerful antioxidant properties fight excess free radicals in the body that can damage cells and diminish health*.
As you can see, there is a lot to love about turmeric! It helps me feel healthy and vibrant – and I plan to continue taking it for the rest of my life.

My journey here at Truvani has led me down a path that I never dreamed I go. I am finally able to create the same healthy products that I always wanted to see in stores, not just for myself – but for you too. My ultimate goal is to give you the tools you need for a healthy and organic lifestyle, allowing you to look and feel your best – for life.
Next week, we start out with the official launch of our Organic Daily Turmeric Supplement.

https://foodbabe.com/im-launching-company-truvani/,Why I’m Launching My Company Truvani,"I’m embarking on something bigger than anything I’ve ever done in my life. I’m changing direction and Big Food isn’t going to know what hit them.
As you know – I’ve spent the last few years being an activist. You stood by my side along with the entire Food Babe Army, and we helped shape a safer, more transparent food system.
It’s been amazing. We’ve signed petitions. We’ve voted with our dollars. We’ve shared the truth about what’s in our food. We’ve forced some of the most iconic food brands into changing their ways.
But, I’ve come to realize this isn’t how we win.
As Mahatma Gandhi once said, “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” And he’s right. We will never get a truly safe and healthy food supply by simply demanding that Big Food change.
And that’s why I decided to go head-to-head with Big Food. It’s a new direction, but it’s the right move.
Here’s how I plan to fight the food and chemical industries in 2018:
The food industry has treated us like idiots for far too long, and quite frankly, I’m sick and tired of it. When Big Food sees what we’ve got in store for them this year, they’ll be shaking in their boots. I wish I could be a fly on the wall in their board meetings as they discuss what we’re working on now…
If you want to boycott Big Food, I’m making it easier for you. I’ve told you for years that voting with your dollars is one of the most important things you can do to change the food system. Now, I am finally able to create the healthy products that I always wanted to see in stores, not just for myself – but for you too. Your support will make this possible.
Next week, we start out with the official launch of the first Truvani product.
Are you as excited as I am?",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/creamy-cauliflower-soup-toasted-pine-nuts/,Creamy Cauliflower Soup With Toasted Pine Nuts,"If you love creamy soups, but don’t care for all the butter and heavy cream… cauliflower is your new best friend! This is a dairy-free soup recipe that I re-engineered in a healthier way from a cookbook many years ago and it is still one of my favorites. When you blend cooked cauliflower with vegetable stock, it makes an amazing creamy base for virtually any soup without the traditional “cream” – and it’s extremely healthy and delicious…


To make this soup a bit richer and creamier, I also added some culinary coconut milk. There is so much flavor from the spices and coconut that you won’t believe this soup is dairy-free!
You just need a few basic ingredients, most of which you probably already have in your pantry. Start by dicing up a couple onions, a few cloves of garlic, and a large head of cauliflower. The soup will be blended later, so don’t worry too much about how pretty your chopping is!

Saute the onions and garlic in coconut oil for a few minutes. Stir in the spices and cook a few minutes longer… mmmm… smells so good! Then you just throw in the cauliflower and steam it in the pot for about 15 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable stock and simmer until all the veggies are completely cooked.
It’s best if you have an immersion hand blender like this one to puree the soup. You just pop it in the pot and blend away, instead of pouring hot soup into a blender and making more dirty dishes.
After it’s well blended, carefully ladle the soup into bowls and top with toasted pine nuts. I recommend that you don’t leave out the pine nuts. They add a depth of flavor to die for!!!
This recipe is so versatile too. Feel free to add in some protein or diced veggies to make an even heartier soup. Here’s the printable version of the recipe…

Have you ever made “creamy” soup without dairy before? What ingredients did you use? Let me know in the comments! If you know anyone who would love a healthy soup recipe that’s full of flavor like this one, please share this post with them.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/healthier-birthday-cake-one-year-old/,Healthier Birthday Cake For My One Year Old,"This month we celebrated my daughter Harley’s first birthday. Watching her turn one has been the highlight of my life. She loves to read books, listen to music, is almost walking, still breastfeeding 6 times a day (sometimes more and still in the middle of the night) and took her first sips of organic raw green juice just recently (she loves it, of course!) I am such a different mom than I ever imagined being… To say I am attached to her is an understatement! I take her wherever I go, including business trips and can’t imagine ever leaving her.

When it was time to plan her 1st birthday, I didn’t follow the “guidelines” they suggest in parenting books. They say not to invite a lot of people, or have too many decorations, and to keep it low key, etc. I did the opposite, oops! I invited all her friends, rented out one of our favorite organic restaurants (Pure Pizza) and decorated the whole place with her favorite barn yard animals she loves to play with and sound out.
The whole birthday turned out beautifully, she loved seeing her family and friends and we had so much fun. Harley especially loved playing with the PIG balloons – her favorite part! (The balloons are still flying around our living room as I type and she wakes every morning excited to play with them).

For her cake, I decided to make Harley her own special one-of-a-kind cake with organic ingredients that I knew she liked to eat. We haven’t introduced wheat quite yet, so the base was made with organic oat flour. To make oat flour, you can simply grind any kind of oats in a spice grinder or buy it pre-packaged.
I also thought long and hard about whether or not to use “REAL” sugar for the icing on her cake, and instead of being completely obsessive and coming up with icing that didn’t have any refined sugar, I decided to go old fashioned and use powered sugar creamed together with butter and vanilla to pipe some flower like decorations onto her cake. I wasn’t planning on her eating that much of the icing but then of course I couldn’t predict what happened at the birthday party either.
At the party, after we sang Happy Birthday and blew out her candle, Harley’s grandma (my Mom!) took the white icing off of her cake and put it directly into her mouth! And of course… Harley loved it. Haha. So my daughter had her first taste of refined sugar on her birthday – Something I bet you thought would never happen! At least it was organic homemade icing, right?! Which reminds me to say – the Food Babe lifestyle isn’t about deprivation or guilt – it’s about enjoying the foods you love the healthiest way you know how while living a normal fun-filled and stress-free life!
Since, sharing this photo below earlier this week on Facebook and Instagram, a lot of you have asked me to share the recipe, so here it is! I hope your little ones love it too!

I used this tiered cake pan for the mold of her cake. Harley loves feeding me… even on her birthday!
If you know a mom or dad looking for a healthier cake for their child, please share this recipe! This recipe is great for adults too! I personally loved eating this cake with Harley and plan to make it again for my birthday coming up soon.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/get-sugar-cravings-control-feel-better-fast/,How to get your sugar cravings under control and feel better fast!,"There is one ingredient that has been brought up to me many times that I haven’t spent a lot of time covering, but given the state we are in with so many food industry deceptions happening, I needed to do more than just write an article about it. This ingredient is considered “natural” too.
I read your comments and emails to me every day and listen to the problems you’re having trying to break away from the processed food industry – and the NUMBER ONE issue you’ve expressed to me is your struggle to tame cravings and avoid SUGAR.
Sugar is the most prevalent food additive – found in about 80% of food at the grocery store! Isn’t that insane? The industry adds sugar because they know it’s addicting and it’s a cheap way for them to hook us on their products. And are we ever!


You might be thinking, “Well, I don’t eat very much sugar” and that what I’m saying doesn’t apply to you. Almost all of us have fallen for this trap – including myself!
Even if you are eating an organic diet, you could still be sabotaged by sugar every day if you’re not careful about the foods you choose. That’s because even foods that you think have zero sugar added to them (like yogurt, salad dressings, a can of vegetable soup or tomato sauce) can be loaded up with added refined sugars.
Also – you might be thinking – but, I only eat “organic sugar or honey, or maple syrup, etc”… Organic sugar of course is better to buy because it’s non-GMO and hasn’t been doused with synthetic chemicals linked to cancer – but organic sugar is still sugar. Just because it is organic sugar doesn’t mean you can throw caution to the wind!
I asked them to write down how many grams of added sugar they are eating per day. Here are some results sent in:
“Breakfast
Coffee w. creamer – 10g sugar
part of a bagel – 6g
Snack
candy – 28g
Lunch
Tortellini with marinara sauce – 8g
orange – 9g
tea w/ honey – 34
Dinner
Hamburger on bun with ketchup – 6g
sweet tea – 6 g
green beans – 2g
TOTAL – 109g
WOW!  I’m shocked.” – Leslie
“Out of curiosity I counted my simple, what I thought was healthy, Organic Vanilla yogurt, Organic honey, & GF Chex granola breakfast…. wait for it…. 66 grams of sugar!!!!!!!!!  What the???? Had NO idea! Never gave it a thought. Thank you! I think.” – Brooke
“I was averaging about 45 grams of sugar a day, then today at work someone brought a ginormous gift basket of a variety of cookies (chocolate chip walnut, peanut butter, oatmeal, etc.). While I was still full from breakfast I was fine at turning it down. Then when lunch time hit and we were all on break I fought in my head back and forth and decided to let myself have one. Cuz I was hungry. And didn’t have any food with me. They were convenient, free, everyone was eating them, they looked, smelled, and tasted delicious, “I’ve been so good for so long,” etc. etc. I was done for. I ended up having 3 more. And then felt sick afterwards. Today my sugar count is at 105 grams. It’s crazy how addicting sugar and white flour is. And how slippery that slope is.” – Tristan
“Just under 100. I believe that’s still more than twice what is recommended for men. From cheese, to bread to meats of any kind, try avoiding sugar. I believe it’s now being pumped into the air.” ~ Jon
“I had my 8th grade students write down everything they ate and drank for the entire day. We looked up sugar content for these foods and added it all up. Only after getting their totals did I ask them to look up what was recommended for their age group. I had students with over 200-250 grams of sugar! Yikes.” ~ Deborah
“Wow, my appetite is down and I must have had almost 46 grams of sugar today! Some of that was from a teaspoon of raw honey in my tea and from a smoothie made with 1/2 a 450ml Bolton Farms Blueberry Goodness and a banana. I also had 14 oz of lentil soup with a tsp of balsamic vinegar added. For dessert, a Kashi Oatmeal Dark Chocolate Cookie and two coconut wrapped date rolls and 12 oz of unsweetened almond milk.” ~ Ted
“Approximately 1 million, lol!” ~ Emily
“How much sugar did you have today?”
 “Too.”
 “Two what?”
 “Too much.” ~ Glenn
When I tracked my own sugar intake a couple years ago, it was a real wake up call! I was SHOCKED at how much added sugar is hidden in everyday “healthy” foods in my own house. I honestly couldn’t believe the results and it freaked me out considering how carefully I eat.


I’m human, just like you, and I love sweets! For most of my life, I was addicted to sugar. As a result, my health suffered a lot too. My teeth were awful, my skin was a mess, my body was inflamed, my energy was low and I was overweight.
I’ve found that eliminating added sugar from my diet to be the fastest way to lose weight and get super healthy, but that is just scratching the surface. What added sugar does to your body is scandalous. 
 
 All the excessive sugar in our diets is one of the biggest perpetrators increasing the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, liver disease, and cancer – but its detrimental effects can take years to surface. It’s the hidden link to so much pain and suffering – AND it makes you feel and look awful!!!
Asking you to eliminate every type of “sugar” from your diet is just crazy – any person trying to do this will fail in the long run. The key is to still include sugar in your diet but get it in forms that your body can easily assimilate and from whole food sources that also provide nutrients, minerals and vitamins your body will use.
If you develop this habit and practice it on a regular basis, you’ll be less likely to go overboard when presented and tempted with refined sugary desserts. Even more, you’ll naturally eat less sugar in the long run because your body is getting real nutrition from the food that hasn’t been chemically altered. Eventually… you’ll develop a distaste for refined sugar and your desire for ultimate nutrition will become intuitive.
I know from personal experience… once you eliminate added sugar from your diet, your health soars. You have more energy and your skin glows. Your risk of chronic disease decreases greatly. Getting rid of this ingredient could literally save your life!
Sugar is an enemy that prevents us from achieving optimal health and the fit bodies we want. If you care seriously about your health (and if you don’t you should!) it’s time to put on the brakes and focus on how much sugar you are really eating.
If you’ve tried to quit sugar in the past with no luck, it’s not your fault or a lack of willpower on your part. Sugar is HIGHLY addictive.
In one scientific study, scientists compared the addictive properties of sugar and cocaine. They put groups of rats in two different mazes. In one maze, the rats could choose to go to a room filled with sugary Oreos or a room filled with bland rice cakes. In the second maze, the rats chose between a room where they were injected with cocaine or a room where they received saline injections. Can you guess which rooms the rats chose?
As you’d expect – the rats chose the rooms filled with Oreos and cocaine. But the scientists were shocked by what happened next…
When they examined the brains of the rats at the end of the study, they found that the rats who indulged on Oreos experienced MORE activation in the pleasure center of their brains than the rats injected with cocaine (well known to be one of the most addictive drugs in the world).

P.S. Since launching the 7-Day Sugar Detox in 2016, hundreds of people have taken control of their cravings and had amazing results…
“I think I can say that the Sugar Detox was a success! Not only have I lost a few pounds, but my clothes are looser, and my rings come off a lot easier… my complexion seems smoother and clearer. I have actually tamed the “sugar craving beast” in me!” – Julia
“I just completed the 7-Day Sugar Detox. It was a great experience! I think my relationship with food is taking a much needed positive turn. For me it is less about the weight loss and more about good health for me and my family. I lost 14 lbs and I feel great.” – Matt
“The recipes are so good, I don’t crave for sugar or feel hungry. Before trying this out, I had frequent headaches and was always tired. This is the first time a diet has actually worked for me.” – Archana
“I am on day 3 and can already notice an improvement in energy, hunger levels, cravings, and mood. I’ve even lost 5 lbs. I was in disbelief!” —Bianca
“Today is day 7 of the detox and I am feeling SO great. Feeling lean and energetic! I am going to continue eating this way as it’s spurred a weight loss that I’ve been struggling with. I’m down almost 5 pounds (and measurements changing too!)” – Diana

https://foodbabe.com/food-revolution-wins-2017-happened-whats-next/,Food Revolution Wins in 2017… What Happened and What’s Next,"This year has been LIFE CHANGING and full of adventures and surprises. Two big developments happened in 2017, in case you missed it…
#1 – First and foremost in my heart, I became a mom. Harley was born in January and being her mom has brought me the greatest joy I’ve ever experienced. My biggest hope is that when she’s all grown up, our food will not look like it does today – full of synthetic additives and dangerous pesticides. This has strengthened my resolve to keep fighting for a safer food system.

#2 – I (finally!) launched my own product line, called Truvani. This is how I will fight the food industry in 2018. Keep reading below for more on this!

One thing I like to do at the end of the year is remember all the great things that the last 12 months have brought us and how far we’ve come. All the work we are doing, sharing information, asking companies to change, spreading the word about the dangers of GMO crops, synthetic pesticides, and chemical additives, and choosing to buy organic food at the grocery store is working. I’m so proud of my fellow activists and the Food Babe Army!
At times it can seem like our food is just getting worse or that good changes take FOREVER, but the truth is that we are winning the battle and I truly believe we’ll win the war.

Girl Scouts launch first non-GMO cookie (January 2017) – The Girl Scout S’mores sandwich cookie sold in some markets is made with verified non-GMO ingredients. Will there be more next season? They also added a GMO label to their other cookies, giving more transparency to consumers. Along with other amazing activists, we called them out in 2016 for their use of shady ingredients and GMOs and it’s time for them to clean up their act!
Frito-Lay makes Organic Doritos (February 2017) – Two years ago, we asked Frito-Lay to go organic and over 20k of you signed this petition. Organic Doritos still contain “natural flavors”, so although I won’t be eating them, I am super excited that the industry is creating more organic products and heading in the RIGHT direction.

Earth Fare removes GMOs from store-brand products (February 2017) -They transitioned more than 500 products to non-GMO and are launching hundreds more.
In-N-Out Burger nixes cottonseed oil in some locations (February 2017) –  The Food Babe Army called out In-N-Out for using cottonseed oil last year and this post was shared thousands of times because of you. They have since replaced cottonseed oil with non-GMO sunflower oil in some locations.

Bojangles’ Chicken & Biscuits is stopping routine antibiotics (February 2017) -Thousands of you signed this petition asking Bojangles’ to disclose their ingredients and stop using chicken raised on routine antibiotics. I joined arms with consumer advocacy group U.S. PIRG to deliver our combined petition signatures totaling more that 12,000 to Bojangles’ headquarters in Charlotte. The following day, they sent us an email and told the press that “tremendous progress is being made toward eliminating their use of antibiotics important to human medicine by 2020.”
A whistleblower inspired by our petition contacted us and we were able to publish never before disclosed ingredients for Bojangles here.





Nestle commits to dropping artificial colors (March 2017) – They announced plans to remove artificial food dyes from all their products (not just candy) by 2020.
Chipotle becomes the first national restaurant chain with no added colors, flavors, or preservatives (March 2017) – They have really come a long way since I first wrote about them in 2012.
Papa John’s begins testing organic ingredients (April 2017) – Back in 2014 when I first investigated pizza chains, Papa John’s was VERY secretive about their ingredients and used some very controversial additives. Since this investigation went viral – Papa John’s has removed some of these additives and started sourcing antibiotic-free chicken for their pizzas. They also published ingredients on their website (although it is not entirely complete). And now they’re testing organic ingredients! Let’s keep pushing them to go organic all the way – their cheese and meat should be a top priority.
KFC finally moves to eliminate antibiotics (April 2017) – KFC commits to eliminating antibiotics important to human medicine from its chicken by the end of 2018. Given that they’re such a huge chain, this will make a big impact! KFC would not have taken this action if it wasn’t for the hard work of fellow activists at the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), U.S. PIRG, Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT), Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), Consumers Union, and the Food Babe Army, who have been asking them to make this change.
Fazoli’s restaurants removes synthetic additives from all their food (April 2017) – Say bye-bye to artificial food dyes, nitrates, artificial sweeteners, sodium benzoate – and all the other 81 artificial additives that Fazoli’s got rid of. They completed this move in April at all of their ~220 locations.
New food label launched to help you avoid glyphosate weedkiller in your food (April 2017) – I’m so excited about the new Glyphosate Residue Free label by my partner The Detox Project. In 2016, tests found glyphosate in many popular American foods…Cheerios, Stacy’s Pita Chips, Ritz Crackers… even some products that are organic and non-GMO! My reporting on this was my most shared post of 2016, with millions of views. It struck a chord with so many of you and for good reason. That’s why this new food label is a real game-changer!

Baskin Robbins and Dunkin Donuts move to ditch artificial colors (May 2017) – All those brightly colored donuts and ice creams may not be healthy, but at least they no longer will contain artificial colors derived from petroleum like Yellow #5 and Red #40 which are linked to hyperactivity in children, cancer, and other health problems. Both brands will remove artificial dyes by the end of 2018.
Caribou Coffee eliminates caramel color, artificial colors, flavors, high fructose corn syrup from their brand (May 2017) We called out Starbucks for the use of caramel color and synthetic additives in their drinks and our reporting went viral, causing them to change… and now other big coffee companies are cleaning up their act too.
California to slap warning labels on Roundup weedkiller as a substance known to cause cancer (July 2017) – Following the ruling by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic to humans, California added it to added to California’s list of chemicals that can cause cancer. This is the active ingredient in the world’s most popular herbicide Roundup. Hopefully this warning label brings more awareness and that Roundup becomes ancient history!
Campbell’s leaves the biggest food industry lobby group – the Grocery Manufacturer’s Association (July 2017) – Campbell’s CEO said the move was “not financial” but rather “driven by purpose and principles”. She also said they want to be “the leading health and well-being food company” who provides transparency to their customers. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, is guilty of spending millions of dollars fighting GMO labeling campaigns and lobbies for policies that support junk food brands who fill their foods with artificial additives. Looks like their actions are starting to bite them!
Glyphosate weedkiller found in Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream samples (July 2017) This may not sound like a win… but in a way it is. This campaign by the Organic Consumer’s Association has raised massive public awareness about how out of control the use of Roundup has gotten and how it is contaminating popular foods that millions eat every day.
Target ditches artificial additives from their line of foods aimed at children. (August 2017) – They’ll be free of artificial flavors, artificial preservatives, artificial sweeteners, artificial food dyes, and high fructose corn syrup by the end of 2018.
Triscuits get Non-GMO Project verified (August 2017) – This just goes to show that the demand for non-GMO food is mainstream.
Hy-Vee grocery stores start to eliminate more than 200 artificial additives and synthetic chemicals (August 2017) – They’re removing ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors and colors and partially hydrogenated oils from their store-brand products. The move should be completed by July of next year.
McDonald’s moves to limit antibiotic use in their beef and pork (August 2017) – As the biggest purchaser of beef in this country, this is huge! However, they have yet to set a timeline.
Monsanto is EXPOSED in groundbreaking book Whitewash (October 2017) – Carey Gillam wrote this brave book about Monsanto and the dirty tricks they play in an attempt to keep Roundup weedkiller on the market, despite all the threats it poses to our health and environment. Just as Rachel Carson started the environmental revolution which led to getting the dangerous pesticide DDT banned over 40 years ago, I believe Carey’s book will have the same impact on our world. Pick up a copy here.
Nestle and Dean Foods join Campbell’s in leaving the Grocery Manufacturer’s Association (October 2017) – Big brands are leaving this corrupt organization in droves!
General Mills cuts artificial flavors and colors from baking products (November 2017) – Let’s take this headline with a grain of salt, as General Mills went back on their word and started selling Trix with artificial colors again this year (after they had removed them with big fanfare last year). We really can’t trust Big Food to keep their promises.




Since our official launch, I cannot believe all the incredible thoughtful messages from you Food Babe Army – your support means the world to me! I can’t thank you enough for having such profound faith in me to see this through.
Many people have asked… why did it take you so long?
The reality of starting your own product line is that it’s expensive. We thought about raising outside capital to fund the creation of Truvani. But, outside money comes with outside expectations that put profits over people. At our core, we believe in real food without added chemicals, products without toxins, labels without lies, and we never want outside money to try and “dictate” what we include in our products.
So, our path was clear. Instead of raising outside money, we knew we could accomplish the same effect by pre-selling our first product, the Truvani Daily Turmeric Supplement. This is expected to begin shipping in February 2018. We are starting with turmeric because it is something I personally wanted to consume immediately – but we plan to create a wide variety of products. The vision for Truvani is extensive and we have several new products in development right now!
We’ve accomplished so much in such a short period of time. This is the next step and your continued support will help!
Here’s to an INCREDIBLE 2018! I know it will be our best year yet. Onward!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/happy-holiday-chocolate-goji-sea-salt-drops/,Happy Holiday Chocolate Goji Sea Salt Drops,"This is a recipe that my best friend Nicole shared with me several years ago and I’ve since made it every single year for the holidays. The combination of flavors in these treats are deadly! The smooth texture of the chocolate against the chewiness of the goji berries married with the crunch of the almonds and spike of sea salt is an EXPLOSION in your mouth.
If you’re not big on baking, no worries… You can throw this treat together in a matter of minutes without turning on an oven and you only need 4 ingredients!


Start by pouring 2 bags (20 ounces) of organic chocolate chips in a large glass mixing bowl. Make sure your chocolate is organic because it’s made with one of the most heavily sprayed crops, and non-organic chocolate can be laden with synthetic chemicals.

Now you’ll want to melt your chocolate. To do that, simply fill a small pot (a bit smaller than your bowl) about 1/4 of the way full with water and heat it up to a simmer. Place your glass bowl full of chocolate chips onto the top of the pot… this creates “double boiler”. You can add about 1 teaspoon of butter (optional) to make it easier to melt and lessen your chances of over-cooking it.
Slowly stir occasionally until the chocolate is creamy and completely melted… mmmmmm…. and try not to be tempted into licking the spoon…. but I’m sometimes guilty!


Spread a sheet of unbleached wax paper on a cookie sheet. Using an ice cream scoop (or spoon) drop about 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto the sheet. You can add a few goji berries and almonds to the top of each one to make it look more festive like I did here…

Sprinkle a touch of sea salt on each drop and put the sheet pan in the fridge. Allow them to set up in the fridge for at least an hour. Keep them stored in the fridge, because they melt (and disappear in your mouth) quickly!

https://foodbabe.com/12-healthy-holiday-baking-swaps/,12 Healthy Holiday Baking Swaps!,"Baking season is in full swing, and if you’re anything like me you’ll be making some delicious goodies for your friends and family (and yourself!) in the weeks that come. Most holiday recipes call for refined bleached flour… refined white sugar… food coloring…shortening… and all kinds of unhealthy ingredients. The good news is that you don’t need to sacrifice your health this time of year while still enjoying holiday treats. It’s all about making better choices, and this same philosophy applies any time of the year.
Ignore all those holiday baking displays full of GMOs and controversial additives at your grocery store and try these easy and healthy holiday baking swaps instead…



I call conventional non-organic butter “Monsanto Butter” because it comes from cows fed almost entirely genetically engineered or GMO grains and Monsanto is the largest producer of GMOs. Conventionally raised cows are most commonly fed GMO corn and soy, however, some farmers fatten up their feed with additional sugar from GMO sugar beets. The harmful pesticides used on GMOs (like glyphosate) is also being eaten by these cows too and can end up in their milk – and thereby, butter. In the alternative, grass-fed or pastured raised cows produce more nutritious milk than cows raised with grains. The highest amounts of the most beneficial CLA and Omega 3 fatty acids naturally come from grass-fed cows. Also grass-fed cows produce butter with up to 50 percent more vitamin A and E and 400 percent more beta carotene (which gives the grass-fed butter a deeper yellow color).
Many people bake with margarine instead of butter. Margarines like Imperial and Blue Bonnet are made with inflammatory oils like soybean oil that are most surely GMO (unless specified otherwise). They also can contain hidden trans fat additives, artificial ingredients made from petroleum and unnecessary preservatives.
Good alternatives: Organic Valley Cultured Pasture Butter, Nutiva Buttery Organic Coconut Oil (for vegans)

Flour can be treated with any of the 60 different chemicals approved by the FDA before it ends up on store shelves – including chemical bleach. The industrial processing destroys nutrients, such as Vitamin E and fiber. It has no nutritional value and is essentially dead food, so they “enrich” it with synthetic vitamins (niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid) that are not from nature. When wheat is not organic, it is often sprayed with Roundup weedkiller pre-harvest and residues can remain in the flour. The active ingredient in Roundup, glyphosate, is linked to cancer. Roundup is banned on all organic crops. Choosing an organic flour made with whole white wheat (not bleached, this is a variety of wheat) is a good alternative because it has a light texture for holiday baking. Sprouted flour is much more easily digested than starchy flour, and contains more vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Phytic acid is destroyed when the grain sprouts, so your body is able to absorb the nutrients in these grains – which makes them that much better for you!
Good alternative: Thrive Market Organic Sprouted White Wheat Flour

While popular brands like Domino and C&H are made with cane sugar (instead of GMO sugar beets), any sugar that is NOT organic could have been sprayed with Roundup weedkiller pre-harvest. These powdered sugars also contain non-organic corn starch, which may come from GMO corn. While sugar is not a healthy ingredient by any means, some holiday recipes require a little powdered sugar and by choosing an organic version will ensure that it is not made with GMO sugar beets or laced with synthetic weedkillers and GMO corn.
Good alternative: Wholesome Organic Powdered Sugar

Popular brands like Reddi Wip are filled with factory farmed milk, mono-and diglycerides (hidden trans fat), carrageenan (linked to gut inflammation and cancer), and some also contain cellulose (linked to inflammation and digestion problems). Cool Whip is even worse made with high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, and a concoction of chemicals ranging from artificial flavors to numerous synthetic emulsifiers. Yikes.
Good alternative: Use Natural Value Coconut Cream to make homemade whipped cream. Recipe here.

Similar to dairy, most eggs are raised in factory farms where the chickens are raised on GMO grains, antibiotics, and they never eat grass. Ideally, you’ll want to source your eggs from local farmers who raise the chickens on pasture and never use unnecessary antibiotics or drugs. There are a few good organic pastured options in stores. You can also make a “Flax Egg” as a good vegan option that works well in most baking recipes. Simply mix together 1 tablespoon organic ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons water per egg. Let it sit for 15 minutes to thicken before using.
Good Alternatives: Vital Farms Organic Pastured Eggs or Homemade “Flax Egg”

Crisco used to be made with partially hydrogenated oils and since they revamped their recipe to make it with “0 Grams of Trans Fat” it’s more toxic than ever. It’s primary ingredient is now soybean oil – one of the most unhealthy oils out there which increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and almost always comes from GMO soybeans. Crisco is also filled with fully hydrogenated oils, hidden trans fat additives, and is preserved with TBHQ (linked to increased risk of food allergies).
Good Alternative: Nutiva Organic Vegan Superfood Shortening

Many of the non-organic spices we find on the shelves are treated with chemicals and pesticides before they end up in the bottle. Organic spices cannot have genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs), artificial colors, preservatives, and other synthetic anti-caking agents.
Good Alternative: Red Ape Organic Cinnamon

Avoid “imitation” vanilla extracts that are made with vanillin, as this is typically sourced from petrochemicals and wood pulp. It is fake food and as an artificial flavor it tricks your brain into believing you’re eating real vanilla. It also doesn’t contain the antioxidants found in real vanilla extract that are good for the body. Many of these fake vanilla extracts are filled with controversial additives like caramel color (linked to cancer) and propylene glycol as well.
Good Alternative: Simply Organic Vanilla Extract

Those food colors by McCormick and Betty Crocker are made with artificial food dyes made from petroleum (Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1). These are linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children. Dyes have also been found to be contaminated with carcinogens. Europe requires any food containing dyes to carry the warning label, “May Have an Adverse Effect on Activity and Attention in Children.” McCormick’s colors are suspended in a solution made with propylene glycol and preserved with parabens – endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems. There are natural coloring kits available made from real food like beets, spirulina, and turmeric. This goes for holiday sprinkles too!
Good Alternative: India Tree Natural Decorating Colors

Refined white sugar has zero nutritional value. Eating refined sugar is addictive, makes you fat, tired, depressed, age faster, makes your skin dull, weakens immunity and when consumed in excess causes all sorts of diseases. Unless a sugar says it is “cane sugar” it is probably made from GMO sugar beets. Any sugar (including Cane Sugar) that is NOT organic could have been sprayed with Roundup pre-harvest. You can replace white sugar with organic coconut sugar. It’s a perfect 1 to 1 substitute for any recipe that calls for regular old sugar. It’s completely unrefined and not bleached, helping to preserve all of its vitamins and minerals.
Good Alternative: Nutiva Organic Coconut Sugar

Brown sugar is simply white sugar with molasses added to it. So, like all other types of sugar (see above), unless it’s organic it may have been treated with Roundup. It’s best to either choose an organic brown sugar, or better yet, use organic coconut sugar as a replacement. The flavor of coconut sugar is richer than white sugar, so it works well as a replacement for brown sugar and is more nutrient dense.
Good Alternative: Nutiva Organic Coconut Sugar or Wholesome Organic Brown Sugar

Most baking powders contain aluminum, which is linked to alzheimer’s. The popular Clabber Girl brand is also made with GMO ingredients.
Good alternative: Rumford Aluminum-Free Baking Powder (non-GMO and aluminum free)
Wouldn’t it be amazing if everyone made these healthier baking swaps? If that happened, our stores would stop carrying all those toxic products and give us more good options!
If there is anything on this list that your local grocery stores do not carry, I encourage you to talk to them and request that they do. In this post I tell you EXACTLY what to say, to make it really easy for you.

It could be all those holiday goodies tempting us everywhere we look, but there are many reasons why we gain weight in the winter. Heavy foods along with sleep and hormonal changes that are normal this time of year can all make our pants too tight.
I know for myself, I’m a bit less active in the winter and it takes more to motivate myself to head outdoors into the cold. All the way up until recently I’ve been taking long walks with Harley every single evening, but now it is so dark and chilly outside after work that I don’t want to bundle us up to go out. As I’m missing out on all of that daily exercise I was getting, I now need to be extra vigilant on making sure I make it to the gym to get that activity in! Unfortunately… one of my biggest triggers is sugar – especially this time of year! Can you relate?

I cannot wait to watch Harley grow up over the years and see the excitement in her eyes on Christmas morning too.

https://foodbabe.com/iced-cranberry-scones/,Iced Cranberry Scones,"These Iced Cranberry Scones are a perfect treat to have around during the holidays! When you make them with organic ingredients, they are a healthier alternative to the Cranberry Orange Scones at Starbucks made with Monsanto Milk (from cows raised on GMOs) and lots of refined conventional sugar (26 grams per scone!)
My scone recipe calls for a very small amount of sugar… I just add a couple tablespoons of coconut palm sugar to the entire batch of dough, plus a little organic powdered sugar to the glaze. I use organic coconut palm sugar in my baking often. You can use it as a 1:1 substitute for any recipe that calls for regular old sugar. It’s completely unrefined and not bleached like typical white sugar, helping to preserve all of its vitamins and minerals.


To ensure your scones are fluffy and tender, you’ll want to use cold butter – so keep it in the fridge until needed. Also put the coconut milk in the refrigerator the night before (or at least 20 minutes before) making the recipe. This will keep the butter from melting while you are mixing and rolling out the dough, and will help you make perfect scones!
When you’re ready to bake up some scones, start by heating your oven up to 350 degrees. In a large glass mixing bowl, measure out 1½ cups of organic sprouted wheat or spelt flour. Add two tablespoons of coconut sugar, a couple teaspoons of baking powder, and a dash of sea salt. Mix well…

Take the cold butter out of the fridge and cut in 6 tablespoons of organic butter with the back of a fork or pastry cutter, until it forms little pea-sized crumbles…

Using a citrus zester, grate about a teaspoon of zest from an organic orange. Stir in the orange zest along with at least ¼ cup of dried cranberries. Add more if you like lots of cranberries!
In a separate bowl, whisk one egg with ¼ cup plus two tablespoons culinary coconut milk. (This is the type of coconut milk that is intended for cooking and generally found in a can. Just make sure you choose a BPA-free version)
Add this to the flour mixture and mix gently – only until combined. Do not overmix, as this will create tougher scones!

If you find the dough is dry after mixing in the egg and coconut milk, keep adding coconut milk (one tablespoon at a time) until the dough just comes together but is not sticky. If you add too much simply sprinkle the dough with a little more flour.

Add some flour to your favorite cutting board and a good rolling pin to prepare it for rolling out the dough. This will keep the dough from sticking.
Remembering not to over handle the dough, place it on the floured cutting board and gently roll each side out until it is 1” thick. Cut the scones into your desired shape and place them on a large baking sheet lined with unbleached parchment paper…

If you want a more golden brown finish to the top of your scones, brush them with extra coconut milk before baking. Put the scones in the oven and set the timer for 25 minutes.
While they’re baking, you can quickly mix up the glaze. All you need to do is whisk together three tablespoons of coconut milk with a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar. Add another tablespoon of sugar if you want it a little thicker. Put the glaze in the fridge to keep it cool.
When the scones are done baking, pull them out of the oven and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before adding the glaze. After they’re cool, drizzle each scone with a bit of glaze…
Now, call up a friend and enjoy your fluffy scones with a cup of hot tea! Yum!
If you have any leftovers, keep them in an airtight container to keep them moist. They are best heated until warm before you serve them…


If you know anyone who is a scone-lover too, wrap some up on a plate with a bow for them. Also share this recipe with them. I’m sure they’ll be thankful!

https://foodbabe.com/announcing-product-line-truvani/,Announcing My Own Product Line: Truvani,"Over the last few years, the Food Babe Army has accomplished a lot… We have influenced Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Kraft, General Mills, Subway, Panera Bread, and many other big food companies into changing for the better…
But here’s the truth: Big companies don’t change fast enough. And most companies don’t value our health over profits.
How many times have you fallen in love with a product, and then a big conventional company buys the brand and the product changes? This story has played out so many times over the years. Just last week, I was looking over the label of my favorite grass-fed vanilla yogurt and noticed a bunch of “gum” additives when previously it had very simple ingredients.
A company starts out with great intentions. A company gets acquired. Then, the company changes their ingredients to cut costs. It’s frustrating.
We work hard here at Food Babe HQ to find great products and recommend them to you. But we can’t predict acquisitions. So, there I was. Mad that I had purchased another brand I thought I could trust. And that’s when I decided that this would happen FOR THE LAST TIME.


Here’s what we are all about…
Since our official launch, I cannot believe all the incredible thoughtful messages from you Food Babe Army – your support means the world to me! I can’t thank you enough for having such profound faith in me to see this through.
Many people have asked… why did it take you so long?
The reality of starting your own product line is that it’s expensive. We thought about raising outside capital to fund the creation of Truvani. But, outside money comes with outside expectations that put profits over people. At our core, we believe in real food without added chemicals, products without toxins, labels without lies, and we never want outside money to try and “dictate” what we include in our products.
So, our path was clear. Instead of raising outside money, we knew we could accomplish the same effect by pre-selling our first product, the Truvani Daily Turmeric Supplement. This is expected to begin shipping in February 2018. We are starting with turmeric because it is something I personally wanted to consume immediately – but we plan to create a wide variety of products. The vision for Truvani is extensive.
We’ve accomplished so much in such a short period of time. This is the next step and your continued support will help!
Thank you again.
And here’s to a remarkable 2018.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/take-daily-organic-turmeric-supplement/,Why I Take A Daily Organic Turmeric Supplement,"I am careful about what I eat, but I am also careful in other aspects of my life too. I seek out things that are healing to my body… such as drinking clean filtered water, laughing with good friends, and taking exercise classes. I don’t want to just live… I want to be healthy.
Can you blame me? I want to feel amazing and have lots of energy. I want a clear mind, free of anxiety and sadness. And I want to live a long, happy life. Don’t you?
The problem is that there are toxins in many products and in our environment that can lead to disease. This is why I try to surround myself and my family with the purest, most natural products (including supplements). I don’t feel comfortable ingesting synthetic substances invented in a lab by a team of scientists… especially when these synthetic substances come with a long list of potential adverse side effects.
Many over-the-counter medications contain “inactive ingredients” that I wouldn’t normally put into my body – and most definitely don’t want to subject my body to when I’m trying to recover from something.
I personally like to heal my body naturally with treatments like acupuncture and some herbal remedies whenever possible. Some people think it’s crazy… but herbs and spices have been used for centuries in Ayurvedic (a medical system that originated in India) and Traditional Chinese Medicine to help a number of conditions. These natural remedies go way back in our history and have been used for a very long time to support good health.


Several years ago, I had a bad fall and injured my tailbone. When I fell, all the nerves surrounding my spine and lower back felt like they were on FIRE! I was traveling for work at the time, and had to be pumped full of painkillers just to get on the plane back home. I was bedridden for 3 weeks and miserable.
And to top it off, my doctor said I only had one option for relief – surgery to remove my tailbone. Hearing his prognosis was devastating to me, because it meant that I would be unable to sit for at least 3 months and endure lots of physical therapy to regain muscle and strength in my body.
Not to mention having a very expensive surgery, taking lots of prescription drugs, and missing work and life.
So instead of going under the knife, I chose to try a different path. And I did it through rest, lots of anti-inflammatory foods like turmeric and ginger, and regular acupuncture treatments (yes – needles right into my butt!).
But then I decided to go to an amusement park, got on some really bumpy rides and re-injured the same spot. Oops.
Needless to say, I went straight back to acupuncture, started taking daily turmeric supplements, and continued on the same path of recovery – and guess what? I got better again.
I like to juice turmeric – and really love to drink turmeric shots! I sometimes make turmeric lattes and cook vegetables with turmeric. And, I also like to take a daily organic turmeric supplement. That’s the easiest way to know I’m getting my turmeric in every day. I can travel with it, keep it in my purse, and never forget to take it.
Turmeric’s beneficial properties have been the subject of thousands of peer-reviewed and published studies. Turmeric is full of nutrients and antioxidants, which are ingredients in food that fight excess free radicals in the body that can damage cells and diminish health*. When I consume turmeric regularly, I feel better overall. Most recently, I began suffering from intense pain in my thumb and wrist, which many new mamas get from picking up their babies (which is why it’s called “Mommy Thumb”). In addition to acupuncture treatments and wrapping it, turmeric has helped with the inflammation*.
Research indicates that curcumin is an anti-inflammatory*. Chronic inflammation is a sneaky condition in the body and you may not even realize if it’s affecting you. It can be brought on by a number of factors… diet choices, environmental pollution, food allergies, stress, lack of sleep, hormonal changes… and, understandably, affects a lot of people. Chronic inflammation is thought to increase your risk of several conditions*,
Turmeric is just one of the tools I use to feel healthy and vibrant – and I plan to continue taking it for the rest of my life.
Unfortunately the turmeric supplement I was taking was acquired by a conventional chemical company that I could no longer support. This is why I chose to create a Daily Turmeric Supplement as the first product in my new company Truvani.
Check out all the details here  – we are taking pre-orders until Tuesday (early-bird pricing ends tomorrow). Remember we believe in real food without added chemicals, products without toxins and labels without lies.

https://foodbabe.com/broccoli-salad-will-make-want-eat-veggies/,This Broccoli Salad Will Make You Want To Eat All Your Veggies!,"Eating lots of veggies is one of my secrets for stopping junk food cravings dead in their tracks. Once you start pumping your diet up with veggies at every meal, you’ll start craving them instead of junk foods and desserts. It may sound crazy, but it really works! When your body gets the nutrition it needs, your body becomes satisfied!
I eat “cruciferous” veggies like broccoli, cabbage, and kale often because they are superstars in the vegetable family. They’ve been shown to help remove toxins from the body by boosting the liver’s own detoxifying enzymes. There is ample research out there that shows cruciferous veggies help to stave off cancer and heart disease too. So, if you’re not already… it’s time to add broccoli (and other cruciferous veggies) to your diet STAT.
If you’re not a fan of broccoli, this flavorful Asian Broccoli Salad just might change your mind! It makes an incredibly healthy lunch that’s easy to make ahead and pack for work. It also is amazing for dinner served alongside a hearty bowl of Carrot Ginger Lentil Soup. Talk about an awesome meal full of antioxidants and compounds that fight inflammation!!!


I love recipes like this that require so little time in the kitchen. You can put this salad together in less than 15 minutes! Here’s how easy it is to make…
Bring a large pot of water to boil while you chop a large head of broccoli into bite-size florets. Once the water begins to boil, add the broccoli and cook quickly for just a couple minutes. Pour the broccoli into a colander and rinse under cold water until cool…
To assemble the salad… chop up a couple scallions, a small handful of raw nuts, and thinly slice half of a red onion. Add them to a large bowl along with the broccoli. Sprinkle on a couple tablespoons of sesame seeds and give the salad a little stir until combined.
Now it’s time to make the delicious peanut (or almond) dressing! Essentially any high quality nut butter would work and if you have a nut allergy, you can use sunflower seed butter. When shopping for nut butter, look for those that are labeled organic and raw. Most store-bought versions have added refined sugar, so check the ingredient list. Watch out for the “no stir” versions that contain added oils (usually palm oil) to keep them blended on the shelf. Ideally, it should just contain nuts and stir it yourself. My favorite brands are Once Again and Artisana.
To make the dressing, start by adding the nut butter to a small bowl. Add in the tamari, rice wine vinegar, raw honey, filtered hot water, and a dash of sesame oil. Whisk it all together until smooth. Grate a teaspoon of fresh ginger and whisk it into the dressing until it’s well blended. Add a couple dashes of sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper… and now it’s ready to assemble your plates! Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine. Dig in and enjoy your veggies!

https://foodbabe.com/flourless-chocolate-chip-cookies-gluten-free-and-amazing/,Flourless Chocolate Chip Cookies {Gluten-Free and Amazing!},"If you’ve tried a million chocolate chip cookie recipes out there trying to find the best one, look no further. Not only do these blow other cookies out of the water, but they are made entirely without flour! It’s pretty amazing that you can make a crispy, chewy, tasty cookie without any flour, but you really can.


One ingredient I try to limit from my diet is refined flour. Typical flour is milled discarding all the essential nutrients the original grain contained. The heat that is generated to crush the grain into flour destroys any vitamin or mineral normally found in the the grain, leaving a white powdery product devoid of any life. It’s essentially dead food. So they have to “enrich” it back by adding in synthetic vitamins and minerals.
The next part is even scarier because fresh milled flour usually isn’t acceptable for consumption because of the look, feel and smell of it. The FDA has approved over 60 chemicals for manufacturers to use to help these aesthetics and the shelf life of flour. Chlorine is used to bleach conventional flours to remove the smell and change the color. The flour is put into a gas chamber and treated with chlorine dioxide which leaches all the vitamin E out of the flour and leaves a chemical called dichlorostearic acid that remains in the flour. Additionally treating flour with chlorine can create more chemical byproducts that have been known to react to other proteins and cause nervous system damage in humans.
The good news is that refined flour is pretty easy to avoid if you know what to look for. If you see “wheat flour”, “enriched flour”, “bleached flour” on an ingredient list, this is refined flour – so stick it back on the shelf and look for alternatives. This standard applies to other flour-based foods like breads, crackers, rolls, bagels, and any commercially baked food.
When it comes to gluten-free cookies, they are often made with replacements for wheat flour, like rice flour or tapioca starch. Rice is known to contain 10 to 20 times more arsenic than other grains, as it tends to absorb more arsenic due to the way it’s grown. Arsenic is a powerful carcinogen that promotes the risk of several types of cancer. It’s also linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, problems in pregnancy and infant development. Tapioca flour can skyrocket your blood sugar (more than whole wheat does) and has zero nutrient value – just empty calories. I get that you don’t eat a cookie to be healthy, but I’m all for packing as much nutrition into all the foods I eat, even cookies!
They have a texture and taste very similar to cookies made with regular flour. They won’t crumble all over the place like other gluten-free cookies you may have tried, and are rich with flavor.

Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees and lining a large baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper. This makes cleanup super easy!
Crack an egg into your favorite glass mixing bowl and give it a little whisk. Stir in the date sugar, molasses, real vanilla extract, and a touch of baking soda. Mix it all up well…

Measure out a cup of almond butter into the bowl and stir well to combine…
Fold in the organic chocolate chips (make sure they are gluten-free if you can’t eat gluten!)…

Using an ice-cream scoop, drop tablespoon-sized balls on the parchment-lined pan. You should get about 12 cookies out of this recipe. If the batter is somewhat loose, gently shape them into nice little circles…

Put the pan in the oven and check them at 10-12 minutes to see if they’re done. Bake for up to 15 minutes if you want a crispier cookie…

My cookies came out perfectly crispy around the edges and bit softer on the inside. They are amazing dipped in homemade coconut milk!

You might want to hide a few of these cookies away for yourself before letting anyone know you made them – they will be gone in a matter of minutes! If you know anyone who loves chocolate chip cookies, bake them up a batch. Who knows, maybe someday they’ll return the favor!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/whitewash-book-get-monsantos-roundup-glyphosate-banned-forever/,Whitewash Book Could Get Monsanto’s Roundup (Glyphosate) Banned Forever,"There is a chemical that likely causes cancer being sprayed on 80% of the food in this country and residues have been found in popular foods like Cheerios and Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream.
This chemical is Roundup Weedkiller (Glyphosate) made by Monsanto.
Even though the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer deemed glyphosate probably carcinogenic to humans, Roundup has NOT been banned. This chemical continues to be used on food crops, parks, playgrounds, and by homeowners everywhere. Glyphosate is now so rampant in our environment that it’s found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies, air samples… the list goes on.
Since our regulatory agencies are not taking action, this carcinogen continues to proliferate and is contaminating virtually all of the food that we and our children are eating. It’s maddening! Some food brands are taking notice – Ben & Jerry’s recently announced that they’re launching glyphosate-free ice cream by 2020 and other brands are getting certified as glyphosate residue free. This is a huge step in helping to clean up our food supply, but much more needs to be done.
My dear friend Carey Gillam expertly delves into this issue in her new must-read (and courageous!) book, Whitewash: The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer, and the Corruption of Science. Just as Rachel Carson started the environmental revolution which led to getting the dangerous pesticide DDT banned over 40 years ago, I believe Carey’s book will have the same impact on our world.


You’ll find Carey’s information very well researched with a wealth of evidence, full of references and background material. I plan to keep this on my bookshelf to use as a reference. In her book, she breaks down how Monsanto has been able to keep Roundup on the market for decades, despite the dangers it presents to our health and environment. She covers…
Monsanto and big chemical companies may have money and great influence, but as consumers, WE have the greatest power of all. The public at large may not be paying attention now… spraying Roundup in their yards and eating Roundup-Ready GMOs but books like this can open up their eyes so they stop buying and using these products. The public needs to know the truth about what is going on – and it’s up to us to spread the word!

Carey goes where most journalists don’t dare to go. In my own experience, I know it takes guts to stand up to billion dollar corporations. It also takes an Army! The vicious attacks can be relentless, and I could never do this work without you by my side. I urge you to pick up a copy of Whitewash and maybe one or two extra to give as gifts to your loved ones.

https://foodbabe.com/marketing-artificial-color-children-illegal-amazing-story/,Marketing Artificial Color To Children Should Be Illegal (Amazing Story),"I’ve got some real idiotic news about Trix Cereal… but first let me explain why I’m so angry about it. If you’re part of the Food Babe Army, I doubt you’re filling your carts up with Trix and Lucky Charms at the grocery store. That’s because you are some of the smartest consumers out there when it comes to your food. You know what to look for on an ingredient list, what additives to avoid, and how to keep the GMOs out of your diet.
People sometimes criticize me for writing about processed junk foods like Trix because they think it’s obvious how unhealthy it is… but there are still a lot of people out there who do not know this information. They do not know what additives like Yellow #5 and TBHQ could be doing to their health or the health of their kids. They do not know that there could be Roundup weedkiller in their Cheerios, silly putty in their french fries, or wood in their cheese. We still need to reach these people! That’s why it’s important to keep raising awareness of these issues.
I also want to keep y’all informed as to what’s happening in the processed food world so that you can spread the word to your own friends and family who need to know this information. Our movement is growing, but there are still SO MANY people we need to reach… and this sad news about Trix really helps make my point…
General Mills just announced they’re putting the artificial dyes – Yellow #6, Blue #1, Red #40 – back into Trix Cereal because they were “besieged” by customer complaints since they removed these dyes two years ago.
You may recall, General Mills announced with big fanfare a couple years ago that they’d remove chemical dyes from all their cereals and replace them with natural colors like turmeric extract, vegetable and fruit juices. They later claimed sales of the dye-free Trix “exceeded expectations” along with great feedback from customers, which makes it even more perplexing as to why they suddenly pulled a 180. They’re going to start selling their original version of Trix with “neon bright” fake colors as soon as next month (both versions will be available).


Who is asking General Mills to put artificial dyes in their children’s food? Are you or anyone you know actually calling up General Mills and complaining about the color? Do the fake colors really make Trix taste better? I really want to know the reasons why anyone would want their children to eat Blue #1 and Yellow #6.
I truly believe if consumers knew that these colors are derived from petroleum, what they do to their bodies and how they have been shown to affect children, they would not want to eat them. We clearly still have so much work to do and need to keep spreading the truth.
The Feingold Association recently thanked us in their newsletter for our successful petition which got the artificial dyes out of Kraft Mac n’ Cheese, along with a story about how one little boy’s life was changed forever when artificial dyes were removed from his diet (following our petition). They graciously granted me permission to publish the entire story here to reach more people and impact as many lives as possible. When I launched the Kraft petition, I received countless letters like this one, and I know that thousands of you are having the same experiences. I hope you read and share this story below with your loved ones and keep sharing the truth about artificial food dyes.
From birth, Cameron was “different.” He was very moody, angry, hated being touched and would not sit still —EVER. He hated car rides, being in a stroller, being carried, sung to; you name it. Other than video games, he hated everything. He never slept for more than a few hours at a time and averaged about five hours. He woke up at night for no obvious reason 5-15 times a night until the age of 5. He spit up every time he ate until he was 3 years old, and he would break out in hives all over his body. At 1 1/2 we took him to an allergist, who said it was food sensitivities and he would outgrow it. He didn’t.
Cameron’s behavior was horrible. In stores, he would run away and hide. In the car, he would scream until he vomited and he gave me two black eyes before he was three years old. He couldn’t speak; he would make sounds but no distinguishable words. We took him for a hearing test, which was fine, and they recommended occupational therapy. He was very uncooperative, but we continued with it two times a week for a year.
When Cameron was four he started speech therapy, but he hated it. He would scream until he began vomiting. He wouldn’t participate with his speech therapist but would kick, hit and spit at her. She suggested medication to help subdue his outbursts. He didn’t know the alphabet or colors but was very good at math. We started thinking he was mildly autistic. He still was not sleeping and was getting hives daily. He craved food with dyes like a junkie craves heroin.
Cameron started 4-year-old kindergarten, and it was horrible. He hated it as much as his teacher hated him. He was the worst-behaved kid in a classroom of thirty-five 4-year-olds. His teacher also suggested looking into medicine, as she didn’t think he would be able to function in mainstream school. But I was firmly against medicating him and started considering homeschooling.
Here is a sequence of pictures I took as Cameron ate a blue lollipop (before I learned about additives). I can now see how he became progressively more miserable. In the last two pictures, there are tears rolling down his cheeks. That final picture gets me every time I look at it!

The following day, I took him for his first allergy appointment. The allergist said he had sensitivities. “Nothing to worry about. It won’t kill him. He should outgrow it by age 4.”
My “Ah-ha moment”
 In the spring of 2013, I saw an online petition calling for Kraft to remove dyes from its mac & cheese because the additives could cause ADHD, mood swings and hives. This was my “ah-ha” moment!
The previous night, Cameron had eaten Kraft Mac & Cheese and he didn’t sleep and was covered in hives. I decided to try taking out food dye for a week to see if his hives went away. They did! We were amazed that after only a few days, he didn’t severely itch. After a few weeks, when he had had very limited exposure to food dyes, I noticed his behavior was different. I thought maybe he was getting sick.
Then, Cameron gave me a hug all on his own! This had never happened before. What’s more, he was waking up only a few times a night instead of ten. He wasn’t so angry, and he wasn’t as itchy. And, after thirty days of being dye-free, he could SPEAK! Nearly perfect, clear words that everyone could understand. For the first time ever, he said, “I love you.”
I spent most of that month in tears because of the life-changing miracles that came from removing dyes. He literally learned his colors overnight. I spoke with him about these changes, and he said his body didn’t hurt as much as it used to and his head didn’t buzz as much. I then realized my son spent the first five years of his life in constant pain and didn’t know he was supposed to feel any different. We were dye-free for three months and doing great; then, we went to a 4th of July parade. He was perfectly behaved until I let him have some cotton candy, and all hell broke out! He was yelling, crying, screaming, curled up in the fetal position having a complete breakdown. This reaction to dye took five days to wear off.
How the additives affect him
 If Cameron ate the petroleum-based dyes, artificial flavors or preservatives eliminated on the Feingold Diet he would experience these reactions: anger, body & joint pains, hives, impaired learning, ringing/buzzing in his ears, stomach pain, anxiety, rapid & loud speech, bipolar tendencies, and the inability to follow simple directions.
I decided it was all or nothing. No food coloring, ever!
 Things were much better that winter, and I also noticed a major change in Cameron’s dad. He cut back on his dye consumption. (He was completely addicted to Jolly Ranchers, Sour Patch Kids and Mountain Dew.) But now, he wasn’t as angry at the world like he had always been and was just nicer in general. Who knew that dyes could affect adults? (They also affect pets. My dog will rip up toys if he eats anything with dye in it.)
He had felt miserable so it’s no wonder he acted miserable as well.
 By March of 2014, we were about one-year dye-free, and Cameron was complaining about body pain again, and he had what doctors kept referring to as eczema. That’s when I stumbled across the Feingold Diet and thought, “This sounds like the symptoms Cameron is having now right down to the ADHD and behavioral issues.” I ordered the membership materials and have never looked back. The Feingold Association provides a long list of brand-name foods that are free of dyes, artificial flavors and the three worst preservatives. They also show how to test for salicylate sensitivity. We removed all preservatives from Cameron’s diet, and things slowly began to improve. (Preservatives are hard to identify because of loopholes in labeling laws. Chemicals like BHA, BHT and TBHQ can be hidden in the ingredients in a product or sprayed on the insides of the packaging and do not need to be listed.) I kept a daily food & behavior journal for Cameron; if it went in his mouth, it was written down. This was a huge help in identifying a possible culprit.
After being dye-free for just thirty days, Cameron experienced the following:
1. Hives subsided
 2. Anger diminished
 3. Started speaking
 4. Learned his colors
 5. Slept better at night
 6. Body pain lessened
 7. Developed compassion & empathy
 8. Began to socialize (He couldn’t handle being in public places with any number of people prior to this.)
Cameron started kindergarten, free of artificial colors and flavoring at the same school where two previous teachers “suggested” medication. Three months into the school year, he was awarded “Student of the Month.” He no longer needed speech therapy or an IEP. The therapist had no explanation as to why he suddenly could talk, but I am 100% certain it is from removing the additives. His occupational therapist contacted me three years after her last meeting with him, saying she couldn’t believe the progress he had made. She said she assumed he would always have major issues.
Food sensitivity avoidance has become our way of life. We follow the Feingold Foodlist almost 100%. Cameron still has “eczema” flare-ups occasionally, but they are not as severe. There are zero behavior issues that we deal with now. Cameron sleeps an average of eight hours a night, seven days a week. He has never been sent to the principal’s office, and he actively & willingly participates in school. We still need to tweak his diet on a regular basis and watch for things, but it is much easier now. We also found Cameron can have reactions to dyes in soap, shampoo, temporary tattoos, toothpaste etc., so, all of that must be dye-free also.
The last accidental food coloring exposure was in May 2014. Within twenty minutes of ingesting a microscopic amount of red dye 40, he was curled into the fetal position, lying on the floor, under the table in a restaurant, experiencing severe body pain & itching. An hour after ingestion, his speech became loud and rapid, and he was unable to hear us when we tried to speak to him. For two hours after exposure to the dye, he repeatedly used the word “what.” His behavior became manic, but while this subsided quickly, the body pain lasted several days. We have found that soaking in a bath with baking soda can lessen some of the symptoms as it helps draw out toxins. We went dye-free in 2013, to try and clear up the hives issue. I never in a million years would have thought additives in food could be linked to Cameron’s behavior, but after seeing the cravings for and withdrawal from food coloring, I can honestly say it should be illegal. It is addictive and mind-altering, just like any other drug.
Success at last!
 After consulting many allergists, dermatologists, pediatricians & pediatric rheumatologists for more than five years, and not getting help, we finally figured out my son’s issues. It began with an online petition and continued with the help and guidance of the Feingold Association. Happily, Kraft removed the synthetic food coloring from its Mac & Cheese in 2016.

https://foodbabe.com/best-air-purifier-health/,The Best Air Purifier For Your Health,"Have you ever been near a window inside your home when the sunshine was coming in just right and saw little particles floating in the air? I’m sorry to tell you that this isn’t just dirt… and that there is a lot more lurking in those little particles (carcinogens, hormone disruptors, bacteria, developmental toxins), which go right into your body every time you breathe.
Even if your house is super clean and although you can’t always see these particles in the air, we’ve all got some level of dust in our home – which is just the reality of modern day life, full of industrial chemicals. Everyday household items like your furniture, carpets, flooring, window shades, cleaning products, beauty products, paint, clothing, and beds, are emitting microscopic chemicals into the air, which float around and settle onto surfaces as dust.
Researchers at George Washington University tested household dust samples and found 45 toxic chemicals, many of which were floating in the air before settling on the ground and other surfaces as dust. They found everything ranging from flame retardants, fluorinated chemicals, and phthalates. Breaking new research has found that some of these particles can alter hormones, triggering the body to store fat.
While outdoor air pollution has been classified as a carcinogen (causes cancer) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer – the air we breathe inside of our homes can be even worse! The EPA says that indoor air pollution is about 2 to 5 times greater than the air outside, and is sometimes 100 times worse than the air you breathe outside. I was shocked when I found that out!
Many of these pollutants are also developmental toxins, and now that I have a little one at home who will be crawling soon, this is one of my #1 concerns. The last thing I want is for my daughter to crawl around on flooring contaminated with toxic dust and breathing in these chemicals. Her tiny body is more susceptible to these toxic invaders.
“The findings suggest that people, and especially children, are exposed on a daily basis to multiple chemicals in dust that are linked to serious health problems” ~ lead study author Ami Zota at The George Washington University


Even if I’m eating the purest, most organic food in the world and drinking the cleanest filtered water around, I know that the air I breathe is just as important! I started using this air purifier in my home and cannot believe the difference in how well I feel and sleep.
We obviously can’t all live in a bubble, but we should do our best to make sure the environment we live in isn’t toxic. Using this air purifier has really given me the peace of mind that the air in my home is safe, especially for my daughter!
As I always want to share with you what works for me, I partnered up with Intellipure to make it easier for you to try the same air purifier I’ve been using. My team was able to negotiate a special deal just for you.

https://foodbabe.com/natural-flavors-really-bad-must-watch/,Are Natural Flavors Really That Bad? (MUST WATCH),"I have a confession to make. My once in a while processed food meltdown is with Annie’s Chocolate Bunnies. Once I crack open the box, I literally cannot stop eating them. (And thinking about them right now, is making my mouth water.) It’s insane! I’ve noticed when I make homemade cookies I don’t get the feeling that I need to eat the entire plate… but with those Annie’s Bunnies, man, I really can’t stop. Why is it that they’re so addicting? Is it all the sugar? There’s actually more to it than that.
I recently sat down with Mark Schatzker, the author of The Dorito Effect – a must read book for all you foodies out there who read ingredients and care about what you’re eating. You know how addicting Doritos are…well, the stories he tells in this book about food and flavor are out of control incredible. I highlighted my copy like crazy and immediately reached out to Mark because I was so impressed with the investigative work he has done. You can watch my complete interview with Mark here:



The main topic of our discussion was “natural flavors”. If you read ingredient lists you know these are EVERYWHERE…listed on almost every package in the aisle at the grocery store. Here are some highlights from our interview…



LaCroix is mostly just carbonated water… but I don’t consider food and drinks that are synthetically flavored (vs. being flavored with real food) a healthy everyday item. I don’t want to screw up the signals in my body that allow me to crave something because it has the nutrients I need. I also don’t want to eat foods that trick my tastebuds into downing almost a whole box in one sitting (like those Annie’s Bunnies!) I like to know exactly what I’m eating, and with “natural flavors” I’m left in the dark. Sticking with real food is just simpler, healthier, and oftentimes cheaper too.
If you’re really hooked on RX Bars, I’m joining GMO Inside and asking them to go organic and to remove natural flavors!",Food Babe,Unknown

“We started out with being very concerned about all the additives and preservatives that food companies are ALLOWED to put in our food and we did a lot of research on what they are doing to us everyday we eat those foods. We were determined to make a change in our lives and help those around us to become more aware.
Then we found Food Babe. Food Babe was the person who was going to help us complete our mission: To live a long healthy life together! We wondered how we would make such a drastic, BUT IMPORTANT, change with there being so much information we needed to understand about additives, preservatives, going organic, reading labels, looking for symbols and numbers, etc… We always say it is like learning a new language.
Then we saw the Food Babe membership and it provided all the information we needed to transition by providing us with a Starter Guide AND it provided us with a Monthly Eating Guide, which helped us when going to Earth Fare. THIS MEMBERSHIP IS THE BEST MONEY SPENT! Our health is priceless and this membership is our Bible.
Since purchasing the annual membership and transitioning to a more healthy lifestyle, we feel so much better and we have both lost 15 pounds each! Not only are we living a healthier life because we are eating better, but we are decreasing the chance of developing ailments!!!
We felt so much better eating healthy and avoiding all the processed food, junk food, and all unhealthy foods. Our bodies felt lighter, not bloated, and the healthy habits like lemon water and dandelion tea….they make us feel so great! Between the healthy food and healthy habits, we lost so much weight! WE believe there is a reason for everything and why people come into our lives, why Food Babe came into our lives.” ~ Joe and Sue
“I have been using the menu plan for over a week and I love it even my family is eating most of the recipes which makes me sooo happy!!! All three of my boys ages 10, 7 and 3 ate the burgers the other night and I was so happy when they asked for seconds. It was the best night ever for me!! Every morning this week I have made a green juice or smoothie before having breakfast and I feel amazing. I love how some of the recipes make enough that I can eat for a couple of days which is awesome. And I love how simple the recipes are, if you have all the right ingredients…actually preparing the recipes is surprisingly easy!! I’m so excited about this new journey for better health and my family will be following suit!” ~ Kimberly O.
“I’ve started the Eating Guide program and it’s going well. I have tremendous energy. The recipes simplify my eating. My husband is also following the program mainly with lunch and dinner and the occasional green juice or smoothie and breakfast. We both enjoy starting our day with our lemon and cayenne pepper water daily habit. The recipes are very tasty and satisfying. I enjoy the fact that the recipes include ingredients I may not have normally eaten. I am looking forward to continuing the plan beyond the three months I signed up for.” ~ Ina W.
“Like you, I was disappointed by the way we have been deceived by the food industry and their allies in the federal bureaucracies that purport to exist for our safety.  As a pilot at a regional airline based in Charlotte, NC, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be tough. Our meal options are especially limited by the small amount we can carry and keep up with, airport security restrictions, and meal choices in the airport and near our overnight hotels. I know you enjoy traveling and hope that one day you’ll be on one of my flights so I can personally thank you for the work and research you put in to educating consumers about their health. I have enjoyed your articles about how to travel and still eat healthy, and I bring along healthy options each and every trip!
I just became a member this year in order to get the Healthy Eating guides each month.  My family loves the variety of healthy meals that expands our menu each month.
I fly with a different crew almost every week.  I am constantly encouraging my fellow crew members to make positive changes in their diets and lifestyles.  I send them to the Food Babe website for resources because you have well-researched articles and provide the source documentation.

https://foodbabe.com/the-food-industry-needs-to-stop-treating-us-like-a-bunch-of-idiots/,The Food Industry Needs To Stop Treating Us Like A Bunch Of Idiots,"There’s a war going on inside the food industry right now and I’m sitting on the edge of my seat… watching each play… and seeing who makes the right moves.
Some of the changes we are seeing are good and some are bad. The food industry is responding at rapid pace – Papa John’s is getting into organic food, Kraft created organic Lunchables, General Mills removed BHT from most of their cereals, Frito Lay is selling Organic Doritos and Amazon bought Whole Foods!
After decades of using the cheapest and easiest ways to create products to maximize profits, brands now have to face the thousands of Americans (including the Food Babe Army!) who are more aware of the crazy additives they are sticking in our food and are demanding change. There are a growing number of us who are no longer willing to buy pickles with yellow #5… almond milk with carrageenan, chips with MSG… or drinks colored with caramel coloring.
But some players in the food industry are making all the wrong moves and our trust is going to continue to decline – unless they wake up and realize that there is a new generation of smart, savvy, health conscious, and educated people out there to hold them accountable. Basically, they need to stop acting like we are a bunch of idiots.
How Kraft, General Mills, Kellogg’s, Pepsico, Coca-Cola, Campbells, etc. are reacting to the “clean food” revolution and changing marketplace is very telling. They can either choose to side with consumers who overwhelming want to buy real food without unnecessary and risky additives… or they can continue locking arms with the big chemical companies in how they will formulate and label their products.


There’s a “mounting distrust of so-called Big Food, the large food companies and legacy brands on which millions of consumers have relied on for so long” ~ Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell’s
Campbell’s just announced they’re dropping out of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), not for financial reasons, but rather “driven by purpose and principles” as they want to become “the leading health and well-being food company.” The GMA is a top industry trade group with a shady history who lobbies for policies that support junk food brands and has spent millions fighting against GMO labeling. Could it be that Campbell’s wants to rise above the fray and base their brand on ethics and trust? Or, are they trying to pull a quick one on us? It’s too early to tell, but you can bet I’m keeping a close eye on their next move.
I sent a member of my team to the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) Annual Meeting & Food Expo last year, which is essentially where major chemical companies and scientists converge to discuss their latest inventions in the food industry and present them to food companies. Many of the food additives I’ve campaigned against… artificial food dyes, Class IV caramel color, BHT, TBHQ, artificial and natural flavors are all showcased here. They also discuss the growing organic and “clean food” movement (including the Food Babe Army) and what they need to do to continue profiting off of chemical food additives and GMOs.

DOW Chemical’s French Fries? Don’t worry, we didn’t eat them 😉

New food additives being presented by Tate & Lyle at the IFT Expo.

New “Clean-Label” additives seen on the IFT Expo floor.
While many of the biggest food additive manufacturers were showcasing their new “natural”, “non-GMO”, and “clean-label” additives designed to replace synthetic colors, flavors, and preservatives, the word on the street focused on how they want to change customer perception so that Americans would come to accept food chemicals and GMOs in their food. They don’t like the sweeping changes that food brands are making to remove chemical additives from their food, as this is costing them a lot of money and possibly more. If consumers stop buying packaged foods full of additives, their market will disappear.
They’re pleading with their members to curtail our movement by recruiting more “science communicators” to gain the public’s trust in their food technologies. Their mindset is that consumers “fear what they don’t understand” and that if they could only explain their food chemicals in a warm and fuzzy way, we would accept them.
But, they’re way off target. We don’t trust the brands who use these chemical additives for good reason, and there may be no coming back. Last week I asked on social media if you trust the Big Food brands like Kraft, Kellogg’s, General Mills, and Coca-Cola, and the overwhelming consensus was NO. And, I don’t blame you. Here are five reasons why these brands have lost our trust…
Many brands reformulate their products with healthier ingredients in other countries and also don’t use GMOs overseas where labeling is required. I’ve written about this many times before and exposed the shocking double-standard of how many brands serve one set of ingredients here in the U.S. and remove controversial additives in other countries that have stronger regulations. The examples are seemingly endless…
Over the years we’ve watched Kraft, Pepsico, Coca-Cola, General Mills, Nestle, Kellogg’s, and ConAgra give millions to fight GMO labeling laws, even resorting to money laundering to hide their contributions to anti-labeling campaigns. They have spent insane amounts of money to hide the GMOs in their food, despite the fact that poll after poll shows that roughly 90% of consumers want to see GMO labels on packages. As I wrote about in The Food Babe Way, Pepsico spent over $8 million, Coca-cola spent nearly $6 million, Kraft spent nearly $4 million, and ConAgra, General Mills, and Nestle each spent over $2.5 million to fight GMO labeling initiatives. Why spend this much money to fight something that consumers overwhelmingly want? It really has felt like a stab in the back.
The new nationwide “labeling” law that passed in 2016 is giving these companies a way out. They can simply use a QR Code instead of the words “Produced With Genetic Engineering” on the package (and they won’t even need to do that for several years). Since this law passed, some brands who had begun labeling their products – like Kellogg’s – are now removing them. It’s so outrageous, and just goes to show they never did this with their customer’s best interests in mind in the first place!

The same goes for restaurants who refuse to disclose their ingredients like In-N-Out Burger. Everyone deserves to know what is in the food they are buying, and there is NO REASON for restaurants to withhold ingredient lists and claim that it is “Proprietary” just because there are no regulations requiring them to disclose. We all know that is a load of you know what…
Back in 2014, Pepsico announced they would remove Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO) from Mountain Dew following a successful petition by activist Sarah Kavanagh. However, they still have not removed it THREE years later. And before you believe they’re still working on the formula – they already sell BVO-free Mountain Dew in the U.K. What’s the holdup?

Likewise, over TWO years ago Kellogg’s told the media they were looking for an alternative to BHT in their cereals, but they sell cereals overseas without BHT already! Why not just sell us the exact same cereal? This is not rocket science.
The same goes for companies like In-N-Out and Bojangles that have publicly vowed to remove antibiotics from their animal feed – but haven’t given a time to the public and have continued their horrendous factory farming practices.
The Co-CEO of Whole Foods once asked me what I thought the new trends in food packaging would be considering the food revolution we are in. I told him we’d start seeing ingredient labels on the front of packaging because consumers care about ingredients. Well, one company – RX Bars – started doing that and when I saw their protein bars in stores I thought my prediction had come true. However, when I examined the bars closer and read the ingredient list on the back of the package, I saw natural flavors listed. The front of the package is not the whole truth and it’s misleading consumers.

This is what angers me about new food companies trying to give us more real food. If you want to gain consumers trust – tell the truth. As you can see from my recent interview with Mark Schatzker of The Dorito Effect, “natural blueberry flavor” is a way for the food industry to use fewer real blueberries and trick consumers into thinking they are getting more nutrition and flavor that isn’t there. The pop of taste from added flavors is made in a laboratory and makes food that we wouldn’t otherwise eat taste like something good.  Is that why RX Bar chooses not to put the ingredient on the front of their package like the rest of their ingredients?
When Kraft removed the artificial dyes from their Mac n’ Cheese they came out with a marketing campaign which made it sound as if they came up with the decision all on their own – instead of just saying THE TRUTH: You asked for it and we delivered. They make no mention of the countless concerned parents who have been asking them to remove these unnecessary dyes for years. They make no mention of the adverse health effects that have been attributed to these dyes and as to why they don’t use them overseas. They make no mention of the over 365,000 of you who signed a petition asking them to make this change. They make no mention of the meeting they had with me in 2013 when they told me that we’d just have to “agree to disagree” and that Kraft was going to keep Mac & Cheese just the way it was. We all know the truth, but they are not owning up to it, which is quite simply ridiculous. I received the following email from a reader, which expresses my sentiments!
“Have you seen the new Kraft Mac and cheese commercial? I’m just wondering if you are as offended as I am. They make it seem like all the crap they were adding before the change would somehow affect the quality or taste and that people didn’t even notice the change. I haven’t eaten Kraft Mac and cheese in years but am thankful for your work on getting them to change the way they make it. It’s just sad they think it’s appropriate to make a commercial that makes the consumer feel as if they’re “missing out” instead of apologizing for all the poison they had put in their food previously.” – Jaime
My visit to Kraft HQ delivering petition signatures in 2013.
Some of brands try to pull the wool over our eyes by announcing they’re cleaning up their food, while they are really just swapping one poison for another. McDonald’s was quoted all over the media saying how they removed the artificial flavors in their ice cream as if this was a major step towards improving their food, but all they did was replace it with natural flavors. Anyone who’s been reading this blog for awhile knows that natural and artificial flavors are essentially the same thing (and their ice cream still contains lots of nasty ingredients like carrageenan, mono and diglycerides, and cellulose gum!)
Food brands have bankrolled scientists and created front groups to attack organic food and defend the continued use of food produced with synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, GMOs, and chemical food additives. Groups like the “American Council on Science & Health” and the “Center For Consumer Freedom” sure sound like independent and scientific organizations, but they are funded heavily by food companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s.
These groups and scientists they work with are often quoted in the media without any mention of their ties to the industry and are given a free pass because they present themselves as independent experts.
“Joseph Perrone, chief science officer at the Center for Accountability in Science — part of a larger tax-exempt group run by the Berman and Co. public relations firm — said industry needed to mount a coordinated effort to paint the risks of common chemicals as acceptable to the public and boost trust in federal regulatory agencies that evaluate them… Perrone’s message is that customers don’t trust chemical companies, and they need “a good PR plan, which is external to the company, which is a third party. Because, quite frankly, whether we like it or not, they don’t believe you.” ~ E&E News

Presentation by the front group The Center For Food Integrity at IFT Expo.
Trust is really important and after it’s been broken, it can be hard to come back from. We have wised up to the dirty tactics they use. If food brands want us to buy their products they really should listen to us – their prospective customers – and stop hiding behind antiquated regulations and paid-off “experts” to justify selling us chemicals instead of food. I truly believe the only way they can gain our trust is by siding with consumers who overwhelmingly want them to sell real food that is healthy and sustainably grown.
We are fed up with the chemical additives they use.
We are fed up with the double standards.
We are fed up with their misleading marketing and deceptive front groups.
We are fed up with their lack of transparency.
We are fed up with their support for factory farms.
We are fed up with the great lengths they go to hide GMOs in their products.
We are fed up with how they continue to hide behind our government’s lax standards and claim the additives they use are “safe”… We’ve heard it a million times and know the truth!
I want you to be the smartest consumers out there. I want you to change your life, and the lives of your families. Be in charge of your destiny. The first step is to stop being hijacked by all the processed foods out there that look better – but really aren’t.

https://foodbabe.com/never-pack-childs-lunch-back-school-recipe/,Never Pack This In Your Child’s Lunch + Back-To-School Recipe,"The quality of food served by school lunchrooms across the country is appalling. Although my little one isn’t in school (yet), I am saddened that many school districts feed children hot dogs, greasy pizza, and nachos for lunch. How this has even become acceptable is the subject of a future investigation… but in the meantime, do whatever you can to take control of the situation by packing your own lunches.
People who eat homemade food avoid thousands of unnecessary food additives they’d otherwise be exposed to. If your kids are away from home during lunchtime Monday through Friday – that adds up to about 22 lunches a month… or 22 opportunities to choose something healthy and homemade. Think of all the GMOs, preservatives, and other chemicals your children can avoid by packing a lunch.
But… don’t go down the path of buying all those conveniently packaged “Back To School” snacks and drinks that line the shelves at the grocery store. Not only do they get expensive, but they’re just as unhealthy (maybe worse) than what they serve in school lunchrooms, filled with GMOs and additives to avoid like BHT, TBHQ, artificial colors, flavors, and tons of added sugar…



It’s especially ridiculous they keep selling products with yellow 5 and red 40 which are linked to hyperactivity in children (requiring a warning label in Europe). How are children expected to pay attention to learn in school after eating food like this?
Even organic packaged foods can be extremely processed and unhealthy without any real nutrition. Take the new Organic Lunchables for example. These might be certified organic, but I’d NEVER buy them…
When children grow up eating processed foods regularly, they grow up less likely to crave fresh foods like fruits and veggies. I want to teach my daughter to love all that real food has to offer, the tastes, the textures, and the amazing nutrition that it provides her body – and not trick her tastebuds with processed foods full of added sugar and fake flavors.
The main course in this lunchbox recipe are some fun Hummus Roll-ups that you can put together the evening before so it’s all ready to go in the morning. I like to make my own hummus because most store-bought versions are made with GMOs and inflammatory oils (like canola and soybean) instead of olive oil. This is my go-to hummus recipe. If you buy store-bought hummus, just look for one that is organic and made with olive oil.
To assemble your Hummus Roll-ups, start out with either an organic sprouted grain or coconut wrap (I like to use wraps by Food For Life, found in the freezer section at most natural food stores). Spread on a couple spoonfuls of hummus and top it with a couple slices of cheese and crunchy romaine lettuce. Thinly slice a cucumber lengthwise and layer it on top…

Then just roll it up tightly and cut into pinwheel slices that are easy for little hands to hold and eat…


All you do is thinly slice a couple fresh parsnips and spread them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment…

Drizzle them with a touch of coconut or olive oil, sprinkle on some salt and pepper, and bake at 375° for about 10 minutes. Take them out when the edges start to get brown and crispy.

https://foodbabe.com/bottle-water-not-think/,Bottled Water Is Not What You Think,"Last week on Facebook I asked whether you drink soda, and if not, what you drink instead. I was overwhelmed with all the awesome responses!… and am sooooo happy to see how many of you have broken up with soda forever and are mostly drinking water, homemade tea, and kombucha instead. Yeah!!!
Bottled water sales have FINALLY surpassed soda sales in the U.S. as more people ditch drinks like Diet Coke and Pepsi. While I’m happy to see people make better choices – bottled water is crazy expensive. Depending on how many bottles you buy for yourself and your family every week, the cost adds up quickly. The average person who buys bottled water is spending over $400 a year for a family of four – and that’s being conservative. Drinking filtered tap water is so much cheaper… bottled water costs almost 2000x more!


While you might think that your bottled water is from a pristine mountain spring full of minerals, that’s almost never the case… Popular brands like Aquafina (by PepsiCo) and Dasani (by Coca-Cola) are just straight up purified tap water. They take their water from city water systems, run it through more filtering, bottle it, and sell it at a huge markup. Look for the terms “public water”, “municipal source”, or “community water” on bottles, which indicates it’s filtered tap water – but brands aren’t required to disclose this. Those that say “artesian” or “spring” water are typically not from the tap, but are typically MORE expensive and still packaged in plastic that is horrible for our environment. Plastic water bottles create an estimated 1.5 million tons of trash per year!
As I’m sure you’re aware, most tap water that isn’t properly filtered is tainted with contaminants like…
You don’t want to be drinking any of those substances… or using tainted water to make coffee and tea at home. That’s why a good home water filter is so important, and will save you literally hundreds of dollars in bottled water costs every single year.
I’ve partnered up with the brand Aquasana because I know how crucial clean water is to my health. I’ve been so impressed with the many inexpensive filter options they offer – their water always tastes great, the NSF certified filters last a long time, and are easy to replace.
All Aquasana drinking water filters are certified to remove and reduce…
If you’re on a tight budget you can start out with their Countertop Water Filter. This is perfect if you are living in a rental too!
A step up are their under the counter models, which install easily under your sink…
If you’d like to make sure to filter out fluoride, they have a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system that is certified to filter all the above contaminants + fluoride.
For the most complete solution, you can get a Whole House Filter. This gives you the peace of mind that the water from every tap in your home is filtered for up to 10 years. I personally love knowing that I can get clean water from every tap in the house, including the bathroom for brushing my teeth and showering.
(Simply click on each filter option to learn about its features and compare here)
Best of all, most of their filters are 50% off right now (expires soon) and they have a 90 day return policy if for any reason you don’t like the filter…which is perfect, so you have enough time to see how much money you are saving when you quit buying bottles. Your purchase also supports the work we do here at Food Babe, so thank you! I only partner with the best companies I personally have used and trust.

https://foodbabe.com/monsanto-caught-ghost-writing-pieces-published-forbes/,Monsanto Caught Ghost-Writing Pieces Published In Forbes,"There are a couple breaking stories that I want to make sure you know about…
Newly released emails show how Monsanto infiltrated a scientific journal and persuaded them to retract a published study which revealed tumors on rats who were fed GMOs and Roundup. This has been coined the “Seralini Study”, which Monsanto has attacked since its initial publication in 2012. Over the years, many people have been misled to believe this study was a farce. This is one of the reasons why the dangers of GMOs coupled with Roundup continues to be questioned by the press and public. Monsanto will do anything to cover up the health risks of using their chemicals.
The website Forbes just ended their relationship with writer Henry Miller after discovering that Monsanto ghost-wrote his article that was trying to downplay the cancer risk of Roundup. Forbes took the article down from their website yesterday but you’ve got to wonder how many people it misled since that article was up for over two years. Nowhere in the article did Miller disclose his relationship with Monsanto, nor the fact that they wrote for him! Monsanto admitted to the New York Times, “Our scientists have on occasion collaborated with Dr. Miller on other pieces” – so this wasn’t an isolated incident. Miller has been writing pro-GMO articles for Forbes for over 10 years. Who else at Forbes is hiding conflicts of interest like this? I have my own hunches on that.
This is a good reminder to be our own health advocates and pay close attention to who is writing what we read. Look into who they are, who funds their work, and what types of claims they’ve made in the past. This is something I do when reading health-related articles – and in today’s age of political and industry propaganda and manipulations, it is imperative that we all take this step.
After I outed the website Snopes.com for trying to squash the lab results showing Roundup in products like Cheerios, Stacy’s Pita Chips and Ritz Crackers, a member of the Food Babe Army forwarded me a copy of an email response they received from Snopes (I’ve highlighted the interesting parts in red):


See my tweets to Snopes here and here… feel free to retweet them! It’s awful that a “fact checking” website like Snopes would make such defamatory statements about me and what we do here at Food Babe.
As you can see, there are some serious detractors that do not want the truth about our food to be heard and these are just a few examples. It’s thrilling for me to see these relationships exposed, and I’m working on a HUGE project on this topic that I can’t wait to reveal to y’all in coming months.

https://foodbabe.com/healing-iced-turmeric-latte/,Healing Iced Turmeric Latte,"Turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory root and I’ve been trying to eat some every single day for the last few months to help me recover naturally from a wrist injury. This Iced Turmeric Latte recipe makes it so easy and delicious to add to your diet! Turmeric has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat a number of conditions and scientists believe that one of the reasons why turmeric is so powerful is that it contains curcumin. Its beneficial properties have been the subject of thousands of peer-reviewed and published studies.
The biggest benefit that I’ve personally witnessed is turmeric’s ability to fight inflammation. If you are suffering from any injuries (as I was several years ago in my tailbone and now with my wrist), turmeric can help reduce inflammation. I was amazed at how well it worked for me back then, and to this day – whenever I have an injury – I turn to turmeric.
This recipe is similar to Golden Milk, served over ice with a touch of honey, coconut water, and cinnamon. The coconut oil in this drink is essential, as this is what helps your body absorb all the goodness from the turmeric (which is fat-soluble) – so don’t skip this ingredient! I incorporate coconut oil in my diet often as it has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body and can assist in weight loss.



Pour a couple cups of coconut or almond milk into a small pot and stir in one tablespoon of raw honey and two teaspoons of coconut oil. Turn the heat on low and warm the milk for a few minutes, stirring it every so often until the honey and oil is well incorporated and it’s warm to touch…

Pour half a cup of coconut water into a blender and add three tablespoons of grated fresh turmeric (only use 1½ teaspoons if using ground turmeric) and a pinch of cinnamon. Give it a really good blend for a couple minutes…

To serve, fill a couple tall glasses halfway up with ice. Spoon a few tablespoons of the blended turmeric mix into the glass and pour the warm milk over the ice until the glass is full. Kick back your heals and enjoy it with a friend!

When you pick up your first bottle of Truvani Turmeric, I’ll send you two complimentary eBooks:

Our mission at Truvani is to choose the absolute best ingredients, as nutrient-dense as possible, without processed chemical ingredients invented by the food industry to increase their bottom line.

I ate a TON of Bomb Pops when I was a kid… no wonder I had so many stomach aches back then! (FYI – Cellulose Gum has been linked to a variety of health issues – including intestinal inflammation).

Even those “Whole Fruit” and “Made With Real Fruit” bars are filled with added refined sugar, natural flavors, and emulsifiers like carrageenan… and despite all the pictures of fruit on the box, these are not real food.

https://foodbabe.com/coconut-oil-healthy-controversy-explained/,Is Coconut Oil Healthy? The Controversy Explained,"You probably read the recent headlines…
And wondering to yourself “What the heck is going on?”… “I thought coconut oil was healthy”…”Crap, coconut oil is another fake health fad?”
Well you are not alone, it seems the entire Internet freaked out at this “news” and for good reason.

As you can probably imagine, my email and phone has been blowing up about all this – even my Mom sent me a text wondering if it was true. I know it’s frustrating when there is so much conflicting health information being fired at us from all directions. How can we know what to believe? How can we know we’re getting accurate advice? Who should we listen to? How can we expect to get healthy?

It’s no secret that coconut oil is a regular part of my diet and I consider it one of the best oils to consume period. (I even partnered with the top organic coconut oil on the market as a result). Not everyone agrees with me, and that’s fine. But I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you to all be very careful about health advice reported in the media – because some well-meaning reporters fall for basic industry tricks like this one that has just happened.
Even if advice seems to come from a perfectly respectable organization on the surface (like the American Heart Association) – research who they are, who funds their work, and what types of health claims they’ve made in the past. This is something I do when reading health-related articles – and in today’s age of political and industry propaganda and manipulations, it is imperative that you take this step to be your own health advocate.
The American Heart Association released a new Presidential Advisory recommending that everyone AVOID coconut oil, stating that it is high in saturated fat and raises “bad” cholesterol levels – which they believe leads to heart disease. In their press release, the lead author of the report recommends that we all stop using coconut oil and cook with “canola, or corn oil or soybean oil, or extra virgin olive oil.”  And, he thinks it’s perfectly healthy to deep fry your food… ummm, what?!…
“There’s nothing wrong with deep frying as long as you deep fry in a nice unsaturated vegetable oil” ~ Frank M. Sacks, lead author of American Heart Association’s Presidential Advisory.
The American Heart Association (AHA) is the same organization who told us for years to eat margarine (which was notoriously high in trans fat) calling it “more heart-healthy” than butter because it contains “no dietary cholesterol”. They started this recommendation back in the 1960’s and continued it for decades while the primary ingredient in margarine was partially hydrogenated oil full of trans fat. Well, we now know that the trans fat in partially hydrogenated oils are responsible for upwards of 20,000 heart attacks every year – which spurred the FDA to finally ban it from our food (effective in 2018). It’s rare for the FDA to ban anything! Boy, I’d say the AHA was way off on that recommendation, wouldn’t you?
“Of the half million Americans who die prematurely each year from heart disease—the leading cause of death in this country—at least 30,000 are killed by trans fats.” ~ Harvard epidemiologist Walter Willett
Cans of Bruce’s Yams In Syrup with 18 grams of added sugar per serving, Prego “Heart Smart” Sauces made with added sugar and canola oil, Starkist Ranch Tuna Creations with added sugar and MSG, and Pepperidge Farm Whole Grain Honey Wheat Bread with added sugar, soybean oil, and two additives that contain trans fats (DATEM and monoglycerides) all get their official seal of approval. In the past, they’ve certified Fat-Free Chocolate Milk, Cocoa Puffs, Lucky Charms, and Trix cereal… yikes.



Processed deli meats full of sugar, salt and preservatives (like heavily processed Boar’s Head!) get a big thumbs up from them as well. All of these products and dozens more insanely processed foods with the “American Heart Association Heart Check” Seal of Approval have each paid thousands of dollars in fees (up to $7,500 + annual renewal fees per product) to use the certified seal.

“Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) have found that eating processed meat, such as bacon, sausage or processed deli meats, was associated with a 42% higher risk of heart disease” – Harvard School of Public Health, May 2010
“Over the course of the 15-year study on added sugar and heart disease, participants who took in 25% or more of their daily calories as sugar were more than twice as likely to die from heart disease as those whose diets included less than 10% added sugar.” – Harvard Medical School, Feb. 2014
They’ve even partnered up with “Healthy Dining Finder” which directs you to eat at Denny’s, Sizzler, and Red Robin… do they really believe these restaurants serve healthy food?
Think of all the people who relied on the AHA’s endorsements and ate foods full of sugar, nitrates, and trans fat for years – and ended up sick as a result. How many people are still being misled? It. Is. Sickening.
This is not where the AHA’s ties to industry end. Over the years, their sponsors have included a who’s who list of the worst Big Food brands out there, who fill their foods up with soybean oil, canola oil, processed meats, and sugar:
The AHA is also raking in upwards of $15 million dollars per year from drug and healthcare companies – including over $3 million from Pfizer (the maker of the statin drug Lipitor that reduces cholesterol). Could this be why the AHA recommends that millions more Americans be prescribed statins, even healthy older people with no history of heart disease? The members of their research committee are raking in industry dollars too… receiving tens of thousands from drug companies to fund research, make trial appearances, and serve as consultants – which is a blatant conflict of interest.
One author, Penny M. Kris-Etherton, discloses significant funding from Ag Canada, Canola Oil Council, and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. Could this be why she recommends “lean beef” as “heart healthy” and canola oil as a way to cut belly fat? In the past, she also served on the advisory board at Unilever (maker of I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, Country Crock, Brummel & Brown, and Imperial Margarine).
Another author, Jennifer G. Robinson, disclosed research funding from numerous drug companies, many of whom make cholesterol pills… Amarin, Amgen, AstraZeneca (maker of the statin Crestor), Eli Lilly, Glaxo-Smith Kline, Merck, Pfizer, Regeneron/Sanofi, and Takeda.
Various conflict of interest disclosures reveal that Frank M. Sacks (lead author) has been paid by the industry to testify in court cases involving POM Wonderful, Hershey, Unilever, and Keebler. He also testified for or has received consulting fees from several drug companies including Abbott, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Merck, Roche, Sanofi and has received lecture fees from AstraZeneca. These previous associations were not disclosed as conflicts in the AHA’s report, but I consider this significant, don’t you?

It’s important to recognize squarely where the AHA’s loyalty lies. They are protecting industries from which they receive millions of dollars. When their primary sources of revenue come from Big Food and Pharmaceutical companies, you’ve got to question the veracity of their opinions on what constitutes healthy food.
The AHA’s recent statement on the saturated fat in coconut oil is NOTHING NEW coming from them. They have long held the position that processed vegetable oils (like canola, corn, soybean oils) are healthy and discredit any information to the contrary, while demonizing all saturated fats as detrimental to our health.
This belief has persisted thanks to intense influence and lobbying by the Institute for Shortening and Edible Oils (ISEO), an industry trade group that protects the interests of vegetable oil manufacturers like Cargill, Bunge, and ConAgra.
“As far back as 1968, the ISEO was mentioned in an internal memo written by the medical director of the American Heart Association: According to the memo, the ISEO objected to the AHA’s intention to include a warning about trans fats in its dietary guidelines; subsequently, the AHA took it out.” ~ Mother Jones, August 2012
Furthering this belief, in the 1960’s the sugar industry funded research that would hide the link between sugar consumption and heart disease, while promoting the idea that fat is the real culprit. The public didn’t find out the truth until internal sugar industry documents were released in 2016.
There is well documented evidence that saturated fats do not increase your risk of heart disease. A recent meta-analysis in the British Journal of Medicine came to this conclusion. Another meta-analysis of 21 studies published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has also come to this conclusion. Another meta-analysis published in 2017 found that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats (like corn oil) is not likely to reduce risk of heart disease. I could go on and on and on and on.
A 2015 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that saturated fats may increase risk of heart disease, but NOT if they come from fish, dairy, or plants – such as coconuts! If you look at the countries that consume the most coconut oil, they’ve also got the some of the lowest rates of heart disease… what does that tell you?
“For many years we have been told that to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), we must lower our intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and instead eat more carbohydrates and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Backed up by the National Cholesterol Education Program, the National Institutes of Health, and the American Heart Association, the medical profession has promoted this idea eagerly, although the number of contradictory scientific reports is almost endless. There is in fact much evidence that doing the opposite is more relevant… There is no evidence that a lower intake of SFA can prevent CVD and a high intake of PUFAs without specification may result in a high intake of omega-6, which is associated with many adverse health effects. Because there is much evidence that saturated fat may even be beneficial, we urge the American Heart Association…to consider the aforementioned evidence when updating their future guidelines”. ~ The Questionable Benefits of Exchanging Saturated Fat With Polyunsaturated Fat, Mayo Clinic Proceedings, April 2014
If the AHA truly believes saturated fat is so bad, why do they have “heart healthy” recipes for beef and pork on their website, given these are the biggest sources of saturated fat in the American diet? Could it be because the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, the National Pork Board, Tyson, Hormel, and Smithfield have all paid money to have their meats and recipes “heart check” certified? This sure raises my eyebrows.
We now know that cholesterol does some amazing things for your body and isn’t all bad as once believed – but it’s highly complex. Even if coconut oil raises cholesterol levels, this doesn’t tell you the whole story. According to Dr. Mark Hyman, what you want to watch out for is the type of cholesterol that is getting raised and particle size, along with high triglycerides:
“As a doctor, I tell patients that abnormal cholesterol can become a problem when it is the small dense LDL particles, accompanied by high triglycerides. In fact small LDL particles actually triple your risk of heart disease. This is caused by high-carb, low-fat diets and is improved when you add fat back to the diet, including saturated fat.” ~ Is Coconut Oil Bad for Your Cholesterol? Mark Hyman, M.D.
It’s also been shown that saturated fat in coconut oil increases “good” HDL cholesterol and increases the size of LDL particles (making them less likely to promote heart disease). On the other hand, low cholesterol can be harmful, linked to increased risk of cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and morbid depression.
These oils go through an insane amount of processing with chemical solvents, steamers, neutralizers, de-waxers, bleach and deodorizers before they end up in the bottle. Corn and soybean oil are very high in omega-6 fatty acids which are known to promote inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is a real killer, increasing the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. These oils are also strongly linked to cancer and are typically derived from GMO crops contaminated with Roundup herbicide.
It could be that the AHA is just stuck in the 50’s and can’t come to grips with all the new research out there. But I have another theory which seems more plausible – the AHA is protecting the profits of the drug industry (their sponsors) who rely on us being unhealthy enough to need a prescription and the food industry who prefers to use cheap oils in their food and doesn’t want to spend more money for healthy ingredients. It’s all about the bottom line.

Now that the general public is learning the truth about saturated fats and sugar, the industry is freaking out. They needed to find a new angle. They need to win their way back into the public’s hearts… and what better way to do it than to scare us… “Hey, you know that coconut oil in your cabinet that you thought was healthy? Well, it’s going to give you a heart attack”.
For someone to die from a heart attack was virtually unheard of 100 years ago, it was extremely rare! In just a few short decades it became the leading cause of death in the ‘50’s and now heart disease remains as the #1 killer of Americans. The drugs pumped out by pharmaceutical companies and all those new “trans fat free” foods are doing nothing to stop this. What changed so dramatically during the last hundred years?
One of the most significant changes to our diets was the switch from natural fats to processed and refined vegetable oils. Americans moved away from eating real butter and fresh foods, while increasing consumption of sugary processed foods made with vegetable oils. Data shows that in the last several decades Americans cut the fat from their diets by 25% while increasing intake of carbohydrates by more than 30%. The majority of these carbohydrates aren’t healthy fruits and vegetables either – but mostly refined breads, crackers, cereals, pastas, and other low-fat processed foods packed with added sugar.
Where has cutting out the fat and gorging on refined grains and sugar gotten us? If you ask me, the health of our nation has tanked. It makes me incredibly sad, because I know most people are trying to eat right and do what their doctors and experts from organizations like the AHA tell them to do. No one wants to be overweight and sick, yet that is the reality for most Americans.
I personally love coconut oil and all of the health benefits it provides.
The tropical saturated fat in coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which have been shown to increase your metabolism and to REDUCE body fat (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4), while retaining muscle mass. It works to bring down chronic inflammation in the body and is an amazing source of energy. As a bonus, it’s also associated with increased antioxidant levels in the body that can slow aging!
I use a variety of cooking oils in my kitchen. Read my investigation with a list of which oils I personally like to use here. If you know anyone who is wondering if coconut oil is dangerous (or is trusting the American Heart Association for health information), please share this post with them and keep spreading the truth!
Even two members of my Advisory Council, who are both physicians that I greatly respect, are on opposite sides of this issue and do not agree. Dr. Joel Kahn agrees with the American Heart Association’s conclusions (because he is generally against all oils) and Dr. Mark Hyman does not…
“My advice is to not get lost in the jungle of discussion over coconut and its oil. Without a doubt the AHA Advisors were responsible in highlighting the lack of data for a health benefit to adding coconut oil to the diet and the likely risks”. ~ Joel Kahn, M.D.
“First, there is not a single study showing that coconut oil causes heart disease. Not one. Second, the whole case against coconut oil is founded on a hypothesis that has been proven wrong”. ~ Mark Hyman, M.D.
I greatly appreciate this difference of opinion, and of course, I have my own.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/curried-cauliflower-salad/,Curried Cauliflower Salad,"Back when I was a kid, I really didn’t like cauliflower. It had zero flavor to me! Looking back, I think I just didn’t give myself enough courage to try different dishes and now I really love it. I make all kinds of things with cauliflower… soups, “rice”, roasted veggies, and I even sometimes blend it into breakfast smoothies! This new salad recipe is quickly becoming a favorite around here because it’s packed with flavor and only takes a few minutes of prep work in the kitchen to throw it all together.

While many white foods (like bleached flour, sugar, and refined pasta) are heavily processed and leached of nutrients, don’t let the fact that cauliflower is white fool you into thinking it’s not good for you… Here’s why you should add it to your diet ASAP if you haven’t already:

Another great way to use cauliflower is to pulse it in a food processor to make a healthier substitute for rice – so it’s easy to add to your everyday diet. I use cauliflower “rice” to make a light and filling Lemon Asparagus Quinoa Risotto (recipe here) and a delicious taco salad (recipe here). I also love to make these AMAZING Buffalo Cauliflower Bites (recipe here) that taste like buffalo wings without the chicken!

https://foodbabe.com/body-slimming-italian-turkey-kale-soup/,Body-Slimming Italian Turkey Kale Soup,"One of my favorite meals is soup! It’s economical, easy to pack with lots of veggies and protein, and the leftovers keep well in the fridge. This Italian Turkey Kale Soup recipe has been in heavy rotation at my house this year ever since having the baby. Not only is it super easy to make but it really helped me to shed the extra baby weight (more on this topic in a post to come!). You probably already have most of these ingredients in your kitchen right now too, which makes it even easier to put together on a busy weeknight. Here’s how I make it…


Get out a cutting board and dice up your veggies. I use three celery stalks, a couple carrots, and one yellow onion – but you could use other vegetables here (like zucchini, cauliflower, etc) instead if you’ve already got them on hand. You’ll also want to mince up a couple garlic cloves and set aside for later.
Swirl about a tablespoon of olive oil into a large soup pot and warm it under medium heat. Stir in the ground turkey and cook for a few minutes until it is slightly browned. Remember to only choose organic turkey to avoid meat that was raised with growth-promoting drugs like antibiotics and ractopamine.

Add your diced celery, carrots, and onion to the pot and give it a good stir. Sprinkle everything with a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, a tablespoon of italian seasoning, a few dashes of black pepper, and a couple teaspoons of salt (you can add less salt now if you prefer and then add it right before serving to taste)…
Continue cooking for about five minutes until the veggies are tender. Stir in the minced garlic and cook a couple more minutes just until fragrant… Your kitchen should smell really good about now!

Pour in a couple cups of homemade chicken broth along with two cups of filtered water. I pretty much always make my own chicken broth because most store-bought versions contain flavors, hidden MSG flavor enhancers (such as yeast extract) and added sugar – even some organic versions! You can see how I make my simple broth here.
Turn up the heat and put a bay leaf in the soup. As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat down to low and simmer the soup for 20 minutes…
While it’s simmering, roughly chop up a couple big handfuls of kale – about two cups worth. Five minutes before serving, take out the bay leaf and add the kale to the pot. Allow the kale to slowly wilt for a few minutes…


Enjoy this beautiful soup now or store in a glass container in the fridge for several days. It’s so filling and comforting…

https://foodbabe.com/zero-calorie/,These Zero Calorie Drinks Promote Weight Gain Not Loss,"I’m so happy to see that sales of Diet Coke and Pepsi keep plummeting… more people are wising up to the fact that these drinks are ridiculously horrible for the body and looking for healthier options. In their place, new zero-calorie drinks and flavored waters are flooding the market, and are now taking up some serious shelf space in major grocery stores. Some of these fruity waters and fizzy “sugar free” drinks are being promoted as health drinks – but are they really?
Unfortunately, many of them are filled with controversial additives that can be sabotaging your weight and your health – even if they have no calories, look like bottled water, or have really short ingredient lists! Let’s take a closer look at what’s in some of the most popular brands like Sparkling Ice and Cascade Ice. They sell these by the case at Costco, but are they truly any better than soda?

These drinks have “zero calories” because they are sweetened with Sucralose (an additive linked to cancer). The artificial colors in these drinks (Yellow 5, Red 40, and Blue 1) are derived from petroleum and linked to several health issues, including allergies, cancer, and hyperactivity in children. Europe requires any food containing dyes to carry the warning label, “May Have an Adverse Effect on Activity and Attention in Children”, but that’s not required here in the States. If that’s not bad enough, they’re also preserved with Potassium Benzoate, which can form the carcinogen Benzene when combined with vitamin C (which is present in some flavors). This is a toxic combo in a plastic bottle!

Perhaps they purposefully make the ingredients so hard to read on a bottle of Propel because they are so horrible!
Propel Flavored Water Black Cherry: Water, Citric Acid, Sodium Hexametaphosphate, Natural Flavor, Salt, Potassium Sorbate, Potassium Citrate, Sodium Citrate, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium, Calcium Disodium EDTA, Calcium Pantothenate (Vitamin B5), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Vitamin E Acetate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6).
Propel, Nestle Splash, Dasani Flavored Water, Diet Snapple, and PowerAde Zero contain artificial sweeteners like sucralose, acesulfame potassium or aspartame. Although these have no calories, artificial sweeteners have been shown to contribute to weight gain by encouraging sugar cravings. Research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. Researchers from the University of Texas discovered that drinks made with artificial sweeteners will expand your waist girth, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. When you drink something sweet – even when it has no calories – your brain is tricked into wanting more calories because your body is not getting enough energy (i.e. calories) to be satisfied. So you keep craving sweets, eating sweets, and gaining weight. This is why a lot of people never reach their full health potential or weight loss goals, because they are constantly being pushed around by these chemical artificial sweeteners that trick the brain and body.
Sodium Polyphosphate and Sodium Hexametaphosphate: These preservatives are full of phosphorous, which can create a mineral imbalance in the body. When you eat (or drink) phosphate additives like these often (which is really easy to do in our processed food world) it can put you at risk for kidney damage, increased mortality, heart disease, and accelerated aging.
Calcium Disodium EDTA: This preservative is made from of formaldehyde, sodium cyanide, and ethylene diamine… yikes! Is this something you really want to drink every day? It has the ability to build up in the body, becoming more toxic if you drink it for several days in a row, which could possibly lead to health problems. It’s also known to lower your body’s ability to absorb vitamins (making all those B vitamins added to Propel pretty worthless).
Potassium Sorbate: This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer. It has also been shown to induce DNA damage when combined with vitamin C (this combo is in Propel).
Citric Acid: Although this is naturally found in lemon and other fruits, the additive used in these drinks is typically derived from mold made with GMO corn (not from fruit). Frequent consumption is linked to an increase in tooth decay and also can irritate the gut.

Bai, Core, Hubert’s Diet Lemonade, Blossom Water, and Vitamin Water Zero are sweetened with the sugar alcohol erythritol. This sweetener can wreak havoc on healthy gut bacteria, which can lead to a whole host of diseases and if you’re trying to lose weight or stay slim, keeping your gut healthy is vital!
Erythritol is also known to cause diarrhea, stomach upset, headache when consumed in “normal amounts”, is a powerful insecticide, and can also increase appetite just like artificial sweeteners do so you’ll end up eating more food. Research by Cornell University shows that the body metabolizes erythritol and associates high levels of erythritol in the blood to weight gain, which has spawned more studies.
Although this is a naturally occurring sugar that is sometimes found in fruit, food manufacturers don’t actually use the natural stuff. Instead they usually start with GMO corn (unless organic or non-GMO verified) and then put it through a complex fermentation process to come up with chemically pure erythritol.


These drinks are better than a Diet Coke – but are they really as clean as they seem? I try to avoid natural flavors, especially if it’s in something that I’d consume often and in large amounts – like a drink.
{Picture of natural flavors on display at the IFT Expo}

Although the ingredient label on Hint Flavored Water just states purified water and natural flavors, Hint has been sued because their drinks contain propylene glycol – a synthetic ingredient. Propylene glycol is one of the hidden ingredients that was (and may still be) used in their natural flavors and doesn’t need to be listed on the label. This goes back to my point that whenever you are drinking something with natural flavors, it is not necessarily natural and you don’t know what’s really in the bottle.

{Excerpt from complaint filed in the court case: Lisa Kim Madrigal, et al v. Hint Inc.}

{Excerpt of test results showing propylene glycol in Hint flavored water}

LaCroix states their flavors contain no artificial ingredients, but they also are not under any obligation to disclose exactly what’s in them, so we just have to take their word for it.
“There is no legal requirement to disclose what’s in the natural flavor. So customers have no choice but to believe companies when they say they don’t use artificial additives in their flavors.” ~ The Mysterious Allure of LaCroix’s ‘Natural Flavor’ – WIRED, December 15, 2016
I don’t consider it safe to drink out of cans often because of the BPA that is usually present in them. This is what LaCroix says about the presence of BPA in their cans, which I don’t find reassuring, especially since I know how inefficient the FDA is at setting “guidelines” for the chemicals in our food…
“All LaCroix products meet the guidelines set by the FDA and are completely safe to drink. Recently, media reports have raised questions about the use of bisphenol A (BPA) by can and bottle manufacturers. While can linings may contain trace amounts of BPA to prevent spoilage and protect food and beverages from direct contact with the can, these trace amounts are virtually eliminated during the curing process.” ~ Source: http://www.lacroixwater.com/nutritional-faqs/
I feel like if something tastes like lemon, then it should actually contain lemon! And it honestly just takes two seconds to  squeeze some fresh lemon juice (or grapefruit or whatever fruit you’d like) into sparkling water and know exactly what you’re drinking. That’s not to mention all the nutrients that you are getting from the lemon juice as well…because natural flavors may have zero calories, but they also have zero nutrition and provide zero health benefits.
My main go-to drink is plain filtered water. I filter my own water at home and always carry a stainless steel or glass container of filtered water around with me – to the gym, in the car, to meetings, and even to some restaurants! Drinking toxin-free water makes a major difference in the way I feel and I consider it a vital part of my everyday life. But, it can be boring to just drink water all the time! These are some other healthy drinks I personally enjoy:

https://foodbabe.com/really-healthy-ice-cream-brand/,Is There Really A Healthy Ice Cream Brand?,"I love ice cream! When I want a treat, ice cream is one of my favorites! But take a walk through the typical ice cream aisle and you’ll find a minefield of risky (and sometimes dangerous) additives mixed with factory farmed milk. I’m a firm believer that everyone should still enjoy treats from time to time, but don’t consider it a treat to poison myself with heart-wrecking trans fats, carcinogenic poisons like glyphosate, and additives linked to gut inflammation. I’ve learned that you can enjoy treats (even ice cream!) that won’t destroy your health and pack on the pounds, but you just need to know what to look for.
There are now some brands that seem healthier like Halo Top and Arctic Zero, and many people have been asking me if they are TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. I’ll get to them in a moment, but first let’s check out what you’ll find in the major ice cream brands.
Gut wrecking emulsifiers: Most ice creams are full of emulsifiers that have been shown to disrupt the good bacteria in your gut and can lead to disease and obesity. Companies use these because it’s cheaper than filling their product with 100% whole food ingredients. Of course the main ingredients in ice cream (cream and sugar) are also linked to obesity, but when you eat the real thing you feel more satisfied and are less likely to down an entire pint.




Artificial Colors: Whenever you see a color like Red 40, Red 3, Yellow 5, or Blue 1, these are derived from petroleum and linked to several health issues including allergies, cancer, and hyperactivity in children.


Mono and Diglycerides (or Partially Hydrogenated Oils): These contain trans fat which is strongly correlated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The CDC has linked trans fat to at least 20,000 heart attacks per year and the Institute of Medicine says there is no safe level to eat. This additive is often found in low-fat ice creams where they are trying to make up for what they took out, but you’ll find it in many others too!

Sugar Alcohols and Zero-Calorie Sweeteners: “No Sugar Added” and “Carb Smart” ice creams are packed sugar alcohols like maltitol syrup and sorbitol. These are associated with destroying gut heath, and a healthy gut is the key to good health and a slim waistline. Artificial sweeteners like sucralose (Splenda) and acesulfame potassium have been shown to contribute to weight gain by encouraging sugar cravings. When you eat something sweet – even when it has no calories – your brain is tricked into wanting more calories because your body is not getting enough energy (i.e. calories) to be satisfied. So you keep craving sweets, eating sweets, and gaining weight. They also come with serious health risks!

Artificial flavors: These synthetic flavors are made from proprietary chemicals to make fake food taste real. This is not a single ingredient – each flavor may contain of up to 100 ingredients, including synthetic chemicals, solvents and preservatives such as BHA, propylene glycol, MSG, parabens, and more.

Natural Flavors: The only difference between natural and artificial flavors mentioned above, is that natural flavors are derived from things found in nature (such as beaver glands). Just like artificial flavors, they are created in a lab by a team of scientists and can contain up to 100 hidden ingredients. The bottom line: You have no idea what you are eating – and it might be propylene glycol, BHA, and parabens.

Soybean Oil: This unhealthy oil increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. When it comes to organic Soymilk ice creams, an abundance of soy itself is not healthy in the diet as it can disrupt hormones and lead to disease. Soy also has an abundance of phytic acid that leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body.

Cottonseed Oil: I was shocked to find cottonseed oil in LaLoo’s Capraccino Almond Fudge Ice Cream. This oil generally comes from GMO cotton crops that require an intense application of agricultural chemicals and have been called the “World’s Dirtiest Crop”. Residues from these pesticides can remain in cottonseed oil and cottonseeds are subjected to intensive chemical refining with toxic hexane, bleach, and deodorizers. I consider it one of the worst ingredients in food.
“Sugar” Instead of “Cane Sugar”: The majority of sugar in this country comes from GMO sugar beets and not from cane. These sugar beets are Roundup-Ready, which means they are sprayed with the herbicide Roundup (glyphosate) and don’t die. Whenever an ingredient list just says “sugar” instead of “cane sugar” that indicates it’s from GMO sugar beets. When my team contacted LaLoo’s Goat Milk Ice Cream they said their ingredients are “clean” and that they’re currently working on getting verified by the Non-GMO Project. But, unless you see that label on there, consider it unverified!

Conventional (not organic) Dairy: Some brands like Breyer’s, Tillamook and Häagen-Dazs have some flavors with cleaner ingredient lists with fewer additives, but they don’t use organic cream or milk. I outline all of the reasons to only choose organic dairy products in this post.

Häagen-Dazs has a non-GMO claim on their ice cream, but that doesn’t apply to the cream, milk, or eggs, in that the animals were likely raised on GMO feed. Their non-GMO claim is 3rd party verified by SGS and their standards don’t apply to animal feed – and a rep from Häagen-Dazs confirmed this with us. Ben and Jerry’s is another brand that uses non-GMO ingredients, but admits the cows are still fed GMO grains (but are trying to transition and hopefully will).
Why to avoid dairy from GMO-fed cows:
Organically raised cows are only permitted to eat organic non-GMO food and organic grass. Ultimately, you want to look for certified organic ice cream to avoid dairy raised with herbicide-laden GMOs, hormones, antibiotics and all the drugs that are prohibited on organic farms.

I’ve gotten a lot of emails about Halo Top because they market themselves as a healthier alternative to regular ice cream that’s low-calorie, high-protein, and low-sugar… and they are REALLY POPULAR right now. This brand has a real “Health Halo” around it (haha), but I’m not buying it. They’ve done such a great job marketing it as healthy ice cream that some people are even treating it like a diet food and the founder says he eats it every morning… which sounds just crazy, but who wouldn’t like to have ice cream for breakfast, LOL. Here’s why that really isn’t a good idea (sorry guys!)…
“Email from Halo Top (May 2017): “We do use only non-GMO ingredients in Halo Top, and the cows from which we get our dairy ingredients are never treated with growth hormones (like rBST). We’re not yet at a point, though, where we can guarantee the makeup of the grain for the cows’ feed across the supply chain. Working on it though!”
“Hey Vani I felt like this was something that needed to be shared. Halo ice cream that I feel like has been pitching themselves as a healthier ice cream won’t disclose what their “natural flavoring” is. Thought you’d like to know their cop out response: Hi Alyssa! I inquired into the flavorings for you, and it turns out that apparently the flavorings industry is highly competitive, and the flavoring makers we work with keep their exact formula proprietary to themselves for competitive reasons. Even so, we of course require confirmation that the flavors are indeed all-natural, gluten-free, kosher, etc. I know it’s not exactly the answer you were looking for but I hope it helps a little!”
Arctic Zero is another “healthy” ice cream that really isn’t. They claim their whey comes from a “GMO-free region” but that doesn’t guarantee how the cows are fed:
Email from Arctic Zero (May 2017): “We have no control over what the cows are fed, but please know we get all our whey protein from a GMO-free region. Our whey protein is GMO-free certified before added to our product and our final product is tested for GMO and it is GMO-free. Please know that our whey protein is not produced from genetically modified organisms, and does not consists of, or contain genetically modified organisms. Therefore, our whey protein is certified GMO-free”.
Arctic Zero is not 100% organic, the whey isn’t from organic cows, and it also contains processed “functional fiber” additives and not-so-natural flavors, so I don’t consider this a good choice.
Is it certified organic?
Is it flavored naturally with vanilla bean, lemon, cinnamon, cocoa, etc.? Or, did they take a shortcut with “natural flavors”?
Is it made entirely with whole food ingredients? Or, does it contain additives you don’t have in your kitchen like carrageenan, yellow #5, erythritol, and mono and diglycerides?
NOTE: Not every flavor by these brands is perfect and you still need to read the ingredient list to make sure you know what you are eating.

https://foodbabe.com/marinated-cannellini-bean-salad/,Marinated Cannellini Bean Salad,"This chilled bean salad recipe is perfect for a backyard BBQ on a hot day or for a simple protein-packed lunch! I’ve always loved to eat tangy bean salads, but never the stale store-bought versions that are usually made with inflammatory soybean oil and added sweeteners. If you’ve never been a fan of bean salads, this recipe is so fresh and flavorful that it might change your mind!
I regularly include beans in my diet for several reasons. Beans are an amazing source of protein and soluble fiber – so they keep you feeling full for hours and can help you lose weight. They are full of nutrients that fight heart disease and there’s ample evidence that beans reduce the risk of cancer and enhance longevity.
When it comes to buying beans, I typically buy dried organic beans (which are often found super cheap in the bulk section!) When you cook them yourself, you can avoid BPA and save money too. If you do buy canned to save time, remember to choose brands that are BPA free like Eden Foods.

If you’ve heard that “detoxing is a myth”, then you have to read this post where I share the science behind detoxing. The truth is that our bodies are working overtime every day to process all of the substances that come in and to expel toxins – but they are being pushed to the brink. When our organs are overtaxed and overburdened with toxins, symptoms can creep up such as fatigue, digestion problems, bloating, weight gain and muscle aches. When these symptoms go unchecked and our bodies are not able to detox optimally, we are at risk for greater health problems down the road.

Dr. Mark Hyman, M.D. (a member of my advisory counsel and a trusted mentor) says that detoxification starts in the diet. Dr. Hyman is a huge advocate of supporting the natural detoxification processes in the body with specific foods, such as lemons, garlic, and cruciferous vegetables.

https://foodbabe.com/modern-medicine-hijacked-pregnancy-birth-can-take-back/,How Modern “Medicine” Hijacked Pregnancy & Birth (And How We Can Take It Back!),"Ever since I saw this hilarious video of Genevieve Howland, aka Mama Natural, “hulk out” on a processed foods scientist, I knew she and I were sisters on similar missions.
So when I became pregnant last year, one of my first steps was to sign up for Genevieve’s free pregnancy week-by-week series from a natural perspective. I loved the series so much I signed up for her awesome online birth classes.
With humor and grace, evidence and affirmation, Genevieve is helping change the culture of childbirth in our country.
Now Genevieve is taking her mission to the next level with a beautiful new book that is out this week, The Mama Natural Week-By-Week Guide to Pregnancy & Childbirth. She was kind enough to share an excerpt from the book below. ❤️❤️❤️


First off, I’d like to thank Vani for the opportunity to share an excerpt from my book with you! I’ve been a part of the Food Babe Army since the very beginning, and I’m so grateful for all of your world-changing work!
So, what’s everybody yelling about?
Until the advent of modern medicine, babies were typically born at home, and mamas-to-be were attended to almost exclusively by women—either female relatives or, in most cases (even as far back as antiquity), hired midwives.
By the mid- to late 1800s, however, a kind of turf war broke out.
Midwifery became associated with old-world folk medicine, whereas newly licensed physicians—exclusively men, many of whom had never even seen a live birth—began to advertise their more “modern” and “sophisticated” techniques.
A few decades later, an American obstetrician by the name of Joseph DeLee called for a ban on the use of midwives altogether—he referred to them as “evil” and “barbaric.”
DeLee also put forth a bold new notion: that pregnancy, rather than a natural process, was “pathogenic” in nature. In other words, pregnancy was like a sickness or a disease, and he thought it was best treated as such.
By the 1930s, hospital birth had replaced home birth as the norm. And things continued that way, with midwife-attended birth declining year after year after year.

Before we get ahead of ourselves, it’s important to point something out: in the old days, the practice of medicine—in all fields, not just obstetrics—was pretty brutal.
There is plenty of evidence, for example, that the earliest doctor-attended births did not exactly go well. Back in the day, giving birth in a hospital was far more dangerous than giving birth at home, and the maternal death rate actually increased at the beginning of the twentieth century. (Infection rates in hospitals were sky-high, for one thing, in part because doctors didn’t know to wash their hands between patients.)
Those early, hard-won discoveries, however, paved the way for astonishing medical breakthroughs.
Doctors learned about the transmission of infection and disease via bacteria. They developed smarter and safer surgical techniques. They helped make pregnancy and childbirth—once a pretty serious health risk—exceedingly safe for most women and babies.
Case in point: the ideal Cesarean rate is between 10 percent and 15 percent, according to the World Health Organization. Yet 33 percent of American women—more than double the recommended rate—are currently giving birth via C-section.
Why? There are plenty of theories, including the idea that some women are just “too posh to push.” (Total myth, by the way. Only 1 percent to 2 percent of women just “decide” to have a completely elective, medically unnecessary C-section.)
The most likely culprit is the modern, medicalized approach to labor and delivery.
These days, a standard hospital birth may go a little something like this:
Guess what? Every single one of those totally standard, commonplace procedures is associated with a higher likelihood of eventual C-section.
Well, first, let me make it very clear: C-sections save lives and thank God we have them. Epidurals, when used judiciously, can actually prevent some moms from ending up in the operating room.
However, with a 33% c-section rate and over 60% epidural rate, we have gone off course for the original intent of interventions. While I do support an informed mama’s desire for an epidural to help her during labor, not all moms are told about the side effects and risks of getting said interventions.
If you’re wondering why that matters—who cares if the C-section rate is kinda high?—well, there are a whole host of reasons.
For one thing, it’s easy to forget that a Cesarean is serious, invasive abdominal surgery; the associated risks and side effects are considerably higher than in uncomplicated vaginal births. Babies born via C-section, meanwhile, have a higher chance of developing asthma, allergies, obesity, and diabetes later in life; they’re also less likely to successfully breastfeed.
While it’s certainly true that not every woman can or should deliver vaginally (C-sections can be life-saving for mamas and babies who need them! I was a c-section baby myself.), it seems to me that we should be doing what we can to lower the rates.
Unfortunately, other forms of medical intervention are on the rise, too.
The use of Pitocin, for example, has doubled since 1990, even though it may be less safe than we previously thought: a 2013 study at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York found that Pitocin was associated with lower APGAR scores (a test to evaluate a newborn’s health), as well as unexpected admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Epidurals—administered to roughly 60 percent of laboring women—can mess with mama’s natural production of oxytocin, thereby extending labor and increasing the risk of perineal tear. (Ouch!)
The further we get from the idea that women were designed to give birth—the more we treat mamas-to-be like sick people—the more likely they are to accept interventions they neither want nor actually need.
We have so sanitized and anesthetized the birth experience that many women have no idea what their bodies are actually capable of doing. And no awareness of the potential side effects of all those “modern” medical services.
You can see how quickly this becomes a vicious cycle.
In fact, it’s called the “Cascade of Intervention.” And once it starts, the birth experience you may have planned for can begin to slip through your fingers.
Before you know it, the baby is in distress and you’re being prepped for an emergency C-section.
Rather than something you did, it can feel as though childbirth was something that was done to you. When that happens, mamas might feel anything from overwhelmed and scared to violated and depressed.
In 1989, midwives were the lead care providers at just 3 percent of American births. These days, the number is closer to 9 percent, and it’s been rising steadily for the last twenty-five years.
Consistent midwife care throughout pregnancy is associated with better birth outcomes for both baby and mama.
While you can reap plenty of rewards by sticking with a natural-minded obstetrician in a hospital setting—women who give birth naturally recover faster and go home sooner—there are benefits to getting out of the hospital, too: among women who choose to deliver at birth centers, only 6 percent do so by C-section.
The most compelling reason to go natural, however, might be the simplest to understand, as well as the easiest to overlook: women were designed to give birth.
When mamas are encouraged to trust the ancient wisdom of their bodies, when they’re allowed to focus on the process without distraction, they don’t just have shorter labors and deliver healthier babies—they feel empowered regardless of how their birth unfolds. And that’s the whole point. That women can make the right choices for their bodies, their births and their babies.
It starts by getting informed. I’ve just published the first week-by-week pregnancy guide from a natural perspective. Featuring insights from a certified nurse midwife (who happened to deliver both of my children), as well as a registered nurse and doula, the book is packed with helpful info on:
This book is evidence-based, empowering and entertaining. ? (No boring text books over here!)  If pregnancy is in your future, or if you know anyone who’s pregnant, please consider picking up a copy.
My goal is to get the book into Babies R Us and Walmart, where we can reach moms who may have never heard about skin-to-skin contact, delayed cord clamping, or gentle cesarean. But in order to get into mainstream retailers, we need to show those stores that there is a groundswell of interest in natural childbirth – and a demand for this natural guide. Would you consider ordering a copy and….
Thank you so much for your support, Food Babe Army!
While some mamas do get the birth of their dreams, I know firsthand that it doesn’t always work out that way. But if we come from an informed place, we can feel good about the experience no matter what.
I hope every mama out there gets the support and resources she needs to have an empowered and grace-filled birth. ❤️",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/the-worst-ingredient-in-starbucks-unicorn-frappuccino-why-you-shouldnt-drink-it/,The Worst Ingredient In Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino & Why You Shouldn’t Drink It,"When I first saw the new Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino I just knew that kids everywhere were going to be drinking this – I mean what kid isn’t going to want a drink that looks like this!  But of course…the first thing that popped into my mind was what the heck is it made out of? Well, we found out, and it’s not pretty.


Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino Ingredients: Ice, Milk, Crème Frappuccino Syrup [Water, Sugar, Salt, Natural And Artificial Flavor, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid], Whipped Cream [Cream (Cream, Mono And Diglycerides, Carrageenan), Vanilla Syrup (Sugar, Water, Natural Flavors, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid)], Mango Syrup [Sugar, Water, Mango Juice Concentrate, Natural Flavor, Passion Fruit Juice Concentrate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Turmeric, Gum Arabic], Blue Drizzle [White Chocolate Mocha Sauce (Sugar, Condensed Skim Milk, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Natural Flavor, Salt, Potassium Sorbate, Monoglycerides), Classic Syrup (Sugar, Water, Natural Flavors, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid), Sour Blue Powder (Citric Acid, Color [Spirulina, Water, Sugar, Maltodextrin, Citric Acid])], Pink Powder [Dextrose, Fruit And Vegetable Color (Apple, Cherry, Radish, Sweet Potato)], Sour Blue Powder [Citric Acid, Color (Spirulina, Water, Sugar, Maltodextrin, Citric Acid)].
Considering the average ADULT male isn’t supposed to be eating more than 36 grams of sugar in an entire day (and only 25 grams if you’re a woman) – just one of these drinks is going to put you WAY over the edge – making it even worse for kids.
The Unicorn Frappuccino grande has 59 grams of sugar and a shocking 76 grams in a venti size. It’s totally outrageous that Starbucks is promoting this drink at all, and especially to children!
Entire bag of Hostess Powdered Donettes (75 grams of sugar). This is 20 donettes!
Four large scoops Baskin Robbins Chocolate Chip Ice Cream (72 grams of sugar).

I hope this makes you think twice before you buy this for yourself or your kids. Please share with everyone you know!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/slow-cooker-southwest-black-bean-dip-homemade-chips/,Slow Cooker Southwest Black Bean Dip With Homemade Chips,"This time of year we love to get together and spend more time outside at parties and BBQ’s with friends and family. If we’re heading out, of course it’s customary to bring a dish and so I always do (and often bring several). This way I know that I’ll have something healthy to eat and can also share with my loved ones how delicious healthy eating can be. This fun recipe for Slow Cooker Southwest Bean Dip is going to be put to big use this year for sure!


As crazy as it has been around here with a new baby, I’m always looking for ways to keep my food simple and even when I’m busy I don’t want to go down the road of buying processed foods full of health-wrecking additives. When I recently checked out the ingredients on bean dips at the store, my mind was reeling. Way back in the day, I used to love Fritos Bean Dip and actually thought it was good for me because it’s low fat and had fiber. Boy was I wrong!

This ingredient sounds clean and innocent, but isn’t what it seems! This is how food manufacturers can get away with putting all kinds of hidden ingredients in your food and just mask it under the name “natural flavors”. Companies use them because it’s cheaper than using real food ingredients and they help make heavily processed food taste good (and addicting). Natural flavors are highly complex chemical concoctions that can contain up to 100 ingredients, including substances like propylene glycol and BHA – and none of these need to be identified on the label. Since I like to know exactly what I’m eating, natural flavors are a no-go for me!
Tostitos Bean Dip is even way worse with artificial colors (yellow #5 and #6) derived from petroleum, controversial preservatives, and MSG. This is no way to party!!

Beware that almost all tortilla chips and pita chips are made from GMOs and inflammatory oils like corn and cottonseed oils…



That’s not the only reason to avoid conventional chips like these… as I reported previously, some Stacy’s Simply Naked Pita Chips (non-GMO and non-organic version) were tested and found to have over 800 ppb of glyphosate weedkiller (aka Roundup) in them – and that’s more than what’s permitted in drinking water. Yikes!
If you’re going to use store-bought chips, make sure that you only buy certified organic chips to avoid GMOs and greatly reduce your risk of glyphosate exposure. Instead of buying a bag of chips from the store, I prefer to make chips at home with sprouted grain tortillas or pitas. Nothing beats the flavor of these homemade chips!
This Southwest Black Bean Dip is so super simple to make, you just basically throw the ingredients in your slow cooker and when you come back in a couple hours it’s practically ready to go.
A lot of people just pull out their slow cookers in the winter, but I think they’re perfect for summer cooking so you don’t heat up your house. If you are trying to eat a healthy diet but are limited on time, using a slow cooker makes it virtually effortless to stick to eating unprocessed food on a regular basis. This recipe comes from my Real Food Slow Cooker Guide, which has over 50 slow cooker recipes that are all incredibly delicious and easy. These recipes are so simple and hassle-free that they make a healthy lifestyle a breeze!

https://foodbabe.com/this-new-label-on-food-will-keep-you-from-getting-poisoned-by-monsantos-weedkiller/,This New Label On Food Will Keep You From Getting Poisoned By Monsanto’s Weedkiller,"A large body of peer reviewed research links glyphosate (which is sprayed on the majority of crops in this country) to cancer, reproductive problems, liver, kidney and skin cell damage, antibiotic-resistance, and more. The WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer has deemed it a probable carcinogen. One of the biggest sellers of glyphosate, Monsanto, has been colluding with the EPA to keep it on the market. It’s truly outrageous and I’m as angry as you are.
A few months ago when the story broke that popular foods like Cheerios and Stacy’s Pita Chips contain glyphosate weedkiller – we were outraged. If you didn’t hear the news, Food Democracy Now! and The Detox Project commissioned these tests which found glyphosate in many popular American foods… even some that are organic and non-GMO! My reporting on this was my most shared post of 2016, with millions of views. It struck a chord with so many of you and for good reason.
Since all of this has come out, I’ve received thousands of comments and emails from people who want to know how to avoid glyphosate and know if the food we buy at the store contains it. I’m right there with ya, I want to know too.
The only way to find out if the food you are buying contains glyphosate is to literally send it to a lab and get it tested. It’s ridiculous. We are totally in the dark and have no clue whether the food we are buying is tainted with this poison. There could be an insane amount of glyphosate in the food we are eating every day, and we’d never know.


When Henry Rowlands from The Detox Project told me about his latest project and this label, I was bursting at the seams and couldn’t wait to tell you all about it! The “Glyphosate Residue Free” verification program has begun labeling products that have been tested and are free of glyphosate. They are working with food manufacturers and grocery chains, so that soon we will see labels like this on products!
Although we already have the Non-GMO Project label to avoid GMOs, that’s the only information that it provides. The “Non-GMO Project” label only verifies that a product doesn’t contain GMOs. While that is good, it’s limited to GMOs only and unfortunately won’t tell you if those non-GMO Cheerios you are buying are free of glyphosate.
The new Glyphosate Residue Free label takes this a step further and just offers more transparency and information about the food you are buying. This label applies to any GMO, non-GMO, or organic food. This is important because glyphosate doesn’t discriminate.
No matter how healthy we eat or how much we try to protect ourselves from it, this weedkiller is being used on most major conventional food crops – such as wheat, tomatoes, sugar, nuts, oranges, apples, beans, and corn. It isn’t just used on GMOs but on 70 different food crops in the U.S. – and winding up in practically everything Americans eat.
Glyphosate is also so rampant in our environment that it is contaminating even food that isn’t directly sprayed with it – such as organic food. It’s been found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies… the list goes on. There is only so much glyphosate-free food out there and it is going to take awhile to rid it from our food system.
That’s why this label is such a game-changer. When brands start testing their food and finding glyphosate, they will take steps to clean up their supply chains. This will improve the integrity of the organic label and our food system as a whole.
The very first product to be verified “Glyphosate Residue Free” is Leaf & Love Organic Lemonade, which you can find at some natural grocery stores and also online. This is just the beginning and many more products are in the process of getting verified right now!
I’ve partnered up with The Detox Project to help spread the word about this new label and verification program, but I need your help. The success of this label is going to depend on us. We need to spread the word to food companies and let them know that we want them to verify their products and why. We need to educate our favorite food brands as to why this label is important and why they’d want to make sure that their products don’t contain glyphosate.
I can’t wait to start seeing this label in stores! Share this post with your friends and family and tell them about this exciting new label. Spread the word!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/worst-diets-follow/,The Worst Diets To Follow,"Recently a friend showed me the annual ranking by U.S. News and World Report of what they consider the “Best Diets” in America. Taking a quick glance at their rankings, I knew that something wasn’t right. Why are they promoting diets that rely almost solely on unhealthy processed food full of additives linked to cancer and heart disease? Why did they rank diets that advocate for giving up processed food in favor of fresh, whole foods AS THE WORST on their lists? They’ve gotta be kidding, right?!?
Who is benefiting from rankings like this? Will this help Americans become less obese? Will this make us healthier? I’d argue that many of the “diets” in America are outrageously unhealthy and diet rankings like this are seriously misleading people about what it means to eat healthy.


Jenny Craig
This diet relies almost 100% on processed food. With a diet like this, you are sure to be eating insane amounts of preservatives and added sugar, which are both linked to major health risks. Jenny Craig uses some of the worst additives in their food, like carrageenan (linked to cancer and intestinal inflammation), cellulose (linked to inflammation and weight gain), and the artificial sweetener sucralose (linked to leukemia and weight gain). How could anyone call this diet healthy?


This diet isn’t supposed to rely on processed foods, but Weight Watchers sells a huge line of majorly processed foods and officially endorses processed food brands like Jolly Time Popcorn and Progresso Light Soups. You’ve probably seen the new commercials that chant “Bring on the food!” while they talk about how NOTHING is off limits on Weight Watchers…. bacon, pizza, chips… “You can have whatever you want”.  So, it sure sounds like they are advocating for the continued use of processed junk food full of additives, instead of creating healthier habits that will teach your body to crave fruits and vegetables instead. Some of the recipes on their website call for processed foods like reduced fat vanilla wafers and even chocolate cake mix! Say Whaaaah?


It blows my mind that this is considered an acceptable diet by ANYONE. On this diet you essentially drink chemical-filled processed drinks for two of your meals, along with three of their processed snacks every day – and then you get just one homemade meal per day. You’ll basically be gulping down tons of artificially thickened sugary drinks every day. Gross.

On this diet you eat five of their “100 calorie” products every single day and then one home cooked meal. So, the majority of the time you are eating food full of heavily processed proteins, excitotoxins, artificial thickeners and sweeteners, synthetic vitamins and amino acids (instead of naturally-occurring ones). This is nowhere near real food! Medifast products are LOADED with hidden MSG additives like textured proteins, sodium caseinate, yeast extract.


On this diet you’ll be eating boxed up and processed Nutrisystem food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner – all filled with of dozens of chemical additives (some of which are addicting) blended together with the “correct” ratios of protein, carbs and fats, with some synthetic vitamins and fiber mixed in to make them look healthy on the “Nutrition Facts” label. Unfortunately, the “Nutrition Facts” label doesn’t tell the real story, and you’ll get a whole lot more than you bargained for when you choose to eat fake food like this.

For instance – on the Mayo Clinic Diet, you can spread your toast with a “margarine-like spread” full of chemicals. On the DASH Diet you can start your day with a bowl of Shredded Wheat preserved with BHT or “light” yogurt sweetened with sucralose and acesulfame potassium. On the TLC Diet you can snack on low-fat microwave popcorn with TBHQ. On the Biggest Loser Diet, you can make a sandwich with processed deli meat and sprinkle your plate with fat-free cheese coated in cellulose. On the Volumetrics Diet, you can eat sugar-free pudding every day for dessert. This is not real food!
Any diet book will tell you to eat right and exercise, but what does that really mean? I’ve seen people “eat right” by eating unlimited amounts of red meat and fat, and I’ve seen people “work out” daily for more than four hours, exhausting their body and pushing themselves too far.
I decided to search for some answers. My search was inspired not by any diet book, but rather by an eye-opening article, “Science Compared Every Diet, and the Real Winner is Real Food.” The article summarized an independent study, published in Annual Reviews in 2014, that reviewed every major diet and concluded that, “A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively associated with healthy promotion and disease prevention.”
I was pumped by reading this! It supported and validated what I had been doing and preaching for years: a natural, whole food, and predominately plant-based diet is the secret to staying in shape, feeling vital, and being healthy. Other diets just don’t cut it, and one reason is that they induce you to eat a lot of chemical calories and lock you into habits that kill your ability to maintain your weight. The old motto, “Garbage In, Garbage Out”, is so true! There is no doubt about it – you feel horrible when you feed your body fast and processed food.
The way to create lasting change in your body is to eat food as close to nature as possible – the least amount of processed food, the better!!! After I began eating this way, I have never had to diet again, despite the challenging environment we live in with an abundance of tricky marketing and addictive food additives.
I’ve learned that the only way to feel great is to stop outsourcing my food to corporations and spend more time preparing meals at home. When I began cooking and eating whole foods, my health soared as a result – and now I never look back.
After I spent years juggling meal planning, food shopping and cooking, I consulted with a nutritionist and worked with my team to create an Food Babe Meal Plans for Health program – not only for myself, but for all of you. This is more than a meal planning service, it will keep you on track, and help you develop HEALTHY HABITS so you can finally shed unwanted pounds or have an easier time maintaining the healthy lifestyle you may have already built. This program makes eating healthy food and losing weight practically mindless (and delicious)!
When you sign up, you’ll get recipes for new Food Babe meals every month (easy to make green drinks, breakfasts, lunches, dinners), a meal schedule, and a shopping list. These are brand new recipes that the Food Babe Team cooks up every month just for you that are absolutely delicious! You will actually LOVE the food you are eating, which makes creating new habits so easy.
You’ll also get my Starter Guide full of budget tips, diet strategies, and a list of the “Terrible 20” ingredients that keep you from losing weight, where to spot them, and what to eat instead. You can download these guides and recipes to your computer and keep them forever. Dozens of pages of knowledge at your fingertips INSTANTLY.
See everything that comes with the program here.
You’ll gain control your eating habits, while this program shows you how to eat wisely and well. As you continue eating this way, which will quickly become second nature, you’ll naturally start losing weight and keeping it off. You won’t have to count anything or obsess over calories or carbs, either. You just have to read labels, change some food-buying and food-prep practices, and enjoy food the way it was meant to be – natural and whole.
The only reason I’ve been able to maintain my ideal weight for over 10 years now and feel amazing is because of my habits, food choices, and routine, which is outlined in this program. If you haven’t already heard my personal story about what happened when I started eating this way and how much my health improved, read my story and see my before/after photo here. When I took a hard look at what I was really eating and changed my eating habits and food choices, things dramatically shifted in my life. I went from someone overweight and sick to a new being of vibrant health, and I want everyone to feel this way.
I have helped thousands of people develop new eating habits, lose weight, and feel their best. You can read a few of their stories here, here, and here. YOU can do this too and I can’t wait to hear your success story.

https://foodbabe.com/super-c-beauty-smoothie/,Super C Beauty Smoothie,"When people tell me they don’t have time to eat healthy, I yell the word – SMOOTHIE at them! Smoothies are the ultimate fast food and they are a superb way to add more veggies to your diet. I’ve found, too, that they alleviate bad food cravings because they provide a burst of nutrition – one that’s not usually present in the typical American diet. When your body doesn’t get what it needs nutritionally speaking, cravings kick in. And if you give in to those cravings, you’re on the road to gaining weight. Once you start to pump your body with greens, you’ll start craving them instead!


I love all of the beautiful ingredients in this Super C Beauty Smoothie – strawberries, red bell pepper, cauliflower, spinach – not only do they make a delicious tasting smoothie, but all these superfoods are PACKED with vitamin C!

This amazing vitamin fights cell damage and chronic inflammation, strengthens your immune defenses, and accelerates wound healing. Eating foods rich in vitamin C has helped keep me from catching a cold or the flu and has kept me going strong. It’s also excellent for your skin because vitamin C helps the body create collagen and rejuvenates aged skin, helping you look younger!
First, you’ll want to remove the leaves from your strawberries and wash up all of your ingredients. Roughly chop up half a cup each of red bell pepper and cauliflower and add them to a high-powered blender along with one cup of strawberries.
Add one cup of spinach (or any leafy green), a banana, and two tablespoons of chia seeds to the blender. Then, pour in up to a cup of almond or coconut milk. If you like a thinner smoothie, add more milk…

You can also add in a few cubes of ice if you want your smoothie colder and thicker. Blend all ingredients on high until it’s smooth and creamy… pour into two tall glasses and enjoy with a friend!


I include recipes just like this in my Monthly Meal Plans, which are part of the Food Babe Eating Guide Program. When you sign up, you’ll get hundreds of pages of my tested tricks and tips to make healthy eating mindless, and a monthly meal plan full of Food Babe approved recipes and guidelines to help you detox naturally every day.

https://foodbabe.com/emails-epa-monsanto-now-revealed-contents-sickening/,Emails between the EPA & Monsanto now revealed (The contents are sickening!),"I have made it my life’s mission to raise public awareness about what’s really in our food, how it can affect our health, and how a handful of large corporations are poisoning us for profit. These corporations use big bucks and unethical tactics to influence regulators into playing their game to keep Americans in the dark about the dangers of their products.
Along with so many of you and fellow activists, we have been spreading the truth about GMOs and hazardous chemicals used in conjunction with them like Roundup (glyphosate). This weedkiller isn’t just used on GMOs but on 70 different food crops in the U.S. – it’s in practically everything Americans eat. So, if glyphosate is causing cancer and other diseases, I want to know about it and get it out of our food – don’t you?
Stating the obvious: Monsanto makes billions off of Roundup sales, so they don’t want anyone to question its safety. Some never-before-seen confidential documents just released in a court case against Monsanto give us a glimpse into how they are working to influence the EPA (who is in charge of determining whether they are allowed to sell Roundup anymore) and undermine any efforts to ban its use. These documents show what many of us have known and suspected for quite some time… Monsanto is manipulating scientific research and has gotten some EPA officials on their side who seem to be helping them cover-up the health dangers of Roundup so they can keep it on the market.


While Monsanto is being sued in California by dozens of people who claim Roundup caused their non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, Monsanto had to provide over 6 million pages of internal emails and documents to the court and attorneys, and marked the majority of them as “confidential” so they’d be hidden from the public. When the plaintiffs asked the court to make the records public, both Monsanto and the EPA objected. The judge didn’t agree with their objections and threatened to sanction Monsanto if they continued trying to seal documents and found it in the best interest of the public to release them for all of us to see,“even if Monsanto doesn’t like what they say”.
The public interest group U.S. Right To Know is publishing these documents in their entirety on their website here. This is just the beginning and more are coming out.
Here’s what we have uncovered in these documents so far…






They are feeding us lies and these secrets are poisoning us!
Most Americans are eating glyphosate every day… No matter how healthy we eat or how much we try to protect ourselves from it, this weedkiller is being used on most major conventional food crops and is so rampant in our environment that it is contaminating virtually all of our food. It’s been found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies… the list goes on. Our government agencies (FDA and EPA) know this and are allowing corporations to poison Americans for profit. It’s truly disgusting!
Monsanto is stooping to corruption to continue selling their poisons. Everything from seeking to keep their correspondence with the EPA secret, to intimidating scientists at the WHO International Agency on Cancer (IARC) who found Roundup’s active ingredient glyphosate “probably carcinogenic”. A large body of peer reviewed research links glyphosate to cancer, reproductive problems, liver, kidney and skin cell damage, antibiotic-resistance, and more – but Monsanto doesn’t want the public to know the truth!
Ask your favorite companies to test for glyphosate and get certified. Wouldn’t it be nice to know if the food you buy contains glyphosate? I have an exciting announcement! The Detox Project just launched a new “Glyphosate Residue Free Certification” program and will begin labeling products that have been tested and are free of glyphosate. I’ve partnered up with them to help spread the word – They are working with food manufacturers and grocery chains, so that soon we will see labels like this on some products – send this link to your favorite companies and ask them to go glyphosate free.

Everyone deserves to know exactly what they are eating and have access to safe, affordable food. My job will not be done until this is a reality. I’m so happy to have so many of you by my side and I know we can make this happen!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/is-organic-food-a-scam/,Is Organic Food A Scam?,"I choose to eat organic food whenever possible because I believe it’s better for my health, the environment, and the farmers who grow our food. But not everyone agrees with me. There are a lot of people who think organic food is too expensive, a waste of money, and a scam. Do you feel that way?
“Buying organic veggies at the supermarket is a waste of money” – Quartz
“The USDA ‘Organic’ Label Misleads And Rips Off Consumers” – Forbes
“Organic Foods Are Just A ‘Marketing Label” – Business Insider
“Don’t Believe the (Organic) Hype” – NPR
“Is organic food worth the higher price? Experts say no” – Portland Tribune
One of the biggest perpetrators of these beliefs is Monsanto (and other big biotech companies like Syngenta and Bayer). Think about it: their best-selling products like Roundup and GMO seeds are banned on organic farms. If all farms were organic their biggest products would bite the dust! Any messaging that organic food is better than conventionally grown food is harmful to their business and they have deep pockets to fight against this type of information.
Just like the millions of dollars that big food and agrochemical companies spent to fight GMO labels, it’s easy for them to put big money into advertising and ag front groups to spin the message that organic food is a scam. They don’t want Americans to question how our food is produced in large industrial operations. And, they don’t want to spend more money buying and growing organic ingredients, because that cuts into their bottom line.
You owe it to yourself to take a hard look at what you choose to eat every day and how it can affect your health. Do the research it takes so you can make an informed decision about whether organic food is worth it to you, and don’t just blindly believe what anyone (including me) tells you. I want you to feel informed and empowered!


One of the most fascinating reports about organic food comes from a large project recently commissioned by the European Parliament. Experts from throughout the world were asked to study whether organic food and farming is healthier for us – and their conclusions counter everything that you may have heard about organic food. The researchers concluded (quoting Harvard):
The whole basis of organic farming is to produce food without the need to use toxic pesticides. Crops are managed in a way that prevents the need to use chemicals. When produce from farms has been tested, organic has far less pesticide residue compared with conventional (non-organic). By eating organic you can significantly decrease your exposure to pesticides!
“Organic is a strictly regulated term, so you can trust that you’re getting produce grown with minimal if any synthetic pesticides.” – Consumer Reports: Pesticides In Produce, 2015
Many of the pesticides used on conventional farms are hormone disruptors, neurotoxins, or reproductive toxins which are strongly linked to many diseases and health issues:
Pesticides are even MORE damaging to children because their metabolism is different than adults and toxins remain longer in their body. The damage starts in the womb!
“Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates associations between early life exposure to pesticides and pediatric cancers, decreased cognitive function, and behavioral problems… Recognizing and reducing problematic exposures will require attention to current inadequacies in medical training, public health tracking, and regulatory action on pesticides.” – American Academy of Pediatrics
Tens of thousands of farm workers are poisoned by pesticides each year in the U.S. according to EPA reports – and there are likely many incidents that go unreported. The effects on farmers and nearby communities are devastating! If this is what happens on the farm, what are these chemicals doing to our bodies when we eat them in small amounts day after day?
“The entire U.S. population is exposed on a daily basis to numerous agricultural chemicals… Many of these chemicals have known or suspected carcinogenic or endocrine-disrupting properties.” – President’s Cancer Panel
When it comes to endocrine disruptors, chronic small exposures are the MOST damaging – “the dose makes the poison” mantra does not apply!
What about just peeling and washing the pesticides off?
It’s not that easy. Many of the chemicals used on conventional food are systemic – meaning they’re absorbed into the food and you can’t simply just wash it off. When it comes to non-organic packaged food, almost all of it is filled with GMOs that absorb and contain glyphosate weedkiller strongly linked to cancer and numerous diseases. This weedkiller is used on non-GMO crops too – but banned on organic!
Several pesticide residues are usually found and there’s no legal limit on the number of different pesticides allowed on food. And, the problem is getting worse:
“One sample of strawberries contained residues of 20 pesticides, according to the “Pesticide Data Program” (PDP) report issued this month by the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service… Notably, the agency said only 15 percent of the 10,187 samples tested were free from any detectable pesticide residues. That’s a marked difference from 2014, when the USDA found that over 41 percent of samples were “clean” or showed no detectable pesticide residues.” ~ Carey Gillam, U.S. Right To Know, November 2016.
Experts at the U.N. recently warned that pesticides end up in our water systems, damage our ecological system, contaminate soils, are responsible for bee deaths, and are a huge environmental threat to the future of food production. The issue of world hunger is due to poverty, inequality and distribution – not lack of food.
“It is time to overturn the myth that pesticides are necessary to feed the world and create a global process to transition toward safer and healthier food and agricultural production.” ~ U.N. Special Rapporteurs on Toxics and the Right to Food, March 2017
Are pesticides used to grow organic food?
It’s true that organic food is not always pesticide free – but that doesn’t mean you should throw the baby out with the bathwater. The best way to keep toxic chemicals out of your food is to choose organic.
Critics argue that “horribly toxic pesticides” are used on organic crops, and that they’re used in much greater amounts. One of the pesticides they routinely bring up is rotenone – but this pesticide isn’t even being used! It was once approved for organic crops, but the EPA has banned it from U.S. crops. Some other countries still use rotenone, but the National Organic Standards Board has passed a recommendation to prohibit it outright.
Another one that gets brought up is copper sulfate. This can be used by both organic and conventional fruit farmers as a fungicide – but conventional farmers reportedly use more of it and their versions contain riskier “non-active” ingredients. Organic farmers are required to monitor copper sulfate use and aren’t permitted to continue if it accumulates in high levels in the soil.
By choosing certified organic food you’ll automatically avoid many dangerous food additives – like TBHQ, BHT, artificial sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose) and artificial food dyes (yellow #5, etc) which are all banned from certified organic products. Carrageenan is on the organic chopping block as well. Although you ALWAYS need to read the ingredient list – even on organic products – it’s easier to find products without a crazy long list of additives and that actually contain real food!
Conventional meat, eggs, and dairy can be contaminated with even more synthetic pesticides than plant-based foods. Pesticides used on feed accumulate in animal tissues over time – and pesticide residues have been found in conventional beef, egg, milk, pork, and poultry samples. Using only certified organic feed is required when raising organic animals.
Most conventional animals are also raised on growth-promoting steroids, antibiotics, and other drugs – and these residues have been found in meat too. The overuse of growth-promoting antibiotics is creating superbugs that contaminate the meat, putting us at greater risk of antibiotic-resistant infections. These drugs are prohibited in the raising of organic animals!
With bigger food companies moving into organics, they are surely trying to water down the system. There are some bad guys out there not following the rules and some organic food is contaminated, but we all have to eat and organic food remains the lowest risk. Ultimately, it’s best to buy organic food grown on small local farms where you can shake the farmer’s hand and ask questions. Your local farmers market is perfect for this and you can also check the Local Harvest website for local growers.
Organic can be more expensive, but it’s worth it.
I believe that buying quality organic food and eating the most nutritious foods on the planet will save you big bucks down the road in medical costs, prescription drugs and doctor visits – It’s totally up to us to make it a priority. I’ve got over 75 organic budgeting tips here to help.
When I switched to eating primarily organic whole foods, everything changed in my life. I went from someone overweight and sick to a new being of vibrant health. I want everyone to feel this way!
I’ve learned to be careful about who I trust for health information and seek out experts who don’t use Monsanto’s talking points and aren’t muddled with industry ties. Ultimately, the only person you can trust is yourself. Make the switch to organic food and see how you feel. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised!",Food Babe,Unknown

What preparation did you go through before getting pregnant?
I have been on a journey for over 10 years to get my health back on track, which helped to prepare my body for pregnancy. Over the years, acupuncture has helped tremendously to balance my hormones and heal my body. I also stopped taking birth control pills years ago, because they were preventing my body from doing what it is naturally supposed to do. I’ve restored my gut bacteria back to normal with a whole foods diet, supplementing with effective probiotics, and eating fermented food daily.
My books The Food Babe Way, Feeding You Lies, and Food Babe Kitchen will show you how to provide the cleanest foods for your body to prepare it for pregnancy. Another great book that I love and read (twice!) was How to Conceive Naturally: And Have a Healthy Pregnancy after 30 by Christa Orecchio, a member of my advisory council. This book is spot on about the nutrition you want to put into your body if you are trying to conceive.
Overall, I stuck with the same diet that I had before pregnancy full of whole nutrient-rich foods with a few indulgences into those cravings – organic grilled cheeses and pizza to be exact! However, there are a few foods that I didn’t eat during pregnancy…
Yes, smoothies and juices made with mostly vegetables are full of vitamins and minerals that help to keep your immune system strong during pregnancy. As always, I take care to thoroughly wash my vegetables before making a juice and fill up my blender or juicer with greens like romaine lettuce, spinach, turnip greens, mustard greens, parsley, and collard greens. I tried not to overdo the beet juice though! I did that once in my first trimester and let’s just say it did not stay down! It’s always good to remember natural foods when juiced can be very potent too.
I’ve never had such a roller coaster of cravings before in my life (I know you other pregnant women can relate!). Read more about that here. One of my obsessions was frozen grapes to curb that sudden sweet tooth. I took my commitment to staying on track with my eating principles even more seriously while pregnant, even while indulging in the occasional treat. I’d indulge – but I made sure the ingredients were organic. If I wanted cookies – I’d eat them, but they need to be organic first to avoid any unnecessary toxic pesticides and chemical additives!
I didn’t drink any alcohol, but did have some soft cheeses on occasion when I knew they were either heated or pasteurized. I continued my habit of drinking lemon water with cayenne pepper first thing in the morning, drank kombucha on occasion, reduced the amount of caffeine I used to have in half (from 8 ounces of coffee or tea to 4 ounces), and tried to eat fermented foods everyday (See more important info on pregnancy habits from my advisory council member Dr. Amy Shah here).
As always, my diet consists mostly of plants like fruits, vegetables, seeds, beans and nuts, but there are some specific foods that I ate more of during pregnancy. This is such a big topic that I wrote an entire post about it with links to my favorite recipes! Check it out here.
These drinks (also known as “Glucola”) are essentially sugar water with hazardous artificial colors and preservatives for a VERY LONG shelf life. They are no better than most sodas on the market – and truly not something you’d want to consume while pregnant. While it’s certainly important to monitor your blood glucose during pregnancy, there are safer alternatives to drinking this toxic sugar water. I simply asked my doctor what my options were and she was ready with 5 alternatives! I was able to monitor with simple blood tests and it was reassuring to see that my blood sugar was on track. Specifically, I took my blood sugar two times a day for 3 days over one week and reported the results back to her. Be sure to ask your health care provider for options! In my opinion there is no way in hell any doctor could convince me to drink something with flame retardant, artificial dyes made from petroleum, controversial preservatives and GMOs, pregnant or not!
Only on my toes since it lasted longer and I didn’t need to paint them as often. I am generally doing the same thing while breastfeeding and handling my newborn as well – although I do occasionally paint them for events and here is a link to some safer nail polish brands I’ve used.
One of the things that I absolutely could not live without during pregnancy was my Belly Armor Belly Blanket. I worked from my laptop almost every day, but knew that it wasn’t safe to expose my baby to all of the radiation that emits from laptops and wifi. Radiation exposures during pregnancy can increase risk of miscarriage and are also linked to developmental issues – and there was no way I was willing to take that risk. So I found an amazing solution! I just placed this Belly Blanket over my pregnant belly whenever I was working at my computer or using my phone for an extended period of time. The blanket is made with special fabric that neutralizes electromagnetic waves and blocks the radiation from reaching my belly, keeping my baby safe. This really gave me peace of mind! Now that she is born, I continue to use my Belly Blanket to protect her while I’m on my computer. As a new partner of Food Babe, Belly Armor is offering you a special deal:
Get a free baby hat ($19 value) if you spend $50 or more in their online store with the code “foodbabe” at checkout. (Note: the code will only work once you have the baby hat in your cart! These are found in their “Nursery” section.)
Before getting pregnant, I couldn’t remember the last nap I took! But once I became pregnant, I needed at least a 30 min – 1 hour nap almost every day, otherwise I would fall asleep at 8pm.  Your body needs more sleep during pregnancy, so don’t fight it. I also drank unsweetened iced tea or kombucha to perk myself up on occasion!
I didn’t take prenatal supplement formulas because the ones available on the market are one-size-fits-all and not everything in those supplements work well with my body. I worked with my doctor to come up with a supplement regimen that worked for me. I took a whole food based organic multivitamin with no fillers and synthetics, following these guidelines. I also took extra probiotics, calcium, vitamin D, magnesium – which helps with sleep. Of course, I also eat The Food Babe Way and have been limiting the amount of sugar in my diet.
I was able to sleep pretty well throughout my pregnancy, which I’m thankful for. The vitamin and mineral supplements that I took (see above) were helpful, but I also took nightly baths with epsom salts. This really helped me to relax and ease discomfort! I did not buy any special pillows, I just used a king size pillow between my legs while I slept on my side.
This simple remedy worked wonders for me: 1 tsp apple cider vinegar with 8 ounces of water. Take up to 2 doses, as needed. I also slept at an angle propped up on two pillows and took a 10 min walk after eating to help prevent heartburn.
Getting out in the fresh air makes a huge difference in everyday life! Although I didn’t go at it as hard as I did before I was pregnant, just doing a little bit of something improved my mood. I kept it part of my routine and made sure to get up and go – showing up to my exercise class every day, whether I could do everything or not! For example, I took a pilates barre class (Hilliard Studio Method) all the way up to my due date. I loved spinning in my first and second trimesters. And I lifted heavy weights with my trainer and took long walks the entire pregnancy.
I drank ginger tea, woke up and ate first thing in the morning and had smaller meals spaced out through the day. Exercise always helped too!
I found the most effective thing to do to avoid stretch marks is eat lots of fruits and vegetables and avoid processed foods while your tummy is growing. All those vitamins and minerals strengthen the skin’s elasticity! I also used organic coconut oil and/or sesame oil on my body every day.
I don’t normally take the flu shot because it has shown to be not effective (so I don’t take the risk) and I would personally never consider it as a pregnant woman. I want my body to react naturally to the environment and to fight viruses on its own. I take steps to prevent the flu – wash hands often, reduce stress, exercise, drink lots of filtered water, eat fermented foods, and avoid industrial toxins. I believe that living a healthy lifestyle sets you up for a healthy pregnancy.
Yes, you can read my birth story here.
No, I did not. I discussed this with my doctor and doula, researched options and there was not enough convincing evidence for me, although I have heard it does benefit some women.
The awesome women throwing me the shower put my preferences on the invitation. I had an eco baby shower, for example, instead of bringing a card with a gift, they requested guests bring an inscribed book instead. I also registered for a lot of eco-friendly items at Sprout San Francisco.
My birth plan is below, this is highly personalized and you should talk about these choices with your family and health care providers before determining your own.
This list is intended to express our preferences under normal conditions.
Labor Preferences:
A Natural Birth. I will use natural pain relief techniques. Please do not offer any medication, I will ask if needed. I have an adverse reaction to most pharmaceuticals.
Interventions only following opportunity to discuss options with husband and doula.
I prefer minimal internal exams. A vaginal exam only when I ask to be checked.
I prefer to move freely during labor and eat and drink as needed. 
I prefer only intermittent monitoring when needed.
I prefer to have no IV but will consent to a saline lock, if medically necessary.
I prefer no induction of any kind. I prefer the bag of waters to break on its own.
I would like perineal support with massage, hot compresses and various positions to avoid a tear. 
I prefer no episiotomy unless required for baby’s safety.
I prefer that no vacuum or forceps are used.
Birth Preferences:
Please place baby on my bare chest immediately. 
Please do not cut cord for 15 minutes or until it stops pulsing. Father will plan on cutting cord.
Please allow placenta to expel on its own.
Newborn Preferences:
Please conduct newborn procedures in arms, at least 2 hours after birth. 
We have chosen to DECLINE: erythomycin, Hep B vaccine (baby will follow up with Pediatrician), and Vitamin K shot (baby will be taking liquid Vitamin K per Stanford University Protocol).
We consent to: newborn screening (including PKU), necessary emergency treatment. Please conduct all in room. Father will accompany baby for hearing test.
Afterbirth Preferences: 
Baby will be breastfed exclusively. Please do not offer sugar water or formula. 
I wish for baby to remain with me following birth. Father will accompany baby out of room if needed.
I do not wish to receive any medication post labor, including stool softener. 
I prefer to leave the hospital as soon as possible after birth.
Should a transfer be necessary for baby, please allow me to accompany baby.
In case a Cesarean becomes necessary:
Husband and doula present in operating room.
Father holds baby immediately for skin-to-skin and stays with baby continually.
Doula present continually during recovery.
Newborn reunited with mother as soon as possible.
Yes! I did the Mama Natural Birth Course from start to finish and loved it so much. This is a digital course that you watch from home on your own time, and on your own schedule. It is super informative and I left each lesson feeling empowered and confident. I can honestly say that I don’t believe I’ve ever enjoyed an online course as much as this one. You can sign up here for free and Mama Natural will send you weekly pregnancy updates and you can find information on the Mama Natural Birth Course here.
The most powerful thing you can do for your health is become educated about everything you put in your own and your family’s bodies – whether it be the food you eat or the pharmaceuticals you inject. Vaccines are not one-size-fits-all and I feel that is way too simplistic of a view – and my doctor agrees. Not all vaccines are created equal. It is really important to recognize that what can help one person, has the ability to hurt another. Each vaccine needs to be evaluated individually for its benefits and risks relative to your personal situation.
Understand that I’m not an expert on vaccines recommended by the CDC for children, but now that I’m a parent I feel that it is my obligation to become as educated as possible on the subject… so I’ve been doing A LOT of reading! I have checked out or ordered just about every vaccine advice book under the sun and am doing a thorough personal investigation to become as educated as possible about my choices. I have also been taking the time to talk to my own doctors and trusted advisors to make the best decisions. I encourage you to do the same and make the decision for yourself as to what you feel comfortable with.
Join us in the Food Babe Meal Plans For Health Program. I’ll stick with you day after day to get rid of the food additives, chemicals and extra baggage that can weigh us down in this over-processed food world. If you are looking for more help in the kitchen or are struggling with figuring out what to eat, the best brands to buy, and how to follow a non-GMO, organic diet, then this program is the perfect fit for you.

https://foodbabe.com/importance-gut-bacteria-pregnancy-destroy-modern-practices/,The Importance Of Gut Bacteria In Pregnancy (and how we destroy it with modern practices!),"This is a guest post written by Dr. Amy Shah, a member of my Advisory Council.  Dr. Shah is a practicing physician, specializing in Allergy & Immunology and Internal Medicine. Dr. Shah is also a mom, and as we were recently discussing my pregnancy she brought up a topic that I believe will be very helpful to all of the other mamas-to-be out there! How can you nurture the bacteria in your gut to protect the future health of your child?

{Photo credit: Brad Olson photography}

Nurturing bacteria in pregnancy and childbirth may be the key to unlocking the mystery behind the modern American crisis of diabetes, autoimmunity, asthma, allergies, obesity and more!
Here is how we in medicine think this happens…
There are 2 basic arms of the immune system: Th1 and Th2. These are white blood cells known as T-helpers that recognize and combat pathogens. Th1 fights bacteria, and viruses; Th2 takes on parasites, allergies and, we think, does not have much of a role these days.
During pregnancy the body is weighted towards Th2. The hypothesis is that is so the body does not activate the immune system against the growing fetus. When the baby is born it is also predominantly Th2.
Because of the lack of bacteria (good and bad) and viruses in the modern world, the baby stays weighted towards the Th2 immune side instead of shifting back to Th1 side. This, we think, is why we have seen such an increase allergy, asthma and autoimmune disease!
So what is the take away?
I know it’s hard to believe, but there is more bacteria in our body than our cells! Here’s what you can do to grow your gut garden:
I can’t tell you how many times I see new mom’s slather hand sanitizer over themselves and anyone who comes close to their little one. The logic is there – of course you don’t want pathogens near your sensitive newborn. But – AND A BIG BUT – is this sterilization may be doing more harm than good by blocking the colonization of nurturing bacteria.
More concerning – ingredients in hand sanitizers are known endocrine disruptors that adversely affect sex hormones, especially in infants and new mothers. Endocrine disruptors are also found abundantly in common triclosan-based cleaning products. Use natural cleaning products when possible (or have someone else clean!)
Tip: Don’t let sick people go near your newborn but for others gentle washing with natural soap and water is preferred.
Of course this isn’t always possible and a C-section is necessary, but if it can be avoided, it should be. Immense difference has been reported in the microbiological constitution of babies born vaginally vs. C-section babies. C-section babies don’t get microbes from the birth canal, which are different than those colonized by the skin, nipple and milk.
A diverse microbiome is significant, as a less diverse microbiome means more chance the immune system will stay in the TH2 – meaning a higher probability of asthma, allergies and obesity related immune disease later in life.
Tip: If C-section is absolutely medically necessary, don’t fret – skin to skin contact, breast feeding, and other techniques to improve baby’s microbiome exist.
Again, of course, sometimes antibiotics are necessary and can’t be avoided but we may be overly reliant on them as a panacea for every ill. Generally avoid antibiotics for gut health, but especially for your infant and when pregnant or breastfeeding. They wreak havoc on the gut garden, destroying good bacteria with the bad, decreasing bacterial diversity and even creating a leaky gut and mood disorders.
Foods containing antibiotics can be assumed to have the same effect. Avoid conventional meats and dairy and instead look for products labeled organic – federally regulated to only come from animals never given antibiotics.
You may have heard of the so-called Hygiene Hypothesis that speculates children raised in overly sterile, germ-free environments develop hypersensitive immune systems. Though it may sound counter-intuitive (and gross), exposing infants in their first year of development to pets, household germs, microbes found in soil, rodent dander and roach allergens appears to lay foundations for a robust immune system, lowering risk of asthma and allergies, according to research from Johns Hopkins.
However, after the first year, the protective effects of exposure to dander, germs and droppings disappear. Playing in the dirt, on the other hand, seems to improve gut health no matter what age you are, so don’t be afraid to be a little dirty!
Don’t be too quick to wean off breast milk and introduce formula or solid food. Colonization and proliferation of an infant’s microbiota can be distressed when exclusive human-milk feeding is stopped. Formula especially incorporated into the diet while breastfeeding can undesirably alter the structure of baby’s gut.
Skin to skin contact, especially right after birth (even for preemies), exposes the newborn to the mother’s bacteria, creating a more diverse gut garden.
Kangaroo Mother Care – basically oodles of naked baby skin on skin exposure several hours a day – has a myriad of additional benefits for baby’s overall health. For example, breastfeeding maybe easier as it aids baby to seek out and latch on to mom’s nipple, reducing soreness.
Studies suggest that babies deprived of skin contact can contribute to mood issues like depression and learning disabilities later in life.
Obviously diet is top on the list of effectors to the intestinal microbiome. Sugar and processed, chemicalized, artificial foods don’t just upset gut equilibrium but can lead to leaky gut, IBS and other digestive issues you don’t want.
Eat an organic whole food diet rich in nutrient dense foods like vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats.
Steer clear of GMOs, artificial sweeteners, ibuprofen/NSAIDs, preservatives like TBHQ, etc.
Eat and drink an abundance of superfoods like algae, seaweed, aloe vera, and cacao.
Get plenty of probiotics and fermented foods like kefir and sauerkraut as well as prebiotics like tubers and alliums.
The healthier your gut flora while pregnant and breastfeeding, the healthier your baby’s constitution – establishing their health now and for the rest of their life.

https://foodbabe.com/buffalo-cauliflower-bites-perfect-healthy-appetizer/,Buffalo Cauliflower Bites: The Perfect Healthy Appetizer,"There’s a vegetarian restaurant here in Charlotte called Fern that makes ah-maze-ing buffalo cauliflower. Every time I go there, I have to order it, they are just mouthwateringly good. I love re-creating my favorite restaurant foods at home so I asked my team if they were up to the challenge and that’s how these homemade Buffalo Cauliflower Bites were born… We tested and tested, and finally came up with something very close!  These make a great alternative to buffalo chicken wings, and I think you’ll be surprised at how hearty and delicious cauliflower can taste. Unlike buffalo wings that are almost always from factory farm chicken and packed with artificial ingredients, these are actually HEALTHY and packed with fiber and nutrients… yeah! Eat a few of these and you’ll instantly zap away cravings for processed junk food filled with MSG and added sugar. This recipe (of course!) has no MSG and is free of junky ingredients.



Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees and chopping up one head of cauliflower into florets. You don’t want the florets to be too small, just good bite-sized pieces. Wash the florets well in filtered water.
In a large bowl, stir together half a cup of almond flour, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Whisk in half a cup (plus two tablespoons) of either almond milk or water, and a dash of hot sauce. Mix well…

Add the cauliflower florets to the bowl and dredge them in the almond flour mix until they are really well coated…

Grease a baking sheet lightly with coconut or avocado oil and spread the cauliflower out onto the pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.

Now is a good time to mix up the buffalo sauce. Whisk together 1/4 cup of hot sauce, a couple tablespoons of white vinegar and a pinch of paprika.
To make the yogurt dill topping, just mix half a cup of plain yogurt with one tablespoon of fresh dill and lemon juice. You can also use yogurt made from coconut or almond milk to keep it vegan! Stir in a pinch of salt and pepper.
Dice up some crunchy toppings too – I like carrots, celery, and some fresh parsley…

After they’ve cooked for 15 minutes, pull the pan out of the oven and pour that buffalo sauce all over the cauliflower. Give it a good toss, so it is evenly covered in the sauce. Put it back in the oven to bake for 5 minutes…

Your house should be smelling really good right about now! Pull the buffalo cauliflower out of the oven and carefully place them on a large plate or platter. Drizzle the yogurt dill sauce over the cauliflower and sprinkle with your toppings. Dig in… Yum!


Serve these Buffalo Cauliflower Bites next time you are having a party or watching a big game, they’d be great for all the big games coming up! For more healthy, organic, and non-GMO party food recipes, check out my favorite party recipes here.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/bojangles-chicken-n-biscuits-whistleblower-sends-us-never-released-ingredients/,Bojangles’ Chicken ‘n Biscuits Whistleblower Sends Us Never Before Released Ingredients.,"It’s absolutely appalling to me that we have been asking the restaurant chain Bojangles’ Famous Chicken ‘n Biscuits for their ingredients for over a year, and they refuse to provide any information to us. They have over 600 restaurants and no one has a clue what they are eating. Bojangles’ serves food in some of our schools and won’t even tell the parents or administrators what is in their food, which is just unacceptable.
Thousands of you signed this petition asking Bojangles’ to be transparent about their ingredients and to stop using chicken raised on routine antibiotics. Last week, I joined arms with consumer advocacy group U.S. PIRG to deliver our combined petition signatures totaling more that 12,000 to Bojangles’ headquarters in Charlotte. Although we gave Bojangles’ notice that we would be arriving and requested to set up a meeting, Bojangles’ refused to open the door when we arrived, and refused to make any communication with us in person. The following day, they sent us an email and told the press that “conversations with our protein suppliers leave us confident that tremendous progress is being made toward eliminating their use of antibiotics important to human medicine by 2020.”
This is not a strong commitment. Bojangles needs to publish a strong policy on their website to show that they intend to take action.

They anonymously sent me complete ingredient lists for many of Bojangles’ most popular menu items…. their cajun chicken, their fries, their mac n’ cheese… and when you see what’s in their “made from scratch” biscuits you’ll be mad. I don’t know anyone using the very controversial additive TBHQ in their homemade biscuits!

I contacted Bojangles’ corporate by email immediately after receiving this list of ingredients and asked them to confirm its authenticity. This is how they replied…
“Unfortunately, I am unable to verify the accuracy of the ingredient information I was sent yesterday. Like most restaurant companies, Bojangles’ does not disclose its ingredients for competitive reasons, but complies fully with all related laws and regulations.”
“Any alleged disclosure of the ingredients in our food by unauthorized third parties should be viewed with tremendous skepticism, and may be in violation of the law.”
~ Brian Little, Bojangles’ Corporate Communications Director, February 21, 2017
Most fast food chains do publish their ingredients online for the public and there is no reason for Bojangles’ to not do the same. KFC, McDonald’s, Chick-Fil-A, Burger King, Wendy’s, Jack In The Box, Taco Bell, Subway, Starbucks, Panera Bread, Chipotle, Dunkin Donuts, Pizza Hut, Papa John’s, Domino’s, Carl’s Jr. and Arby’s all publish their ingredients online for the public. Why does Bojangles’ think they are any different? This is the kind of transparency that consumers expect.
There are a growing number of consumers who seek out ingredient information because we are concerned about food additives and their relation to health, or have other allergies and food sensitivities that are not provided on their allergen statement.
All of Bojangles’ competitors release ingredients when asked – and it surely seems bizarre that Bojangles’ refuses to release even basic details about what is in their food – and won’t confirm or deny whether the whistleblower’s ingredient list is accurate.
I really appreciate this whistleblower’s incredible courage to reach out. Bojangles’ gives the impression they use better and more authentic ingredients than other chicken restaurants like KFC, but when you see what this whistleblower says they are putting into their food, I think you’ll be surprised.






The whistleblower let us know that those aren’t even made with real blueberries! They are artificially colored pellets!
Partially Hydrogenated Oils (Artificial Trans Fat): The FDA finally banned “partially hydrogenated oils” from our food and companies have until June 2018 to comply. This is a VERY long time coming – because the consumption of artificial trans fat has been strongly correlated an increased risk of heart disease for quite some time and hundreds of processed foods contain this ingredient. The Institute of Medicine says that trans fats have “no known health benefit” and there is no safe level to eat. No safe level! It’s sad that some companies continue to use this harmful ingredient. Listed in: Grilled Chicken Breast, Biscuits, Dirty Rice, Brown Gravy, Mac n’ Cheese, Pork Chop
Cottonseed Oil: This oil is made from a byproduct of the industrial waste from the cotton farming industry, which isn’t a food crop. Despite being one of the most prevalent GMO crops (designed to produce an insecticide), cotton crops still require an intense application of agricultural chemicals and that’s why cotton has been called the “World’s Dirtiest Crop”. Residues from these pesticides can remain in cottonseed oil according to data collected by the FAO/WHO Joint Meetings on Pesticides Residues in Food. If that isn’t bad enough, to extract the oil the cottonseeds are subjected to intensive chemical refining with toxic hexane, bleach, and deodorizers. Listed in: Fries, Grilled Chicken Breast, Biscuits, Brown Gravy, Pork Chop, Fries, Dirty Rice, Cinnamon Pecan Twist, Sweet Potato Fried Pie, Liquid Margarine
TBHQ: This synthetic preservative has been linked to vision disturbances, liver enlargement, childhood behavioral problems, stomach cancer, and most recently, to the rise in food allergies. It’s also banned for use in food in other countries including Japan, and is on the Center For Science in The Public Interest’s list as one of the worst food additives to be avoided. Listed in: Biscuits, Mac n’ Cheese
MSG & Hidden MSG: Besides the additive monosodium glutamate (MSG), the food industry sneaks in other additives – yeast extract and hydrolyzed proteins – that contain free glutamic acid, which is the main component of MSG. These “hidden MSG” additives are purely used to make you crave their food and eat more than you should, and are excitotoxins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Listed in: Fries, Dirty Rice, Brown Gravy, White Gravy, Ranch Dressing, Southern Style Chicken Filet, Homestyle Tenders
Caramel Color: There are 4 different types of caramel color used by the food industry and this Bojangles’ ingredient list does not specify which one they may use. Class IV caramel color is the one most commonly used by the food industry. Class IV caramel color is made from ammonia and contains the byproduct 4-MEI, a known cancer risk. Listed in: Fries, Southern Style Chicken Filet, Dirty Rice, Brown Gravy, White Gravy, Honey Mustard Sauce
BHA: This preservative is on EWG’s Dirty Dozen List of Food Additives to avoid and is also banned in other countries. BHA has been shown to be an endocrine disruptor which is also believed to be a carcinogen, causing tumors in animal studies. Listed in: Sausage Patty, Brown Gravy
Monoglycerides and Diglycerides: This emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing – including partially hydrogenated canola and soybean oils – which contain the same artificial trans fat that is detrimental to our heart health. Listed in: Flour Tortilla (Wraps), Pork Chop, Liquid Margarine, Mac n’ Cheese, Cinnamon Pecan Twist
Artificial Color: The “processed cheese” listed in Bojangles’ Mac n’ Cheese says it contains “artificial color”, but doesn’t specify which specific color is used. At this point I can only presume it is the same artificial yellow dyes that Kraft used to use in their Mac n’ Cheese which is linked to behavioral problems in children and requires a warning label in Europe. Listed in: Mac n’ Cheese
Soybean Oil: One of the most unhealthy oils out there which increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. It’s almost always made from GMO soybeans. When researchers tested GMO soybeans they found that they contain high levels of residues from the herbicide glyphosate (Monsanto’s Roundup) compared to non-GMO soybeans. This is a huge issue, as glyphosate has been linked to cancer and other diseases in many studies – so this is not something I want to be eating and why I avoid GMOs like the plague. Listed in: Biscuits, Fries, Brown Gravy, Grilled Chicken Breast, Pork Chop, Fries, Flour Tortilla (Wraps), Mac n’ Cheese, Liquid Margarine, Cinnamon Pecan Twist, Sweet Potato Fried Pie, Ranch Dressing
Sodium Phosphate: This preservative is so commonly used that if you eat processed food, you likely eat it daily. That doesn’t mean it’s safe. When you eat phosphate additives often, it can lead to excessive levels of phosphate in the blood and puts you at risk of chronic kidney disease, increased mortality, heart disease, and accelerated aging. The EWG also warns that sodium phosphate is an additive to avoid. Listed in: Grilled Chicken Breast, Mac n’ Cheese, Pork Chop
Natural or Artificial Flavors: Any time you see flavors on an ingredient list be aware that you don’t really know what you are eating. According to the EWG, every flavor has their own secret list of up to 100 ingredients, including “synthetic chemicals such as the solvent propylene glycol or the preservative BHA” as well as GMO-derived ingredients. Flavors can also include excitotoxins like MSG that cause your taste buds to experience irresistibility when it comes to food. Listed in: Brown Gravy, White Gravy, Southern Style Chicken Filet, Grilled Chicken Breast, Homestyle Tenders, Mac n’ Cheese, Pork Chop, Liquid Margarine, Cinnamon Pecan Twist, Scrambled Egg, Ranch Dressing, Honey Mustard Sauce
Cellulose:  Ground breaking research links this additive to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. Listed in: Flour Tortillas (Wraps)
Dextrose or Corn Syrup: These heavily processed forms of sugar are typically made from GMO corn that produces its own insecticide. Listed in: Brown Gravy, Southern Style Chicken Filet, Grilled Chicken Breast, Chicken Supremes, Pork Chop, Fries, Cinnamon Pecan Twist, Sweet Potato Fried Pie, Honey Mustard Sauce
Methyl and Propyl Parabens: These preservatives are endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems. EWG also includes propyl paraben on their Dirty Dozen Guide to Food Additives to avoid. Listed in: Sweet Potato Fried Pie
Bojangles’ continues to source their chicken from farms who routinely feed their animals antibiotics. Low-level doses of antibiotics are routinely fed to farm animals who are not sick to promote growth and prevent disease. When animals are constantly fed low levels of antibiotics, they become a breeding ground for superbugs (aka antibiotic-resistant bacteria) which are spreading to humans. Antibiotics are becoming far less effective, and some infections that were previously treated easily are now difficult or impossible to treat.
This issue hits home for me personally as my dad was once infected with bacteria that was resistant to antibiotics and very hard to treat. I don’t want my daughter to grow up in a world where antibiotics are no longer effective at treating simple infections, and that prospect is quickly becoming a reality. I’m sure many of you can relate to these fears.
Until Bojangles’ changes their ways, the most effective thing we can do is vote with our dollars by not eating there and choosing to spend our money elsewhere. When we vote with our dollars we not only help strengthen the companies that are doing the right thing by supplying healthy products and sustainably grown food, but we also send a clear message of disapproval to those companies who are putting harmful products into the marketplace. By sending a clear message of what we want, we are actively shaping the world around us.


Consider further action:

February 21, 2017 – Petition Delivery At Bojangles’ With U.S. PIRG

Bojangles’ may not want to change right now, but if they receive enough consumer pressure to change – I know they will like so many other companies have! When we work together, we are very powerful.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/do-you-trust-snopes-you-wont-after-reading-how-they-work-with-monsanto-operatives/,Do You Trust Snopes? You Won’t After Reading This.,"The big players in the GMO and agrochemical industry – Monsanto, Bayer, Dow, Syngenta, DuPont – are engaging in an extensive public relations, advertising, lobbying and political campaigning to make sure that genetically engineered crops (GMOs), and the chemical pesticides they require, continue to proliferate in the U.S.
To improve their public image, they are attempting to manipulate everything we see and hear about GMO crops and pesticides in the media and on TV, the internet and print articles – using propaganda-laden commercials, “mommy-blogger” articles, farmer endorsements, hired operatives to change Wikipedia, and front group websites. The biotech industry is feeling threatened, and their profits hang in the balance. They are trying to silence the truth!
A lot of people trust the website Snopes.com and use it to fact-check things they hear on the internet. For no reason whatsoever, this mom-and-pop website has been put on a pedestal as if they are the be-all and end-all of truth on the internet.
Facebook recently teamed up with Snopes, allowing them become an arbitrator of fake news circulating on their network, essentially elevating them as an authoritative source of information. I find this development alarming on many levels:


Monsanto has made BILLIONS off of the weedkiller Roundup (aka glyphosate) along with their Roundup-Ready GMO seeds, but sales have been plummeting since the truth about this toxic product is coming out. They are doing everything they can to keep those profits coming in!


Did the facts really change? Why would they call this information FALSE?
It’s as if Monsanto edited it themselves and sent it off to Snopes for publication. Entire sentences and paragraphs were removed that were hurtful to Monsanto. Important data was removed entirely. The wording was changed to make the findings of an independent FDA-registered laboratory seem less scientific or credible…

The data about how Cheerios and Stacy’s Pita Chips were found to have MORE glyphosate than the level permitted by the U.S. government in drinking water (700 ppb) was completely removed! Apparently Snopes believes it’s not factual or important to mention that some foods were found to have more weedkiller in them than even our lax regulations allow…


In this first revision, Snopes makes a huge mistake in stating that the World Health Organization’s International Agency For Research on Cancer’s (IARC) finding that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic to humans was “overturned in March 2016”, which is NOT TRUE…

IARC’s 2015 assessment has NOT been overturned, this is just what Monsanto dreams would happen. In reality, the team of international independent cancer scientists at IARC who made the finding that glyphosate “probably causes cancer in humans” are defending their decision, while being attacked by Monsanto with their lobbying group attempting to cut off IARC’s funding. The 17 independent scientists at IARC came to an unanimous decision that isn’t muddled by industry ties, and Monsanto is trying to shut them up.
The subsequent 2016 Joint FAO-WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) is not reliable as the scientists on the panel have a giant conflict of interest in working with ILSI Europe, a group funded by Monsanto, CropLife, and big food companies, along with a board of trustees comprised of industry execs from Monsanto, Syngenta, DuPont, Nestle and others. Snopes is WRONG to say their finding is the “current consensus amongst the world’s regulatory agencies”. That’s the industry-funded view!
A large body of peer reviewed research links glyphosate to cancer, reproductive problems, liver, kidney and skin cell damage, antibiotic-resistance, and more – but Monsanto doesn’t want the world to know the truth. The industry has a long history of of concealing health risks about their products from the public.
“Historically, the same thing happened with tobacco, the same thing happened with asbestos, the same thing happened with arsenic. It’s not junk science.” ~ Aaron Blair, PhD, MPH, internationally renowned epidemiologist and the author of more than 450 scientific papers, who spent thirty years at the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Blair led the IARC panel.
Which just goes to show they don’t properly research the facts before publishing stories!


The FDA has been caught having closed-door meetings with industry representatives several times in the past. There is evidence that Monsanto met with the FDA specifically to discuss glyphosate residues in food in 2016:
“In April of this year, Monsanto’s international regulatory affairs manager Amelia Jackson-Gheissari emailed FDA asking to set up a time to talk about “enforcement of residue levels in the USA, particularly glyphosate.” ~ Huffington Post, September 2016

Monsanto also had secret talks with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about glyphosate and are trying to hide the documentation from the public.
“The plaintiffs’ attorneys say at least four specific documents they have obtained are clearly in the public interest and “illuminate that one of Monsanto’s chief business strategies is its secret and untoward influence on EPA.” – Huffington Post, January 2017
Likewise, the industry group CropLife (which represents Monsanto and agrochemical companies) tried to stop the EPA from convening their scientific panel to review the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate. Read their August 24, 2016 letter to the EPA here. (The meeting took place in December, and the EPA’s findings have not yet been made public.)
Yet, my post was called “unsubstantiated”…


Advertisements on Snopes website for Monsanto/Bayer:

It was brought to my attention that after Snopes first called our piece a “MIXTURE” of truth, Monsanto’s operative (aka Kevin Folta) swept in and started bullying the reporter at Snopes into changing his article to claim that the information we presented was “FALSE”.
Kevin Folta tweeted Snopes and their reporter (Alex Kasprak) multiple times, again, and again, and again, and again, until they agreed to listen to him…

He is NOT independent and works right along with Monsanto executives, industry consultants, and lobbyists to spread their propaganda…

In other words, this is how Monsanto quietly paid Kevin Folta to advocate for them…




Just as I had reported, Monsanto is scrambling to bury this story and Snopes is just one channel that they are using to make people believe that any story speaking negatively about Roundup and GMOs is false. This is a dirty fight and Monsanto’s propaganda is in full force. This Snopes piece is all marketing. Marketing for Monsanto!
Snopes response to Food Babe: “The change in rating was mainly the result of my narrowing the focus of the claim to the alleged conspiracy to suppress residue data. This was in response to criticism from ‘both sides’ about a lack of clarity my original approach took. The issue with the FDN study, of course, is that its methods have not been peer-reviewed or even made public, outside of the fact that the report states the tool was an LC-MS-MS in an FDA-certified lab… My approach is to take the totality of these data, which argues that at environmentally relevant concentrations there is no harm through diet, while allowing that debate still exists within the the scientific community. That remains my position.”
After all of this… Kevin Folta admits that the glyphosate tests that we reported on were 100% CORRECT…
That’s right. He contacted Anresco Laboratories and found that their testing was done 100% correctly and obtained honestly. In fact, in his podcast he admits he should have contacted them first. Yet Snopes still calls this report FALSE. Isn’t this ridiculous?
Read Anresco Laboratories test results here and the statement on the validity of their testing here.
If you have friends or family that use Snopes as a factual source of information, please share this post with them! This is how we cut the legs off of Monsanto’s propaganda machine. We need to expose who Snopes really is and what they stand for. The truth will set you free!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/create-safest-organic-natural-nursery-child/,"How To Create The Safest, Organic and Natural Nursery For Your Child","When I first became pregnant, I knew right away I wanted to create a safe environment and nursery for my baby. There was so much to research and it all was very overwhelming. Cribs, mattresses, clothes, diapers, toys, strollers, car seats – the list goes on and on and on!  I remember walking into Buy Buy Baby for the first time and walking right back out because it was too much to handle! But all my frustration quickly went away after I met the founder of Sprout San Francisco, a natural and organic children’s store in CA. Suzanne Price is a mother of two who has devoted her life researching toxic chemicals in children’s products and their effects on their bodies. When we met while I was on a business trip last year, we instantly hit it off. Her passion was contagious! Suzanne created Sprout to be a one-stop-shop for new parents who want to outfit their nursery with the safest and healthiest products. Sprout has done all the research for us and only stocks their store with products that get their seal of approval. I loved how I could walk in to their store and feel comfortable as a new mom who wants to do the very best for my baby, knowing that everything on the shelves is non-toxic and safe for my newborn.
Shopping at Sprout was SO FUN! I didn’t have to stress out researching every little thing myself! The staff made it so simple to outfit my entire nursery and set up a baby registry for my friends and family. I was so impressed with everything they did for me and Harley, that I asked Suzanne to share her top tips and recommendations for a safe, natural and organic nursery in this special guest post.
Also, to help all the other moms and dads out there, I partnered with Sprout to offer a 15% discount on your purchase when you use the code “FOODBABE” at checkout here.

These pictures were taken by Little Nest Portraits (highly recommend them!) during Harley’s one week old photo shoot. Still working on commissioning some low VOC art and picture frames for the walls, but Harley’s nursery is almost done!

At Sprout, we try to provide everything a family needs for a new baby in the healthiest and most natural way possible. We offer a gift registry so people can let their friends know what to buy them, an app to register on their iPhone, and a registry checklist so that parents can make sure they have not forgotten anything they might need. We even provide Healthy Baby Guides on our website that help parents to learn everything they should be looking out for in every category. However, I sometimes forget how overwhelming this can be to parents who are learning about all of it at once for the first time. I decided to break down the main things you need to make sure you have in order to bring your baby home, and what Sprout looks for in each category to make sure it is as healthy for your baby as possible.
Crib and Dresser / Changing Table: Try to find solid wood with low VOC paint. Most cheap cribs are made with particle board that’s stuck together using glue that emits formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Vani’s Skylar Crib is made in the USA using solid hardwoods (pictured above). You’ll also want a bookshelf to store all the adorable books and picture frames you’ll receive as gifts, as well as a comfortable place to change the baby, such as the top of a dresser with a secured organic changing pad.
Crib Mattress: This is the most important thing to buy organic. Traditional mattresses are made of foam that release particulars into the air (VOCs) that are not good for your baby’s lungs. They are also sprayed with flame retardant chemicals, horrible for a baby to breath and known to cause lots of different health issues. Putting an organic mattress pad cover on a regular mattress does NOT solve the problem. But you should also have an organic mattress pad cover. Sprout sells a variety of organic mattresses. Vani chose Naturepedic (pictured above) and a fully organic co-sleeper here.
Crib Bedding: Since your baby will spend so much time lying on these sheets, it is important to have organic crib sheets. Consider trying a solid white sheet with a patterned crib skirt to add some decoration to the crib if you do not fall in love with any of the organic patterned sheets.
Clothing: You are going to get tons of clothing as gifts, and from everywhere, but you should definitely register for things you like. At the very newborn stage, it’s nice to have organic cotton touching your baby’s skin since it has been shown that pesticides can rub off of a finished garment. (Cotton is the most heavily pesticided crop in the country.) I would suggest registering for some layette sets like kimono tops (so they don’t have to be pulled over the head) and pants in organic cotton and let people buy you all the other cute fun outfits for the older sizes. The first few weeks the baby will basically be in a shirt or bodysuit and a swaddle all the time anyway.
Baby Carrier: Our favorite carriers are the adjustable, backpack-style Beco or the wrap-style Solly. Whichever you choose, prioritize organic, since it’s shocking how much the babies suck on the fabric and straps.
Baby Bath: Make absolutely sure that it is free of BPA, PVC, and phthalates. These are 3 terrible chemicals in plastics that will leach into warm water.
Car Seat: Many car seats are sprayed with toxic flame retardant chemicals. Find one that is GREENGUARD or OEKO-TEX® certified, or that promises it does not use any of the worst flame retardants, like Tris. The only infant seat we carry is one we have had tested and know to be free of Tris, the Nuna Pipa.
Toys: I always opt for wood or organic cotton over plastic. Phthalates in plastics were outlawed in toys for kids under 3 in 2009, yet nobody really knows this (so don’t take hand-me-downs) and from what I have heard, it is not really enforced, especially for products made overseas.
Glider / Rocker: A glider or rocker isn’t an absolute must-have, but many find it extremely helpful in those early days of nursing your baby in the middle of the night. Make sure to look for one that does not have foam sprayed with flame retardant chemicals. Our exclusive gliders do not have flame retardants or polyurethane foam. Vani has our Como Pure in her nursery (pictured above).
Rug: Many rugs are backed with formaldehyde emitting glue. Find a rug for your nursery made of natural fibers with no glue backing, so that your baby will be safe laying on it during tummy time.
Art: To finish off your nursery, add some cute artwork to walls to give the room a personal touch. Just make sure that anything with paint is low VOC. Vani used Natura by Benjamin Moore.
I think this is a good place to start and not get overwhelmed. Of course you can always call or come into one of our stores to ask as many questions you like of our knowledgeable sales team.
Good luck!
I know when you are expecting you have so many things to think about, so I hope this helps you out as much as it did me! And if you know someone who needs safe baby products, please share this post with them.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/five-minute-healthy-chocolate-mousse/,Five-Minute Healthy Chocolate Mousse,"It feels like the holidays just got over, but the Holiday Death Aisle is BACK…. and this time we are bombarded with store shelves filled with red, pink and white junk and pretty heart-shaped boxes filled with toxic chocolates by brands like Russell Stovers, Godiva, and Hallmark. Take a look at the ingredients in these Valentine’s Day chocolates below and you’ll quickly realize that they’re just selling cheap ingredients wrapped up in fancy-looking packages. Why would you give your Valentine a “gift” filled with heart-wrecking partially hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors derived from petroleum, nasty preservatives, artificial flavors, GMO oils, sugar from GMO Roundup-Ready sugar beets, and the absolute worst ingredients you can put in food? How do these companies keep getting away with this?

Unfortunately, our food system’s top priority is the bottom line so we need to pay attention to the ingredient label on every single product we buy. Chocolate can provide a daily dose of much needed antioxidants or it can be a chemistry experiment full of man-made artificial ingredients. I do not like supporting brands that try to trick me into buying questionable ingredients. Voting with your dollars is one of the only ways to voice disgust for the unhealthy chemicals in food, and it can also directly influence change by hitting the bottom line of the food companies that continue to sells us cheap, harmful, and potentially dangerous ingredients.
And, I don’t know about you… but when I’m presented with a box of chocolates it’s really hard for me to eat just one.. or two.. or three… I tend to really overindulge! That’s where this super simple and healthier chocolate treat comes in…
This Five-Minute Creamy Chocolate Mousse is one of the recipes included in the Maintaining Your Success After Detox Guide from my 7-Day Sugar Detox Program, which shows you the healthiest ways to enjoy sweets without sabotaging your health. Expecting to live without sweets and desserts for the rest of your life is just crazy, and no one would ever be successful trying to maintain a diet like that!
The key is to only choose treats that are both sweet and nutritious. That way you’ll satisfy your cravings but still get a dose of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Eventually you’ll develop a distaste for processed refined sugars and your desire for ultimate nutrition will become instinctive.
Nutrient-dense whole food sweeteners include:
Not only is this chocolate mousse lightning-QUICK to make, but it’s sweetened with a touch of maple syrup and the natural sweetness found in coconut and vanilla. When you top it with some high-fiber berries, such as raspberries or blackberries, you’ll help to slow the absorption of those natural sugars into the body – which is MUCH healthier than eating a few Valentine’s Day chocolates (and actually more delicious than those chemical-filled things anyway)!

You can buy coconut cream on its own, or what I typically do is purchase 1-2 cans of organic BPA-free coconut milk and scrape off the thick cream that has settled on top of the can.
Just throw these five ingredients in a good high-powered blender along with a handful of ice cubes and blend on high for a few minutes until nice and creamy. Adding a pinch of sea salt helps to bring out the sweetness and balances the flavor…

And voila!!! That’s it. In just five minutes, you’ve got a decadent, creamy, chocolatey dessert that will satisfy any chocolate craving without any nasty refined sugar or additives! I like to top mine with strawberries and cacao nibs, but you can use either or neither… whatever you prefer. A sprinkling of chopped raw nuts would be good too! Letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours helps thicken it up too if you like your mousse to be denser.


If you know anyone who is a chocolate fanatic and would love a recipe like this, please share this post with them! Let’s spread the word that we can still enjoy dessert without unhealthy processed ingredients!",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/favorite-organic-non-gmo-party-food/,My Favorite Organic Non-GMO Snacks and Party Food!,"I know many of you are watching sports these days where traditional Doritos, Lays and Ruffles are being served but you don’t have to eat those dirty processed chemical filled GMO snacks! There are so many new alternatives brands and organic versions available that you can bring. Although I don’t recommend packaged snacks often – and preach the gospel on whole real foods – if you are going to gather around and watch the big game you’ve gotta have some snacks, right?
Some other favorites:
One thing I love about these alternative snack brands, is that they do not contain MSG, an ingredient that keeps you going back for more and more and more. Which is why some of the GMO snack brands like Doritos are so addictive and have become “popular” as a result.

https://foodbabe.com/look-what-happens-when-you-resist-sweets-for-7-days-whoa/,Look What Happens When You Resist Sweets For 7 Days! Whoa!,"I don’t believe in using quick fixes and shady supplements to lose weight and feel my best. Instead, I strongly believe that by instilling healthy habits you can make a significant impact on your health in a very short amount of time.
On a personal level, there is one healthy habit that POWERFULLY changed the way I feel, helped me lose unwanted pounds for good, made my skin glow and improved my overall health. AND it was the #1 thing you wrote to me about when I asked you what you were struggling with to accomplish this year!
“I want to be able to resist all sweets, when they are in my face. I am a sugar addict. Can’t seem to resist even though I know that it will make me sick and fat, especially when I am feeling low or stressed.” – Debra
“I have a sweet tooth and have trouble staying consistent and steady on my path to success.” – Afshan
“I need help REALLY cutting out sugar. It is the hidden sugar that is problematic for me. I try to make most things my family eats from scratch but it is unrealistic all of the time. That’s it for me!” – Elizabeth
Asking you to eliminate every type of “sugar” from your diet is just crazy – any person trying to do this will fail in the long run. The key to this healthy habit is to still include sugar in your diet but get it in forms that your body can easily assimilate and from sources that also provide nutrients, minerals and vitamins your body will use.
If you develop this habit and practice it on a regular basis, you’ll be less likely to go overboard when presented and tempted with refined sugary desserts. Even more, you’ll naturally eat less sugar in the long run because your body is getting real nutrition from the food that hasn’t been chemically altered. Eventually… you’ll develop a distaste for refined sugar and your desire for ultimate nutrition will become intuitive. What a wonderful habit to develop and keep for life, no?
I’ve found this to be the fastest way to lose weight and get super healthy, but that is just scratching the surface. What added sugar does to your body is scandalous. That’s why I worked with my team to create an impactful and effective program – The Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox.

Since I came out with this program last year, the success stories keep coming in from people (some of which you’ll see below) who have dramatically improved their health and nixed their sugar cravings in just 7 days. I’m confident you can do this too. I’ve made it easy!
Check out all that’s included in the program here – the Quick Start Guide, the exclusive videos, the delicious recipes, the private forum – all designed to make your transformation a piece of cake!
You can start the detox anytime you’d like – next week, next month, next year. I don’t want you to miss this opportunity and your health deserves it.
Sign up for the Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox here – the entire Food Babe Team will be cheering you on in the forum!
We shared several success stories last summer, and now have a few more to share with you below… Are you next?

“I am feeling lean, energetic and so great! I am going to continue eating this way as it has spurred a weight loss that I’ve been struggling to ignite. I’m down almost 5 pounds, and paired with seeing a personal trainer I’m experiencing big changes already.
I know I will continue to make significant progress if I keep this up. The cruciferous detox salad is quite the meal; that salad alone has helped me drop weight overnight and reset my system.
I have been a follower of Vani / Food Babe for years now and have purchased meal plans and books in the past, as I love to know as much as possible about food & nutrition. This sugar detox has been the BEST plan yet for having an immediate and wonderful impact on my health!”
~ Diana
“I am 85 and my husband is 87 and we have both just completed our 7-Day Sugar Detox. At this age, we obviously don’t expect boundless energy and glowing skin but to date he has lost 5-lbs. and I have lost 2.5-lbs., although I have more to lose than he, proportionately.
As we age, we’ve found that things take much longer to work and this applies to diets as well as everything else. We have both noticed our desire for sweets has pretty well disappeared and I, in particular, have been addicted to sugar my entire life.
I find I have more control over my appetite, which is a change! My friends tell me I have lost weight and have expressed interest in the program.
Also, strangely enough, my arthritic hip seems to be much better. Instead of lying awake for hours during the night, I now get a full 8 hours sleep and it’s wonderful.”
~ Greta


“I think I can say that the Sugar Detox was a success! There are a few reasons I can say that. From a physical aspect not only have I lost a few pounds but my clothes are looser and my rings come off a lot easier. I have also noticed that my complexion seems smoother and clearer.
I have actually tamed the “sugar craving beast” in me! While in the middle of my detox week there was a party and I had to have the cake or face scrutiny (I wasn’t ready to explain to everyone why I was doing a “sugar detox program” yet). Not only did I NOT finish the whole thing, I didn’t really CARE to finish the whole thing. That is how I know I tamed the beast!
This program has changed the way I think about the processed baked goods. There are other healthier options out there. The Food Babe’s recipe collection has those options. I always seem to have the strongest craving for sweets after a meal, the Refrigerator Almond Fudge bars definitely satisfied that craving. I feel so empowered to have conquered the sugar demon that now I can tell everyone about it!
I am so happy to have discovered this program and this way of life. I appreciate all of the Food Babe’s hard work and I am grateful for all the resources. Thank you, Food Babe!”

https://foodbabe.com/craving-sugar-night-heres-stop/,Craving Sugar At Night? Here’s How To Stop!,"It takes time, but I try to read every single email you send me and when I get an email like this one below from Claire, it makes me want to help ASAP!
“I am SUCH a late night snacker… It comes to the point, where the cereal box is on my nightstand while I’m watching a movie when I could just be asleep. This obviously worsens when I drink alcohol. However, I don’t want to give up alcohol because that is not the lifestyle I’m after, rather I would like to cut down and also cut down the late night binges on unhealthy processed food since my days are usually full of whole foods that are good for me.” – Claire S.
I think nighttime sugar cravings are the absolute worst and I know many of you can relate! If you have ever tried to go “cold turkey” to simply stop eating sugar – and failed – don’t despair! While it can truly seem as if the odds are against us – there is hope! There are several strategies that I’ve used over the years to curb my own sugar cravings (I used to be a major candy ADDICT!) and hopefully these little tricks will help you too…
Sugary foods release endorphins that make you feel more relaxed and after you’ve had a long day sometimes it can be hard to refuse a sweet treat to “reward yourself” with that great feeling. The processed food industry knows how addictive sugar is, and carefully engineers their products to hit what they call “the bliss point” to make us crave their foods more and more. They even add sugar to salty foods – it’s reprehensible!


If it’s not there, you can’t eat it! But once you bring the bag of cookies into the house you have made it ten times harder to keep your cravings at bay. Willpower will not last, and sooner or later you will come home exhausted, stressed, and the first thing you will reach for are those cookies! Clear any sweets and processed food from your pantry and refrigerator and replace them with simple one-ingredient REAL FOOD snacks – apples, bananas, vegetable sticks, nuts, seeds, boiled eggs. Tell everyone in your family to not bring any sugary junk into the house either, so you won’t be tempted!
One of my all-time favorite rituals is drinking tea – especially at night! I drink hot tea almost every night before bed and it really relaxes me and takes away any cravings. I love mint, ginger, or spicy cinnamon teas, as these are amazing at blasting away sugar cravings. That’s because they are naturally sweet without the sugar, and warm and comforting.
Exercise releases feel good endorphins that can provide a similar “high” as a sugary or junk food treat can. Not only will you feel better about yourself and the decision you made to be active, but you are also creating new healthy habits by immediately inserting an activity when you feel a craving coming on. I love to take walks outside before the sun sets in the evening, right before dinner. I find that this is when some of my best ideas come to the surface and it really clears my head. Other outdoor activities like raking leaves and tending to a garden are great ideas as well!  When you’re spending time in the sun, the added Vitamin D will lift your mood and hopefully take away bad food cravings. So really make an effort to bundle up if necessary and make it outside every day. But if the weather is horrible or you can’t make it out, another good option is to pop in an exercise video at home and get those endorphins pumping!
When I don’t get enough sleep I want to eat everything in the house! I notice that I’m way more hungry throughout the day and my cravings are through the roof! So, do whatever you need to do to make sure that you’re sleeping enough each night. This will naturally boost serotonin levels, turn off the hunger hormones, and when your body has enough time to recharge you will probably find that your cravings are not as intense. Having a newborn in the house, this is definitely a tip I’ll be personally working on!
Sometimes just talking about your cravings with someone in the same situation is all you need to stay on track. If you know that someone is holding you accountable and rooting you on, it’s much easier to stick to your goals and be successful!
That’s why I built a support system like this into the Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox Program. As soon as you join here, you’ll be welcomed into our Private Forum with open arms, where you can connect with other members on the sugar detox. This is a place where we privately share our experiences without judgment – since a lot of us are all facing the same type of struggles and bad food cravings! We answer questions and share our success stories. When you surround yourself with people who share the same goals and help to keep you accountable, you will succeed.
This program provides the plan, the support, and the community you need to ditch refined sugar in a way that makes it practically impossible to fail! I’ll give you real life emergency strategies for when you feel like you can’t live without sugar and have crazy uncontrollable cravings – especially at those times when you are at work sitting at your desk and at night. You will receive detailed online guides and videos to walk you through the 7-Day Sugar Detox, along with all the personal support you need. You’ll know exactly what to eat, what not to eat and what to do after the detox is over.

https://foodbabe.com/birth-story-little-angel/,My Birth Story. Our Little Angel Is Here!,"Our little angel is here and we are so crazy in love. Meet Harley Diane, 6.5 pounds and 20 inches. Every time I look at her, my heart feels like it is going to explode! This is my birth story…


When I became pregnant back in April 2016, I knew right away I wanted to have a natural birth and my commitment became even stronger after talking to several experts, reading many books about child birth, taking a natural birth course and talking to my doctor & doula about the risks associated with some interventions and drugs. Hearing all my friends and family’s birth stories, as well as reading and watching many online, there was one big common theme – there are no two births that are the same and things don’t always go as planned! So I decided to go into all of this with a very easy going attitude and not get too worked up if things did not turn out the way I expected them to go. I said to myself “whatever happens, happens, as long as I have a healthy baby at the end, nothing else matters.” And I also repeated the mantra “My body was designed to do this” to prime my brain to stay focused on the goal.

One of the biggest reasons I wanted a natural birth was because I know how my body reacts to foreign substances and pharmaceutical drugs – I don’t feel good after taking them and often feel the bad side effects for weeks. Not only did I not want those substances to get to my newborn baby, but I wanted to have the fastest recovery possible after birth. I also have undergone two different abdominal surgeries in my lifetime and know the recovery is not for the faint of heart. These experiences have given me a very strong conviction to do what I can in my power to avoid medical interventions. Feeling the way I do now – a week later – I know I made the right decision for me to focus on a natural birth. I remain in awe that everything worked out the way I envisioned it to.
The month leading up to the birth, I started to get Braxton Hicks contractions and at first they didn’t hurt at all, and then suddenly on Christmas Eve (38 weeks) they began to hurt. The entire day on Christmas Eve, I was having contractions and even contracting at my brother’s Christmas Eve party that evening. It was nothing too painful at this point, but I for sure thought I would have a Christmas baby (and my family thought so too!). A doctor friend at the party even wanted me to go to the hospital to get checked but I didn’t go and eventually on Christmas Day all the contractions fizzled out.
When you hit your due date everyone in the world starts calling and texting you, wondering when you are going to give birth. This can be stressful if you let it… but after she didn’t come early during the holiday break, I became super patient leading up to her birthday. “Babies are born on their birthdays” is one of my affirmation cards that I read every night and this kept me focused on taking care of myself, staying calm and relaxed before birth, knowing that my baby would arrive when she was ready. The extra week, gave me time to continue organizing closets and cabinets throughout the house – which I am so glad to have done now!
I have been using acupuncture for years as preventative medicine, but when I became pregnant, I started to go to acupuncture almost every week. Not only did this help my pregnancy symptoms (just ask my best friend, who said I never complained during my pregnancy!) but it primed my body for the best birth possible. When I hit 39.5 weeks, I had 3 acupuncture treatments over the course of one week to get my body ready for big day. Acupuncture can help start labor if your baby is ready! After these treatments, I started a type of early labor on Tuesday and Wednesday – both nights I woke up at around 3am with painful contractions that hit every 20 mins or so but would tinker on and off throughout the day.
On Thursday, the day before 41 weeks, I saw my doctor and we did a quick safety ultrasound check just to make sure I still had enough amniotic fluid and to see if the baby was doing well in there. As long as everything looked good, she was going to just let me keep going in my late pregnancy until the baby was ready. This was very exciting – I hadn’t seen my baby for over 24 weeks! Everything turned out perfectly! She also checked my cervix and reported that I was 3 cm dilated and 75% effaced, all that early labor was working! This put me at so much ease and I was relaxed enough to go to the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art that afternoon (even though I was still contracting!) to walk around and keep my body moving. We bought the baby an art book to remember the moment and eventually my contractions fizzled out again to relax a bit for dinner.

41 weeks pregnant! Last belly shot before the hospital…
The big day…
After 2 nights of no sleep, I finally went into REAL labor late Thursday night – actually at about 2:30am Friday morning. The contractions had sped up significantly to every 8-10 minutes all night long. At about 5:30am I texted my doula and she wanted me to keep her posted on progress and we kept in touch throughout the morning. I labored at home finding any position to get me through – hands and knees and bending over with my arms on a wall were the best positions. At around noon, I knew it was time for my doula to come over, it was getting intense and I was having contractions every 5 minutes.
For those of you who have never given birth or experienced contractions, it feels like the worst stomach cramp you have ever experienced, and like a wave of sensation with a strong peak that you absolutely have to breathe to get through if you want to be able to handle the pain. It takes all of your focus and concentration during the contraction just to get to the next one. The key is to relax in between the contractions as much as possible so you can get through the next one.
I had been in my bedroom all morning by the time my doula arrived. She got me up out of bed and said “take me on a tour of your house” and so we went through and walked my entire house – going up and down the stairs in my house, I contracted on each wall! I had to hold on to her or the wall and bend down for every contraction. After the tour, I thought it would be a good time to eat something, my doula suggested soup and my husband warmed me up some butternut squash soup I had made for our freezer meals after the baby was born. I ate that with some crackers and water. It was so good! I was starving! Then it was finally time for the tub. This was my doula’s “last resort” before getting to the hospital, getting from the stage of early labor to active labor so I would not be in the hospital for too long before giving birth.
According to many natural birth experts, if you get to the hospital too early, there is more time for interventions, so the key is to get there at just the right time to avoid that. My doula was very experienced in knowing when to go and without her, I probably would have left earlier… my husband was definitely getting antsy and a bit nervous at this point!
I had a ginger blackberry popsicle in the bath – it was delicious, but I couldn’t finish it – the contractions were coming too strong! The bath helped me get through them until about 5:00pm, and then I started feeling an intense amount of pelvic pressure that made me want to push.
When my doula witnessed this, she knew it was time to head to the hospital. My husband put the last minute things in the car, handed me my labor robe and nightgown to wear and walked me down the stairs to the car. I was worried about the car ride to the hospital, because even though we were close to the hospital, I was contracting every two minutes. I didn’t want to get out of the bath either because it was such an amazing feeling and the soothing warmth of the water was helping so much with the intense contractions.
Once I got to the hospital, I completed a cervical exam (my least favorite thing to do while being pregnant!) – I was at 6 cm and a midwife had to double check it because they thought I had broke my water already too. My doula and I were stunned that they said that I broke it because I didn’t feel anything at all! That same day, I had lost my mucus plug however, which I had been looking forward to seeing as a sign of labor. It was one of those things I was looking for every time I used the bathroom but never found prior to that day. As soon as we got settled into the delivery room, one of my first contractions broke my water. It was the loudest pop I’d ever heard inside my body and it brought on a flood of emotions (no pun intended!). It still baffles me that they thought I had already broke it!
My doula whispered to me, things are about to speed up, so let’s get the tub ready. The tub in the delivery room had these magical massaging jets that I didn’t have at home and I was really excited about that. My contractions were coming really fast and very hard in the tub. So hard that the jets no longer felt good and after a few minutes, I begged and screamed to turn the jets off. It got so hot, I thought I was going to melt. Thank goodness for the cooler of coconut water my husband brought to the delivery room – I think I drank about 4 bottles within just a few hours. And this whole time, my sweet nurse was trying to monitor the baby’s heart beat which for some reason really made me uncomfortable, the tiny bit of pressure from the hand held doppler on my pelvis was driving me nuts!
I screamed like an animal for a couple of hours (my throat hurt so bad the next day – so remember to bring some organic throat drops with you mamas!). Giving birth is such a primal experience, and I never thought I would hear the sounds that would come out of my mouth. I was in full gorilla ape mode! Leading up to my birth, I thought I would be a quiet birther but heck no! Making the animal sounds really helped me get through the intensity.
My doctor, who is a huge advocate for natural birth and very supportive of my birth plan, arrived at the scene. I was SO HAPPY to see her. I was progressing so fast and when I got out of the tub, I couldn’t believe it – I was fully dilated and ready to push about 8:45pm.
I got back to the delivery bed and tried to find some positions that would be the best to push in. As many mama’s know, laying on your back is not really the most comfortable position during contractions or pushing, and my birth team had some other tricks up their sleeve. It ended up being that a squat bar and laying on my side were what worked best for me. So I used both of those positions throughout my pushing.
At this point, I had been laboring for about 18 hours and I was tired! But the pain was not that bad, nothing worse than what I had already experienced up until that point.
At first it took me awhile to get a hang of pushing. I had been breathing heavily through contractions, and my birth team really wanted me to push through contractions while holding my breath – the opposite of what I had been doing all day long! That was difficult for me and really stressed out my body. I felt intense pain on my chest, holding my breath and almost like I was drowning from the lack of oxygen!
The final pushes were really athletic and it took everything in me to focus – I felt the ring of fire, but it wasn’t as bad as I expected. When she finally came out, I heard the doctor do something (but didn’t really know what was happening at the time because I couldn’t believe I just pushed her out…) and then she checked to see if I tore, and said everything looked great – no tears to stitch!
I was so stunned and so in awe when my daughter was born… the sense of accomplishment… the excitement of seeing her for the first time… everything that you dream about. It is so magical and the feeling of relief is so instant that everything you did up until that point becomes a BILLION times worth it!
For every birth video I had seen since I became pregnant, I cried at the end when the baby was born. Even reading a birth story, I would cry at the end. But when my own baby came, I didn’t cry. I was just so happy and I felt my heart exploding with love! I will never ever be able to equate giving birth to anything else I’ve ever accomplished in my life. It is definitely my greatest achievement and was so thankful everything went as I had hoped.

After the birth, we waited until the cord stopped pulsating and my husband cut the cord, I got to spend a lot of time skin to skin with my baby and breastfeeding, but the baby nurse did take her away to weigh her, measure her, clean out her nasal passages and mouth and take a blood sample to test her blood sugar (which in hindsight – I wish I would have waited for). It felt like an eternity those few minutes she was out of my arms!
The next morning, I really just wanted to take my baby in my arms and say peace out, but I had to stay to monitor my blood pressure that was high after birth. Thankfully it has been treated naturally since leaving the hospital and is back down. They did prescribe me some pharmaceuticals for high blood pressure to take at home before I left (which I didn’t end up taking). I know my body, and knew it would be back to normal in a flash, if I rested and allowed my body recover from the lack of sleep and exhaustion! I also had a wonderful at home acupuncture treatment about 5 days later that worked like a miracle for my blood pressure and sore muscles.
When my doula came over for a postpartum visit, I learned that my baby was born with the cord wrapped around her neck, this is what I heard my doctor taking care of, but didn’t see it when she was coming out. My doctor gently looped the cord back over her head before the rest of her body came out, and the cord was long enough that it didn’t pose any danger during the delivery, thank God! It was kinda scary learning about this days later, but it is a really very common thing to happen. It’s amazing that a safe natural birth is still possible in circumstances like this!
I know I couldn’t have achieved a natural child birth without the coaching of a doula, a supportive doctor, and a very positive and helpful nurse – I had the A Team for sure! Giving birth is like a marathon. At a marathon, at every water stop along the way, you have people cheering you on with motivational signs and encouraging you to finish. You need the same support while giving birth because there are so many times you think to yourself that you can’t do it or you’re not sure if it is possible or if something will go wrong and you are tired! You need that positive energy in the room to get you through it. There were a few moments during labor where I asked the team “can I do this?” and they would say “yes, you can do this”, and that really motivated me. Taking drugs, however, did not enter my mind once! I credit this to my daily practice of birth affirmation cards leading up to the birth.
There were times when I thought I will never, ever, ever have another child while I was going through the really tough parts of labor (the point where my water broke to the point where I started pushing), but that thought went 100% out the window after meeting my baby and the high that I felt of accomplishing my goal of a natural childbirth. I will take 10 babies please!!!! Mr. Food Babe, are you ready? haha.
I want to thank my magical birth team: my dear husband who was 100% supportive of my decision to go natural and even more incredible now as a new Dad, all of the women in my life that shared their advice, birth stories and wisdom with me, Genevieve from Mama Natural for her amazing birth course and affirmation cards, Megan from Detoxinista, Latham Thomas from Mama Glow, my sister-in-law Judy who has given natural birth twice!, my trainers at Hilliard Studio Method and K.O. Fitness who kept me in tip top shape all the way to 40 weeks, Charlotte OB/GYN, Carolina Medical Center Maternity Center, my doula Melissa Fehr, my acupuncturist and prenatal massage therapist.
I’ll be sharing much more about my pregnancy and motherhood in future posts to come, until then… if you know someone who is pregnant, a mom or wants some inspiration for a natural child birth, please share this post with them and feel free to ask any questions in the comments below! I want to help as many mamas as possible achieve a natural birth, if that is what they want to do.
Thank you for all the sweet comments and well wishes you sent this week on social media when I announced our daughter’s birth. I love this community so much and it brings me so much joy to share this very personal story with you.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/the-10-reasons-you-need-a-sugar-detox-right-now/,10 Reasons You Need A Sugar Detox Right Now,"One of the most insidious ways the food industry poisons us is by dousing all sorts of foods with “added sugar.” By “added sugar,” I’m talking about any sweetener that doesn’t occur naturally in a food. It may seem innocent, but what added sugar does to the body is scandalous.
Added sugar is one of the biggest perpetrators of our current health crisis, and can be implicated in many cases of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer – but its detrimental effects can take years to surface. It’s the hidden link to so much pain and suffering.
The food industry knows that sugar is addicting and that sugar makes heavily processed foods taste good, so that’s why they have added it to so many foods that you’d never imagine that it would be in – salad dressings, crackers, soups, pasta sauces… the list goes on. Sugar is in practically every packaged food in the store and at restaurants.
It’s so bad now that the average American consumes about THREE POUNDS of sugar every single week in their regular diet. This is one food additive that we all should be paying more attention to when reading ingredient lists.
Most recently, an industry front group funded by Coca-Cola, General Mills, Hershey’s, Kellogg’s, Kraft Foods and Monsanto was exposed for commissioning a scientific review that attacked health advice to eat less sugar. Perpetuating false nutrition and health information for the sole purpose of profits is absolutely appalling! These very companies are all big offenders of adding sugar to their products. Should we all just keep eating sugar-laden foods because the junk food industry says it’s okay? Of course not, and it’s time we all see right through this shady paid-for “science”.


Sugar makes you gain weight by adding empty calories to your diet and jacking up your blood sugar – two processes that form excess body fat. It also screws with your appetite. According to Dr. Mark Hyman, sugar is different from other calories, “It scrambles all your normal appetite controls…driving your metabolism to convert it into lethal belly fat.” Ditching sugar is one of the fastest and most effective ways to lose weight!
Sugar destroys your skin and makes your skin wrinkle. In a process called glycation, sugar molecules attach to collagen and elastin, two proteins that keep skin looking young, and create Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs). AGEs weaken your skin’s support structure and lead to lines and wrinkles.
An influx of sugar in the diet increases levels of inflammatory messengers called cytokines. Refined sugars processed from cane, corn, or beets, such as table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are the baddest of the bad. These sugars have been chemically stripped of their minerals, so when you indulge in these sugars, you get no nutrition and your body becomes more acidic. As these sugars are devoid of minerals, they are acid-forming causing more inflammation. When your body stays in a state of inflammation, you are at a greater risk of developing various chronic diseases ranging from cancer, to heart disease, to digestive disorders.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease now affects approximately 90 million Americans (17% are children!) and sugar is to blame. Excessive sugar intake causes the liver to produce fat in a process called lipogenesis. This can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (in which your liver fills with fat), putting you at risk for chronic diseases.
Continually exposing your teeth to sugary foods and drinks erodes away your teeth. The bacteria that is naturally in your mouth feeds off of sugars in your diet, producing acids that attack the enamel on your teeth and demineralizes them, eventually leading to cavities and tooth loss.
After you break the cycle of endless sugar consumption, you will no longer feel like you are living on an energy-sucking rollercoaster. Added sugar makes your blood sugar go sky-high – a reaction followed immediately by plummeting blood sugar. That crash and burn triggers feelings of irritability, depression, and leaves you exhausted until you get your next sugar fix.
A study conducted by the University of New South Wales concluded chronic sugar intake triggers changes to hippocampus the area of the brain, which is important for both memory and stress. Another UCLA study found a high sugar diet sabotages learning and memory ability. A 2012 Mayo Clinic study found that people who eat a lot of sugar have a much higher chance of cognitive decline as they age.
Sugar intake weakens your immune system, so you’re at a greater risk of coming down with something. Increased insulin levels from consuming sugar also tells the body to release cortisol – a hormone that further weakens your immunity.
A 2015 scientific review in Mayo Clinic Proceedings warns that refined sugar in the diet is a principal driver of heart disease. It’s been shown that those who eat high sugar diets are up to 400% more likely to have a heart attack! It’s now come to light that back in the 1960’s the sugar industry paid leading scientists to discredit claims about sugar and heart disease and to paint fat as the enemy instead. That is when the low-fat craze began, causing most people to correlate heart disease with excessive fat consumption. This belief perpetuated on for decades and unfortunately continues today. These dirty tactics played by the industry have literally destroyed the health of millions, and I’m so thankful that the truth about sugar and its role in heart disease is getting out!
If you develop this habit to stay away from added sugar and practice it on a regular basis, you’ll be less likely to go overboard when presented and tempted with refined sugar desserts. Even more, you’ll naturally eat less sugar in the long run because your body is getting real nutrition from food that hasn’t been chemically altered. Eventually, you’ll develop a distaste for refined sugar and your desire for ultimate nutrition will become instinctive. What a wonderful habit to develop and keep for life!
A sugar detox is the best way to finally stop sugar cravings dead in their tracks and kick refined sugar from your life for good! That’s why I worked with my team to create an impactful and effective program – The Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox

https://foodbabe.com/cilantro-rice/,Light & Delicious Cilantro Rice (or Quinoa!) Salad,"This Cilantro Basmati Rice Salad is zesty, really FRESH, and compliments almost any meal! It also happens to be one of the simplest recipes in the world. It’s just as easy as those boxes of Rice-a-Roni, but without the nasty additives – and it tastes a million times better too. Even if you are a beginner cook, this is a meal or side dish that will impress your friends and family with very little effort!


I like to use brown basmati rice to make this dish, but you can also use quinoa if you prefer. Brown basmati rice hasn’t been stripped of its bran and germ (like white rice) where most of the nutrients are, and it still has a light and fluffy texture. Brown rice is one of the richest sources of manganese, a trace mineral that fights free radicals in the body.
Basmati rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice and won’t send your blood sugar surging! Refined carbohydrates (carbs) like white rice, processed grains, and refined sugar can spike blood sugar levels and tax your organs, slowing down healing and robbing the body from other important regulatory functions. Refined carbs can also cause weight gain that you can’t seem to get rid of (especially around the mid section). Since brown basmati rice isn’t refined and has its fiber intact, it is a more nutritious way to eat carbohydrates.
To get started on making this dish, get out a medium sized pot and melt one tablespoon of coconut oil (or butter) over medium heat. Chop up half a cup of onions, mince a couple garlic cloves, and stir them into the pot. Cook until the onions start to turn translucent and the garlic is fragrant. It smells sooo good! Add 1 cup of dry brown basmati rice or quinoa to the pot and stir it around for one minute. Make sure to keep stirring so it doesn’t burn!

Stir in two cups of chicken (or vegetable) stock, turn the heat down to low, cover the pot and allow it to simmer. After 20 minutes, take a peek at the rice and check to see if the liquid has evaporated and if the rice is cooked. It may need to cook for about 5-10 minutes longer. Use this time to chop up half a cup of cilantro and also to juice and zest one lime…

When the rice is cooked, take the pot off of the heat and stir in the chopped cilantro, lime juice, and lime zest. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm and enjoy!


This is an example of the types of recipes that are recommended after you complete the Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox Program. We all want to find a balance between feeling our best, finding our ideal weight and eating a diet that we can live with. One that doesn’t rob us of a guilty pleasure here and there or cut out so many foods that it leaves you wondering if there is anything left that you CAN eat!
The Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox Program is a great way to begin to eliminate problematic foods from your diet without drastically slashing calories or having a long list of foods to avoid taped to your refrigerator. That is never fun! With this program I provide you with a simple plan to follow so that you can start feeling your best and see how even small changes can create big results. I am opening up this impactful and effective program at a special discounted price for limited time.

https://foodbabe.com/my-favorite-moments-from-2016-see-which-food-companies-are-dropping-the-toxins/,My Favorite Moments From 2016 – See Which Food Companies Are Dropping The Toxins!,"We’ve come a long way Food Babe Army! 2016 was full of surprises and a lot of turmoil – but there was so much good to reflect on, these are some of my favorite moments of 2016…
At a recent conference, executives from legacy food companies agreed that consumers want to buy clean, healthy food and that this isn’t just a fad – it’s here to stay. Iconic food brands are now on a “real food journey”, removing artificial additives and eliminating harmful farming practices (like routine antibiotics). They are moving in the right direction and they aren’t alone. The good food revolution is in full force thanks to the Food Babe Army, activist organizations and countless consumers that are taking back their health!
When I look back on 2016, one of the things I’m so proud of is seeing the public become increasingly aware of the unethical tactics employed by the food and chemical companies to mislead consumers. Thanks largely to the work done by consumer interest groups like U.S. Right to Know, Food and Water Watch, Center for Food Safety and The Cornucopia Institute we now see exactly how companies use front groups, scientists, and other paid experts to conduct covert public relations for them. The Food Babe Army has been very instrumental in spreading the word and we are creating a better informed public! We now know why they are attacking us for simply asking for healthy food and how to fight back. There are some big revelations on this front to come next year, and I couldn’t be more proud of the amazing work that we are doing together. The Food Babe Army Rocks!!!

The Most Loved Instagram Posts of 2016!

Campbell’s labels GMO ingredients (January 7, 2016) – The new year started out with a bang when one of the largest food corporations in the U.S. announced they will begin labeling GMOs on all of their products, which include Pepperidge Farm, Prego, Plum Organics and V8, and they anticipate that labeling will be complete within “12 to 18 months”. We had previously exposed the GMOs in their products here, and the Food Babe Army showed our thanks to Campbell’s for being the first major brand to label the GMOs in their products in the U.S.

All the letters you sent to Campbell’s thanking them for labeling GMOs – So nice of them to acknowledge our efforts!
Vani Hari named one of “America’s 50 Most Powerful People in Food for 2016” by The Daily Meal (January 27, 2016) – I was honored to make this list as one of “the watchdogs, the inspirers, the facilitators” of the food movement in America. This is a win for ALL OF YOU in the Food Babe Army who share our posts, investigations, petitions, and vote with your dollars asking for a safer and healthier food supply. You are a force like no other!
Starbucks publishes drink ingredients for first time in history – Sometime in January, we noticed that Starbucks quietly added ingredient lists for their drinks to their website. This is a campaign that we have been working on since 2012 (see here, here, here, and here) and these posts have been shared hundreds of thousands of times. Starbucks used to claim that their ingredients were “proprietary” and refused to disclose – so this is a huge win for transparency!
Mars removes artificial colors from candies (February 5, 2016) – The maker of M&M’s, Skittles, and Starburst will remove all artificial colors from all of their products (excluding pet foods) within the next 5 years. Renee Shutters (an activist consumer) and The Center For Science In The Public Interest petitioned to remove the dyes from M&M’s, and received over 217K signatures!
Vani Hari named one of “The 13 Most Powerful Women in Food” by The Daily Meal (February 19, 2016) – Pretty surreal a food activist was on this list with Oprah Winfrey and the CEOs of major food companies!
Perdue’s chicken strips go antibiotic-free (February 26, 2016) – Perdue announced that they would eliminate chicken raised on antibiotics from their chicken strips and nuggets sold in grocery stores by June 2016. This just goes to show that it doesn’t need to take YEARS to accomplish this! This makes them the largest supplier of antibiotic-free chicken strips in the U.S. Yet, this is still only a portion of the chicken that Purdue produces, so I am still waiting for them to eliminate the routine use of antibiotics across their entire product line. We have campaigned along with dozens of consumer interest groups to to stop the dangerous routine use of antibiotics on farms and we are slowly chipping away at it (see here, here, here, here, and here).

The Food Babe Way is released in paperback! – My first book, The Food Babe Way, was a #1 bestseller & New York Times Best Seller – selling more books than any other book the week that it was released in 2015. I have continued to be astonished by all your support, generous love and am humbled and forever grateful for every single person that has read this book and have helped to spread the word and get this message out. The Food Babe Way is for anyone who’s tired of the food industry hijacking their taste buds and wants to take matters into their own hands and become their own food investigator, nutritionist, and food activist. There’s a way to survive and look good without dieting, and this book contains the 21 essential habits that I taught myself to take control of my health. It is now available in paperback online here.

In-N-Out Burger commits to stopping routine antibiotic use (March 2, 2016) – On February 24th, I joined over 50 public interest and consumer advocacy groups in sending a letter to In-N-Out Burger, asking them to phase out the routine use of antibiotics across all of their meat supply chains (as well as using beta-agonists and growth hormones) and also to provide a more healthful and sustainable grass-fed option on the menu. The following week, In-N-Out Burger responded by telling reporters, “Our company is committed to beef that is not raised with antibiotics important to human medicine, and we’ve asked our suppliers to accelerate their progress towards establishing antibiotic alternatives.” Although they stated they are moving in that direction, they have not provided a timeline, so this fight is not over. Here’s more about what’s in their food.
General Mills labels GMO ingredients (March 18, 2016) – Two days after the DARK Act was initially defeated by the Senate, General Mills was the first company to announce that they will label GMOs on all of their products within the U.S. Their product line includes Yoplait, Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Chex, Progresso, and Fruit By The Foot. Will they keep this commitment now that the DARK Act was revived and signed into law in July?
Kellogg’s & Mars both label GMO ingredients (March 21, 2016) – Just a few days later, both of these companies followed suit by announcing they will also label GMOs in their products throughout the U.S. within months.
ConAgra labels GMO ingredients (March 22, 2015) – Quickly on their heels, ConAgra said they will also begin adding labels to products nationwide by July – their brands include Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Hunt’s, and Marie Callender’s.
Campbell’s eliminates BPA from cans (March 28, 2015) – Campbell’s announces they will transition to BPA-Free cans by the mid-2107 in the U.S. and Canada. They are the largest canned soup maker in the U.S., so this is huge!
Del Monte joins the Food Babe Army (March 29, 2015) – Del Monte told reporters that they will begin to “move away” from GMOs and that they would add “non-GMO labels” to their products that don’t contain them. When I thanked Del Monte on Twitter for their decision – they told me: “We are happy to join your #FoodBabeArmy!”… these brands are listening to us!!! The biotech companies were not pleased and a fake grassroots movement (astroturf campaign) was launched – which I revealed here.
This is the month I found out I was pregnant ! I can’t wait to bring little baby Food Babe into the world very soon. Follow @FoodBabeMama on Instagram for updates and lots of mama discussions!

Showering Little Food Babe With Love (Nov 2016)
Taco Bell ditches antibiotics (April 18, 2016) – Taco Bell issues a press release announcing they will no longer serve chicken raised on medically important antibiotics in the U.S. by 2017. This follows a letter that over 80 organizations (including Food Babe) sent to Taco Bell’s parent company (Yum! Brands) in January, urging them to commit to a strong antibiotics policy.
Nestle removes GMOs and artificial ingredients from ice cream (April 20, 2016) – Nestle cleans up their ice cream as they ditch GMOs and growth hormones from many of their ice cream products – their brands include Dreyers, Edy’s, Haagen-Daz, Outshine, Skinny Cow, and Drumstick. They also said they’d eliminate other ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, carrageenan, artificial flavors and colors from many of these products.
Dannon eliminates GMOs from yogurts (April 27, 2016) – Dannon announced that they are moving away from synthetic ingredients and would remove GMOs from Dannon, Oikos and Danimals yogurts starting in July. Instead of just removing GMO ingredients (like sugar from GMO beets) from their ingredients, they are taking it a step further to ensure that the milk comes from cows that are not fed GMO feed. This is a HUGE and outstanding commitment given that the vast majority of GMO crops are fed to farm animals. They also committed to labeling GMOs in their remaining products – and are holding strong, despite being attacked by the industry!
Moms Across America Launched Organic Awareness Campaign (April 24, 2016) – This billboard was in 191 locations across 35 cities. “This is a health solution not only for consumers, but for our earth. 1 out of 2 U.S children have a chronic illness. Studies also show organic improves the health of farmers, the quality of the soil, water, plants and reduces climate change.”

Pizza Hut removes controversial preservatives and switches to antibiotic-free chicken (May 31, 2016) – Pizza Hut began making big changes to their ingredients which include removing BHA and BHT from all of their meats and removing preservatives from cheese by March 2017. They also have plans to get rid of additional unnecessary additives and preservatives in their food by 2020. Most importantly, they will stop sourcing chicken (as a pizza topping) that was raised on human antibiotics by March 2017 – now they just need to include their chicken wings and other meats in this policy! We raised awareness of the preservative BHT when we petitioned Kellogg’s and General Mills to remove it from their cereals in 2015.
Adweek names Vani Hari one of the 30 Most Influential People in Food! (June 5, 2016) – I was over the moon to be considered on the same list as  my favorite foodies Anthony Bourdain and Ina Garten – even more so, considering the attention to our good food movement activism!

In June, I completed a whirlwind book tour in Spain for the Spanish version of my book, The Food Babe Way (El método Food Babe). Overseas, Monsanto and pro-GMO proponents do not easily influence the government and the media with their propaganda – it was refreshing to be around people not scared to report the truth about the chemicals in our food. I was able to spread our message widely in Spain and reached so many people in a short amount of time! Here’s some of the press we received:

Meeting the Food Babe Army all across Spain!
Pepperidge Farm releases non-GMO Goldfish Crackers (June 2, 2016) – Pepperidge Farm introduces a new version of Goldfish Crackers made with organic wheat and non-GMO ingredients. They are still selling the old GMO-filled Goldfish though, so check those labels!
Panera Bread removes more artificial ingredients (June 15, 2016) – Ditches artificial ingredients in their grocery store products (which include soups, breads, deli meats, coffee and salad dressings). These will no longer contain high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, artificial sweeteners, artificial preservatives and artificial colors. This is in addition to the changes they started making in their restaurants last year, which includes stopping the routine use of antibiotics in their meat!
Campbell’s plans for antibiotic-free chicken (July 21, 2016) – Although they didn’t disclose a timeline, Campbell’s announced that they will not allow their chicken suppliers to add antibiotics to their feed, water or vaccines. This will include their entire line of brands, such as Swanson.
McDonald’s starts to clean up their buns and McNuggets (August 1, 2016) – Following their commitment to eliminate human use antibiotics from their chicken, they announced the removal of artificial preservatives – sodium phosphate, TBHQ – from their famous Chicken McNuggets and some breakfast items. They will also be removing high fructose corn syrup from all of their buns! They likely made this move after they received double digit sales increases when they reformulated their Egg McMuffin last year with simpler ingredients. This just goes to show that it pays off to improve their products with better ingredients!
Cheez-It’s indicates they will remove TBHQ (August 26, 2016) – Our facebook post exposing the TBHQ in Cheez-It crackers went viral with over 12 million views and 185,000 shares. This synthetic preservative is a form of butane (a very toxic gas) and has been linked to vision disturbances, liver enlargement, childhood behavioral problems, and stomach cancer in animal studies. New research coming out of Michigan State University links it to the rise in food allergies, which has prompted more research. Although the FDA allows TBHQ in America, it is banned for use in food in other countries including Japan. Cheez-It took notice and responded that they are “actively testing a number of natural alternatives” to TBHQ – but how many more people will continue to consume TBHQ before they change it?

September
In September, I spoke at the Hawaii-Center for Food Safety’s event called the “Ethics of Eating”. The Center For Food Safety is a nonprofit organization that promotes organic and sustainable agriculture with work focusing on the public health impacts of the pesticides and herbicides used on GMOs, and because of this, they are heavily targeted by the biotech companies who are profiting off of these chemicals and technologies. Despite unethical efforts by the biotech industry to disrupt my talk, we had a packed house and standing room only! We streamed the event live on Facebook and it was a huge success. Thank you Hawaii-Center For Food Safety for the incredible hospitality and of course, for hiring additional security to keep the event on track!

Ethics of Eating Talk at The University of Hawaii, 09/15/2016

Healthy Futures SALT Salon hosted by The Center For Food Safety, Honolulu, Hawaii
Stouffer’s simplifies ingredients in their lasagna (September 6, 2016) – Nestle reformulated their recipe and removed autolyzed yeast extract (hidden MSG), carrageenan, dextrose and bleached wheat flour from their Stouffer’s Lasagna. I’ve highlighted the harmful effects of hidden MSG and carrageenan several times in the past and it’s nice to see companies are starting to remove these unnecessary additives from their products!
Schuman introduces “True Cheese” without cellulose (September 6, 2016) – Schuman introduced a new “True Cheese” label that verifies a product is made only with milk, cultures, salt and enzymes. This was in response to the scandal regarding alarming amounts of cellulose added to some shredded cheeses. Ground breaking research links this additive to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems.
Jell-O ditches artificial colors in new line (October 5, 2016) – A new line of Jell-O gelatin and pudding mixes without artificial colors, artificial flavors, or preservatives was released. In 2014, I broke down the toxic ingredients in conventional Jell-O, including artificial colors like yellow #5 that requires a warning label in Europe, and the artificial preservative BHT. The Food Babe Army shared this investigation so much that it was read by millions of people over the last couple years. Informed consumers like us stopped buying JELL-O and look what they had to do! Beware that the old toxic version of JELL-O with artificial colors and BHA is still in stores and this is just a new line that they have created – so continue to check the ingredient list on any product you buy!
Buitoni goes non-GMO (October 25, 2016) – Buitoni announced that they will remove the GMOs from their pastas and sauces.
Carrageenan to be removed from organic food (November 17, 2016) -The National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) declares that carrageenan will no longer be permitted in organic food by 2018. I wrote about this additive in organic food back in 2012, which is commonly found in almond milks, coconut milks, soy milks, creamers, cottage cheese, ice cream, deli meat, and dozens of other products. It’s been shown to be a dangerous and potent inflammatory agent (and possible carcinogen), so it has no business being in our food. This is a HUGE win for consumers. Thanks goes out to The Cornucopia Institute for leading this charge and to everyone who campaigned to make this happen!
The Food Babe Army storms the internet! Our most viral blog post of the year with over 5 million views exposed the alarming amount of the weedkiller glyphosate found in U.S. foods after it was tested by a FDA registered food safety laboratory, commissioned by Food Democracy Now and The Detox Project. The Food Babe Army really pulled through on this, and although the mainstream media failed to cover this very important information, you all shared this post so much that it spread like wildfire and millions of people are now informed.
We are winning the fight for a safer and healthier food supply.
Every time you purchase food, tell a friend something new you learned about food, sign a petition, read an ingredient list or contact a company directly, you are taking an act which makes you an activist. Together, with the power of our collective voices, we are shaping the marketplace and creating a new demand for real food.
Let’s encourage each other to keep going! PLEASE SHARE THIS POST with everyone you know and ask them to join the Food Babe Army!  When we work together to demand better food, companies have no choice but to change – and we need all hands on deck in the coming new year.
Make sure that you are subscribed to the Food Babe email newsletter here, so that you are notified about our next big investigation and petition. This is the primary way I communicate with all of you and I don’t want anyone to miss out.

https://foodbabe.com/holiday-recipes/,How To Avoid The Holiday Death Aisle This Year And Beyond!,"If you do one thing this holiday season – avoid what I call “The Holiday Death Aisle” at the supermarket and discount drug stores. That aisle is filled with brightly colored JUNK made with bleached and heavily processed flour, artificial colors derived from petroleum, nasty preservatives, GMO refined white sugars, GMO oils, and the absolute worst ingredients you can put in food.





This is no way to celebrate the holidays and food manufacturers know they can get away with selling you the cheapest ingredients during this time of year because they can tap into the nostalgia of the holiday season and the idea that “it’s just once a year” – but really it’s ALL YEAR. Almost immediately after they clear the Halloween candy from their shelves, grocery stores stock up on Christmas candy and all the fast food places come out with “holiday drinks”… and then comes Valentine’s Day… and then Easter… and it really just keeps going in an endless cycle of toxic seasonal treats.
I’m not saying you shouldn’t have festive treats for the holidays, but it just baffles me that food companies and restaurants fill their foods with the worst possible ingredients in the name of the holidays. Just take a look at what’s in Chick-Fil-A’s popular Peppermint Chocolate Chip Milkshake for example…

Gross, right?
Just because it’s the holidays, you don’t need to subject your body to ingredients like this. Years ago, I stopped buying packaged and processed holiday candies, cookies and treats, and started the tradition of making seasonal treats with real whole food organic ingredients instead – and I’ve never looked back!


Please share this list of recipes with your friends and family too! Let’s help everyone make healthier treats this year and beyond.",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/almond-butter-raspberry-thumbprint-cookies/,Almond Raspberry Thumbprint Cookies,"Almost every packaged holiday cookie out there is made with bleached and heavily processed flour, artificial colors derived from petroleum, GMO refined white sugars and GMO oils, and conflict palm oil. Just because it’s the holidays, you don’t need to subject your body to ingredients like this…
There’s nothing that I value more than my health and the health of my friends and family, and I’m sure you feel the same way. That’s why I started the tradition of baking seasonal treats with real whole food organic ingredients. One of my new cookie recipes is sure to become a favorite around here, and they don’t even contain any refined sugar!


I’ll be sharing these Almond Raspberry Thumbprint Cookies with loved ones during the holidays. They look a little fancy, but only take about 15 minutes of your time to put together – quicker than it would take to run to the store! I like to prep the chia jam the night before since it takes some time in the fridge to set up, but it really only takes one hour in the fridge if you don’t want to wait.
All you need for the jam is a cup of raspberries, a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and a tablespoon of chia seeds. If you want it sweeter, you can stir in some honey or maple syrup, but you don’t need it!

Just blend up the chia jam ingredients in a blender until smooth. Add in a tablespoon (or so) of water if you need to help it blend. Put the jam in a glass jar or bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour – or overnight. The chia seeds will expand and gel, transforming it into a delicious jam!

When you’re ready to make the cookies, preheat your oven to 350 degrees and get out a large bowl and your favorite whisk…

Whisk together 1/4 cup coconut oil, 1/2 cup coconut sugar, one egg, and a tablespoon of real vanilla extract until well blended…

In another bowl stir together a couple cups of almond flour and a pinch (1/4 teaspoon) of sea salt.

And slowly pour the almond flour mixture into the wet ingredients and blend together until it’s all mixed together like this…

Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and scoop out 12-15 cookie dough balls. Press a thumbprint into the center of each cookie…

Take your chia jam out of the fridge and scoop a teaspoon into each indent…

Put the cookies in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes until slightly browned on the edges.

https://foodbabe.com/one-pan-dish-lemon-rosemary-chicken-root-vegetables/,Make Dinner Easy With This One Pan Dish: Lemon Rosemary Chicken & Root Vegetables,"After investigating how food is produced and raised in this country, one of the first commitments to my health I made was to completely stop eating “factory farmed” meat. Whether I’m eating at home, a friend’s house, or at a restaurant – I try my best not to eat meat unless I know that it didn’t come from a factory farm.
When you stop buying meat raised on factory farms you will feel SO MUCH better! You’ll no longer be eating meats with the accumulated toxins that come from living crammed together in inhumane living conditions, subsisting on a diet of chemical-laden GMOs and antibiotics, while being pumped full of hormones and drugs to make them grow bigger.
These animals are not healthy! And when we eat animals that are not healthy – we become unhealthy! If you want to change the food industry, your body, and get healthy you have to make the commitment to stop eating factory farmed meat.
That’s why I prefer to obtain meat directly from local farms or sources I trust where they are transparent about their practices. Knowing the source of my meat, gives me peace of mind that the animals truly had a “free-range” life and weren’t kept in a crate and pumped with antibiotics in some Big Ag operation. Ideally, I want all the meat I buy to come from a healthy, contented animal that grazed on an open, green pasture its whole life.
From the mountains of emails I’ve received, I see that many of you desperately want to stop buying meat from factory farms too, and that’s why I have a new partner here at Food Babe that will help you (and everyone you know) do just that.
Not only am I now using this service, but I’ve got my team and some family members on board too! We whipped up this incredible Lemon Rosemary Chicken with Root Vegetables in just one pan this week… and let me tell you… it’s an extremely satisfying meal and perfect for having friends over for dinner.


When entertaining, I love making meals that only use one pan as I don’t have to worry about multi-tasking. This is one of those recipes you can throw together while chatting with your friends without missing a beat! I’ll definitely be keeping this Lemon Rosemary Chicken recipe handy during the holiday season.
While preheating the oven to 400 degrees, prepare the rosemary spice mix. This flavorful dish is simply seasoned with a mix of fresh rosemary leaves, oregano, red pepper flakes, minced garlic, the juice of one lemon and olive oil. Just add all of this to a large bowl and stir it up!

Salt and pepper 4 chicken thighs, add them to the same bowl with the spice mix and rub it all in evenly. Set this aside and wash up to prepare the veggies.

Dice up half of an onion and three cups of root veggies into bite-size pieces. Here I used sweet potatoes, turnips and red and purple potatoes, but feel free to use any root vegetables you like such as yams, carrots, and parsnips. This recipe is flexible!
Get out a large oven-proof skillet (I like to use a heavy cast iron skillet) and heat up one tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat on the stove. Saute the diced vegetables for 5-7 minutes and remove from the pan to make room for the chicken.

Add your seasoned chicken thighs to the skillet and brown them on both sides for a couple minutes. Stir back in your veggie mix, along with 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary and half a cup of chicken stock (here’s how to make homemade stock!). Cut a lemon in half and toss it into the skillet. I added the already juiced lemon too!

Stick the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes (or until chicken is cooked through) and then you’ll have this beautiful skillet of deliciousness!!!……

This dish will easily impress friends and family! Doesn’t it look so beautiful all plated up? Squeeze some of that lemon juice over everything before you dig in, the flavors are fresh and amazing!

https://foodbabe.com/monsanto/,Monsanto Is Scrambling To Bury This Breaking Story – Don’t Let This Go Unshared!,"I am frankly shocked this information is not making front page news right now. Monsanto will do anything to bury this story… and as of right now, it’s working. Not a single mainstream media outlet has covered this appalling new report that shows millions of people being poisoned by a chemical that does not belong in our food. This chemical is ending up in processed foods like Cheerios, Ritz Crackers, and Oreos and being consumed by humans across the world. The health of millions of people is on the line and this news must go mainstream! That’s why I’m calling on every single one of you who reads this post to share this breaking story now. The only way this injustice will be corrected is if enough of us stand up and demand that something be done to stop the poisoning of our food supply.
A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto’s Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts.

{See the test results and full report by Food Democracy Now! and The Detox Project}.

This chemical has gone so mainstream that glyphosate has infiltrated every facet of our environment – our water, air, soil.
So, that is why it’s not just GMO-filled junk food that is laced with glyphosate. It’s contaminating organic and non-GMO foods, and it’s even in our honey! The FDA quietly found it in almost every single sample of honey that they tested (from mass produced to organic mountain honey). The media has been essentially silent and barely anyone heard this news!
Even if you don’t personally eat the specific brands that were tested (I don’t), how many people are eating Cheerios and Ritz Crackers every day? A lot!
There are still thousands of other brands and whole foods that have not been tested for glyphosate residues, so we can’t be so sure that our own organic, non-GMO, and unprocessed food is safe. Americans are effectively being forced to eat this poison until something is done to stop the rampant use of this chemical. Yes, I said poison.
While there are now several manufacturers of glyphosate herbicides, Monsanto completely dominates the market and this is a best seller. They are raking in BILLIONS every year and certainly don’t want that to stop. They are clearly, without a doubt, using their prosperity to influence our government regulators. Why else would those entrusted to protect the public from harmful chemicals turn a blind eye to this?
In 2013, the EPA massively increased the industry standard of what is considered a “safe” level of glyphosate on our food, in order to make enormous amounts seem A-OK. Instead of properly regulating, they effectively raised the “safe” level so that no one can blame the industry for poisoning us with unlawful amounts of chemicals. This is corruption at its finest. The EPA has a long and sordid history of doing whatever Monsanto wants and you have to ask yourself why this continues to happen and how we can make it stop.
The EPA continues to pander to Monsanto, as they keep postponing and dragging their feet to evaluate glyphosate’s link to cancer in humans. The industry is fighting tooth and nail to make sure that the EPA “evaluation” will be in their favor and is trying to control who will be on the panel. Why won’t the EPA do their job to make sure that the world’s most widely used herbicide isn’t causing us all to get cancer? Don’t you think this should be a top priority? It’s time for the EPA to put the public health above the corrupt desires of corporations.
When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided to suspend their testing this week. Could it be that Monsanto didn’t like the results they started getting – especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye.
It is shameful that the American media has thus far failed to cover this breaking news, but WE HAVE THE POWER to make this information go viral. If you really want to stop the corruption perpetuated by Monsanto and the large chemical companies – this is how we shut them down!
Remember the best way to avoid glyphosate is by choosing certified organic foods because it is prohibited on organic crops. Although contamination is a real threat, the levels on organic foods are minimal compared to what’s been found on conventional foods. It’s been shown that people who eat organic foods have less glyphosate and other synthetic pesticides in their system.
The people of this country must be informed and this should be our top priority. Go, Food Babe Army, Go!",Food Babe,Unknown

I also like to switch up my nut butters – sometimes I use almond butter instead of using peanut butter that is often used in Pad Thai recipes. Peanuts are more susceptible to being contaminated with Aflatoxin, which is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer – so it’s not a nut butter I eat on a daily basis. Besides, according to this analysis, almond butter has 69% more calcium, twice as much fiber, 86% more iron, and 169% more vitamin E than peanut butter.

https://foodbabe.com/easy-slow-cooker-chicken-quinoa-chili-recipe-bonus-time/,Easy Slow-Cooker Chicken Quinoa Chili Recipe,"This Chicken Quinoa Chili is one of those recipes that you can throw together in the morning before work, let it simmer in a slow cooker all day, and sit down to amazing homemade meal without spending hardly any time in the kitchen! Don’t you just love recipes like this?


I’ve had SO MANY people tell me how shocked they were that it really doesn’t cost them more money at the grocery store to eat whole foods instead of processed foods, but the time they were spending in the kitchen was wearing them out.
I’m right there with you! It seems all too easy to just pick up some take-out in the evening and relax on the couch. But, I’ve learned that even when I’m crunched for time, I can’t continuously outsource my health to restaurants if I want to maintain an ideal weight and stay in the best health that I’ve ever known. When you cook your own meals you are in control of the ingredients and know everything that went into them. It’s the only way to know exactly what you are eating!
That’s why I prepare at least 15 home-cooked meals every week — and I’ve found that using a slow cooker is one of the easiest methods out there that makes it virtually effortless for me to stick to eating unprocessed food on a regular basis. Hands down… this is the easiest way to eat a healthy diet on limited time.
That’s why I worked with my team to create a (newly expanded) Food Babe Real Food Slow Cooker Guide. We spent months carefully crafting OVER 50 healthy slow cooker recipes which are all incredibly delicious and easy. These recipes are so simple and hassle-free that they make a healthy lifestyle a breeze!
To give you a taste, I’m sharing the Chicken Quinoa Chili recipe straight from this guide with you below. This recipe is not only healthy and delicious, but makes the house smell so amazing! If you’d like to, it’s easy to make this chili vegan by simply omitting the chicken and using vegetable stock. It will still be packed with protein and fiber from the beans and quinoa.
Quinoa is a gluten-free seed that contains 8 grams of complete protein and 5 grams of fiber per cup (cooked). It’s also a good source of manganese and magnesium… just some of the reasons why I love adding it to my meals to bump up the nutritional content. Quinoa has a texture similar to rice so it really works well in stir-fry’s and soups!

Here’s a recap of what you’ll receive…",Food Babe,Unknown
https://foodbabe.com/bojangles-ingredients/,What Are Bojangles Ingredients? (Let Me Warn You.),"Today I’m launching a petition asking the restaurant chain Bojangles’ Famous Chicken & Biscuits to: (1) formally prohibit the routine use of antibiotics for growth promotion and disease prevention in the production of their meat, with a concrete policy and timeline, and to (2) publish their complete ingredient list online. Here’s why…
Last summer, I volunteered at a local elementary school and noticed that they were serving Bojangles’ for breakfast. I asked the school administrators if they knew what was in Bojangles’ food or if they had an ingredient list that they could share with me – and they told me they didn’t know the ingredients. Hundreds of kids were eating it, but no one had any idea what was in it. How does this happen? I asked myself.
I grew up eating Bojangles’ and they have a really large presence here in Charlotte. You see their advertising everywhere – sporting events, local charities, and schools! I used to eat it every Friday in high school when seniors were allowed to leave the school campus for lunch. I’d get everything – the fries, the sweet iced tea, and that famous fried chicken! Obviously, I didn’t know or care about what I was eating back then – but given the health crisis we face in this country (especially here in the south), if we are going to make good informed decisions about what we are eating – we need to know what’s in our food!
We initially reached out to Bojangles’ via their contact form to ask for ingredients in some menu items and didn’t receive responses. We tried this several times and received absolutely nothing back from them which seemed somewhat strange from a customer service standpoint. When we followed up with phone calls, the customer service agents told us they didn’t have any ingredient lists and couldn’t provide any information, but that they would ask someone from corporate to call us back. They never called or emailed us back – not a peep!


In a news release Bojangles’ says, “I can’t give away all of our secrets, but I can say that we start every batch of biscuits with the freshest ingredients. It’s what our customers expect and deserve”.
They’ve always claimed to make their biscuits “from scratch” and this is something that they are famous for. When I hear the words “from scratch”, I tend to believe that means that they’re made from ingredients that are typically used in the kitchen – no chemical additives and ingredients that you’d expect in biscuits like flour, butter, and milk. On the other hand, I also know that most restaurants – especially fast food restaurants – are notorious for taking shortcuts and add all kinds of synthetic chemicals like preservatives, MSG, artificial flavors, and colors to their food. For example, KFC lists the ingredients for their biscuits online and they are filled with partially hydrogenated soy and cottonseed oils, DATEM, natural and artificial flavors, and TBHQ. KFC also adds MSG to their chicken.
When Bojangles’ refuses to share their ingredients, I can’t help but be skeptical and wonder if they are using ingredients like these too!
In a last ditch effort, we contacted a Bojangles’ regional office (Tands, Inc. Bojangles’) and received an email back from their Area Supervisor with some very interesting information.
We asked what type of oil they use in their fryers as this is used to cook a number of their items like their chicken, fries, country-fried steak and the cajun filet. The representative stated they use All Fry ZT (Blended Liquid Shortening Made from Canola Oil and Beef Fat) in their fryers.
What else do we know about the food at Bojangles’?
Until they agree to disclose ingredients, we are pretty much in the dark. A Bojangles’ allergen statement from 2013 found online indicates there is soy in their biscuits, which could mean that they use soybean oil instead of butter (but we won’t know for sure until they stop hiding their ingredients).
Soybean oil is one of the most unhealthy oils out there which increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. It’s almost always made from GMO soybeans. When researchers tested GMO soybeans they found that they contain high levels of residues from the herbicide glyphosate (Monsanto’s Roundup) compared to non-GMO soybeans. This is a huge issue, as glyphosate has been linked to cancer in many studies – so this is not something I want to be eating and why I avoid GMOs like the plague.
Bojangles’ apparently uses MSG too. According to their 2013 allergen statement, MSG is in all of their kids meals. It also shows that MSG is added to their seasoned fries, green beans, dirty rice, country-fried steak, ranch sauce, and blue cheese salad dressing.
Providing customers with full and transparent ingredient information shows that Bojangles’ is a trustworthy company that is proud of their products. Besides, there are a growing number of consumers that are seeking out ingredient information because we are concerned about food additives and their relation to health, or have other allergies and food sensitivities that are not provided on their allergen statement. Without full ingredient disclosure, consumers are left in the dark and this is preventing them from eating at Bojangles’. Most competitors release ingredients when asked – and it surely seems bizarre that Bojangles’ refuses to release even minute details about what is in their food. But, it doesn’t end there.

Almost all chickens raised in factory farms are routinely fed antibiotics, day in and day out. This practice should be stopped and here’s why:
I personally reached out to Ken Scott, the Director of Quality Assurance at Bojangles’ (and cc’d the CEO), last December and asked him to provide me with their ingredient list and their policy on antibiotics in the production of their meat.

And, was told that many of their menu items are “proprietary” and that they couldn’t make that information available:

I pressed for more information, especially since all major fast food chains publish their ingredients online and my question about antibiotics was ignored:

As I did with McDonalds, Subway, In-N-Out Burger and KFC, I joined several consumer interest groups to formally ask Bojangles’ to prohibit the routine use of antibiotics in the raising of their meat. We sent a letter on April 29th, 2016 to ask for these changes.
Our collective activism has worked in the past and we hope that it will again this time.
What happens next? Here’s what you can do!
When we work together, we have been able to move mountains. You can join us by asking Bojangles’ to improve their practices.

https://foodbabe.com/advice-from-a-cardiologist-critical-questions-to-ask-in-the-emergency-room/,Advice from a Cardiologist: Critical Questions To Ask In The Emergency Room,"This guest post reminds me of the time an emergency room doctor sent me home with the advice to take some Advil, only to find out the next day, my appendix was about to burst! I am so thankful for this advice from Dr. Joel Kahn, who serves on my Advisory Council. Dr. Kahn is a practicing interpreventional cardiologist who also writes for Reader’s Digest and has taught dozens of residents and cardiologists. I am thrilled to have him as a contributor here!


I do not want to burst your bubble, but the medical system is under severe stress and serious mistakes happen daily. Some of these mistakes are lethal and I do not want you to be one of them. The latest report indicates that medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States exceeded only by heart disease.
During the week I wear several different hats. One is my medical career where I currently practice an aggressive brand of preventive cardiology and heart disease reversal. Another is that I am asked frequently to review records from other doctors and hospitals where patients have experienced bad outcomes, often death. I serve as an impartial medical expert. Just this week I reviewed a file of a 50-year old male smoker who went to the emergency room with 2 days of new and intermittent chest pain. He had minimal testing and was released in an hour with instructions to see his family doctor in a week. Sadly, he died of a heart attack 3 days later. This is all too common.
While not all deaths can be foreseen and prevented, I have created a list of questions to ask or testing to request from your health care providers in hopes that it will prepare you for dealing with this overtaxed medical complex and protect you from heart damage.
In my 30 plus years of training and practice, you are likely to have the same lab tests at an annual physical now as in the 1970s. This is not acceptable as there have been major advances in assessing your physiology by labs. I would suggest you ask for the following tests:
Advanced lipid profile: Rather than a calculated LDL cholesterol level, advanced panels measure LDL particle number and size which are more predictive of future heart and stroke events. Two individuals with a calculated LDL cholesterol level of 150 mg/dl can have widely different particle and size measurements and have very different risks.
Lipoprotein a: This is a genetic form of cholesterol that is elevated in about 20% of those tested. It is rarely drawn even though hundreds of research studies indicate if it is elevated, the risk of heart attack and stroke skyrocket. There is even a foundation dedicated to educating the public of the risk. In my clinic, when lipoprotein a is elevated, I work to make sure all other risks for heart and stroke are managed but I also have a protocol to lower and neutralize the effects on arteries.
Homocysteine: This amino acid is produced by an important process called methylation. It is important for artery and brain health along with decreasing risk of autism and cancer. When elevated, it may be due to a genetic defect in the MTHFR gene which is also easily measured. It can be treated with methylated B complex vitamins and the level will return to normal.
Inflammatory markers: The best known is hs-CRP but there are 5 others I measure in my practice. If there are markers of inflammation in the blood, a hunt is on for infections, food allergies, skin conditions like psoriasis, a diet rich in processed foods, central obesity, gingivitis, and sleep apnea among others. Inflammation can be reduced by addressing these root causes.
TMAO: This is a newly described marker of heart and kidney health and rises both by meat and egg heavy diets and an altered gut microbiome. It has now been conclusively shown to cause heart and kidney damage and is associated with a worsened prognosis. It may give an impetus to transition to more plant based diets.
ECG: Years ago a routine physical included an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) but this may be skipped nowadays. I suggest it for one particular reason, the measurement called the QT interval. A segment of the population has a genetic defect that causes the QT interval to be prolonged. Some people are prescribed drugs that prolong the QT interval. A long QT can result in death from a cardiac arrhythmia and a number of medications have been pulled off the market due to this risk. Knowing if you have a prolonged QT interval before you are prescribed antibiotics, antidepressants and other medications is key. More can be learned at www.sads.org.
Vascular screening: Many hospitals offer a vascular screening program using ultrasounds of the carotid arteries, abdominal aorta and legs. These may cost between $50-$100 although for about twice that similar screenings are done in churches and workplaces. Although they are rarely definitive, they can offer a good value if you are a smoker or have a strong family history of early heart disease or stroke of the status of your arteries. Arteries should have no plaque so the word “mild” plaque should prompt you to have a complete evaluation by a vascular expert.
Coronary artery calcium scan (CACS): A CACS is by far the most accurate way to determine if your heart arteries are silently suffering. The heart gives no warnings until the arteries are badly blocked and the first symptom you have may be the day you die. Do not wait. In my community this 1 minute CT scan costs $80, uses no dye, and takes 1 minute. It is far more accurate for screening your heart than a stress test. My book “Dead Execs Don’t Get Bonuses“ goes into detail on how this test works. Your score should be zero and anything higher should prompt you to see a preventive cardiology expert.
There is a chance you or a loved one will end up in an emergency room (ER) or urgent care clinic with chest pain symptoms needing evaluation. First, do not go to an urgent care clinic with chest pain, pressure, tightness, squeezing, or compression. Go to an ER. However, the ER has pressure on them to turn over the rooms. I have reviewed dozens of charts with young people sent home with cursory evaluations only to die or be maimed by massive heart attacks within days. Tragic. Do not go home without a thorough evaluation.
Second, ask for “serial” cardiac enzymes that are repeated every 4-6 hours for 2-3 times.
Third, ask for a repeat ECG to compare to the one you presented with.
Fourth, ask for a definitive test before discharge. This may be a treadmill stress test with echocardiography (no radiation) or nuclear imaging (radiation). In some ERs, the CACS or more likely the more advanced coronary CT angiogram may be available. If you are not severely allergic to iodine dye, this is by far the most accurate way to be sure your arteries are clean. If they are not clean, a cardiologist will have to evaluate your status but you will know the score and be alive.
There are so many potential drug interactions and some of them are deadly. Some of them center on the long QT syndrome found on your ECG mentioned above. There are online resources to check your list of medications for interactions, particularly if you are prescribed a new medication. Antibiotics are particularly frequent causes of drug interactions that can be avoided with proper research online.
I have focused on heart issues as they are the focus of my quarter century of practice, but these lessons are true of other conditions (e.g. a bad headache not fully evaluated in the ER). Do not be afraid to challenge, ask why, read online, and refuse to go home before proper testing is performed. My hope is that I never am sent a medical chart to review with your name on it. The best way to not be a statistic of the third most frequent cause of death in the U.S is to take excellent care of your health, have proper preventive testing, and stay out of ERs and hospitals unless very ill.
