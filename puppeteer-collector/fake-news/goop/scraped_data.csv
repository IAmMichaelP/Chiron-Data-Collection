https://goop.com/wellness/health/othership-bathhouse-review/,"I Cried and Screamed at Othership, the Buzziest New Bathhouse","Like the Mona Lisa, Stonehenge, and Tom Cruise, Othership is smaller in stature than I expected. Its reputation—so bloated and widespread (more on that later)—makes me nervous on arrival, like I’m walking into a first date.
There’s a gentle unze-unze in the reception area and obligatory bathhouse paraphernalia: illuminated glass bottles (curiously empty), an installation of banya bonnets ($60), and limp linen robes that a man beside me runs his hands along, affectionately.
The changing rooms are also smaller than expected; somewhere between an Equinox locker room and a club’s coat check. Thayer’s facial toner and a jar of Q-Tips sit next to a cup of orange earplugs.
So, what exactly is Othership?
Judging purely by architecture, Othership is a bathhouse—one amongst many that have opened recently in New York City—equipped with a 90-person sauna and eight cold plunges. However, they squirm out of this categorization (and nowhere on the website do they say ‘bathhouse’) by blending performance, sober clubbing, treatments, and group therapy. With two locations in Toronto, one in NYC’s Flatiron District, and a soon-to-come Williamsburg spot, their mission is to combat the loneliness epidemic and foster community in a sober, device-free space.
To understand the cast of characters behind Othership requires a corkboard and red string. During COVID, the couple Robbie Bent and Emily Hunter (now Bent) began hosting sauna parties in their backyard. Robbie was a crypto entrepreneur, recently sober, and edging that tech-meets-spirituality line (from a stalk on Instagram, I see skydiving, saltflats, and a ten-day meditation retreat in Israel). They brought in their friends, Harrison Taylor, a sauna master and certified breathwork coach, Amanda Laine, a former model turned sauna master and cold exposure therapist, and Taylor’s partner, and Myles Farmer, who’d opened restaurants and nightclubs in Toronto and, notably, was a Tim Horton’s franchisee. As the world came out of lockdown, their sauna parties took off and in 2022, they opened the first Othership in Toronto.
It’s worshiped by techies who’ve swapped bars for a banya and is funded by companies like Headspace, SoulCycle, and Canadian singer Shawn Mendes (who’s supposedly visited over 100 times?). It’s been dubbed “the SoulCycle of spas” by The New Yorker, the best place to find love by PopSugar, described as a blend of Cirque du Soleil and group therapy in Toronto Life, and, as New York Magazine puts it, I’ll leave with a “sober hangover.” All said, Othership’s most ubiquitous rumor? It’s a cult.
On a rainy Saturday night, I bring a friend who’s going through a breakup. We’re attending a 75-minute guided class called Rose, Thorn, Bud, three words that, together, prompt a minor trauma response. While they offer ‘free-flows’ and ‘socials,’ for independent bathers, the classes—which cost $65 for a drop-in or $333 for a membership—and the Guides themselves, are Othership’s magnum opus. I’ve heard they’re a mix between an Aufguss—a German tradition of pouring aromatic water on the sauna rocks and fanning the hot air with a towel—a dance performance, and group therapy.
The locker room leads us into the ‘tea room,’ an amber-lit and amphitheater-style lounge. We climb over our fellow ‘Journeyers’ to perch at the top like the jury in a courtroom. Sixty half-naked people, many semi-recumbent couples, a few huddles of women and the stray single man, rubbing his palms together, waiting for our Guide, Dev Richey to begin.
Richey is a dancer and choreographer on Broadway, clearly, as he pirouettes around, outlining what’s to come. After a light preamble, we’re ushered into the palatial sauna with a faint herbal smell, and we sit facing the stove and a giant gong. Uplifting, Rüfüs Du Sol-type house music starts, the neon lights bump with the beat, and Richey begins by throwing herbal snowballs on the stove. We’re visualizing our Rose.
Once my body is covered in sweat, time begins to warp. It’s a lot of sensory action; the music gets louder, Richey is dancing and fanning us with hot, aromatic air. Soon, we’re moving on to our ‘thorns.’ The music fades, the lights dim, then, poof, we’re in pitch black. Dev seems genuinely sad. I feel sad. We visualize our thorns, what we messed up this month. Someone starts banging the gong and, on the count of three, Richey lets out a primal scream that erupts around me. I’m screaming too, at full volume, I think, but it’s drowned by one collective, barbaric roar.
Then, silence. I nudge my friend. I feel like I might cry, maybe I do, I wouldn’t know, my face is covered in sweat. On to the ice bath.
Eight small ice baths dot the floor. We file in, stand above our plunge (more like a puddle as they’re only 22 inches deep), and we sit in unison, the cold zinging my body, as Richey lulls us away from panic, for two submerged minutes.
“People give me a laundry list like, ‘I’m a sound healer and I’ve taught yoga in this and that place,’ and I don’t really care,” says Laine, who’s the director of Guides and handles hiring people like Richey. In their video job submission, applicants are asked things like ‘tell the craziest story’ or to show a full range of emotion on their face in 30 seconds. From these, she says, they’re looking for an “X-factor.”
There is a meticulous curation to what they don’t say. They avoid spiritual or religious concepts, basing their classes on psychotherapy techniques, “not chakras or energy,” says Bent. Nothing is “woo-woo,” Laine reiterates. This comes as a surprise, and reads as slightly incongruent to their marketing. (Someone on their team signed off an email with “happy to be in orbit with you.”)
Despite Andrew Huberman coming up in both my interviews, they also avoid “talking about things like ‘inflammation’ or ‘longevity,’” or any other lingo used in the bio-hacking world, Bent says. The yolk of Othership is to simply feel your emotions for 75 minutes, not to intellectualize them.
There is science behind it all, of course. For their Graditude class, they wanted to introduce a more potent, studied practice, Laine says. “We’ve been taught to practice gratitude by listing three things we’re grateful for, but that’s not actually the best way, it’s really through storytelling,” she says. This is shown in a study from 2015 that found repeating a story of gratitude (or better yet, a story in which someone is grateful to you) is far more effective than simply listing. They weave positive visualization into their classes, which we do a lot of in Rose Thorn Bud, which is shown to boost mood and achievement. Their classes can take months or even years to write. “It’s tons of research, we work with different therapists to review scripts. It’s really a craft of language.”
Similarly, saunas have sweeping benefits like improving blood flow, activating metabolism with heat-shock proteins, and improving cardiovascular function. The higher heart rate you have in a sauna can even mimic the effects of moderate exercise, and like exercise, saunas can boost mood and make you more relaxed (through release of beta-endorphins). And on a rudimentary level, inside a sauna like Othership, you’re forced to be away from a screen for more than an hour.
Cold plunges are slightly more contentious when it comes to sex. Studies show that short-term cold exposure is beneficial for everyone because it’s shown to increase endorphin and norepinephrine levels, but some experts, like exercise physiologist Stacy Sims, PhD, say extreme cold below 55 degrees puts too much stress on women’s systems. Laine says it’s about the individual, or phase in their cycle, but the truth is there’s not enough research on the effects of plunges on female bodies.
The cold plunges at Othership are 32 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. I couldn’t help but notice that those who hopped out first were men. (This could be due to research showing women, generally, have more brown fat, which helps us withstand cold—or maybe it’s just grit.)
Back in the sauna, all we have left is our Bud. Richey asks us to visualize walking along a path of rose petals where we meet the former version of ourselves. We hug ourselves, and suddenly, our former self explodes into a shower of flower petals, and we continue on the petal path. For the second time, inexplicably, I feel like crying.
“The word cult used to rattle me, I was like ‘oh my God, like what is happening,’” Laine says when I ask about their reputation. The word spread gradually at first. Then, when their Flatiron location opened, people began whizzing by their hundredth visit and raving about it online, the label stuck.
In response to the same question, without missing a beat, “I love it,” Bent says, naming companies with devoted communities, like SoulCycle, Apple, and Tesla. “That’s what we’re trying to create.”
After one last barbaric yap, Richey opens the floor to us Journeyers, offering space for optional sharing. After a long silence, a man in the corner—a solo Journeyer, previously rubbing his palms together—describes choosing to laugh in the cold plunge instead of gritting his teeth. We all erupt in cheers, naturally.
We emerge from the sauna pink-faced and chatty. My friend turns to me and says she’s going to find a way to come here every month. The solo man is talking with a group of women at the tea station. People are setting up a DJ table in the amphitheater room. At Othership, the night’s just getting started.",Eloise King-Clements,"May 1, 2025"
https://goop.com/wellness/health/osteopathy-benefits/,"What to Know About Osteopathy, the Holistic Modality Beloved by European Women","In France, where I grew up, nobody would bat an eyelid if they heard you say you were on your way to the “osteo”—unsurprising, given that a 2021 survey estimates the number of osteopaths in France at a whopping 49 per every 100,000 people. So, when my therapist in the UK referred me to an osteopath to help get my nervous system down to a more manageable baseline, I was more than willing.
Osteopathy is an alternative, hands-on approach to healthcare (pun intended) that involves the physical manipulation of bodily tissues and bones to facilitate holistic healing. Though it is still wholly under-studied, a recent analysis of all the research that has been published so far found evidence it can help improve a variety of physical and psychological ailments. While it’s more commonly known to be effective for conditions like arthritis and osteoporosis, osteopathy is also often recommended—at least in France—for a host of other health issues as well, including tension headaches and even endometriosis.
But, if osteopathy is so wide-ranging in its proven and potential benefits, why don’t more Americans consult osteopaths—or even know of it as an option? Below, we take a closer look at the proven and purported health benefits of osteopathy that are surely behind its continued popularity among French and European women—and explore why this practice hasn’t yet made its way fully across the pond.
Osteopathy exists in the U.S., but the terminology is different, so here we’ll start by defining it as it’s practiced in Europe. In countries like France and the UK, patients will routinely consult an osteopath as part of their healthcare arsenal, alongside physicians and other practitioners. Europeans will typically consult osteopaths for aches and pains in their muscles and joints, or to help improve their posture, but those aren’t the only ailments the practice can treat.
“Osteopathy is a manual approach whose aim is to restore mobility to the body’s tissues, which in turn helps to promote the body’s healthy function and self-healing,” says Arnaud Marguin, a registered osteopath who practices in Paris, France. He explains that osteopaths work on parts of the body that have restrictions in movement, “helping the body to return to its natural balance.” Marguin cites musculoskeletal pain (lower back pain, neck pain, sprains), digestive issues (acid reflux, bloating), and headaches as some of the conditions for which osteopathy is most helpful. Osteopathy has many things in common with chiropractic, but employs a more holistic approach to body work (while chiropractic care is more focused on the spine, according to the UK health service Patient).
A typical osteopathy session lasts between 20 minutes and an hour and begins with a detailed review of the patient’s medical history, followed by questions about their lifestyle and current symptoms, Marguin says. The osteopath then performs a series of neurological, postural, and mechanical tests to identify any mobility restrictions. Based on these findings, they deliver a personalized treatment that may include gentle manipulation, mobilization, and other hands-on techniques, he says.
Amberin Fur, an osteopath and clinical director of The Vital Practice in London, UK, goes further, explaining that osteopathy is a kind of “lifestyle medicine” that can’t be reduced to just the hands-on treatment. “The advice, exercise and communication is an essential part of the process,” she says. “There is great care in understanding the person as a whole, to gain a view on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the symptom picture.”
Marguin notes that osteopathy is becoming increasingly popular across Europe, a trend he attributes in part to a growing public interest in preventative healthcare and holistic well-being. He highlights osteopathy’s comprehensive approach and the typically longer duration of sessions compared to traditional doctors’ appointments as important factors. “In the context of an aging population and a crisis in healthcare systems around the world, osteopathy represents an effective and non-invasive alternative which can improve people’s quality of life,” he adds.
It’s hard to say why osteopathic manipulation has remained so popular in Europe since it first arrived there, as opposed to its relegation into obscurity in the U.S., but one explanation might be that—speaking very generally from my own personal experience—people there tend to be more open-minded about alternative medicine and holistic therapies. Also, proximity: You can be in the middle of nowhere in France and still have easy access to an organic food shop and an acupuncturist. Even now that I live in London, my naturopath happens to be a French transplant, which I don’t think is all that coincidental. But, while osteopathy is technically categorized as an alternative therapy, there’s also a fair amount of scientific evidence for its effectiveness.
Various professional bodies in France recommend osteopathy for treating musculoskeletal, neurosensory, pulmonary, pediatric, gynecological, and digestive disorders (including IBS). Still, as one systemic review of the literature found, the strongest evidence available mostly points to osteopathy’s effectiveness in treating issues like low back pain and sciatica, while some evidence shows it could be helpful for dealing with tension headaches, endometriosis, and low back and pelvic pain in pregnant women.
Some researchers also believe, as a growing body of evidence continues to show, that osteopathy may be helpful in alleviating mental health symptoms (including lessening anxiety, managing stress and even improving depressive symptoms). While more research is needed on this front, my own visit to the osteo for help dealing with anxiety and regulating my nervous system proved fruitful. I’ve found each session incredibly helpful in bringing me back to a manageable baseline of calm—something I often struggle to achieve on my own.
Overall, though, as pointed out by a 2022 article published in the McGill Office for Science and Society, there is still a lack of solid scientific evidence supporting osteopathy. Fur believes that’s largely due to the matter of funding: “These trials are extremely expensive and need to be backed by big organizations who often have the resources to continually pursue the outcomes.” Perhaps even more importantly, randomized controlled trials—widely considered the gold standard for scientific validation—aren’t well-suited to studying osteopathy, Fur explains. Manual therapies involve numerous variables that are difficult to control or replicate within such a rigid framework, she says, making it hard to accurately reflect real-world clinical practice.
In areas where there isn’t enough research, it’s still worth looking at experienced practitioners’ own history of treatment outcomes. Because of constraints from a UK advertising body, Fur and her fellow practitioners can only claim to treat a list of ailments which she finds a bit vague and limiting, including lumbago (or lower back pain), digestion problems, and generalized aches and pains. But, “through 30 years of clinical work, I have seen all sorts of tangible and remarkable health gains, and patients’ lives that have been affected from it,” Fur says. “These can range from more typical things like improvement with joint pain and spinal injuries to long Covid and stress management.”
Put simply, osteopathy can be a helpful addition to a well-rounded healthcare toolbox for supporting overall vitality—if you can access it, that is.
You wouldn’t guess it, but osteopathy was actually born in the U.S. by a physician named Dr. Andrew Taylor in the latter half of the 19th century. That said, the practice evolved differently in the U.S. than elsewhere around the world. “In Europe, osteopathy has remained a separate manual practice, which focuses on treating restrictions in mobility,” explains Marguin.
While European-style osteopathy doesn’t exist as a separate practice in the U.S., that’s not to say it doesn’t exist at all. Stateside, it’s actually referred to as osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), and it’s just one component of osteopathic medicine. To get more granular, OMT is a system of hands-on techniques used by Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DOs).
“An osteopathic physician is fully qualified to practice medicine in the United States, just like MDs,” explains Nicholas Generales, DO and board-certified family medicine physician in Los Angeles. That means they can also prescribe medication in the same way MDs can. “The key difference is that DOs have the qualification to perform (OMT),” Generales adds.
Generales describes OMT as useful for treating a somewhat wider range of conditions than European-style osteopathy claims to. “OMT can be used to help treat many diseases of every organ system in the body,” he says. “For example, OMT can be used to help patients with anxiety, gastrointestinal diseases, and respiratory diseases.” So, if OMT is so beneficial and if all DOs are trained in it, why don’t they practice it? You can probably guess. “OMT takes time, and with the reality of poor insurance reimbursement in the United States, many DOs may choose to not practice OMT,” says Generales.
If you’re looking to improve some of your symptoms in a more holistic way, you can seek out U.S.-based DOs who actively practice OMT. For now, at least, doing so just might involve a bit more research than if, say, you happened to find yourself in France and could just google “osteopath near me.”",Iris Goldsztajn,"April 16, 2025"
https://goop.com/wellness/health/westin-heavenly-bed-review/,The Bed That Changed the Way We Sleep,"It’s 1998 and you’re on a business trip. You arrive at your hotel late at night and get into bed. The duvet is itchy, and the floral pattern printed on it is an affront to your design aesthetic. The mattress is somehow both hard and unsupportive. You wake up tired, and a little sore. You don’t think about it. This is normal. You’ll sleep better when you get home. The major hotel groups haven’t tried to outdo your bed at home, or, really, even match it.
This would change, of course. And it began, largely, with one bed, the following year. In 1999, Westin Hotels introduced the Heavenly Bed. Instead of a basic mattress made of innerspring coils, this was a custom-designed pillow-top mattress. Instead of two even more basic pillows, you now got five pretty good pillows. Instead of scratchy polyester-cotton linens, you had three crisp sheets ranging in thread count from 180 to 250. To promote the rollout that year, Westin lined up beds outside the New York Stock Exchange, and a skydiver in Savannah parachuted over the Savannah River, and landed on a Heavenly Bed. This was a Big Bet. And it worked.
Guest satisfaction and guest occupancy went up at Westin hotels when the Heavenly Bed was installed in rooms. And in the coming years, publications like The Wall Street Journal would cover the “full-scale hotel bed war” that broke out after the Heavenly Bed’s debut, wherein the other major hotel groups invested in upgrading their beds. And since then, we’ve been sleeping all the better for it.
In 1999, it was unusual for a hotel to sell their mattress directly to consumers, which Westin started doing over a hotline. By the beginning of 2024, they had sold more than half a million Heavenly Beds (sadly not all via hotline). And in 2025, it makes sense that here on goop, where we’re a little (a lot) sleep-obsessed, we’re carrying Westin’s new, modernized, and perfected version of that legacy bed. It took Westin about eight years to get it right, and when you sleep on it, you feel like they really did.
The next-generation Heavenly Bed has a plush top mattress. And that has a soft, yet supportive top layer. An innovative silver weave was added with the intention of keeping us cool and comfortable. Tweaks were made throughout the layers of the mattress to better absorb and diffuse motion. (And yes, Westin reported that the mattress components meet OEKO-TEX standards and are free of PBDE flame retardants.)
Now, the duvet is slightly oversize—it feels fuller, cozier. The linens are a blend of cotton and lyocell (made from eucalyptus and other botanicals). They’re a bit more resistant to wrinkling and pilling, and soft and cool to the touch. And instead of a reflective sheen, the linens have a matte finish now. The previous all-white aesthetic has been updated with a grey blanket and full-frame piping on the pillows. The middle sheet, bed skirt, and bolster pillow: gone. Overall, it looks more modern. It’s the kind of bed we’d be happy to sleep in occasionally while traveling (Westin started rolling out this newest version to their properties last year), but preferably, we’d have the pleasure of sinking into it every night—and luckily, we now can.
The Westin Bora Bora
When Westin launched the original Heavenly Bed in 1999, neither the sleep industry, nor the wellness industry, as we think of those things today, existed. People at the company, though, appreciated a good night’s rest. And they had some consumer research that suggested travelers did, too. (In a survey of 600 business travelers, 82 percent disliked something about the hotel bed at the time. Ouch.) It makes sense that Westin started to prioritize sleep by changing something so basic, so foundational as the bed. And it also feels right that the basics of well-being are what they continue to focus on.
Today, sleep (or rather “sleep well”) remains one of Westin’s key pillars, alongside eating well and moving well—which often brings them back to sleeping well. For example, Westin has a food menu designed around supporting sleep. One of their gear-lending kits includes things like Bala weights for working out, but another includes things like compression boots and percussive massage devices for recovery and rest. Because we know a lot of well-being comes back to sleep. And because when you’re traveling, a lot of maintaining—and when possible, enhancing—your well-being comes back to how much, and how well, you’re able to sleep.
This is what we set out to explore more with the team at Westin in our new video series, Sleep Training for Grown-Ups. In it, our own long-time sleep enthusiast Gwyneth is joined by sleep physician and research scientist Cheri Mah, MD. You can watch the first installment here.",Kiki Koroshetz,"April 8, 2025"
https://goop.com/wellness/health/aescape-robot-massage-review/,I Got a Robot Massage and Things Got Metaphysical,"Let’s play Imagine for a moment. Imagine the pressure is perfect. The brook is babbling. Your muscles are syrupy. Maybe a pearl of drool slides down your lips. Imagine, from your scapula to your hamstrings, as if by X-ray vision, this massage is delivering you somatic bliss. There’s just one thing: your masseuse is a robot. Dealbreaker?
Aescape, pronounced ‘escape,’ is the New York based start-up behind the first fully automated, AI massage, which they unveiled across ten Equinox locations in August. As a denizen of Chinatown spas, an interloper at places like The Well, and an owner of a feeble electric back massager—a robot massage falls smack within my area of interest.
They invite me to their headquarters in Chelsea where I’m greeted by two women with blindingly white smiles, holding a stack of athletic clothing. It’s a typical techy office: fluorescent light so bright I forget what time of day it is, glass conference rooms, and a fridge stacked with little cups of Greek yogurt and Spindrifts, probably.
I’m ushered inside the massage room where the set-up is somehow biblical: a table waits for me in the center, lit from its underbelly, with giant robot arms recoiled politely. Just like scripture. I shed my clothes and don the compression spandex that substitutes the massage oil. Rule one of Aescape: Thy robot doth not touch thy skin.
“Our research said one in five [people] would get massages regularly if they weren’t from a person,” Eric Litman, the founder and CEO tells me over Zoom a couple months after my massage. He’s perched at a conference table, his high-tech video camera autofocuses and zooms in on whatever makes noise, like a robot’s eye, whipping me from his face to his typing assistant. Litman emphasizes that Aescape is not meant to replace human massages, but is simply a different product. It’s for someone in a time crunch, someone who doesn’t want to be naked with a stranger, or someone who wants more control within a massage… and would prefer a robot, would be the end of that sentence. Litman doesn’t say that, though. Of course, the robots are also intended to maximize efficiency, promising to deliver the value of a full 60-minute massage in just 30 minutes, for $60 bucks. (“Because, as we all know, the sign of a truly great massage is hoping it’ll be over soon,” Stephen Colbert says.)
Whatever ideas they were banking on are paying off. Upon release, Aescape sparked a media frenzy, and they’ve since expanded to the Palace Hotel in New York, Privai Spa in Miami, and, as of December, Pause Studio in Los Angeles. They raised $85 million in funding, and were featured in the Time 200 Best Inventions of 2024, alongside a “blue collar robot,” a “steady surgeon,” and a “hard-working humanoid bot.” Industrious!
If Aescape’s success is a sign of the times, no time like the present, eh? Once I’m on the table with my head in the hole, I’m face-to-face with a screen that tells me to hold still. Using infrared sensors, it clocks 1.2 million data points in a 3D scan and presents a mini avatar of my musculature. I hear the robot’s arms extend in a whirring noise like a vending machine, and there’s an awkward pause, just before it lays its hands on me, where I half expect a whispered “just relax.”
Up until that point, I was all in. But as it places its heated metal knubs (“Aerpoints” to use their nomenclature) on my skin, I have a flash of the first lines of a book I read in college, Elia Canetti’s Crowds in Power that goes, “There is nothing that man fears more than the touch of the unknown.” I have an acute awareness of my flesh, my frailty, the flimsy spandex, my atrophied muscles. I’m no match for this beast!
“We hear from quite a few people that they fall asleep on the table just enjoying it,” says Litman, to my bewilderment. Calling their lodestar Brookstones—you know, those wimpy foot massagers that bulge through faux leather—would be, categorically, an insult to Aescape. “We have a team of massage therapists here that teach the robots with sensors on their hands,” says Litman. While Aescape isn’t aiming to replace all touch with robot knubs, they say they’re helping to address a shortage of massage therapists in the U.S. This checks out: While there’s been roughly a 5 percent increase in massage therapists in the last decade, demand has skyrocketed. (Between 2022 and 2023 alone there was a 16 percent increase in demand and the massage therapy market is projected to more than double in size in the next decade, from $65.23 billion in 2024 to $146.13 billion by 2034.)
The next thirty minutes are marked by an ambivalence that’s unusual for me. The panicky feeling stays while the robot kneads along my spine, too close to my vital organs. Can I escape from Aescape if the robot malfunctions and bludgeons me? What if its cool strokes turn malevolent? No, it’s been tested endlessly, I’m sure. The robot’s arms slide my shirt up a few times (unsportsmanlike!) and when I turn around, the arms recoil, as if in offense. But I begin to fiddle with the different controls on the screen, changing the pressure, display and music which quell some anxieties.
“It doesn’t sound very healing to me,” Emily Dunuwila, a health initiatives coordinator at Cornell University and a licensed massage therapist, says. “Touch has the capacity to be incredibly healing, but it matters how we touch. Human touch generally is known to reduce cortisol and increase things like serotonin and dopamine which can help our body to get into that rest and digest mode.” As for the touch of a robot? She’s skeptical that it wouldn’t increase cortisol, the stress hormone, and therefore cause muscles to contract (the opposite of the intended goal). But she says what makes for a good massage is trust.
And there are elements of trust in Aescape. The screen displays a breakdown of each section of the massage and how long it will spend on each movement. If I don’t like something, I press a button and it’ll move on, obediently. Once we move to the glutes and quads portion my panic begins to fade. I increase the pressure and marvel that I don’t have to muster the courage to tell a human masseuse. In the taxonomy of people that would enjoy Aescape, the spectrum is: doesn’t want to be naked and touched by a stranger, to, got their pump on, pressed for time, and wants to blitz their glutes for fifteen minutes. As a closeted gym bro, I might really like this!
The robot uses machine learning to understand how to tailor the massage specifically to you, but there are still kinks. Twice throughout the massage the robot shutters, pulls back and says it needs to readjust the stroke placement. By the end, there was something endearing about its flaws. It’s learning, too.
I tell Litman about my fear of being pummeled, and he tells me, “The reality is, the arms aren’t strong enough to push harder than the limits, and we have the limit set in software anyway. You’re in control.”
And there is something to be said about a therapy of maximum control. Our world is curated to our liking—tell the algorithm you don’t like something and poof!—but, especially recently, it feels like it’s blooming out of our control. Perhaps outside the bulking robo-arms and somatic release, the real therapy that Aescape offers is an exercise of maximum control. And for many, this is exactly what needs massaging. Paradoxically, for me, it was a ferocious exercise in letting go.
The thirty minutes is up. I put on my clothes, give the robot a pat, and am handed a Spindrift that I sip on my way out. On the street, the air is sharp. My body feels fresh—from my escape or the massage, it’s hard to tell.",Eloise King-Clements,"March 27, 2025"
https://goop.com/wellness/health/ozempic-microdosing/,The Rise of Ozempic Microdosing,"Much like those who opt for “baby Botox” or “MicroTox” to smooth wrinkles subtly without a totally frozen face, many people are now microdosing Ozempic to shed a few pounds, while minimizing unpleasant side effects. And now, with new research pointing to broader health benefits—including potential Alzheimer’s protection—losing weight isn’t the only reason people are lining up to ask their doctors about these ‘miracle’ drugs called GLP-1s (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists).
So is microdosing—or taking less than the standard dose—of GLP-1 weight loss drugs (which include Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound) a legit practice?
Beverly Tchang, MD, an endocrinologist and obesity specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, has been instructing her patients to microdose long before the current GLP-1 revolution. When Ozempic (generically known as semaglutide) was approved by the FDA for adults with type 2 diabetes in 2017, it became clear that even the lowest doses were effective for weight loss, she says.
Yes, microdosing is considered off-label—it’s not in the package instructions—but it’s still evidence-based, Tchang says. For example, while the standard starting dose of Ozempic is 0.25 milligrams, studies have shown that a dose of 0.05 milligrams per day is both safe and effective in people with obesity. Lowering the dose can also help people who are struggling with certain side-effects find relief: “Microdosing really helps with GI side effects, like nausea and constipation and reflux,” Tchang says. Anecdotally, people have shared that smaller doses have also helped them avoid other less common symptoms like brain fog.
Tchang believes that tailoring doses to the individual just makes sense. “It’s the same concept as personalized nutrition.” The mission of the doctor is to treat the patient with the lowest therapeutic dose, she says. “Why go beyond that? Use the lowest dose that works for you. That’s the crux of microdosing.”
Before “microdosing” entered the lexicon, it was called “click counting” and could be done only with the GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, which come in multidose injectable pens, Tchang explains. But now, the rise of GLP-1 compounded medications—custom-made and available through online pharmacies at a fraction of the cost—has broadened access to these drugs and also sparked controversy. Unlike their brand-name counterparts, compounded medications aren’t FDA-approved.
“The landscape is riskier than if you were to get that prescription from your doctor who writes an FDA-approved medication that is evidence-based, that has had clinical trials, and it comes directly from the manufacturer,” says Tchang, who consults with both Ro, a telehealth pharmacy that offers compounded semaglutide, and Ozempic’s maker, Novo Nordisk.
Nevertheless, many people are seeking out microdoses of compounded GLP-1 drugs through med-spas or plastic surgeon’s offices to lose weight without going to more drastic measures. And while not recommended by doctors, some are even buying online courses from influencers and injecting themselves at home.
But as convincing as the marketing can be, when it comes to people who don’t have obesity, we simply don’t have the data to support microdosing, says Elizabeth Sharp, MD, a board-certified internal medicine physician, an assistant professor at Mount Sinai Hospital, and the founder of Health Meets Wellness, a concierge medical practice in New York City.
With less information about how those at a lower weight will respond, there’s intrinsically a higher risk, Tchang says. For example, it’s possible that taking weight loss medications at a low dose long-term could lead to loss of bone density and skeletal muscle mass, Sharp says—changes that are hard to reverse, especially as you get older.
Despite the lack of data, the buzz is hard to ignore. “A lot of my patients are asking about it,” says Sharp, who is hopeful about the idea of prescribing microdoses of GLP-1 medications for her nonobese patients in the not-so-distant future. “I just think we don’t know right now what that right dose is. And so it is a gray area where people are really experimenting. There isn’t an exact science to it.”
The medical community is also grappling with the idea that current definitions of obesity might be wrong—and leaving out people who can benefit from these drugs, Tchang says. “We’re recognizing that the disease of obesity is far more complex than just a number on the scale,” she says. “Obesity really is a problem with energy metabolism. It has to do with how your body handles those calories, whether the body chooses to store them or to burn them. And if it chooses to store them, how does it decide whether to store it in fat or muscle, for example?”
In other words, factors like your family history, cholesterol profile, body composition, and how you carry weight should be considered in addition to your weight. Even your ethnicity can play a role, Tchang says: Data shows that some ethnicities start to have metabolic problems like heart disease and diabetes at a relatively lower weight.
As Tchang points out, some people may not fit this evolved view of obesity but still want to lose a few pounds to feel their best—or to prevent future health problems. For example, beyond weight management, emerging research suggests that GLP-1 drugs have the potential to prevent heart attacks and strokes and even support people with addiction to quit smoking or drinking.
A newly published study found that people prescribed the drugs had a reduced risk of not just substance-abuse disorders, but also suicidal ideations, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders—as well as clotting problems, infections, liver failure, fatty liver disease, and liver cancer, says Ziyad Al-Aly, M.D., a physician-scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and an author on the study. “Very importantly, we also saw a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia,” Al-Aly says. “And that’s really a significant breakthrough because currently there are no good treatments for [them].”
Still, the study was observational and conducted in people with type 2 diabetes, so the findings may not apply to people without diabetes who are taking GLP-1s, Tchang says. It’s tempting to assume a cause-and-effect relationship, but the truth is, these types of studies are really meant to generate more questions than answers, she adds.
Another question that remains is whether microdosing would offer similar benefits. “We don’t know because what we studied is the therapeutic, FDA-approved doses,” Al-Aly says. Still, it’s possible that someone looking to lose a little bit of weight and also kick a smoking habit could kill two birds with one stone by talking to their doctor about off-label microdosing, Al-Aly says.
Until we get prevention trials—which our healthcare system isn’t incentivized to invest in—we just don’t know whether people who are fairly healthy and don’t have a lot of weight to lose can benefit from taking these medications, Tchang adds. For now, the debate around microdosing Ozempic mirrors that of microdosing psychedelic substances like LSD or psilocybin—some believe it’s a way to tap into mental health perks without a full-blown trip, while others say it’s under-researched or placebo.
For the Ozempic-curious, navigating the world of GLP-1 medications can feel like the Wild West. If you’re considering exploring microdosing, your first best step is to consult with your doctor to discuss the benefits and risks.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/supplements-to-support-brain-health/,5 Supplements to Support Brain Health as You Age,"Kristine Profeta, MD, wants people to understand that we can have healthy cognition well into old age. “The aged brain is not inevitable. The aged brain is a disease,” she says. In her precision medicine practice, where she mostly works with complex chronic illness, she sees patients with brain health concerns across the board: Many of them would like to be a little quicker; others come in with severe brain fog that could indicate early-onset dementia. “And then there are 80-year-olds who have taken care of their brains and bodies and are as sharp as any 30 or 40-year-olds that I talk to,” she says.
With the right care, Profeta says, we can all maintain healthy cognition well into old age. The first thing to understand is that the body is a single system that can’t be segmented; how you care for your body in its entirety will show up in the health of your brain. The second is that the root of most dysfunction is missing nutrients and chronic, systemic inflammation.
Her brain health strategy starts right there: Provide nutrients for structural support and activate the body’s innate anti-inflammatory abilities, with benefits for the entire system. Here, her recommendations to support brain health (and overall wellness):
Phospolipids make up the double-layered membranes of nearly every single cell in your body, including your brain. Ideally, your body would get all the building blocks it needs to build and maintain these membranes through the food you eat. Profeta says that because our food systems often don’t provide all the nutrients we need to support optimal health—you can point a finger at industrial agriculture for that one—she recommends her patients test for what nutrients they’re missing and make up the gaps with well-formulated supplements.
For healthy cell membranes, Profeta likes BodyBio’s liquid phosphaditylcholine, which they call BodyBio PC (Phospholipid Complex). It’s manufactured so that the phosphaditylcholine molecules inside are organized into liposomes: bubbles of phospholipids with the same double-layered structure as the membranes in your body. “Liposomes can cross cell membranes and get absorbed more readily,” she says.
Studies show that the optimal ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3s in our diets is four to one, Profeta says. That’s been established since the ‘90s. But today, you usually hear people pushing for omega-3s and condemning omega-6s—especially those that come from seed oils. (On seed oils, Profeta says: Unadulterated oils extracted from raw seeds are typically good for us.)
Overdoing omega-3s eventually does more harm than good. She suggests making a trail mix with a blend of natural nuts and seeds, including walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and hemp seeds to get closer to the ideal ratio to fight inflammation in the body.
Typically, Profeta says, people think of inflammation as something that gets turned on in the body when we’re unhealthy. Really though, she explains, our bodies are set up for inflammation, and an unhealthy system simply fails to turn inflammation off.
Specialized pro-resolving mediators, or SPMs, are omega-3 derivatives that help the body manage inflammation, including the low-grade inflammation that can damage brain health long-term. She chooses to supplement with SPMs.
Methylation is a complex pathway that impacts thousands of reactions in the body. It is one of the core detoxification pathways, and among hundreds of other things, it is necessary to make optimal neurotransmitters. That’s why it’s essential to support methylation in today’s world: If we don’t get enough B vitamins and methyl groups (methylated B vitamins are a way to get both) then we will not be able to optimally detoxify or support brain health, Profeta says.
“It’s super, super important to be drinking a mineralized form of water or taking a mineral supplement as an active supplement every day,” Profeta says. Minerals play fundamental and vital roles in the body’s communication systems as ions and enzyme mediators.
Profeta is concerned that, like other nutrient building blocks in our bodies, we don’t get enough minerals from our food—and that the presence of potentially-toxic heavy metals outcompete the healthy ones for the same enzymes.
Lastly, Profeta emphasizes the importance of good sleep, which allows the brain to clear out cellular debris. She advocates for good sleep hygiene and a wind-down routine, which trains the brain’s limbic system—putting away screens, turning the lights down low, and reading something light.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/avoid-digestive-issues-while-traveling/,How to Avoid—and Fix—Digestive Issues While You’re Traveling,"When your routines, diet, and physical activity levels—which all impact gut health—are disrupted, your digestive system can become imbalanced. That’s why any kind of travel—whether it’s for a night or a week—can feel like a big disruption. “Then you get a little bloated, abdominal distension, cramping, constipation, or diarrhea,” says Elizabeth Sharp, MD, IFMCP, a functional and board-certified internal medicine physician. “None of that is fun—not at any time, but especially when you’re on the move.”
Sharp recommends doing six things to help maintain a healthy gut while you’re traveling. As always, talk with your doctor about any gut health concerns and seek emergency care when needed.
“One of the biggest issues that people experience as they travel is that they’re eating different foods than they do in their day-to-day lives,” says Sharp. Of course, trying new foods is a key part of the travel experience. To help stabilize your gut, Sharp suggests incorporating fruits and vegetables as much as possible—the fiber helps regulate the gut.
As an extra precaution, she recommends eating fruits that you must peel to eat (e.g., bananas, oranges, and avocados) and cooked vegetables. This helps reduce exposure, as much as possible, to microbes that could cause traveler’s diarrhea.
Prebiotics balance out gut microbiota by providing food sources for healthy gut bacteria and inhibit the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. When you’re on the go, Sharp says that unripe bananas (they contain the prebiotic inulin and prebiotic-like starches that aren’t found in ripe bananas), flaxseed, and oatmeal (the less processed, the better) are some convenient ways to get them.
Generally, research shows that prebiotics like inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) can help prevent and improve gut imbalances like constipation and diarrhea.
For probiotic foods, Sharp says that kimchi and yogurt are great sources to incorporate into your meals whenever you can. When you’re supplementing with probiotics, research shows that Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus fermentum may be effective in preventing and treating traveler’s diarrhea, with Saccharomyces boulardii playing a key role.
For constipation, studies suggest that an array of probiotics can help, including Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium animalis. And for abdominal bloating and distension (and other symptoms of IBS), the research is less clear, but Escherichia, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium strains may help.
Choosing a probiotic with as many of these strains as possible can increase your chances of the supplement addressing various gut imbalances.
Giving yourself time between meals helps your body move food through the digestive tract and regulates your gut, Sharp says. It allows the migrating motor complex (MMC)—a pattern of gut movement that’s designed to propel food down the small and large intestines—to activate.
About two hours after a meal, the MMC is triggered, and it reengages every 90 to 120 minutes until you eat again. But it activates only between meals—when you’re not eating or drinking (except for noncaloric beverages like water, plain coffee, or tea). That means if your meals aren’t spaced at least three to four hours apart, you can increase your chances of constipation.
Staying hydrated helps keep all your bodily functions flowing, including your digestive system. Sharp says that in addition to getting plenty of water, adding electrolytes like magnesium, potassium, and calcium can help you rehydrate.
“Exercise is one of the best ways to help in terms of keeping some regularity with digestion,” says Sharp. Research shows that it increases metabolism and acutely modifies gut microbiota activity to optimize digestive health. And it can improve mood by regulating the gut-brain axis.
Sharp says that it doesn’t have to be an intense gym workout: “If you walk, especially while you’re exploring a new city, you could get up to anywhere from four to six miles a day without even realizing it.”
Sharp says that having a routine can indirectly help with digestive health—it sends a message to our brain that we’re winding down for the night, which triggers our mind and body to relax. This improves digestion and sets us up for a better night’s sleep, which is when our MMC is activated and digestive repair occurs.
To start, she recommends avoiding food a few hours before bedtime—it allows your blood sugar levels to return to baseline, which helps your body relax. When you get closer to bedtime, she says to take at least five minutes to wind down before bed by doing a short meditation, listening to calming music, or putting away your phone and other electronics. “Whatever works best for you,” says Sharp. The goal is to take a relaxing moment before going to bed to prepare for a more restorative sleep.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/lymphatic-massages-services/,What Can—and Can’t—Lymphatic Drainage Massages Do?,"Our lymphatic vessels are designed to regularly move fluid that’s filled with various substances like proteins, minerals, and white blood cells throughout the body. When we contract our muscles as we move, it creates pressure that allows the fluid to flow. But if the lymphatic system is impaired—due to lymphedema (a chronic disease that leads to accumulation of fluids in the body), surgeries, chronic inflammation, or lack of movement for long periods of time—excess fluids can accumulate in the body, which in turn impairs the immune and circulatory systems.
Lymphatic drainage massages are designed to increase the flow of fluids in the body so that there’s less buildup. They can help increase blood circulation and immune function, too.
Tina Tsan, DAOM, CLT, a certified lymphatic drainage massage therapist, has performed this type of massage for 18 years, primarily for clients with lymphedema. But within the last five years, her clientele has expanded to include postoperative patients: Doctors now refer individuals who’ve had orthopedic surgery—and, at increasing rates, cosmetic surgery, including liposuction, breast implants, tummy tucks, Brazilian butt lifts, and facelifts. “All of these surgical procedures result in postsurgical swelling,” Tsan says. That’s because most surgeries inevitably disrupt the lymphatic vessels, which allow fluid to circulate throughout the body.
Most recently, Tsan has seen more people request drainage massages for nonsurgical reasons, like to reduce inflammation caused by lupus, Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis, digestive issues, and other inflammatory conditions. And she sees clients who want the massages for preventive care—to help their bodies detox, to improve circulation, and to support immunity.
But when it comes to using lymphatic drainage massages for weight management—an application for which Tsan has also seen an uptick in requests—she says there’s no scientific evidence to support its effectiveness. It can help with bloating, she says, because it can move fluid buildup in the abdomen area and decrease inflammation. “But specifically emulsifying fats to give you a flat stomach—I don’t think it does that,” she says.
You might wonder where the fluid drains to after the massage. “You’re going to eliminate it from your body via urination,” Tsan says. Most people usually urinate soon, sometimes immediately, after the lymphatic massage.
Credentials are key when looking for a lymphatic massage therapist: A CLT (certified lymphedema therapist) or an MLD (manual lymphatic drainage) therapist is the most reputable. A massage therapist without a lymphatic drainage massage certification, Tsan says, is not qualified to do a lymphatic massage—there’s an additional 135 hours of training required to learn the proper technique.
You can find a qualified professional in your area through the Academy of Lymphatic Studies or Norton School of Lymphatic Therapy. Tsan’s tip: Ask your therapist whether they’re trained in the Vodder Method—it’s the original manual lymphatic drainage massage technique, named after the person credited with developing it. She says that if they are, it’s a good sign that they’re properly trained.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/sweat-and-your-health/,What Could Sweat-Sensing Devices Tell You about Your Health?,"We all sweat. It can be inconvenient (and annoying), but it has a purpose: to help us maintain a steady body temperature so we don’t overheat.
Sweat is mostly water. But it also contains electrolytes (e.g., sodium, potassium, chloride), metabolites (e.g., glucose, lactate), proteins (e.g., cytokines, interleukins), vitamins and minerals (vitamins C and D, calcium, zinc), and even hormones (e.g., estrogen, progesterone, cortisol). Which means that measuring what exactly is in our sweat, using an arm or finger patch, has alluring potential to lend insight into our overall health without drawing blood.
There are some sweat-sensing devices currently on the market, like the Gx Sweat Patch, but they can measure electrolytes and metabolites only. These devices are primarily marketed to athletes, who can use them to analyze sweat during workouts and optimize their rehydration strategies.
“Sweat is this noninvasive window into the body,” says Tyler Ray, PhD, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Hawaii and a scientific advisor for Epicore Biosystems, the creator of the Gx Sweat Patch. His lab has created a sweat-sensing device generated by a 3D printer to stick to your forearm. “It allows us to collect sweat very precisely—as it’s coming out from the body over a continuous phase—so we can look at what’s happening in sweat in real time,” Ray says. (For now, it’s used only in research contexts.)
Wei Gao, PhD, a medical engineering professor at the California Institute of Technology, has published data showing the potential for the stress hormone cortisol to be measured with a sweat-sensing patch. His study suggests that cortisol levels in sweat correlate with cortisol levels in blood, validating the potential for this hormone (and others) to be accurately measured by sweat-sensing devices.
Earlier this year, Gao’s lab was the first to publish data measuring estradiol—a form of estrogen—using a sweat-sensing device. Gao says that this finding shows a potential to change women’s health: Frequently monitoring hormone fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle or during perimenopause and menopause, for example, could provide data that would expand our current knowledge and view of these physiological phases. There’s also potential for sweat-sensing devices to help diagnose and treat infectious diseases, brain and mental health conditions, hormone imbalances, and other health concerns.
But developing this technology doesn’t come without challenges. “Sweat, of course, has its own limitation,” Gao says. The size of proteins and hormones must be considered—it’s easier to measure small molecules from sweat than larger ones because smaller ones diffuse through the skin’s pores more freely.
Scientists also need enough sweat to measure these biomarkers effectively. “The challenge is that there is typically a hundredfold dilution in what is measured in sweat versus what you could measure in blood,” Ray says. That means it’s much harder to detect the same biomarkers that would be present in blood, and a certain volume of sweat is needed to do that.
Creating sweat sensors to measure various biomarkers poses additional challenges, but the researchers I talked to are focused on their vision. “Being able to fully monitor and understand what’s happening with your body in real time—when you want it and when you need it—is going to be really transformative,” Ray says.","Denise John, PhD","June 27, 2024"
https://goop.com/wellness/health/ahiflower-omega-3-oil-for-dogs/,A Dog Wellness Brand’s Innovative Approach to Supplements—and Treats,"Omega-3s, the healthy fats that are beneficial for our overall health, are also great for dogs. They are anti-inflammatory fatty acids: They activate parts of the immune system that help to reduce inflammation. Research shows that omega-3s can improve a dog’s brain development, cognition, gut health, kidney function, and heart and joint health. And some studies suggest that omega-3s (together with amino acids and prebiotics) can help shorten a dog’s recovery time after surgery.
“Omega-3s can also help improve coat quality in conditions that may cause diminished coat or skin health, such as allergies, hypothyroidism, or other metabolic disorders,” says Stephanie Liff, DVM, the medical director at Pure Paws Veterinary Care.
Research shows that it’s important that omega-3s are paired with omega-6s—a fatty acid that, when in balance with omega-3s, works to heal and repair cells throughout the body. Liff says to look for supplement formulas that have a ratio of five omega-6s (or fewer) to every one omega-3. Too many omega-6s, when not balanced with omega-3s, can lead to chronic inflammation.
We like the omega oil supplement from WagWell—a dog wellness brand that works with food scientists, board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and top pet product formulators to create some of the best treats and supplements to support a dog’s overall health. (You can find some of its products at select goop stores.) WagWell’s omega supplement uses Ahiflower oil instead of fish: It’s a trademarked vegan oil that comes from the Buglossoides arvensis plant, which is naturally rich in omega-3s. The oil is designed to meet a four-to-one ratio, which means it has four omega-6s to every one omega-3—a healthy balance. It has a variety of omega-3s—including SDA (stearidonic acid), ALA, and GLA—which increases the bioavailability of these healthy fats. (And, of course, it saves many fish from an untimely demise.)
Liff blends the oil directly into her dog’s food—WagWell recommends one pump per day for dogs under 60 pounds and two pumps for dogs over 60 pounds—and finds an empty bowl shortly after, a sign of her dog’s approval.
When it comes to treats, Liff says that lean meats and fish and many fruits and veggies work well—just steer clear of garlic, onions, raisins, grapes, avocado, and nuts. She says most pets can tolerate peanuts, but they usually don’t need the added fat.
Liff gives her dog WagWell’s cheese and beef treats, too—they’re freeze-dried to preserve nutrients and flavor and don’t contain fillers, corn, wheat, or soy. (You can use them as a food topper or as a high-protein snack.) Her dog also likes having Omega Chews and Mobility Chews added to her food. “They entice her to eat, whereas otherwise she would wait all day.”
Liff recommends that you consult your vet prior to supplementing or adding treats to your dog’s diet.

The latest installment delivered on all fronts. Thanks to our partners at Hyatt—who graciously hosted us at the Park Hyatt Aviara, one of the hotels in their Wellbeing Collective—the whole weekend had the backdrop of sprawling, lush grounds and gorgeous views. (More on that later.) The day’s highlights included a morning talk between psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb and grief therapist Claire Bidwell Smith, an aromatherapy meditation class led by Miraval Life in Balance Spa specialist Claudia Yates, and a workshop on the science of attachment led by the renowned couples therapist and researcher Stan Tatkin. A meaningful chat between Gwyneth, Emma Grede, and Justina Blakeney brought the day to a close.
Without further ado, here’s everything that was in this year’s (very heavy) gift bags.
Between classes and workshops, guests had time to explore our wellness playground. Experiences included astrology readings by KJ Atlas; B12 shots by the Hydration Room; ear seeds by Dr. Natazia Stolberg, LAc, DACM; gua sha scalp messages by YINA; red-light therapy by HigherDOSE; a salt electrolyte station by Redmond Real Salt; and wellness cocktails by MyWellCo.
The guests who spent the weekend with us (we call them our Weekenders) stayed at the Park Hyatt Aviara for two nights. Their curated itinerary reflected so much of what the Hyatt Wellbeing Collective properties have to offer: connection and community through a stunning dinner alfresco, true restoration via treatments at the Miraval Life in Balance Spa Aviara, and immersion in nature thanks to a hike along the Batiquitos Lagoon.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/do-your-workout-clothes-contain-endocrine-disrupting-microplastics/,Do Your Workout Clothes Contain Endocrine-Disrupting Microplastics?,"We’ve come across some alarming headlines in the last year suggesting that workout clothes potentially expose us to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Before throwing out all our workout gear, we paused—and decided to investigate. Here’s what we found after digging into the research and talking to five experts in environmental health, plastic toxicity, and bioengineering.
As the name suggests, microplastics are tiny particles of plastic, less than five millimeters long. They fall into two categories: Primary microplastics, which are microplastics directly released into the environment as small particles. And secondary microplastics, which come from larger plastics (like bags, bottles, or fishing nets) that break off into tiny pieces over time.
The world’s largest source of primary microplastics is clothing—accounting for an estimated 35 percent. (Car tires are the second largest primary microplastic source.) About 70 percent of clothes produced around the world are made from plastic (synthetic) materials: polyester, nylon, acrylic, and elastane (a polyurethane-polyurea copolymer that’s also known by its brand names, Lycra and spandex). Tiny pieces of synthetic fabric break off from clothing—due to friction caused by washing and wearing—creating microplastics.
Because of their chemical structure, microplastics attach easily to known endocrine-disrupting chemicals—including dioxins, pesticides (like DDT), brominated flame retardants, phthalates, and bisphenol A (BPA)—in the environment. That means that the endocrine disruptors go everywhere that microplastics do: domestic water systems, rivers, lakes, oceans, and the air.
Eventually they make their way into our bodies—scientists have found evidence of microplastics and nanoplastics (smaller pieces of microplastics) in human blood, intestines, lungs, kidneys, livers, hearts, reproductive organs, and even placentas. They can disrupt critical reproductive and metabolic hormone-regulating connections, like the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, as well as the HP-testicular, HP-thyroid, and HP-adrenal axes, for example. Some studies suggest that microplastics disturb the immune system’s normal response and damage immune cells.
Some of the same harmful chemicals that attach to microplastics from the environment, like BPA, are also found in clothes that are made from synthetic materials, according to Kizzy Charles-Guzman, the chief executive officer at the Center for Environmental Health, a nonprofit organization that works to reduce people’s exposure to toxic chemicals. These synthetic materials are not unique to workout clothing, but how we wear workout garments may mean that they pose a greater health risk than other clothing does, at least hypothetically.
For example, workout clothes, like sport bras and leggings, are designed to fit tightly—directly against our skin. Research shows that microplastics can enter the body through sweat glands, hair follicles, and skin wounds; the close contact could increase the chances of harmful chemicals getting into our bodies. Plus, we probably sweat in workout gear more than we do in any other kind of clothing—preliminary data suggest that sweat may increase the chances of microplastics and toxic chemicals moving through the skin into the body.
If and how our workout clothes are leaching microplastics and endocrine disruptors directly into our bodies is theoretical, though. “Our understanding of the full impact of microplastics as carriers of endocrine disruptors—that’s still evolving,” says Jeff Karp, PhD, a Harvard Medical School professor and MIT bioengineer. We need more investigation to elucidate the exact impact on our health—and true solutions will follow. “Any time there’s a problem that gets to be well understood in society, it then creates this crucible moment to focus innovation on it,” Karp says.
What we do know for certain is that microplastics are getting into our bodies—in different ways and from various sources. And reducing the chances for them to do so can benefit our health. There are a few ways you can limit your microplastic exposure from clothing, along with the amount of microplastics you release into the world.
For more information about what you can do to reduce the number of microfibers that enter the environment and to minimize your plastic footprint, the Plastic Soup guide and app are great places to start. And if you’d like to learn more ways to limit your exposure to microplastics and harmful chemicals in your workout clothes (and other products), the Center for Environmental Health and Toxic-Free Future are excellent resources.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/which-milk-is-best-for-your-body-and-the-planet/,Which Milk Is Best for Your Body—and the Planet?,"Whether you’re navigating the dairy aisle or ordering a latte, choosing the best milk can be more complicated than we’d like. There’s taste to consider, of course, but many of us are also concerned about how our milk choices affect our health and impact the environment.
“This conversation is never straightforward,” says nutritionist Maya Feller, MS, RD, CDN. “What’s good for one person may not be suitable for another.” There are many factors to consider—like food allergies and sensitivities, nutrition, environmental impact, animal welfare, taste, and texture. Even if one milk has a compelling nutritional profile, your overall health is the priority—avoid milks that include ingredients that you may be allergic or sensitive to, no matter how good they seem on paper. And for all your health concerns, like your nutritional needs or food allergies or sensitivities, consult your doctor and nutritionist.
If you’re considering the environmental impact of your milk choice, Dora Marinova, PhD, a professor of sustainability at the Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, says that there’s more to consider than the milk itself. “How we package milk has a huge environmental footprint,” says Marinova. “If you use packaging that cannot be recycled or decomposed, you are solving one problem but creating others—in some cases, the environmental footprint of the packaging is 10 times higher than the content of the milk.”
For example, Marinova says many plant-based milks come in boxes that are lined with plastics. It’s difficult—and, in some locations, impossible—to recycle them. She recommends that you check with your local recycling facility or purchase milks that come in standard recyclable containers. (We also like the company TerraCycle, which works to recycle single-use plastics and other hard-to-recycle materials.)
Here’s a nutritional and environmental breakdown of the most popular milks in the US. Note: Values may vary depending on the brand you purchase, whether it’s fortified with vitamins and minerals, and whether it comes with added flavors. Look for brands with fewer binding ingredients and added sugars.
Nutrition: Compared to plant-based milks, Feller says that cow’s milk is more nutrient-dense: It has about 8.2 grams of protein per serving (or eight ounces); at least 20 percent of the daily value of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin B2 (riboflavin); about 10 percent of the daily value of vitamin D; and about 11.5 grams of sugar. It also has some heart-healthy fat in it, she says, and the lowest percentage of water—88 percent—compared to plant-based milks.
Environmental: Cow’s milk is well-known for its high environmental footprint—including land use, greenhouse gas emissions, fresh water use, and eutrophication (the rapid growth of microorganisms in a body of water, caused by runoff, that leads to oxygen depletion). Its environmental impact is higher than that of all plant-based milk options by at least two times.
Nutrition: Of all the plant-based milks, Feller says that soy stands out as being the most nutritionally robust. An eight-ounce cup has about 92 percent water, 6 grams of protein, at least 20 percent of the daily value of calcium and vitamin B2, 10 percent of the daily value of phosphorus and vitamin D, and 9.7 grams of sugar. “The other thing about soy is it’s a complete protein because it has all the essential amino acids that we require as humans,” says Marinova.
Environment: There are also environmental benefits to soy milk. “Soy is a legume, which means that it is very good for the soil,” says Marinova. It fixes nitrogen, meaning it converts nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form that can be used by plants—which helps fertilize the soil, so fertilizers aren’t needed during crop rotations.
Nutrition: Almond milk is the top-selling alternative milk in the US, yet it’s the least nutritionally robust. “Almond milk has such a big percentage of water in it,” says Marinova. That is, 97 percent water—the largest percentage among plant-based milks. One serving of almond milk has 1 gram of protein, which is one of the lowest of all the alternative milks (except rice and coconut), and about 6 grams of sugar. Its calcium levels, however, are the highest compared to many alternative milks—exceeding 20 percent of the daily value—and it has 10 percent of the daily value of vitamin D.
Environment: The environmental impact of almond milk is one of the greatest of plant-based milks. Compared to other plant-based milks, almond milk uses the most fresh water: 372 liters per liter of milk. Rice milk requires 270, oat milk requires 48, and soy requires 28.
Nutrition: An eight-ounce glass of oat milk contains about 91 percent water. And it has about 2.7 grams of protein; at least 10 percent of the daily value of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D; 20 percent of the daily value of vitamin B2; and 10 grams of sugar. “I know that there’s a bunch of discussion around oat milk spiking blood sugar levels,” says Feller. “I have to say, I’ve looked at the research and I haven’t come to my own conclusion yet.” When it comes to managing your blood sugar, she says it’s all about the quantity of sugar being consumed (whether you’re drinking a latte with alt-milk or eating dessert) and what you pair it with—preferably protein to help manage your blood sugar levels. If you prefer oat milk but you’re concerned about it spiking your blood sugar levels, Feller suggests that you pair it with a meal.
Environment: “Oat milk is really good in terms of its environmental footprint—very, very low,” says Marinova. “Yet it’s grown as a monoculture, which makes it vulnerable to all kinds of bugs and pests. Therefore, we see increased use of pesticides, including glyphosate, which essentially have potentially toxic implications.”
Nutrition: Coconut milk—the one in the cartons, not the canned coconut milk for baking—is another popular alternative. Per serving, it has about 0.5 grams of protein, more than 20 percent of the daily value of calcium, 10 percent of the daily value of vitamin D, and about 3 grams of sugar.
Environment: Coconut milk also has a very low environmental footprint—one of the lowest of all plant-based milks. And it requires very little water to grow: 3 liters per liter of milk. Yet the increased demand for it has had a big impact: “We’ve seen a lot of devastation of rainforests so that we can grow coconut trees—that’s destruction of native habitat,” says Marinova.
Nutrition: A glass of rice milk contains about 89 percent water, 0.7 grams of protein, and 12 grams of sugar. It also has 20 of the percent daily value of calcium and vitamin B2 and 10 percent of the daily value of phosphorus and vitamin D.
Environment: “Rice has a higher water footprint,” says Marinova. “It’s about half of that of cow’s.” And its carbon footprint is highest compared to soy, oat, and almond milks. “Rice paddocks naturally develop methane, so when you grow rice, you also add methane in the atmosphere; methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.”
But rice doesn’t require a lot of land to grow. “Rice milk is probably the most efficient, from a land-use aspect,” says Marinova. “In the case of cow’s milk, it requires about 9 square meters per year for one liter of milk, and for rice, it’s 0.3.” It has one of the lowest land-use of plant-based milks (oat uses 0.76 square meters per year; soy, 0.66; and almond, 0.5).
Some alternative milks, like hemp, hazelnut, and macadamia, are not as abundant as the others but are still great options if you can find them. “Hemp is a very versatile plant,” says Marinova. “You can use all parts of the plant—you don’t just use the seeds [for milk]. You can use the stalks to make ropes, bags, and clothes and to create building materials. Many people describe it as a game changer for the future.” According to Marinova, because hemp requires a continental climate to grow—cold, long winters and hot summers—it will take some time to commercialize hemp milk (although you can make it at home).
Another thing to consider when it comes to the environmental impact of your milk is how far it has traveled. “If you are in southern Europe, hazelnut milk may be a good option because hazelnuts grow there,” says Marinova. “The other nut milk that is quite popular in Australia and South Africa is the Australian macadamia nut. It’s very suited to the climate, and that means that it does not require as much water and it’s adaptable.”
Ultimately, the best way to choose your milk—for the environment and your body (and maybe even its taste)—is to diversify your milk choices. Mixing things up is beneficial for the environment because it minimizes the demand on one type of milk, which can have major environmental impact (e.g., devastation of rainforests or other natural habitats to keep up with the demand).
Feller says that variety is best for your body, too. “We know that when people eat varied patterns and there’s diversity [in the foods they’re eating], they tend to have a more diverse microbiome,” she says. This is very important for the gut and overall health. “That’s really what we want at the end of the day.”

https://goop.com/wellness/health/cycle-syncing-nutrition/,"What to Eat (and Avoid) during Each Phase of Your Cycle, according to a Dietitian","Shira Barlow, MS, RD, is a registered dietitian, an author, and a nutrition expert. In her book, The Food Therapist, she shares her disarming and realistic approach to uncomplicating your relationship with food. She’s currently accepting one-on-one clients.
Each phase of the menstrual cycle impacts how we feel, what we crave and what we need. In my private nutrition practice, I help clients understand what’s happening during each phase, which gives them insights into what works well for them throughout the month as their hormones shift and where things tend to get challenging. Some of my clients choose to cycle-sync, or align their lifestyle and nutrition habits to their menstrual cycles.
In my intake sessions, I ask my clients if they cycle, including how regularly they menstruate, and if they track their cycles closely. Based on their responses, we decide whether it’s appropriate to build cycle syncing into our work together. If yes, they learn what’s happening during each phase of their cycle—each is marked by the rise and fall of hormones—and how to support their bodies during that phase.
I have seen noticeable differences for those who choose to cycle sync, including more regular and predictable periods and more comfort throughout their cycles (particularly with PMS symptoms and PCOS clients). I regularly see pregnancy wins with fertility clients. (And I recently had a 40-year-old client with endometriosis have an unplanned pregnancy; she’s thrilled.) I believe cycle syncing has been valuable in those outcomes.
Before we get into it, one disclaimer: Menstrual cycles aren’t one-size-fits-all. The length of each cycle, the levels of each hormone, and the timing of ovulation can all vary from person to person. I do recommend tracking cycles on an app to make cycle-syncing more user-friendly.
If fertility is something you’re interested in tracking, a couple of my clients really like Ovia Health. For anyone who wants to track their cycle without a fertility lens, my current favorite is Aavia; I recommend this one to anyone for whom fertility is either nonapplicable or triggering and to all my tween and teen clients.
The menstrual phase, which begins the day bleeding starts and ends the day bleeding ends, typically lasts three to seven days. During this phase, estrogen and progesterone are low, the lining of the uterus is shedding, and it is common to feel dips in energy and mood. The body craves hibernation, warmth, comfort, and rest.
Nutritionally, the menstrual phase is time to focus on warming, mineral-rich, easily digestible, and deeply nourishing foods, with an emphasis on warming foods and spices like ginger (a natural antispasmodic agent helpful for those with painful cramps).
Because we often experience bloating and GI motility changes in the menstrual phase, it’s not the best time for cold foods, raw veggies, or giant salads. It is, however, a great time to do stir-fry, fajita vegetables, and big sheet pans of roasted veggies. Comfort and warmth are key during this time: My favorites recipes for this phase are braised meats and chicken, soups, curries, stews, and my anchovy chicken.
The follicular phase technically lasts from menstruation to ovulation, but for cycle-syncing purposes, it starts as soon as bleeding ends and lasts until ovulation, around 7 to 10 days. During this phase, estrogen starts to rise steadily, which tends to usher in a boost in mood and energy. The rise of luteinizing hormone (LH) ramps up libido. Much like the melting of the frost in springtime, we tend to feel more like ourselves than we did in the menstrual phase.
The ovulatory phase typically takes place roughly 14 days (give or take) after the first day of your period and around 14 days before your next period. It is the shortest phase of the cycle, often only lasting about two or three days. Estrogen and LH are at their highest, and many women tend to feel their absolute best in terms of mood, energy, sex drive, and digestion. However some women can also experience side effects of rapid surges in estrogen—particularly some cramping in the lower abdomen.
My favorite recipe during this time is my purple cabbage salad with shredded chicken or broiled salmon.
The luteal phase occurs right after ovulation ends and is typically around two weeks long, lasting right up until the next period. After ovulation, LH and estrogen drop (although estrogen does normalize again mid-luteal), while progesterone, the dominant hormone in luteal, starts to rise. The rise in progesterone, which remains high until right before menstruation starts, is responsible for an increase in both appetite and resting metabolic rate. So it’s not just that we crave more food during this time but that we actually need more food; we’re burning through more energy at rest. For this reason, I like to focus on especially hearty, delicious meals that keep blood sugar levels from dipping too low.
I recommend that my clients make sure to build in conscious indulgences during this time. My favorites are anything with dark chocolate and peanut butter, and caramelized sweet potato drenched in olive oil or ghee. My top pick for luteal recipes would be my paleo shepherd’s pie.
•••
There’s a lot to digest here, and I hope you find it helpful and instructive. But the truth is everyone has their own unique experience with the ebb and flow of hormones during a cycle. These hormone fluctuations translate to changes in comfortability, mood, hunger, sex drive, and energy levels—and a lot more—that can vary from cycle to cycle and over time as well. Hormonal birth control, conditions like PCOS, and life stages like perimenopause can make our cycles less predictable, too.
My recommendations for anyone who cycles: Get to know yourself better in this way. Plan ahead when you can. (For instance, make an extra shepherd’s pie to freeze in early luteal; energy levels drop in late luteal, when you’ll be craving comfort food the most.) Let your personal experiences with your cycle guide you and give you ideas for how to best nourish yourself. And most of all, be gentle with yourself.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/jacey-duprie-wellness-routines/,"The Easy, Breezy Morning of 2 Wellness-Minded Besties","For influencer, Damsel in Dior blogger, Wyeth founder, and mom Jacey Duprie, a set of daily rituals invites a sense of beauty and ease into what might otherwise be chaos.
Duprie has a lot on her plate; wellness keeps the boat afloat. She’s a regular meditator, a habit that kicked off years ago with a powerful experience with hypnotherapy and a life-changing retreat at Esalen. She journals. And she turns toward the beauty in ordinary moments—a cup of tea, her favorite Pilates class, a hike, some time in her garden—to power her through the rest. “It’s about carving out little moments to take care of myself,” she says.
Her big project for the year? Launching the first IRL store for her brand Wyeth, now open in Culver City’s Platform. From her home in Studio City, the drive over takes up a solid chunk of her morning. She makes the time count: She catches up on news podcasts and whatever audiobook she’s into lately. But perhaps the best way to pass the time is with great company. Today, she brought along her best friend Ashley Fultz for the drive and a wellness-y morning in Culver. (We tagged along, too.)
Duprie’s ride for the day is a rolling sanctuary, the Porsche Cayenne. It’s the ultimate luxury for people on the move: comfortable, spacious, and not only fun to drive but a pleasure to spend time in. Which is especially vital for people who log a lot of time on the road—in commutes like Duprie’s, on school pickup duty, or peacing out of town for the weekend with their most cherished people. The effect is incredible: You’ll find the Cayenne is a reprieve from a busy day, and just as valuable for you-and-me time as your destination is.",Kelly Martin,"December 7, 2023"

https://goop.com/wellness/health/mold-testing-kit/,Do At-Home Mold Testing Kits Really Work?,"“Home environments are a big part of health care,” says Michael Rubino, mold and air quality expert and president of Change the Air Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works to improve indoor air quality for people nationwide. “The dust floating around in the air that we breathe can harbor mold and toxins that place extra stress on our bodies, especially our immune system,” he says.
Rubino says that about 75 percent of the homes he inspects have significant mold or bacteria contamination, often due to a water leak. If your health is suffering from unknown causes and you suspect it’s due to mold growth, working with a physician and testing your home can help determine whether this is the case.
If you have an energy-efficient home, HVAC filtration system, or water damage, you are more likely to have mold contamination, Rubino says. Here’s why:
Rubino recently created an innovative way to test for mold called The Dust Test, which checks off three important boxes.
Surprisingly, The Dust Test is also simple and fast—it took me less than 10 minutes to collect my samples when I tried it out. And the video and written instructions made it seamless. A 20-minute consultation call with an expert is included with the kit; a mold expert explains and clarifies any questions about your results. Depending on what’s found, they’ll also guide you toward the best next step. In my case, I was guided to change a HEPA filter or two. But they let you know if they think professional remediation is required—Rubino says if that’s the case, it’s imperative that you work with research-based experts in the field who will properly remove it.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/functional-psychiatrist/,Finding a Functional Psychiatrist Near You,"“Mental health is not isolated to the brain,” says Ellen Vora, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist, acupuncturist, and yoga teacher. Vora is what’s called a functional psychiatrist: She treats mental imbalances with the entire body in mind.
There’s no specific credential that is required in order to call oneself a functional psychiatrist, Vora says. (Psychiatrists, of course, go through medical training to earn that title.) Many functional medicine practitioners have medical degrees plus some level of training at places like The Institute for Functional Medicine, Kresser Institute, Institute for Integrative Nutrition, or Empowered Education.
Vora says that it really comes down to their treatment philosophy: “If a practitioner approaches care with the goal of addressing the problem at the root rather than suppressing the symptoms without regard for whether the treatment addresses the root cause, I consider that to be a functionally oriented practitioner.” That means they’re aware of the connection between a patient’s mind, body, and spirit and how it impacts their health. And it implies that a practitioner considers a person’s lifestyle—what they eat, how they sleep, their exercise habits, their relationships, etc.—when treating mental health conditions.
We asked Vora to share the functional psychiatrists who are at the top of her recommendation list—they’re below. To find a functional psychiatrist near you, The Institute for Functional Medicine, Integrative Medicine for Mental Health, and Integrative Psychiatry Institute are great resources.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/sleepcation/,One Prescription for Sleep Debt? A Sleepcation,"By now, you’ve likely heard about the concept of sleep debt, which is the difference between the amount of sleep our body needs to feel its best and the amount of sleep we actually get. “Say you need seven hours of sleep to feel your best the next day and you get five: The difference, two hours, would be your sleep deficit,” says sleep consultant Kelly Murray, FDN-P. Over time, sleep debt can affect your cognition, metabolism, heart health, blood sugar regulation, immune system, and more. Decreasing your sleep debt allows you to regain energy, improve cognitive function, and repair your health over time.
But if we know we’ve accumulated some sleep debt—life happens!—what can we do about it? To rebalance, Murray recommends planning a sleep vacation (also known as a sleepcation): a period of time dedicated to sleeping well and determining your optimal sleep time.
According to the National Sleep Foundation, most people need seven to nine hours of sleep to feel rejuvenated. Murray says one way to know if you’re getting your ideal amount of sleep is your energy levels: You’ll wake feeling refreshed and have a steady stream of energy throughout the day. (If you consistently need more than nine hours of sleep to feel energized, she suggests you talk with your doctor, because that can be an indicator of an underlying medical condition.)
How long should your sleepcation be? “It typically takes between two and seven days to work off a sleep deficit. And it could be longer if you have long-term insomnia,” Murray says. She usually recommends her clients take about five days. She doesn’t prescribe strict protocols, just some general guidelines.
If we were planning a sleepcation for ourselves at home, these are the steps we’d take to maximize comfort and relaxation:","Denise John, PhD","August 31, 2023"
https://goop.com/wellness/health/hormones-and-eyesight/,Are Your Hormones Messing with Your Eyesight?,"By Carolyn Pan, MD, as told to goop | Reviewed by Denise John, PhD
Our eyes are intricately connected to the rest of our body. This means that biological changes—like hormone fluctuations—affect our eyes, too. Here are a few ways hormones impact eye health.
If you are experiencing shifts in your hormones and any eye symptoms along these lines, work with your general practitioner and eye doctor to try to get to the root cause of your symptoms and support bringing your hormones back into balance.
For general eye health, here are some preventive practices to help care for your eyes.
1. Eat a balanced diet, exercise, and sleep. Our bodies—including our eyes—benefit from eating a balanced diet, having regular physical activity, and sleeping well. This gives our eyes the foundational care—nutrients, blood flow, and repair—that’s needed for them to function.
2. Get regular eye exams. Visual symptoms and discomfort don’t always show up in the beginning stages of an eye condition. Eye doctors recommend that healthy adults with good vision get a routine eye exam (conducted by a licensed optometrist, who examines your vision) or a comprehensive medical eye exam (conducted by an ophthalmologist, an MD who assesses the overall health of your eye) at least once in their 20s and twice in their 30s. After the age of 40, we recommend exams every one to two years. This may be covered by your vision or medical insurance depending on your age, preexisting conditions, and diagnoses.
3. Use tear drops and eye compression. Keeping your eyes lubricated helps them stay healthy. Similar to using lotion to moisturize dry skin, using over-the-counter tear drops can help lubricate dry eyes. Using warm eye compresses as part of your morning routine can also help release oil from your eyelids’ glands and improve the quality of your tears.
4. Wear sunglasses. In addition to hormone changes, exposure to UV rays over time contributes to many age-related eye conditions, such as cataract, macular degeneration, and ocular surface diseases. Just as you wear sunscreen to prevent skin damage, wearing sunglasses and wide-brim hats protects your eyes from UV damage from the sun.
