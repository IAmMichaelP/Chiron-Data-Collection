Orange juice futures have surged to a multi-decade high of $4.92 per pound this week – driven by poor harvests in Brazil and Florida. Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of orange juice, has faced unusually high temperatures and below-average rainfall this year, while Florida’s orange groves have been battered by hurricanes and a cold snap in 2022.
Additionally, both regions have been afflicted by “citrus greening,” a disease that renders the fruit bitter and ultimately kills the trees. With stockpiles dwindling, juice producers are increasingly experimenting with more climate-resilient fruits, like mandarins, as reported by Tortoise Media.

The rising prices of orange juice, a breakfast staple, have thrust the industry into crisis, compelling some producers to seek alternative fruit options. The situation is exacerbated by a sharp decline in production in Florida and extreme weather conditions in Brazil, the primary orange-producing region.
Historically, Brazil has played a crucial role in the global orange juice market. In the 1960s, after frosts devastated Florida’s orange groves, Brazil filled the gap with its supply of frozen concentrated orange juice. (Related: Oranges are waste-free: Every part has unique health benefits.)
The situation worsened in 2005 when citrus greening disease reached Miami, leading to a 55 percent decline in Florida’s orange production over the next decade. This prompted a significant price hike in orange juice, driving bottlers to opt for the more affordable Brazilian alternative.
Today, Brazilian companies supply more than half of all orange juice bottled by major brands like Tropicana, with shipments originating from the Port of Santos in São Paulo. In 2017, the U.S. orange juice export market was valued at $1.4 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) – solidifying Brazil’s financial influence over American orange juice production facilities.
As of this week, frozen concentrated orange juice futures on the Intercontinental Exchange in New York have reached $4.77 per pound, nearly double the price from a year ago. According to Harry Campbell, a commodity market data analyst at Mintec, the soaring prices are pushing manufacturers to adjust their blends by incorporating more affordable fruit juices, such as apple, grape and pear to reduce reliance on orange juice.
“This trend appears to be long-term. Consumers may eventually resist paying a premium for orange juice, but until then, prices will continue to rise due to the low supply,” Campbell told CNBC.
The ongoing supply constraints and rising costs underscore the need for the industry to diversify and adapt to changing climatic and economic conditions, ensuring sustainability and affordability in the global food and drink market.
Recent findings from the research center Fundecitrus indicate that Brazil is experiencing one of its worst orange harvests in over 30 years due to excessive heat last year. In a report published on May 10, the citrus growers’ organization projected Brazil’s orange production for the 2024-2025 season to be 232.4 million boxes, each weighing around 40.8 kilograms. This marks a 24 percent decrease from the previous cycle.
Typically, Brazil produces about 300 million boxes of oranges per cycle. However, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have significantly impacted crop yields.
According to Fundecitrus, a series of intense heatwaves between September and November last year disrupted the crucial flowering and early fruit formation stages, severely reducing production. Additionally, citrus greening, a disease with no known cure that results in bitter and stunted fruit, continues to pose a major challenge for orange farmers worldwide.
“Orange juice prices are rising due to the three Ds: drought, disease and demand,” explained Dave Reiter, a trader with Reiter Capital Investments LLC, in an email to CNBC.
While many associate orange juice production with Florida and California, Brazil is the largest producer of both oranges and orange juice. The majority of Brazil’s orange juice production takes place in São Paulo and Minas Gerais, regions that have been grappling with weather problems and disease for several years.
Reiter noted that the benchmark orange juice futures contract is a thinly traded market, which can lead to significant volatility. He predicted that the next target price for orange juice could reach $5.16 per pound.
As changes in climate and extreme weather continues to disrupt traditional agricultural practices, the orange juice industry faces mounting challenges. The combination of drought, disease and rising demand underscores the need for adaptation and innovation to ensure the sustainability and affordability of this popular beverage.

https://food.news/2024-05-17-ditch-harmful-vegetable-oils-for-these-substitutes.html,Ditch harmful VEGETABLE OILS for these healthy substitutes,"Advertisement
Industrial seed and vegetable oils are harmful to your health, and these products are long entrenched in the market. However, there are substitutes you can use to replace these harmful oils in your cooking. But how exactly do industrial seed and vegetable oils undermine your health?
According to a study published in the journal Open Heart, the linoleic acid in vegetable oil is the culprit as it easily oxidizes and turns into oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMS). These OXLAMS induce atherosclerosis and heart disease, so it follows that reducing vegetable oil consumption would also reduce the amount of OXLAMS being formed.

But there’s no need to fret, as registered nutritionist Kerry Torrens shares several alternatives to seed and vegetable oils that offer extra health benefits for you and your family.
Pressed from the fruit of the avocado tree, this oil is often likened to olive oil. It is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), especially oleic acid, which increases the oil’s stability at high temperatures. A study published 2019 in the journal Molecules stated that almost 70 percent of avocado oil consists of heart-healthy oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid.
The high smoke point of both refined and unrefined avocado oil makes it ideal for cooking. Its subtle flavor also allows other ingredients in your recipe to shine through.
Olive oil is made from the juice of the olive fruit and is known for its many health benefits from protecting you against heart disease to reducing your risk of developing Type-2 diabetes. Oleic oil, the predominant MUFA found in olive oil, is thought to be 50 times less likely to oxidize than linoleic acid – the predominant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) found in vegetable oils, like corn oil and sunflower oil.
Virgin olive oil is a good cooking oil for temperatures between 356 F and 374 F. Aside from imparting a unique flavor to your dishes, virgin olive oil contains antioxidants such as vitamin E and more.
However, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is reported to have the lowest oxidation rate of any cooking oil. EVOO is made from pure, cold-pressed olives and is an ideal choice when cooking at home – but be wary of overheating it as it has a low smoking point.
Butter has been part of the human diet since the agricultural ages after the domestication of mammals. It is obtained from churning milk or cream, and was first prepared from sheep’s milk. Nowadays, organic butter is made using milk from grass-fed cows.
Butter contains a variety of fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamins K2, A, D and E. It serves as the perfect carrier for these vitamins as it provides the fat necessary for their absorption. Butter also contains butyric acid that can inhibit the growth of tumors in the breast, according to a study published in the Journal of Dairy Science.
Commonly used in Indian cooking, ghee is made by simmering butter until the moisture evaporates and removing the milk solids until a clear golden oil is left. The low moisture and high saturated fat content gives ghee a high smoke point and long shelf life. It is also devoid of lactose and casein, making ghee a suitable option for those with lactose intolerance or milk allergy.
A study by researchers from Universiti Putra Malaysia examined ghee and vegetable oils when exposed at a temperature of 356 F. It found that ghee creates fewer damaging acrylamides compared to vegetable oils. Acrylamides are chemicals that form when starchy foods such as potatoes and bread are cooked at temperatures above 248 F.
Lard is made by rendering – boiling, steaming or using dry heat – pork fat from the rest of the animal tissue. It does not oxidize at high temperatures and has a remarkably high smoke point of 375 F.
Contrary to claims that pork lard is unhealthy due, it contains the second-highest amount of MUFAs at 48 percent – only olive oil has more at 77 percent. This helps lower blood cholesterol levels and maintain healthy cells. Lard is also a great source of choline, a nutrient your brain and nervous system need to regulate memory, mood, muscle control and other functions.
Lard contains anywhere from 102 to 399 milligrams per cup, depending on how the pig was raised. Lard rendered from organic, pasture-raised pigs will likely contain significantly more choline than those raised in the conventional manner.
Whereas lard is made from pork, tallow is made from suet (beef fat) that has been clarified and rendered. It boasts of a high smoke point of 400 F, making it an excellent choice for frying, sauteing and searing meats. Since it’s from beef, tallow adds more flavor to your dishes. (Related: The decades-long saturated fat SCAM to push toxic vegetable oils… here’s why you should be eating tallow instead of canola.)
Both tallow and suet are rich in fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamins A, B1, D, E and K. They are also healthier and stable alternatives to industrially-processed seed and vegetable oils that cause inflammation.",Olivia Cook,05/17/2024
https://food.news/2024-05-16-replace-ultra-processed-foods-with-healthy-alternatives.html,Replace ultra-processed foods with these HEALTHY alternatives,"Advertisement
In a world where convenience often trumps nutritional value, making healthy food choices can sometimes feel like a daunting task. However, small changes in dietary habits can yield significant benefits for overall well-being. One effective strategy is to swap out ultra-processed foods (UPFs) – those laden with additives, preservatives, and refined ingredients – for healthy alternatives.
The rise of UPFs in modern diets has been linked to various health concerns, including obesity, heart disease and metabolic disorders. Fortunately, making healthier food choices doesn’t have to be complicated or restrictive. By replacing ultra-processed options with nutrient-dense alternatives, you can enhance nutritional intake and promote better health outcomes.

When choosing snacks, try substituting sugary options such as candy with healthier alternatives like dried fruit or dark chocolate. While indulging in occasional sweets is fine, frequent consumption of sugary foods can heighten the risk of health issues such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity.
Explore a variety of nutritious snack choices such as dried fruits, fresh fruits like bananas and strawberries dipped in antioxidant-packed dark chocolate or homemade energy balls to fulfill your sweet tooth cravings. For more snack inspiration, check out this list of 28 healthy snack ideas suitable for both you and your children.
Instead of your customary soda, consider opting for coffee, infused sparkling water, kombucha or green tea. While the temporary energy surge from sodas and other sugary drinks may be appealing, the long-term consumption of soda is associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
On the other hand, coffee, kombucha and tea provide a caffeine boost without the added sugar. Additionally, they are rich in antioxidants, which may help reduce cholesterol levels and safeguard against heart disease and stroke.
However, it’s important not to consume excessive amounts. Too much caffeine can potentially lead to stomach discomfort or jitteriness. If you’re pregnant, it’s advisable to consult your doctor before consuming caffeine.
Additionally, be mindful of what you add to your tea or coffee, as excessive sugar and cream can negate their health benefits. Enhance the flavor with citrus slices or spices such as cinnamon or mint, but do so in moderation.
Instead of relying on store-bought coffee creamers, which often contain unhealthy additives like high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), consider crafting your own creamer.
HCFS  has been associated with various adverse health outcomes, including diabetes, insulin resistance, liver issues, obesity and weight gain. (Related: Overconsumption of high fructose corn syrup-rich foods causes health problems. addiction.)
For a dairy-free and healthier alternative, you will need
Combine all the ingredients in a glass bottle or mason jar, then shake thoroughly. Store the mixture in the refrigerator for up to one week, or freeze it in ice cube trays for longer-term use. For added flavor, you can also incorporate a sprinkle of cinnamon or a pinch of pumpkin pie spice. Remember to shake well before each use.
Potato or corn chips often contains excessive salt and potentially unhealthy saturated or trans fats, increasing the risk of heart disease.  Consider these alternatives instead of indulging in these. (Related: Studies show ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS put millions of people in the U.K. at risk of cardiovascular disease.)
Nuts offer a delightful salty indulgence now and then. Cashews, walnuts and almonds provide a dose of heart-healthy unsaturated fats. Moreover, they boast satisfying protein and fiber, along with essential vitamins and minerals. Keep in mind, though, that nuts are calorie-dense, so stick to moderate one-ounce servings.
Popcorn isn’t just a favorite among movie buffs; it’s also a high-fiber whole grain that satiates hunger with fewer calories compared to chips. Additionally, popcorn contains antioxidants that may reduce the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. For a healthier option, prepare popcorn using an air popper or with a heart-friendly oil, omitting the butter and using salt sparingly. Avoid the temptation of theater popcorn, which often packs a hefty load of calories, fat, and sodium.
Alternatively, consider indulging in homemade snacks such as baked potato chips, beet or kale chips and roasted chickpeas. These options are rich in fiber and magnesium, a vital mineral essential for regulating blood sugar levels and supporting nerve function.
Instead of indulging in ice cream, consider Greek yogurt paired with fresh fruit. Ice cream tends to be loaded with fat, sugar, and calories. Just a half-cup serving of vanilla ice cream, devoid of any additional toppings, can pack 140 calories and 14 grams of sugar.
In contrast, the same portion of nonfat Greek yogurt, boasting a creamier and thicker texture than regular yogurt, contains a mere 73 calories and significantly less sugar. Additionally, Greek yogurt provides ample amounts of calcium, magnesium, protein, and vitamin B12.
Enhance the flavor and nutritional value by adding a variety of berries, sliced bananas or other fruits. This combination not only adds natural sweetness but also contributes to a lower risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, thanks to the synergistic benefits of fruit and yogurt.
While baked goods from bakeries may tempt the taste buds, they often harbor excessive amounts of sugar and refined white flour, devoid of fiber. Furthermore, they may contain butter or hydrogenated oils, laden with heart-harming saturated or trans fats.
Choose a square of dark chocolate over cookies or cake. Dark chocolate, with its higher cocoa solid content compared to milk chocolate, offers a delectable alternative. Enjoying a square or two a few times per week may lower the risk of chest pain, heart attack, or stroke.
Instead of opting for fatty cuts of beef, consider the following alternatives:
Mixed lentils and mushrooms offer a plant-based alternative reminiscent of ground beef when cooked. Mushrooms contribute a meaty flavor and texture, while lentils provide a hearty base. When combined and seasoned well, they create a meatless sloppy joe that rivals traditional burgers. This option is particularly suitable for vegans seeking alternatives to meat and fish in their diets.
Seafood provides a delightful alternative to steaks and burgers typically loaded with saturated fat, which can elevate cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease. Fish varieties such as salmon or tuna boast high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, known to lower “bad fats” in the bloodstream and prevent plaque buildup in arteries. Grilled shellfish, including crab and lobster, offer another flavorful option rich in protein and essential minerals.
Instead of reaching for that bowl of sugary cereal, a breakfast staple for many, consider opting for alternatives, like high-fiber, high-protein oatmeal (ideally minimally processed steel-cut oats available in shelf-stable packaging from supermarkets and online retailers), chia pudding or plain Greek yogurt parfait topped with fresh or freeze-dried berries, crushed almonds, and unsweetened coconut flakes.
Sugary cereals, often targeted towards children, are frequently laden with artificial food dyes, such as red dye 40, and high fructose corn syrup, both of which have been linked to behavioral issues in children.
Instead of your typical sandwich staple, consider opting for more nutritious whole-grain bread, tortillas or wraps. This straightforward substitution replaces your less nutritious white bread with wholesome whole grains. When selecting bread, look for the “100 percent whole grain” label to ensure maximum nutritional benefit.
Consider exploring a nutritious bread option, such as Ezekiel bread, which is crafted from whole grains and legumes, devoid of refined flour or sugar. The sprouting process involved in its creation might enhance the accessibility of specific nutrients.
Furthermore, you have a variety of delicious, grain-free alternatives to choose from, such as nutrient-rich portobello mushroom caps, sweet potato toast, and wraps made from Swiss chard or lettuce.
Refined grains, such as white flour, are deficient in essential nutrients, like fiber, B vitamins, iron and magnesium. In contrast, whole grains are rich in fiber, which aids in reducing cholesterol levels and lowering the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Additionally, the fiber content promotes satiety – assisting in weight management efforts.

Consumer Reports (CR) has unveiled alarming findings indicating that one out of every five tested foods available in the United States carries a high risk of pesticide contamination. The report, released on April 18, highlighted the presence of banned pesticides in certain foods, with green peas being cited as an example.
To assess the current state of affairs, CR conducted its most extensive review yet on pesticide levels in food. The analysis, based on seven years of data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), scrutinized a variety of produce – both conventional and organically grown, domestically or imported to the United States. The study encompassed 59 common fruits and vegetables, examining not only fresh varieties but also canned, dried or frozen alternatives.

Pesticide contamination posed significant risks in 20 percent of the foods surveyed, including popular choices like bell peppers, blueberries, green beans, potatoes and strawberries.
Notably, green beans were found to contain residues of a pesticide banned for use on the vegetable in the U.S. for over a decade. Imported produce, particularly from Mexico, showed a higher likelihood of carrying hazardous levels of pesticide residues.
Dr. James E. Rogers, CR’s director of food safety research, expressed concern over the recurring pattern observed. He described it as a case of progress followed by setbacks in pesticide regulation.
According to Rogers, this concentrated risk facilitates targeted solutions, albeit requiring concerted efforts and time to prompt regulatory adjustments by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is responsible for overseeing pesticide use in agriculture.
Despite the concerning findings, the report also offered some reassurance. Nearly two-thirds of the foods tested, including the majority of organic options, exhibited minimal pesticide risks. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the greatest threats stemmed from a select few pesticides, primarily affecting specific foods cultivated on a small portion of U.S. farmland.
Decades of research underscore a clear correlation between pesticide use and long-term adverse health effects in humans. Studies reveal a range of detrimental impacts across various bodily systems:
Cancer risk
Certain pesticides, including organochlorines, creosote and sulfamate, were identified as carcinogenic, while others, like DDT, chlordane and lindane were implicated in tumor growth. Arsenic, present in many pesticides, was also recognized as a human carcinogen.
Research published in Cancer Causes and Control, Environmental Health Perspectives and Reviews on Environmental Health suggested an increased risk of liver cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancers associated with pesticide exposure.
Respiratory issues
Individuals regularly exposed to pesticides, particularly through occupational use, face elevated risks of respiratory ailments, such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and impaired lung function. Studies also suggest a potential link between pesticide exposure and lung cancer.
Kidney damage
Investigations into chronic kidney disease reveal a positive association with pesticide exposure in a majority of studies, although conclusive findings are hindered by confounding factors and limited lifetime exposure assessments.
Neurological effects
Pesticides exert toxic effects on the nervous system, leading to cognitive decline and potentially increasing the risk of Parkinson’s disease. Research from the University of Guelph suggested a significant risk increase for Parkinson’s disease following exposure to specific pesticides.
Birth defects
High pesticide exposure, as indicated by a study in Nature Communications, correlated with elevated rates of birth defects – emphasizing the severe consequences of such exposure during pregnancy.
Endocrine disruption
Pesticides act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, interfering with hormonal function and posing risks to sexual and reproductive health. Studies highlighted associations with childhood cancers, fetal death, infertility and low birth weight.  (Related: Pesticide linked to reproductive issues found in popular oat-based breakfast cereals.)
Autism risk
Research published in BMJ suggested a heightened risk of autism spectrum disorders associated with prenatal pesticide exposure. Proximity to pesticide-treated fields during pregnancy is linked to increased autism risk and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
The ramifications of pesticide use extend beyond human health, profoundly impacting the environment in more ways than one:
Threat to pollinators
Pesticides pose a significant threat to vital pollinators like honey bees, disrupting their ability to collect pollen and negatively affecting their population. Chemicals, such as neonicotinoids – recognized for their toxicity to insect brains – are particularly harmful. Additionally, fungicides can disrupt bee gut bacteria and impede nutrient absorption from pollen.
Disruption of ecosystems
Excessive pesticide application leads to displacement of aquatic life, habitat destruction and insect mortality. Certain chemicals can render vegetation toxic to wildlife – disrupting the food chain and essential ecosystems.
Soil degradation
Pesticides degrade soil quality – diminishing essential nutrients, like nitrogen and potassium. This degradation not only affects soil-dwelling organisms, such as earthworms, frogs, snails and snakes but also compromises crop sustainability and reduces the nutritional value of food grown in contaminated soil.
Water contamination
Pesticides persist in the environment – contaminating water sources through erosion, leaching, microbial assimilation, plant absorption and runoff. This contamination poses risks to aquatic life and human health.
Risks to farm workers
Despite evidence suggesting the toxicity of even minimal pesticide exposure to humans, farm workers face significant health risks due to their regular and direct contact with these chemicals. The lack of routine health monitoring by regulatory agencies leaves farm workers vulnerable to higher exposure levels. Moreover, residues carried home on clothing and footwear inadvertently expose families to harmful chemicals.
Recent evidence underscores the detrimental health effects of even minimal chemical exposure, with approximately 90 percent of Americans harboring pesticides in their bodies. Environmental Working Group (EWG) tests reveal that around 70 percent of U.S. produce contains pesticide residues.
To reduce exposure to pesticides, experts recommend the following strategies:
Opt for organic
Choose organically grown foods or consider cultivating your own produce. Organic options, indicated by the USDA Organic seal, are cultivated without synthetic pesticides. While organic produce may still contain some pesticides, the use of synthetic chemicals is significantly lower compared to conventional farming practices. (Related: Avoid harmful chemicals like glyphosate in food by ALWAYS choosing ORGANIC.)
Mind the Dirty Dozen
Refer to the Environmental Working Group’s annual list of the “Dirty Dozen” and “Clean 15” to prioritize organic purchases. Items on the Dirty Dozen, such as spinach and strawberries, are known to contain higher pesticide residues and may warrant organic sourcing.
Thoroughly wash produce
Employ effective washing techniques to remove surface pesticide residues. Solutions, such as a 10 percent salt-water solution, full-strength vinegar or a baking soda-water mixture can help reduce surface chemicals. While washing may not eliminate pesticides absorbed into the produce, it can mitigate surface contamination.
Limit non-organic animal products
Reduce consumption of non-organic meat and dairy products, which may harbor pesticide residues from animal exposure to contaminated environments and feed. Studies have detected various pesticides in dairy products, highlighting the potential for environmental contamination.
Install home water filtration
Address potential pesticide contamination in drinking water by installing a home water filtration system. Such systems can effectively remove unwanted substances, enhancing water safety.
Explore natural pest control methods
Consider natural alternatives to chemical pesticides for gardening purposes. Homemade pesticides, beneficial insects and companion planting techniques can help manage pests without harming the environment.

https://food.news/2024-04-25-turmeric-and-black-pepper-a-powerful-combination.html,Dynamic duo: Why TURMERIC and BLACK PEPPER are a powerful combination,"Advertisement
Turmeric and black pepper are noteworthy for their stand-alone health benefits. But when combined, this dynamic duo becomes a powerhouse of healing.
Turmeric (Curcuma longa) has substantial amounts of the plant compound curcumin. This phytochemical is a strong antioxidant that also boasts of being able to fight inflammation, bacteria and fungi. But this bright yellow spice has one drawback – the body cannot absorb it well, with most amounts of curcumin being eliminated.
Meanwhile, black pepper (Piper nigrum) is rich in piperine, a bioactive compound that gives this spice its signature pungency. Piperine is similar to the alkaloid capsaicin, which is present in chili powder and cayenne pepper. This phytochemical has been shown to help address nausea, headaches, poor digestion and inflammation.

But piperine’s most notable quality lies in its ability to enhance the body’s absorption of curcumin. Adding black pepper to turmeric can mitigate the poor absorption of curcumin into the bloodstream. According to research, supplementing C. longa with P. nigrum significantly improves the body’s curcumin uptake by a huge degree.
A study published in the Planta Medica journal expounded on this. Researchers from India examined how curcumin alone and piperine-curcumin in tandem was absorbed in both animal and human models. According to the study, adding 20 milligrams of piperine to two grams of curcumin notably increased the latter’s absorption.
In rats given both piperine and curcumin, the bioavailability of the latter increased by as much as 154 percent. Meanwhile, the bioavailability of curcumin in human participants increased by 2,000 percent when supplemented with piperine.
There are two prevailing theories explaining this phenomenon, as outlined by two separate studies. The first theory was outlined in a study published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine. According to the paper, piperine may facilitate the passage of curcumin through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream.
Meanwhile, a February 1986 study in the  Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics suggested that piperine might inhibit the liver’s breakdown of curcumin. This, in turn, elevates the amount of curcumin entering the bloodstream, translating to health benefits.
Here are some examples of how you can combine turmeric and black pepper:
It’s important to note that while turmeric and black pepper have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties, individual responses may vary. It’s always a good idea to consult with a natural health practitioner before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

In a study published in Pathology Oncology Research, academic pathologist Dr. Yujiang Fang and a team of University of Missouri researchers found that blueberry fruit extracts can greatly improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy on cancer cells.
Long known for their antioxidant properties, blueberries have exhibited “inherent abilities to prevent carcinogenesis, inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cells, and reduce the risk of recurrence in patients in remission.”
The study noted that when the researchers reduced the dosage of radiation, the killing effect of blueberry phytochemicals on cancer was even enhanced. “That is because a chemical in the fruit called resveratrol acts as a radiosensitizer,” explained Fang.

He added that as a radiosensitizer, resveratrol “suppresses initiation, promotion and progression of carcinogenesis while reducing the expression of vascular endothelial growth, as well as promoting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity” – improves cardiac health and healing processes and respiratory response; enhances performance during exercise; and reduces high blood pressure during pregnancy, as well as erectile dysfunction. This also means that even with less radiation, doctors can reduce the side effects of chemotherapy on healthy cells.
Using cervical cancer cells in the lab, the researchers found that radiation reduced the number of cancer cells by 20 percent, while over the same period, blueberry extract decreased the number of cancer cells by 25 percent. The synergistic effect of both radiation and blueberry extract decreased the number of cancer cells by a whopping 70 percent – and additionally reduced the growth of new cancer cells. (Related: Blueberries are more effective at killing cancer than radiotherapy.)
An earlier study published in the Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B found blueberries to have the strongest natural total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the highest total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and total anthocyanidin content (TAC) values when compared with blackberries and strawberries.
These superfruits are a formidable line of defense against cancer – loaded with bioactive compounds, some of which have demonstrated the capacity to halt cancer cell proliferation and increase cell death or apoptosis.
Extracts from these superfoods contain important nutrients, such as fiber, vitamin C and manganese, and bioactive compounds that have been scientifically proven to offer a lot of health benefits, such as:
Studies show that when you eat blueberries every day, you can enjoy the following health benefits:
Numerous research have associated the flavonoids in blueberries with improved learning and general cognitive function and memory, including decision-making, numerical ability, reasoning skills and verbal comprehension.
A study published in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research found that blueberries can support gut health by improving intestinal morphology (the main indicator of intestinal development, functionality and health); modulating the composition and function of gut microbes; reducing gut permeability; remediating gut inflammation; and suppressing oxidative stress.
Blueberries are rich in antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins, as well as vitamins C and E, that are known to protect eyesight and slow the progression of macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa.
The vitamin C in blueberries, paired with anthocyanins, supports collagen production and skin elasticity and protects your skin from free radical damage, reducing signs of aging.
According to physiotherapist and top trainer Jeff Cavaliere, vitamin C, potassium and flavonoids like the anthocyanins in blueberries can enhance blood flow and reduce muscle inflammation, especially after a particularly intense workout. Blueberries also contain complex carbohydrates, which can help your body quickly replenish its energy levels and mend any microdamage done by heavy exercise to your muscles.
A study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that the bioactive compounds in blueberries can improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant and obese men and women. Blueberries are notably high in fiber, low in carbohydrates and lower in sugar than other types of fruit.
Research also suggests that blueberries can help your body process glucose more efficiently by helping improve your insulin sensitivity. Doing so helps you keep your blood sugar levels under control.
Blueberries are loaded with vitamins and minerals that aid in maintaining bone strength, such as calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, zinc and vitamin K. A study published in Antioxidants found that blueberries increase the proliferation of human bone marrow cells that are responsible for bone formation.
A study published in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research also suggests that increased doses of blueberry polyphenols could induce changes in the intestinal phenolic metabolism and increase calcium absorption in your bones – the main storage site of calcium, which helps your cells, muscles and nerves function normally.

Biologically speaking, the wheat berry, also known as the “kernel,” is the seed from which a wheat plant grows. They are a powerful survival food that, if stored properly, can last for years in your stockpile.
Wheat seeds or wheat berries are true whole grains that will keep you healthy. They are a great source of complex carbohydrates, fiber, healthy fats, protein, phytochemicals, minerals and vitamins A, B, C, E and K.
Wheat berries are thick, short grains that look similar to brown rice. Industrious preppers grind them into whole wheat flour for baking – not purchasing them in bulk in the form of flour.

When boiled, cooked wheat berries have a chewy, subtly nutty and earthy flavor. They’re sturdy enough to handle bold salad dressings and still delicate enough to taste delicious with some cinnamon, honey and milk.
If you like sprouts in salads and sandwiches, just add a little water to wheat berries and you can grow your own wheat sprouts.
Here’s a list of good containers for packaging and storing wheat berries to keep them in your stockpile for years. (Related: 4 Best food storage containers for your stockpile.)
The can creates a time capsule that protects the wheat berries from oxygen, moisture, rodents and light. The size of these small cans is perfect for individuals or smaller families to ensure only a small amount of product is open at a time. If you properly store your wheat berries in #10 cans, you can expect them to survive on your shelf for up to 30 years and possibly more.
Protect cans from moisture to prevent rust. Do not store in direct contact with concrete floors or walls. Except for sugar, all dry foods stored in #10 cans should be packed with an oxygen absorber to prevent insect infestation and preserve the quality of food.
Mylar bags provide a good moisture and oxygen barrier to protect the wheat during storage. However, they are more fragile than #10 cans and should be handled carefully.
If wheat berries are properly stored in mylar bags that are airtight and do not have pockets of air left inside them – a tricky process that may take several tries to perfect – then the food inside is effectively frozen in time and can last for a long time.
Extend the shelf life of wheat berries and protect them from insects by placing a 300 cc oxygen absorber in a one-gallon Mylar bag. You can expect a 25-year shelf life for wheat berries stored in a Mylar bag in a cool, dry, dark location protected from rodents.
Mylar bags do have a problem in that they do not stack well in storage spaces because they leave a lot of empty space when placed in containers.
The best way to save space using a Mylar bag is to use the large five-gallon bags inside a rodent-resistant container, such as a food-grade plastic bucket.
Use your Mylar bag to line a five-gallon food-grade bucket before filling it and adding your oxygen absorbers. Fill the bag up to about one inch below the rim of your bucket. Rest your level, or another length of wood, across the top of your bucket, as close to the center as possible.
For 5-gallon bags you should use five to seven 300cc oxygen absorbers or one 2,000cc oxygen absorber. You should adjust this number up a little bit if you are storing less dense foods like pasta or lentils because the bags will contain more air even when full in comparison to very dense foods, such as rice or wheat berries.
The plastic bucket gives shape to the Mylar bag and protects it from rodents. The Mylar bag provides a better moisture and oxygen barrier than the bucket does alone. Then secure the lid on the plastic bucket. Be sure to label both the Mylar bag and the plastic bucket with a permanent marker and include the date and description of the contents.
If you want to place all your wheat berries in one large container, a food-grade plastic bucket with gasket seals is a good candidate for storing your grain. They are an inexpensive option to store large amounts of dry food products and are available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.
Never use a plastic bucket that has stored non-food items, or is not made of food-grade plastic, for your food storage. Re-purposed plastic buckets may come with some lingering odors. While not harmful, it is possible for the food to absorb the odor.
You can store individually packaged items, such as bags of baking powder, baking soda, pasta, powdered sugar, salt and a variety of other items in their original packaging inside the plastic buckets.
The bucket provides an extra layer of protection from critters, protects packaging from absorbing moisture in the storage room and helps to maintain freshness. It does not prevent insects originally inside the packages from multiplying. However, it will contain the infestation and not allow it to spread to other stored foods.
Store the buckets in a cool, dry, dark location and you can expect at least a 20-year shelf life, probably longer. Plastic buckets should not be stored directly on concrete. Stacking buckets over three high may break the seal and compromise the wheat berries.

Cancer is often addressed using strong medications that can cause more harm than the disease it purports to fight. Fortunately, there are natural cancer-fighting solutions that you can use against the Big C.
Allspice (Pimenta dioica) is made from the unripe berries of the P. dioica tree that are dried and ground. It is called by many names including Jamaican pepper, kurundu, myrtle pepper, pimenta and new spice. The P. dioica tree is cultivated in many warm areas throughout the world, with its essential oil also commercially available.

According to research, allspice possesses antimicrobial and antioxidant properties thanks to its abundance of bioactive agents that contribute to health promotion. It can address inflammation, pain and fever thanks to these same plant compounds.
Allspice is also known to possess cancer- and tumor-fighting properties due to three compounds in particular. The plant compounds eugenol, ericifolin and quercetin present in allspice are the ones responsible for its anticancer effects.
Black walnut (Juglans nigra) contains the plant compounds quercetin 3-beta-D-glucoside and penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose. These two chemicals part of the 16 compounds present in J. nigra kernel were the center of a paper published October 2020 in Molecules.
The study authors pointed out that the two compounds prevented two kinds of cancer cells from multiplying. However, they suggested that the antioxidant activity is likely driven not only by these two phenolic compounds, but also by a combination of its other compounds. These compounds exerted antioxidant activities that were significantly higher compared to the vitamin E analog Trolox that was used as a control for the study.
Despite its reputation as a poisonous plant, bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) possesses cancer-fighting properties. One study published in October 2020 in the International Journal of Dermatology focused on the cancer-fighting ability of sanguinarine, a plant compound found in the roots of S. canadensis.
The October 2020 study found that sanguinarine, in a dose-dependent manner, is effective on certain kinds of skin cancer. The plant compound blocks proliferation of cancer cells and induced apoptosis (cell death) a number of different transformed and malignant cell types.
Meanwhile, The Truth About Cancer disclosed that sanguinarine can trigger apoptosis via three mechanisms, citing a study published May 2016 in Free Radical Biology and Medicine. According to the study, sanguinarine activates caspase (an enzyme that helps to break down proteins and other molecules), prompts DNA fragmentation and down-regulates anti-apoptotic proteins in laboratory leukemia cells.
Parsley (Petroselinum crispum) is often dismissed as a mere garnish in the kitchen. However, this mere garnish possesses powerful anti-cancer compounds such as apigenin, which prevents the formation of blood vessels that carry nutrients to cancerous tumors. It also contains 8-methoxypsoralen, a plant compound shown to inhibit the development of carcinogen-induced lung cancer in laboratory mice.
A major Italian population study involving more than 2,500 women with breast cancer found that the risk of breast cancer was reduced by increasing their parsley intake. The reason for this lowered breast cancer risk was the plant compounds present in P. crispum. (Related: The unassuming parsley has many healing properties, including the ability to fight cancer.)

Salt, or sodium chloride, is a mineral compound that is required to survive. It is an essential nutrient your body needs for various physiological processes, including aiding the balance and stability of electrolytes and fluids, carrying and absorbing nutrients into cells, maintaining cell plasma volume, regulating acid-base balance and supporting a healthy nervous system.
Most that has been said about salt is usually just to eat less of it, but is that always the best advice?
Not getting enough salt in your body may cause health issues, too, such as dehydration, elevated levels of bad cholesterol and triglycerides, increased risk of death from heart failure, insulin resistance and others.

Some kinds of salt are marketed as healthier than others – in terms of nutrient and sodium level contents – depending primarily on where they were sourced and if or how they were processed.
Himalayan pink salt
Also referred to as “sendha namak” or “saindhava lavana,” all-natural Himalayan pink salt is almost exclusively harvested from the salt range in the Punjab region of Pakistan, near the foothills of the Himalayas – present for millions of years in its naturally crystalline form without being spoiled or polluted.
Believed to be the purest of all kinds of salts and widely recognized as nutritionally superior to other salts, Himalayan pink salt contains a unique combination of up to 84 minerals (including calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and sodium) and trace elements (including chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and zinc) at varying safe levels.
In addition, its overall sodium content is lower when compared to other kinds of salt used for human consumption. (Related: Not all salts are equal: 20 Ways to use Himalayan salt – the purest salt on Earth.)
Sea salt
As the name suggests, sea salt is what’s left after evaporating seawater or water from salt lakes and contains essential minerals, like potassium, and trace elements like naturally occurring iodine, iron and zinc, which are beneficial.
However, because of rising pollution in the lakes and oceans, unrefined sea salt may contain high amounts of arsenic, lead, mercury and other heavy metals, as well as micro- and nano-plastics that have found their way into sea salt – posing a grave threat to human food safety and health.
Health authorities and organizations, like the American Heart Association, have pegged the ideal limit of daily salt intake to one to two teaspoons of salt per day. However, this can increase your body’s need for sodium depending on your activity level. If you sweat a lot, you need to replenish lost sodium and chloride through your diet.
Ultimately, moderation and mindful salt consumption are keys to maintaining a healthy sodium intake. Note that the mineral content for different types of salt available in the market is considered “insignificant” because you can often get the essential minerals your body needs by simply eating healthily and choosing nutritious, whole foods.
Here are ways you can reduce sodium in your diet.

Spring is here and if you’re a coffee lover and a home gardener, you’re in for a treat. That morning cup of organic coffee doesn’t just support good health, it’s also a secret weapon for your garden.
And the best part? You can reuse your coffee grounds to give your garden a nutrient-rich kickstart this season. (h/t to GardenDesign.com)
Before you get coffee grounds, you first need to drink coffee. And there are several benefits to incorporating organic coffee into a balanced diet.
Coffee is loaded with antioxidants — over 100 polyphenols, according to studies — that help protect your body from oxidative stress. This stress, caused by free radicals, can lead to chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes and even neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.
Phenolic acids, the most abundant antioxidants in coffee, are particularly powerful in fighting free radicals.
Flavonoids, another group of antioxidants, help support cellular health.
But here’s the kicker: Caffeine, the star of your morning routine, also has antioxidant properties that can support good overall health.
So while you’re sipping your organic brew, you’re not just waking up — you’re doing your body a favor. And once you’re done with that cup, don’t toss the grounds. They’re a treasure trove of nutrients for your garden.
Used coffee grounds are a fantastic, eco-friendly way to boost your garden’s health. They’re rich in nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium and copper, all of which plants need to thrive.
If you don’t drink coffee, you can still get used coffee grounds for free: Just ask your local coffee shop for their used grounds and help reduce waste.
Here’s how you can put them to work in your spring garden:
For compost
Coffee grounds are great for composting. They’re considered “green” material, meaning they’re rich in nitrogen, which helps break down organic matter.
Mix your used grounds with “brown” materials like dried leaves, wood chips or straw in a 3:1 ratio (brown to green).
This combo creates a nutrient-rich compost that improves soil structure and feeds your plants over time. (Related: How to grow your own survival garden.)
For mulching
Spread a thin layer of composted coffee grounds around the base of your plants to suppress weeds, retain moisture and keep roots cool during warmer months.
Always mix coffee grounds with other mulch materials like shredded leaves or straw to prevent them from forming a crust that could block water and nutrients.
Liquid fertilizer boost
Turn coffee grounds into a liquid fertilizer by steeping two cups of grounds in five gallons of water overnight.
Use this nutrient-rich “coffee tea” to water your garden beds or container plants. It’s an easy way to give your plants a slow-release dose of nitrogen and other essential nutrients.
Feeding garden soil (and worms)
Earthworms love coffee grounds. These little garden helpers munch on the grounds, producing nutrient-rich castings that improve soil health.
Plus, worms aerate the soil, making it easier for plant roots to access water and nutrients. Sprinkle a thin layer of grounds around your garden beds for healthy garden worms.
For acid-loving plants
While coffee grounds are neutral to slightly acidic (pH 6.2–6.8), they’re especially beneficial for acid-loving plants like azaleas, blueberries, hydrangeas and roses.
You can sprinkle a small amount of fresh coffee grounds around the base of these plants to give them a nutrient boost.
While coffee grounds are a gardener’s ally, they’re not a one-size-fits-all solution. Avoid using them on plants that prefer alkaline soil, like lavender or rosemary, or those that thrive in dry conditions, like cacti and succulents.
And remember that moderation is key. Coffee grounds should make up no more than 20 percent of your compost or soil mix to avoid stunting plant growth.
Acid-loving indoor houseplant varieties like African violets, monsteras and philodendrons can also benefit from a sprinkle of coffee grounds in their soil. You can use the liquid fertilizer method to give your indoor plants a gentle nutrient boost.
Avoid using coffee grounds on plants like orchids and pothos, which prefer less acidity.
This spring, don’t let your coffee grounds go to waste. Whether you’re composting, mulching or brewing up a liquid fertilizer, these little leftovers can make a big difference in your garden.







The Health Ranger Store is here to help you stock up on delicious and high-quality organic coffee. That’s why we’re proud to present clean, lab-verified, healthy food options such as 100% Organic Hand-Roasted Whole Bean Coffee (Honey Processed Honduras) and 100% Organic Hand-Roasted Whole Bean Coffee (Low Acid Blend).

Health Ranger Select 100% Organic Hand-Roasted Whole Bean Coffee (Honey Processed Honduras) coffee blend comes from the country’s Cafe Organico Marcala Sociedad Anonima (COMSA) co-op, which uses innovative methods and practices to create coffee of exceptionally high quality. “Honey processing” is one such innovative method the COMSA co-op specializes in.
While it may have the word “honey” in its name, this method doesn’t involve actual honey. Instead, it refers to the fermentation process the farmers employ.
Unlike the typical method, which entails milling the pulp and washing the mucilage off coffee cherries, honey processing keeps the mucilage, or the “honey,” on the cherries as they dry. This results in a medium roast coffee blend with a clean and slightly sweet taste.
With its distinctly fruity aroma and exquisite flavor with floral undertones, our organic Honey Processed Honduras coffee blend is truly an exceptional Marcala classic.
You can also try our Health Ranger Select 100% Organic Hand-Roasted Whole Bean Coffee (Low Acid Blend) which is formulated for both cold brew and hot brew.
Like all our other hand-roasted whole bean coffee blends, this organic Low Acid coffee blend is imported directly from small farmer cooperatives around the world and is certified Fair Trade.
This unique certified organic coffee blend is created from a medium roast and a French roast from Honduras combined with another medium roast from Nicaragua. What makes it special is that it is considerably less acidic than other coffee blends, boasts an enhanced flavor and is easy on the stomach.
All Health Ranger coffees are freshly roasted and comprise an exceptional range of blends. Choose one of our amazing blends and enjoy the nutrition our organic coffees have in store for you and your garden.

Some fruits shine brighter than others, and nance is one such gem. This small, golden fruit, often overlooked outside its native regions, is a powerhouse of nutrition and flavor.
Known by various names such as nanche, golden spoon, yaca or hogberry, nance has been a staple in traditional diets across Central and South America for centuries.

Nance is a small, round fruit, typically about the size of a cherry, with a bright yellow or orange hue when ripe. Its thin skin encases a juicy, fibrous pulp that surrounds a large seed.

Nance has deep roots in the history and culture of Mesoamerica. Indigenous peoples of Mexico, Central America, and the northern regions of South America have cultivated and consumed nance for thousands of years.
Spanish explorers documented the fruit during their travels in the 16th century, noting its widespread use among native populations.
Today, nance is primarily grown in tropical and subtropical regions, including Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Brazil. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in wild or semi-cultivated forms.

Calabash nutmeg (Monodora myristica) stands out as a superfood that combines rich cultural history, nutritional value and culinary versatility, offering a holistic approach to wellness and flavor.
Compared to other superfoods, few ingredients carry the mystique and cultural richness of calabash nutmeg, a lesser-known yet profoundly impactful spice native to Africa.
Often referred to as African nutmeg, Jamaican nutmeg, or “ehuru” in Nigeria, this aromatic seed has been a cornerstone of traditional medicine and culinary practices for centuries.

Calabash nutmeg derives its name from the calabash tree, which produces large, gourd-like fruits containing seeds. The seeds themselves are small, oval-shaped and dark brown, with a wrinkled surface that resembles the more commonly known nutmeg (Myristica fragrans).
However, calabash nutmeg has a distinct flavor profile — earthy, slightly sweet and with a hint of spiciness that sets it apart from its more widely used counterpart.
Calabash nutmeg is warm and nutty, making it a versatile addition to both sweet and savory dishes.
The history of calabash nutmeg is deeply intertwined with the cultural and medicinal practices of West and Central Africa. Indigenous communities have long valued the seed for its therapeutic properties, using it to treat ailments ranging from digestive issues to respiratory conditions. (Related: The jackfruit: A superfood source of vitamin C, fiber and other nutrients.)
Historical records suggest that calabash nutmeg was introduced to the Caribbean during the transatlantic slave trade, where it became known as Jamaican nutmeg.
Today, it is cultivated primarily in tropical regions of Africa, including Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana, where it thrives in the humid, fertile soils of rainforests.
Calabash nutmeg is more than just a flavorful spice — it is a nutrient powerhouse. Rich in phytonutrients, it contains compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids and tannins, which contribute to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
These bioactive compounds help combat oxidative stress, a key driver of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
Calabash nutmeg is also a source of essential oil containing myristicin and elemicin, which have been studied for their potential neuroprotective and antimicrobial effects.

A nutritious superfood, here are some of the health benefits of calabash nutmeg:
While more research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms, existing evidence points to calabash nutmeg as a promising natural remedy.


The versatility of calabash nutmeg makes it a delightful ingredient in a variety of dishes. Its warm, nutty flavor pairs well with both sweet and savory recipes, adding depth and complexity to meals.
Here are a few recipe ideas to inspire your culinary adventures:
Calabash nutmeg is a culinary ingredient that is also a testament to the rich heritage and natural bounty of Africa. Its unique flavor, coupled with its potential health benefits, makes it a standout superfood in a world increasingly focused on holistic wellness.
This humble seed is a reminder that some of the most powerful remedies and flavors are found in the most unexpected places.

The bush tomato (Solanum centrale) is a small but mighty fruit that has been a staple in the diets of Indigenous Australians for thousands of years.
Often referred to by its common names, such as desert raisin, kutjera or akudjura, this superfood is known for its unique flavor, rich nutritional profile and potential health benefits.
With its vibrant color, distinctive shape and complex taste, the bush tomato is not only a culinary delight but also a powerhouse of phytonutrients that may help prevent or reverse various health conditions.

Bush tomatoes are small, round fruits that typically measure about one to two centimeters in diameter.
When ripe, they exhibit a deep golden-yellow to reddish-brown hue, often with a slightly wrinkled texture that resembles a raisin. This appearance has earned them the nickname “desert raisin.”
The fruit’s flavor is complex, combining tangy, earthy and slightly sweet notes with a subtle smokiness.
Some describe the taste as reminiscent of sun-dried tomatoes, but with a more intense and unique flavor profile that makes it a standout ingredient in both traditional and modern cuisine.
The bush tomato has a rich history deeply intertwined with the culture and traditions of Indigenous Australian communities. For thousands of years, these communities have harvested and consumed the fruit, using it as food and medicine.
The plant thrives in the arid and semi-arid regions of central Australia, where it has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions.
European settlers first encountered the bush tomato during their explorations of the Australian outback in the 19th century. However, it wasn’t until recent decades that the fruit gained attention beyond its native land, as global interest in Indigenous foods and superfoods began to rise.
Today, bush tomatoes are cultivated in small quantities, primarily in Australia, and are increasingly exported to international markets. (Related: Bilberries: The wild blueberry powerhouse of antioxidants and flavor.)
Bush tomatoes are a rich source of essential nutrients, including vitamins C and E, potassium and dietary fiber. However, what truly sets them apart is their impressive array of phytonutrients, which contribute to their health-promoting properties. These phytonutrients include:

The nutrient-dense profile of bush tomatoes makes them a valuable addition to a health-conscious diet.
Research suggests that consuming bush tomatoes may offer the following benefits:

https://food.news/2025-02-24-freeze-dried-traditional-snacks-which-is-better.html,Freeze-dried vs. traditional snacks: Which is better for your family?,"Advertisement
Convenience often trumps nutrition, but the rise of healthy snacks — both traditional and freeze-dried — has been a welcome shift.
These snacks are not only delicious but also pack a powerful nutritional punch, making them ideal for busy families, health-conscious individuals and even emergency preparedness enthusiasts. (h/t to Healthline.com)
Traditional healthy snacks, such as fresh fruits, nuts, seeds and homemade granola bars, have long been staples of balanced diets. These snacks are celebrated for their simplicity, natural ingredients and accessibility.
Fresh fruits like apples, bananas and berries are rich in vitamins, minerals and fiber, making them a go-to choice for quick energy and optimal digestive health.
Nuts and seeds, on the other hand, provide healthy fats, protein and essential nutrients like magnesium and zinc, which support your overall well-being.
One of the greatest advantages of traditional snacks is their versatility. They can be easily incorporated into meals or enjoyed on their own, and their preparation often requires minimal processing.
For families, these snacks are a reliable way to ensure kids get the nutrients they need without relying on heavily processed alternatives.
However, traditional snacks do have their limitations. Fresh fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life and require refrigeration, which can be inconvenient for on-the-go lifestyles or emergency situations.
This is where freeze-dried snacks come in handy, offering a modern solution to these challenges.
Freeze-drying, or lyophilization, is a cutting-edge dehydration technique that removes water from food while preserving its nutritional value, flavor and texture. This process involves freezing the food and then using a vacuum to turn the ice directly into vapor, bypassing the liquid stage.
The result? Lightweight, shelf-stable snacks that retain most of their original nutrients. (Related: Prepping tips for beginners: Nutritious emergency foods to stock up on.)
Freeze-dried fruits, in particular, have become a game-changer for families and health enthusiasts.
Unlike traditional dried fruits, which often contain added sugars and preservatives, freeze-dried fruits are typically made with just one ingredient: The fruit itself. This makes them a naturally sweet, guilt-free snack option.
Freeze-dried fruits are packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. For example, freeze-dried berries retain high levels of vitamin C and anthocyanins, powerful antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress and support good health.
Apples and bananas provide potassium and fiber, which aid digestion and keep energy levels stable.
Convenience and Longevity
One of the standout features of freeze-dried snacks is their extended shelf life. When stored in a cool, dry place, these snacks can last for months or even years without refrigeration, making them perfect for busy families, road trips and emergency food supplies.
Their lightweight nature also makes them easy to store and transport, whether you’re packing a lunchbox or preparing for a natural disaster.
Versatility in daily life
Freeze-dried fruits can be enjoyed straight out of the bag as a crunchy snack, added to cereals or yogurt for a nutrient boost, or rehydrated for use in recipes.
This versatility makes them a practical choice for anyone looking to incorporate more fruits into their diet without worrying about spoilage.
In addition to their daily benefits, freeze-dried snacks are a cornerstone of emergency preparedness. Natural disasters, power outages and other unforeseen events can disrupt access to fresh food, making it essential to have non-perishable options on hand.
Freeze-dried foods, with their long shelf life and nutritional integrity, are an ideal solution.
You can stock up on freeze-dried fruits, vegetables and even complete meals to ensure that you have access to healthy food during emergencies. These snacks provide essential nutrients and energy, helping to maintain physical and mental well-being in challenging situations.
While traditional snacks offer the comfort of familiarity and minimal processing, freeze-dried snacks bring unmatched convenience and longevity.
Choosing freeze-dried snacks ensures that your whole family has access to nutritious, delicious snacks at all times. If you are focused on emergency planning, freeze-dried snacks provide peace of mind because healthy food is always within reach.
The Health Ranger Store is committed to helping you provide your family with healthy and convenient snacks. That’s why we’re offering clean, lab-verified, healthy food options such as Organic Freeze-Dried Crunchy Munchies Banana Mango Passion Fruit and Organic Freeze-Dried Crunchy Munchies Banana Apple Blackcurrant.

The black plum (Vitex doniana) is a lesser-known yet remarkable fruit that has been cherished for centuries in traditional medicine and culinary practices.
Often referred to by its common names, such as African black plum, wild plum or simply Vitex, this fruit is a powerhouse of nutrients and phytonutrients, making it a true superfood.
With its deep purple-black hue, oblong shape and sweet-tart flavor, the black plum is as visually striking as it is beneficial for health.

The black plum is easily recognizable by its dark, almost black skin, which encases a juicy, fibrous pulp. The fruit is typically oblong or oval-shaped, measuring about two to three centimeters in length.
When ripe, the flesh ranges from a deep purple to a reddish-brown color, with a texture that is both succulent and slightly fibrous.
The taste of the black plum is a delightful balance of sweet and tart, with a subtle earthy undertone that makes it a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes.
The black plum has a rich history that dates back centuries, primarily in Africa, where it is indigenous. It is widely grown in West Africa, including countries like Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon, as well as parts of East Africa.
The fruit thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in savannahs and forested areas. (Related: Bilberries: The wild blueberry powerhouse of antioxidants and flavor.)
While its exact discovery date is not well-documented, black plum has been a staple in African traditional medicine and diets for generations.
Its resilience and adaptability have made it a valuable resource for communities in arid and semi-arid regions, where it provides both food and medicinal benefits.
Black plums are a treasure trove of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds.
They are rich in vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin C and several B vitamins, as well as minerals like calcium, magnesium and potassium.
However, what truly sets the black plum apart is its impressive array of phytonutrients, which include flavonoids, tannins, phenolic acids and anthocyanins.

https://food.news/2025-02-22-why-you-should-upgrade-pink-himalayan-salt.html,Here’s why you should make the upgrade to Pink Himalayan Salt,"Advertisement



Many health-conscious individuals consider pink Himalayan salt as a healthier, more natural alternative to regular table salt.
Mined from the pristine foothills of the Himalayas in Pakistan, this pink-hued salt is celebrated not only for its unique flavor but also for its nutrient profile and potential health benefits. (h/t to MedicalNewsToday.com)
Pink Himalayan salt is a type of rock salt that is chemically similar to table salt, containing up to 98 percent sodium chloride. The remaining two percent is where the magic happens — this portion consists of trace minerals like calcium, magnesium and potassium, which give the salt its distinctive pink color.
These minerals not only enhance its visual appeal but also contribute to its slightly different taste compared to regular table salt.
Unlike table salt, which is heavily refined and often contains anti-caking agents like sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate, pink Himalayan salt is minimally processed and free of artificial additives. This makes it a more natural option for those looking to reduce their intake of processed foods.
Table salt is a staple in most kitchens, but its highly refined nature and added chemicals have raised concerns among health-conscious consumers.
While both table salt and Pink Himalayan salt provide sodium, the latter offers additional trace minerals that can support good overall health.
For example, the potassium in pink Himalayan salt helps balance sodium levels in the body, which is crucial for maintaining overall well-being.
Magnesium also supports muscle and nerve function, while calcium is essential for strong bones and teeth. The minerals in pink Himalayan salt, though present in small amounts, can contribute to a more balanced nutrient intake when pink salt is used regularly.
If you’re still on the fence, here are other reasons to try pink Himalayan salt:
A natural, additive-free option
As mentioned earlier, pink Himalayan salt is free of the artificial additives found in table salt. For those looking to minimize their exposure to synthetic chemicals, this makes it a cleaner, more natural choice.
Supports hydration and fluid balance
Sodium is essential for maintaining proper fluid balance, and pink Himalayan salt can help with this.
Some people even add a pinch of it to their water or meals to promote optimal hydration, especially during hot weather or after intense workouts. (Related: Hydration tips for winter: Why electrolytes are your secret weapon.)
A versatile household item
Salt is not just a kitchen ingredient, it can be used for various purposes. For example, you can use pink Himalayan salt to make salt lamps, which an help clean the air in your home and enhance your mood. Pink Himalayan salt can also be used to make an oral rehydration solution or a saline solution to clean wounds and rinse your sinuses.
While salt is essential for bodily functions like muscle contraction, nerve signaling and fluid balance, excessive intake of table salt can have serious health consequences.
High sodium consumption is a leading risk factor for hypertension (high blood pressure), which can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney problems.
Table salt’s refined nature and lack of balancing minerals like potassium can exacerbate these risks. Over time, a diet high in table salt may lead to fluid retention, strain on the cardiovascular system and even an increased risk of heart failure.
Switching to pink Himalayan salt isn’t just about flavor — it’s about making a healthier choice for your body. Its natural composition, trace minerals and lack of additives make it a superior option for those looking to reduce their reliance on processed foods.
However, moderation is key. Even with pink Himalayan salt, it’s important to monitor your sodium intake.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends consuming less than five grams of salt per day (about one teaspoon) to reduce the risk of heart disease and other health issues.
Pink Himalayan salt offers a more natural, mineral-rich alternative to table salt, making it a worthwhile addition to your pantry. While it’s not a miracle cure, its trace minerals and lack of additives can contribute to a healthier diet.






The Health Ranger Store is committed to helping you find natural alternatives to common products that often contain harmful chemicals. That’s why we’re proud to introduce clean, lab-verified, healthy food options like our Pink Himalayan Salt Fine Ground.

A much healthier alternative to regular salt, pink Himalayan salt can contain up to 84 different beneficial trace minerals without the harmful additives often found in regular table salt.

https://food.news/2025-02-21-kumquat-tiny-citrus-powerhouse-with-health-benefits.html,Kumquat: The tiny citrus powerhouse with big health benefits,"Advertisement

The kumquat (Citrus japonica), a diminutive yet vibrant citrus fruit, has been captivating taste buds and nourishing bodies for centuries. Often overlooked in favor of its larger citrus cousins like oranges and lemons, the kumquat is a nutritional gem that deserves a spotlight.
Known by various names such as “golden orange,” “dwarf orange,” or “cumquat,” this fruit is as versatile as it is flavorful.
With its unique combination of sweet and tart, the kumquat is not only a culinary delight but also a potent source of health-promoting compounds.

Kumquats are easily recognizable by their small, oval shape, typically measuring about the size of a large olive. Their smooth, glossy skin ranges in color from bright orange to deep gold, depending on the variety and ripeness.
Unlike most citrus fruits, the kumquat’s skin is sweet and edible, while the flesh inside is tart and slightly sour. This contrast creates a delightful flavor experience that is both refreshing and complex.
The fruit’s seeds are small and edible, though some prefer to remove them for a smoother texture. (Related: Papaya: Discover the remarkable health benefits of this tropical superfood.)
The kumquat has a rich history that traces back to ancient China, where it was first cultivated over a thousand years ago. The fruit’s name is derived from the Cantonese words gam gwat, meaning “golden orange.”
It was introduced to Europe in the 19th century by Scottish botanist Robert Fortune, who brought it from China to England. From there, it spread to other parts of the world, including the United States, where it is now grown in states like Florida and California.
Today, kumquats are also cultivated in Japan, Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean region, thriving in warm, subtropical climates.
Kumquats are packed with phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals that contribute to their health benefits. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that supports immune function and skin health.
Additionally, kumquats contain significant amounts of fiber, which aids digestion and promotes gut health.
The fruit is also rich in flavonoids, such as lutein, zeaxanthin and beta-carotene, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These compounds help protect the body against oxidative stress and chronic diseases.

The nutritional profile of kumquats makes them a valuable addition to a wellness-focused diet. Here are some of the conditions and symptoms that kumquats may help prevent or alleviate:


Kumquats are incredibly versatile in the kitchen, adding a burst of flavor and nutrition to both sweet and savory dishes.
Their unique sweet-tart profile makes them a popular ingredient in jams, marmalades and desserts. They can also be used to enhance salads, sauces and marinades.
Here are a few recipe ideas that showcase the kumquat’s culinary potential:
The kumquat is a small fruit with a big impact, offering a wealth of health benefits and culinary possibilities.
By incorporating kumquats into your diet, you can enjoy their delightful flavor while enjoying the benefits of their impressive nutritional profile. This tiny citrus fruit is proof that good things often come in small packages.

https://food.news/2025-02-20-debunking-top-10-myths-emergency-food-storage.html,Debunking the TOP 6 MYTHS about emergency food storage,"Advertisement


When it comes to preparing for emergencies, food storage is a cornerstone of any survival plan. Yet, many well-meaning preppers fall victim to common myths that can leave them with a pantry full of unappetizing or unusable items.
From outdated assumptions about shelf life to misconceptions about what your family will actually eat, these myths can undermine even the most carefully laid plans. (h/t to TheEpochTimes.com)

Below are some of the most persistent food storage myths, debunked. You can also read up on practical tips to ensure your emergency food supply is both effective and tailored to your family’s needs.
It’s easy to assume that grocery stores and supply chains will bounce back quickly after a disaster. However, natural disasters, economic disruptions or even pandemics can cripple supply chains, leaving shelves empty for days or even weeks.
For example, earthquakes can damage infrastructure, making it difficult for stores to restock.
Having your own food storage ensures you’re not reliant on external resources that may not be available when you need them most.
While government relief efforts are a critical part of disaster response, they are not instantaneous. As a prepper, you know that it can take days or even weeks for aid to reach affected areas, and not all emergencies qualify for government assistance.
By maintaining your own food storage, you ensure your family has immediate access to meals, no matter the situation.
Factors like heat, humidity and light are the enemies of long-term food storage. Many non-preppers make the mistake of stashing their emergency supplies in garages, attics or outbuildings, only to find their food spoiled when they need it.
Optimal storage conditions — cool, dark and dry — are essential for preserving the quality and shelf life of your food.
If space is an issue, consider decluttering to make room in your home for your emergency supplies.
Canned food is a staple of many food storage plans, and for good reason — it’s convenient, shelf-stable and widely available. However, canned food isn’t foolproof. Over time, it can lose nutrients, flavor and texture. (Related: Quinoa, mushrooms and more: Superfoods for energy and vitality that you need in your survival stockpile.)
For example, canned tuna may become mushy, and soups can change color and taste.
Additionally, many canned foods contain high levels of sodium and preservatives, which may not align with your dietary preferences.
While canned food is a great foundation, it’s important to diversify your storage with freeze-dried meals, grains and other shelf-stable and nutritious options.
Food storage companies determine shelf life based on optimal storage conditions — cool, stable temperatures and protection from light and humidity. While properly stored food can last for decades, real-world conditions often fall short of these ideals.
Over time, food may lose its nutritional value, flavor and texture, even if it remains technically safe to eat.
To maximize shelf life, store your food in the coolest part of your home and use airtight containers to protect against pests and moisture.
Food fatigue is a real phenomenon, even in emergencies. Just because someone is hungry doesn’t mean they’ll eat something they dislike.
Stocking up on foods your family already enjoys or getting versatile ingredients that can be prepared in multiple ways such as grains like quinoa and lentils, is key to avoiding mealtime revolts.
For example, instead of loading up on a single type of canned meal, consider storing basics like rice, beans and spices that can be combined into a variety of dishes.
Once you get started on your food stockpile, use the “first in, first out” method to ensure your food stays fresh. Incorporate stored items into your regular meals to keep your supply current.
Include a mix of canned goods, freeze-dried meals, grains and other shelf-stable items to provide variety and balance.
The best food storage plan is one that’s customized to your family’s unique needs and preferences. By debunking these common myths and following practical tips, you can build a supply that’s not only effective but also enjoyable to eat.

https://food.news/2025-02-20-eggplant-nutritional-powerhouse-with-ancient-roots.html,The majesty of the eggplant: A nutritional powerhouse with ancient roots,"Advertisement

Among the vibrant array of vegetables found in farmer’s markets and grocery stores, the eggplant (Solanum melongena) stands out as a versatile and nutritious gem.
Often referred to by various names such as aubergine, brinjal or melongene, this member of the nightshade family has a rich history and a diverse range of culinary uses.
Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the eggplant is a powerhouse of nutrients and antioxidants that can contribute significantly to your overall health and well-being.

Eggplants are known for their distinctive colors and shapes. The most common variety, often found in Western cuisine, has a deep purple, almost black, color and glossy skin.
However, eggplants can also be found in shades of white, green and even striped patterns, depending on the variety. Their shapes range from the elongated and slender Japanese eggplant to the plump and round Italian varieties.
When cut, the flesh of the eggplant is white and spongy, which can vary in texture from firm to soft when cooked.
In terms of taste, eggplants have a mild, slightly sweet and somewhat earthy flavor, which makes them an excellent base for absorbing the flavors of other ingredients. This adaptability has made eggplants a favorite in cuisines around the world, from the Mediterranean to Southeast Asia.
The origins of the eggplant trace back to ancient times, with evidence suggesting that it was first cultivated in India and China over 4,000 years ago.
The earliest written records of eggplant cultivation date back to the 5th century B.C. in China, where it was initially grown for its medicinal properties. From these regions, the eggplant spread to the Middle East and the Mediterranean, where it became a staple in various cuisines.
The name “eggplant” is believed to have originated from the 18th century, when European varieties of the plant produced small, white, egg-shaped fruits.
In other parts of the world, such as France and the United Kingdom, it is known as “aubergine,” a term derived from the Arabic “al-badhinjan.” In India, it is commonly called “brinjal,” and in some parts of the United States, it is referred to as “melongene.” (Related: Custard apple: A nutrient-packed superfruit with ancient roots.)
Eggplants are not only low in calories but are also packed with essential nutrients and phytonutrients.
They are a good source of dietary fiber, vitamins B1, B6 and K, and minerals like potassium and manganese.
The deep purple skin of the eggplant is particularly rich in anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid with potent antioxidant properties.
One of the most notable phytonutrients found in eggplants is nasunin, an anthocyanin that has been shown to protect the lipids in brain cell membranes, potentially aiding in cognitive function and reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.
Eggplants also contain chlorogenic acid, another potent antioxidant that has been linked to lower blood pressure and improved cardiovascular health.

The nutritional profile of eggplants makes them a valuable addition to a healthy diet. Here are some of the potential benefits and therapeutic uses of eggplants:


The culinary applications of eggplants are vast, and they can be found in various dishes across different cultures. In the Mediterranean, eggplants are a key ingredient in dishes like ratatouille, caponata and moussaka.
In Indian cuisine, they are used in curries, such as baingan bharta, and in the Middle East, they are featured in dishes like baba ganoush.
For those looking to incorporate more eggplants into their diet, there are countless recipes to explore, such as:
The eggplant, with its ancient roots and diverse culinary applications, is more than just a beautiful vegetable. It is a nutritional powerhouse that can contribute significantly to a healthy lifestyle.

Bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), often referred to as wild blueberries, are a small but mighty fruit that has captivated health enthusiasts, chefs and herbalists for centuries.
Known by various names across cultures — such as European blueberries, whortleberries, huckleberries or blaeberries —bilberries are a close relative of cultivated blueberries but boast a unique flavor and nutrition profile as well as medicinal properties.
Bilberries, with their round shape and slightly tart, sweet taste, are not only a culinary delight but also a nutrient powerhouse packed with phytonutrients that can support overall health.

Bilberries are round, about five to nine millimeters in diameter, and grow on low shrubs. They are easily recognizable by their deep indigo hue, which comes from powerful antioxidant pigments called anthocyanins.
When ripe, the skin of bilberries is smooth and slightly waxy, encasing a juicy, dark purple flesh that can stain fingers and tongues alike.
The flavor of bilberries is a delightful balance of sweet and tart, with a more intense and complex taste compared to cultivated blueberries. Their rich, earthy undertones make them a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes.
Bilberries have a rich history that dates back to ancient times. Native to Europe, Asia and North America, these berries have been foraged and consumed for thousands of years.
Historical records suggest that bilberries were used by the ancient Greeks and Romans for their medicinal properties, particularly for digestive and vision-related ailments.
During World War II, British Royal Air Force pilots reportedly consumed bilberry jam to improve their night vision, a testament to the fruit’s long-standing reputation as a vision-enhancing food.
Today, bilberries are primarily found in the wild, thriving in acidic, nutrient-poor soils in temperate and subarctic regions. They are especially abundant in Scandinavian countries, the British Isles and parts of Eastern Europe.
Unlike their cultivated blueberry cousins, bilberries are smaller, darker and more intensely flavored.
Bilberries are celebrated for their exceptional concentration of bioactive compounds, particularly anthocyanins, which are responsible for their vibrant color and many health benefits.
These phytonutrients are potent antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. (Related: The jackfruit: A superfood source of vitamin C, fiber and other nutrients.)

In the realm of exotic and healthful fruits, the persimmon (Diospyros kaki) stands out as a vibrant and versatile addition to any wellness enthusiast’s diet.
Known by various names such as “Sharon fruit” in Israel and “kaki” in Japanese, the persimmon is not only a delight to the palate but also a powerhouse of nutrients that can contribute significantly to overall health.

The persimmon is a visually striking fruit, typically ranging from a deep orange to a rich burgundy color. It is roughly apple-shaped, with a glossy, smooth skin and a distinctive calyx at the top.
When ripe, the flesh of a persimmon is soft, jelly-like and incredibly sweet, with a subtly honeyed flavor that is both comforting and refreshing.

https://food.news/2025-02-18-why-consume-only-lab-verified-cocoa-products.html,Here’s why you should choose only lab-verified cocoa products,"Advertisement



Chocolate is often celebrated as a decadent treat, a mood booster and even a superfood due to its high antioxidant content. But beneath its rich, indulgent surface lies a darker truth: Some cocoa products can harbor harmful contaminants that pose serious health risks. (h/t to Food-Safety.com)
Recent research has raised alarms about the presence of toxic heavy metals like cadmium and lead in chocolate, prompting experts to urge consumers to choose only lab-verified cocoa products.
A groundbreaking study by researchers at Tulane University analyzed 155 chocolate samples from major brands sold in the United States. These products were sourced from cocoa beans grown in regions like West Africa, South America and Asia.
While most samples contained toxic heavy metals below recommended safe levels, some chocolates — particularly dark chocolates with high cocoa content — exceeded safety thresholds for cadmium and lead. Cadmium, a naturally occurring heavy metal, can accumulate in cocoa beans during cultivation, especially in soils contaminated by industrial activities or volcanic ash.
On the other hand, lead often contaminates cocoa during post-harvest processing, particularly while the beans are being dried on the ground or transported in lead-contaminated equipment.
Both metals are toxic even in small amounts, posing serious risks to the kidneys, bones and nervous system over time.
The Tulane University study found that dark chocolates from Central and South America had the highest cadmium levels, with one sample from Colombia containing 843 micrograms per kilogram (ug/kg) — exceeding the European Commission’s safety limit of 800 ug/kg.
Similarly, dark chocolates from Venezuela and Peru contained lead levels far above California’s interim safety limit of 150 ug/kg.
While these levels may not pose immediate risks to adults, they are particularly concerning for children, whose smaller body size makes them more vulnerable to heavy metal toxicity.
Long-term exposure to cadmium and lead can have devastating health consequences. Cadmium is a known carcinogen and can damage the kidneys, weaken bones and increase the risk of osteoporosis.
Lead, even at low levels, can impair cognitive development in children, leading to learning disabilities and behavioral issues. In adults, chronic lead exposure has been linked to high blood pressure, kidney damage and reproductive problems.
For the study, researchers used hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) calculations to assess the risks of long-term exposure to these metals.
While most chocolates posed no significant risk to adults, 33 dark chocolate samples exceeded safety thresholds for children weighing 15 kilograms (33 pounds) or less. This is particularly alarming given that children are more likely to consume chocolate regularly and in larger quantities. (Related: Clean food watch: Does your protein powder contain heavy metals?)
The good news is that not all cocoa products are created equal. By taking a few precautions, you can minimize your exposure to harmful food contaminants:
Choose lab-verified products
Look for chocolates and cocoa powders that have been tested for heavy metals and other contaminants. Reputable brands often provide this information on their packaging or websites.
Lab verification ensures that the product meets safety standards and is free of toxins.
Opt for low-risk origins
The researchers found that chocolates made from West African and Asian cocoa beans generally have lower levels of cadmium and lead. Choose products made from cocoa sourced from these regions.
Moderate your intake
While dark chocolate is often touted for its health benefits, its higher cocoa content also means it’s more likely to contain contaminants.
Limit your consumption to one ounce per day, especially if you’re eating dark chocolate with 70 percent or more cocoa content.
Check for certifications
Certifications like USDA Organic, Fair Trade or Rainforest Alliance indicate better farming and processing practices, which may reduce the risk of contamination.
To ensure cocoa products are safe, rigorous testing is essential. Residue analysis, a process that detects pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins and other contaminants, is a critical step in cocoa quality control.
Advanced techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) are used to measure contaminants at trace levels.
Regular microbiological testing is also crucial to prevent contamination by mold, bacteria and viruses, which can thrive in poorly stored or processed cocoa. By adhering to strict hygiene practices and conducting routine testing, producers can minimize the risk of contamination and ensure their products are safe for consumers.
While chocolate can be a delicious healthy treat, it’s not without risks. The presence of toxic heavy metals like cadmium and lead in some cocoa products underscores the importance of choosing lab-verified options.
By being mindful of where your chocolate comes from and how it’s processed, you can enjoy your favorite treat without compromising your health.

The Health Ranger Store is committed to helping you find high-quality cocoa products so you can protect your family from heavy metal contaminants like cadmium and lead. That’s why we’re proud to introduce clean, lab-verified, healthy foods such as Health Ranger Select Organic Cocoa Love.

Papaya (Carica papaya), often referred to as the “fruit of the angels” by Christopher Columbus, is a tropical treasure celebrated for its vibrant flavor, nutritional richness and medicinal properties.
Known by various names across the globe — such as pawpaw in some regions, tree melon or simply papaya — this fruit has carved a niche in both culinary and wellness circles.
Its golden-orange flesh, sweet taste and buttery texture make it a versatile ingredient, while its impressive nutrient profile positions it as a superfood with the potential to prevent and even reverse certain health conditions.

Papaya is easily recognizable by its oblong shape, which can range from pear-like to cylindrical, depending on the variety.
When ripe, its skin transitions from green to a sunny yellow or orange hue, while its inner flesh glows with a vibrant orange or pinkish color.
The fruit’s taste is a delightful blend of sweetness and mild muskiness, often compared to a cross between a cantaloupe and a mango.
Embedded within the flesh are small, black, gelatinous seeds, which, though edible, are often discarded due to their peppery, slightly bitter flavor.
Papaya is believed to have originated in the tropical regions of Central America, particularly southern Mexico and neighboring countries.
Historical records suggest that the fruit was cultivated by the Maya and Aztec civilizations long before European explorers arrived in the Americas. Spanish and Portuguese colonizers introduced papaya to other parts of the world, including the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and Africa, where it thrived in warm, humid climates.
Today, papaya is grown in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, with India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia being among the largest producers.
Papaya’s health benefits stem from its rich array of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients.
It is an excellent source of vitamin C, providing more than 100 percent of the recommended daily intake in a single serving.
The fruit also contains significant amounts of vitamin A, folate, potassium and magnesium.
Among its phytonutrients are carotenoids like beta-carotene, lycopene and lutein, which are known for their antioxidant properties.

In the world of superfoods, few fruits capture the imagination quite like the miracle fruit (Synsepalum dulcificum). This small, unassuming berry earned its name from its extraordinary ability to alter taste perception, turning sour flavors into sweet sensations.
Beyond its novelty, miracle fruit is gaining attention for its potential health benefits, making it a fascinating subject for wellness enthusiasts and researchers alike.
Miracle fruit, also known as miracle berry, sweet berry or flavor berry, is a bright red, oblong berry native to West Africa.
The fruit is roughly the size of a coffee bean, measuring about two to three centimeters in length. Its vibrant red hue and smooth skin make it visually appealing, though its taste is relatively mild when eaten fresh. (Related: 5 Remarkable ways GARLIC can support your health, according to science.)
The berry itself is not particularly sweet or flavorful, but its magic lies in its unique active compound, miraculin.
Miraculin is a glycoprotein that binds to taste buds and temporarily alters their function. When consumed, the compound makes sour or acidic foods, such as lemons, vinegar or pickles, taste sweet. This effect can last anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the individual.
The fruit’s ability to transform taste has made it a popular novelty item, but its health benefits are equally compelling.
Miracle fruit has a rich history rooted in West Africa, where it has been used for centuries by indigenous communities.
The fruit was first documented by European explorers in the 18th century, with records suggesting that local tribes used it to sweeten sour foods and beverages.
In the 1960s, miracle fruit gained international attention when researchers began studying its potential as a natural sweetener for individuals with diabetes or those seeking to reduce sugar intake.
Today, miracle fruit is primarily cultivated in West Africa, particularly in countries like Ghana, Nigeria and Benin. It is also grown in tropical regions of Asia and the Americas, though on a smaller scale.
The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish.
While miracle fruit is not a significant source of macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, or fats, it contains a combination of essential nutrients and phytonutrients that contribute to its health-promoting properties. These include:
These compounds work synergistically to provide a range of health benefits, making miracle fruit more than just a culinary curiosity.

Miracle fruit has been studied for its potential to address various health conditions and symptoms. While research is still in its early stages, preliminary findings suggest that the fruit may offer the following benefits:



Miracle fruit’s unique properties make it a versatile ingredient in the kitchen. While it is often consumed fresh or in tablet form for its taste-modifying effects, it can also be incorporated into creative recipes.
Here are a few ideas:
Miracle fruit is a testament to nature’s ingenuity, offering both sensory delight and potential health benefits. While more research is needed to fully understand its therapeutic potential, miracle fruit stands as a shining example of how superfoods can bridge the gap between pleasure and well-being.

https://food.news/2025-02-17-kaffir-plum-superfood-nutrition-wellness-fruits.html,The Kaffir plum: A hidden gem of nutrition and wellness,"Advertisement

The Kaffir plum (Harpephyllum caffrum), a lesser-known but nutritionally potent fruit, is a treasure trove of health benefits and culinary potential.
Native to Southern Africa, this fruit has been a staple in traditional diets and herbal medicine for centuries.
The Kaffir plum is a vibrant, tangy fruit that deserves a spotlight in the world of superfoods.

The Kaffir plum, scientifically named Harpephyllum caffrum, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known fruits like mangoes and cashews.
Its common names reflect its regional significance and characteristics. In South Africa, it is often referred to as “wild plum” or “sour plum,” while in other parts of the continent, it is simply called “African plum.”
It thrives in subtropical climates and is often found growing wild in riverine forests.
The tree itself is an evergreen, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, and produces clusters of small, oval-shaped fruits that ripen to a deep red or purple hue.
The Kaffir plum is a visually striking fruit, with its glossy, smooth skin and vibrant color. When ripe, the fruit transitions from green to a rich red or purple, signaling its readiness for harvest.
The flesh is juicy and fibrous, with a tart, tangy flavor that is both refreshing and slightly astringent. The taste is often compared to a combination of cranberries and plums, with a hint of citrus. This unique flavor profile makes it a versatile ingredient in sweet and savory dishes.
The name “Kaffir” itself is derived from the Arabic word for “non-believer” and was historically used by European settlers to describe indigenous African people.
However, due to its derogatory connotations, the term is increasingly avoided in modern contexts, and the fruit is more commonly referred to by its other names.
The Kaffir plum tree is indigenous to the coastal and inland forests of Southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.
The Kaffir plum is a feast for the palate and an impressive nutritional powerhouse. Rich in phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals, this fruit offers a range of health benefits. (Related: The star of wellness: Exploring the nutritional power of carambola (starfruit).)
Among its key phytonutrients are flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and anthocyanins, which are responsible for its vibrant color and antioxidant properties.
These compounds help combat oxidative stress, reduce inflammation and protect against chronic diseases.
Here are some of the health benefits of Kaffir plums:



The tangy flavor and vibrant color of Kaffir plums make them a versatile ingredient in a variety of dishes. Here are a few recipe ideas that showcase the fruit’s unique qualities:
The Kaffir plum, with its rich history, vibrant appearance and impressive nutritional profile, is a fruit that deserves greater recognition. Its potential to prevent and reverse various health conditions, coupled with its culinary versatility, makes it a valuable addition to any diet.

https://food.news/2025-02-16-titanium-dioxide-food-additive-health-risks.html,The hidden danger in your food: Titanium dioxide and the health risks you need to know,"Advertisement

Brightly colored candies, creamy frosting and white bread are commonly consumed food products, so chances are you’ve already consumed titanium dioxide (TiO2), a food additive often used to whiten and brighten processed foods. While it may make your food look more appealing, this chemical has been linked to serious health risks — so much so that the European Union banned it as a food additive in 2022.
Yet, in the U.S., titanium dioxide remains a staple on grocery store shelves, hidden in everything from Skittles to Duncan Hines frosting.
The question is: Why is a chemical deemed unsafe in Europe still allowed in American foods? And what are the potential dangers of consuming it?
Titanium dioxide is a white, powdery substance used primarily as a pigment in paints, plastics and cosmetics.
In food, it’s labeled as E171 and added to products like candies, chewing gum, baked goods and even some dairy items to enhance their color and texture. It has no nutritional value; its sole purpose is aesthetic.
Despite its widespread use, titanium dioxide has come under scrutiny in recent years due to growing evidence of its potential harm to human health. Studies have linked it to DNA damage, inflammation and cancer.
The primary concern with titanium dioxide lies in its nanoparticle form. Nanoparticles are incredibly tiny particles that can easily penetrate cells and tissues. When ingested, these particles can accumulate in the body, particularly in the gut, liver and spleen.
Research has found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles can cause genotoxicity, meaning they can damage DNA and potentially lead to cancer. A study published in Food and Chemical Toxicology found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles induced DNA damage in human intestinal cells, raising concerns about their role in colorectal cancer. (Related: FDA proposes ban of popular food additive linked to negative side effects.)
Additionally, titanium dioxide has been linked to intestinal inflammation and disruptions to the gut microbiome, the community of beneficial bacteria that plays a crucial role in digestion, immunity and overall health.
A study published in Nanotoxicology also found that mice fed titanium dioxide experienced significant gut inflammation and changes to their gut bacteria, which could increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic conditions.
The dangers of titanium dioxide aren’t limited to the gut. Emerging research suggests that nanoparticles can cross the blood-brain barrier, potentially harming the nervous system.
A study published in the Archives of Toxicology found that titanium dioxide exposure in mice led to changes in gut bacteria and locomotor dysfunction, suggesting a link between the additive and neurological issues.
Even more alarming, a 2025 study published in Alzheimer’s and Dementia found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles can bind to neurons, triggering oxidative stress and inflammation — two key factors in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.
In 2022, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that titanium dioxide could no longer be considered safe for human consumption due to concerns about genotoxicity. This led to a ban across the European Union.
In contrast, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains that titanium dioxide is safe for use in food. According to reports, the agency last reviewed the additive’s safety in 1973, long before the rise of nanotechnology and the growing body of research highlighting its risks.
Public health advocates also argue that the FDA’s outdated safety standards are putting Americans at risk.
While policy changes are needed to address the widespread use of titanium dioxide, there are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to this harmful chemical:
Read labels carefully
Titanium dioxide may be listed as “E171” or simply as “artificial color.” Avoid products that contain these ingredients.
Choose whole foods
Opt for minimally processed foods, which are less likely to contain artificial additives.
Support advocacy efforts
Organizations like the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) are pushing for stricter regulations on food additives. Supporting these efforts can help drive change.
The case of titanium dioxide highlights a broader issue: The lack of oversight and transparency in the U.S. food system. While Europe has taken a precautionary approach – banning additives until they are proven safe – the U.S. often allows chemicals to remain in use until they are proven harmful.
As a consumer, you have the power to demand better. By staying informed and making conscious choices, you can protect your health and push for a food system that prioritizes safety over profit.

The mango (Mangifera indica), often referred to as the “king of fruits,” is a tropical treasure celebrated for its luscious flavor, vibrant color and impressive nutritional profile.
Known by various names across cultures — such as aam in Hindi, mangga in Filipino and mamuang in Thai — the mango has captivated palates and nourished bodies for thousands of years.

Mangoes are as diverse in appearance as they are in flavor. Their skin can range from green to yellow, orange or even red, often with a blush of multiple hues. The shape of a mango varies depending on the cultivar, with some being round, others being oblong and some being distinctly kidney-shaped.
Inside, the fruit has a golden-yellow to orange flesh that is juicy, fibrous and irresistibly sweet, with a hint of tartness that balances its flavor.
The taste of a ripe mango is often described as a harmonious blend of peach, pineapple and citrus, making it a universally beloved fruit.
The mango’s origins trace back to South Asia, where it has been cultivated for over 4,000 years. Historical records suggest that mangoes were first domesticated in India and Myanmar, where they held cultural and religious significance. The fruit was later introduced to other parts of the world through trade and colonization.
By the 16th century, Portuguese explorers had brought mangoes to Africa and South America, and from there, their cultivation spread to tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.
Today, India remains the largest producer of mangoes, followed by countries like China, Thailand, Mexico and Indonesia. (Related: Here are 10 kiwifruit benefits you shouldn’t miss out on.)
Mangoes are not just a treat for the taste buds, they are also a rich source of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds. Mangoes are packed with vitamins, particularly vitamins A and C (in the form of beta-carotene), which are known to support immune function and eye health.
Mangoes also contain significant amounts of vitamin E, vitamin K and B-complex vitamins, including folate.
In addition to vitamins, mangoes are a treasure trove of phytonutrients, which are plant-based compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Protein powders, whether whey-based or plant-based, are a convenient and effective way to refuel and recover after winter workouts, helping you stay strong and energized throughout the season.


If you exercise during the winter months, you may find yourself bundling up for outdoor runs, hitting the gym to stay active or even shoveling snow as an impromptu workout. While the cold weather can make exercise feel more challenging, it also highlights the importance of proper recovery — especially when it involves post-workout nutrition.
Enter protein powders, a reliable way to refuel, repair and rebuild after a tough winter workout. (h/t to WorkingAgainstGravity.com)
After working out, your body needs three key things to fully recover:
In winter, these needs become even more critical. Cold weather can strain your immune system, and indoor workouts in dry, heated environments can leave you dehydrated without you even realizing it.
Protein powders, such as whey or plant-based options like pea protein, offer a quick and efficient way to deliver the nutrients your body craves.
Whether you’re sipping a protein shake or blending it into a smoothie, these supplements can help maximize recovery, especially during the 30- to 60-minute post-workout window when your body is most receptive to nutrient absorption.
Still in doubt? Here are some reasons to try protein powders this winter:
Muscle repair and growth
Winter workouts, such as lifting weights, running on icy trails or shoveling snow, can take a toll on your muscles. Protein powders provide a concentrated source of high-quality protein, which is essential for repairing muscle fibers.
Whey protein, in particular, is rich in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which are known to support normal muscle recovery.
For those who prefer plant-based options, pea protein is an excellent alternative, with its complete amino acid profile that rivals animal-based proteins.
Convenience in cold weather
When it’s freezing outside, the last thing you want to do is spend time cooking a complex post-workout meal. Protein powders are a lifesaver for busy individuals who need a quick recovery option.
Just mix a scoop with water, milk or a plant-based alternative and you’ve got a nutrient-packed shake ready to go.
Hydration help
Staying hydrated in winter can be tricky, as the cold weather often masks thirst. Protein shakes made with water or milk not only deliver protein but also contribute to your daily fluid intake.
For an added hydration boost, consider adding a pinch of electrolyte powder to your shake.
With so many options on the market, selecting the right protein powder can feel overwhelming. Here’s a quick guide to help you decide:
Organic options
If you’re prioritizing clean eating, look for organic protein powders made with minimal ingredients and free of artificial additives. (Related: Clean food watch: Does your protein powder contain heavy metals?)
Pea protein
Pea protein is a plant-based option that’s easy to digest and packed with essential amino acids. Pea protein is ideal for vegans or those with dairy sensitivities.
Whey protein
A fast-digesting protein derived from milk, whey is ideal for post-workout recovery due to its high BCAA content. It’s also versatile and blends well into shakes and smoothies.
Here are some tips on how to incorporate protein powders into a winter workout:
Prep ahead
Save time by portioning out single servings of protein powder in small containers or bags so they’re ready to grab and go.
Blend with winter-friendly ingredients
Add seasonal fruits like bananas, berries or a handful of spinach to your shake for extra nutrients and flavor.
Stay consistent
Make protein shakes a regular part of your post-workout routine to ensure you’re consistently supporting healthy muscle recovery.
Winter workouts can be tough, but with the right recovery strategy, you can stay strong and energized all season long. Protein powders, whether whey-based or plant-based, offer a convenient and effective way to refuel your body after exercise.

Garcinia (Garcinia gummi-gutta), commonly known as garcinia or garcinia cambogia, is a tropical fruit that has garnered significant attention for its health benefits.
With its vibrant yellow-green hue and tangy flavor, garcinia is not only a culinary delight but also a powerhouse of phytonutrients that can support overall wellness.
Garcinia is a small, pumpkin-shaped fruit native to Southeast Asia and India. It is known by several other names, such as Malabar tamarind, brindleberry (brindle berry) and kudam puli. It is also known by the name Garcinia cambogia, the fruit’s former scientific name.
Garcinia is typically about the size of an orange. It has a distinctive ridged surface that gives it a pumpkin-like appearance. When ripe, its skin turns a bright yellow or greenish-yellow, and its flesh becomes pale and segmented like a citrus fruit.
The taste of garcinia is notably sour, often compared to tamarind or lemon, making it a popular ingredient in traditional cuisines, adding a tangy kick to dishes.
In Southeast Asia, it is frequently used in curries, chutneys and pickles. In India, it is a key component of fish curries in Kerala, where it is known as kudam puli.
The use of garcinia dates back centuries, with its origins rooted in the lush rainforests of Southeast Asia and the Western Ghats of India.
Garcinia is a staple in Ayurvedic medicine, where it was valued for its digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The fruit was first documented in the 18th century by European botanists who were intrigued by its unique appearance and medicinal potential.
Today, garcinia is cultivated in tropical regions worldwide, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and parts of Africa, where it thrives in humid, warm climates.
Garcinia is rich in bioactive compounds that contribute to its health-promoting properties. One of its most studied components is hydroxycitric acid (HCA), a derivative of citric acid that is believed to play a role in weight management and appetite suppression.
Additionally, garcinia contains flavonoids, polyphenols and xanthones, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. These phytonutrients work synergistically to combat oxidative stress, support metabolic health and protect against chronic diseases.
Research has found that garcinia can offer a range of health benefits, making it a valuable addition to a balanced diet.
Here are some of the health benefits associated with garcinia:
Garcinia’s unique flavor profile makes it a versatile ingredient in both traditional and modern recipes. (Related: Here’s a healthy and delicious tiger nut gingerbread cookie recipe you’ll love.)

In the world of exotic fruits, eggfruit, scientifically known as Pouteria campechiana, stands out as a unique superfood. Commonly referred to as canistel, yellow sapote or “eggfruit” due to its custard-like texture and bright yellow hue, this tropical gem has been cherished for centuries in its native regions.
With its rich history, distinctive flavor profile and impressive health benefits, eggfruit is a fruit worth exploring for anyone interested in nutrition, wellness and culinary adventure.
Eggfruit is a tropical fruit native to Central America and southern Mexico, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The fruit is typically oval or egg-shaped, hence its name, and ranges in size from three to seven inches in length.
When ripe, its skin turns a vibrant yellow-orange while its flesh becomes dense, smooth and creamy, resembling the texture of a hard-boiled egg yolk.
Eggfruit is often described as sweet and mildly tangy, with notes of pumpkin, sweet potato and mango, making it a versatile ingredient in sweet and savory dishes. (Related: The star of wellness: Exploring the nutritional power of carambola (starfruit).)
The origins of eggfruit can be traced back to the lowland rainforests of southern Mexico and Central America, where it was first domesticated by indigenous peoples.
Spanish explorers encountered the fruit during their colonization of the Americas and introduced it to the Philippines in the 17th century. From there, it spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and tropical regions of Africa.
Today, eggfruit is grown in warm climates worldwide, including Florida, Hawaii and parts of South America, where it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils.
Eggfruit is not only delicious but also packed with essential nutrients and bioactive compounds. It is an excellent source of vitamins A and C, which are crucial for immune function, skin health and vision.
The fruit also contains significant amounts of dietary fiber, potassium and B vitamins, including niacin and riboflavin.
Eggfruit is rich in phytonutrients, such as carotenoids (beta-carotene and lutein), flavonoids and phenolic compounds, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These phytonutrients play a vital role in combating oxidative stress, reducing inflammation and protecting against chronic diseases.
For example, beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A and has been linked to improved eye health and a reduced risk of age-related macular degeneration.
Lutein, another carotenoid found in eggfruit, is known to support brain health and may help prevent cognitive decline.
The nutrient-dense profile of eggfruit makes it a powerful ally in promoting overall health and preventing a range of conditions.
Here are some of the key health benefits associated with this tropical superfood:
Eggfruit’s unique texture and flavor make it a versatile ingredient in a variety of dishes. Its natural sweetness pairs well with sweet and savory recipes, while its creamy consistency makes it an excellent substitute for eggs or dairy in vegan cooking.

In the lush tropics of Southeast Asia, a small, tangy fruit grows in abundance. It is often overlooked by the global health community but cherished by those who know its secrets.
Known as bilimbi (Averrhoa bilimbi), this fruit is also called the cucumber tree or tree sorrel due to its elongated shape and sour flavor.
While it may not yet be a household name, bilimbi is a nutrient powerhouse with a rich history and several health benefits.
Bilimbi is a small, green fruit that turns yellowish-green when ripe. It is typically four to 10 centimeters long, with a cylindrical shape that tapers slightly at both ends, resembling a miniature cucumber.
The skin is thin and waxy, while the flesh is juicy and acidic. Its flavor is often compared to that of a sour green apple or tamarind. Its intense tartness makes it a popular ingredient in pickles, chutneys and refreshing beverages.
The fruit grows in clusters on the bilimbi tree, a small to medium-sized evergreen that thrives in tropical climates.
The tree is closely related to the starfruit (Averrhoa carambola), sharing a similar botanical lineage but differing significantly in taste and texture.
Bilimbi is believed to have originated in the Moluccas (Maluku Islands), an archipelago in Indonesia, and has been cultivated in Southeast Asia for centuries. It was later introduced to other tropical regions, including India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and parts of South America.
The fruit has long been a staple in traditional medicine and cuisine in these regions, valued for its versatility and health-promoting properties.
In traditional Ayurvedic and Malay medicine, bilimbi is used to treat a variety of ailments, from coughs and fevers to skin conditions and digestive issues.
Its high acidity also makes it a popular natural cleaning agent and preservative.
Bilimbi is a treasure trove of phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals. It is particularly rich in vitamin C, a potent antioxidant that supports immune function and skin health.
The fruit also contains significant amounts of vitamin A, iron and calcium, making it a valuable addition to a balanced diet.
Bilimbi is known to contain flavonoids, tannins and phenolic compounds, which have been studied for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. These compounds help combat oxidative stress, reduce inflammation and protect against chronic diseases.
Additionally, bilimbi is a natural source of oxalic acid, which, while beneficial in moderation, should be consumed cautiously by individuals with kidney issues.
Modern research has begun to validate many of the traditional uses of bilimbi, shedding light on its potential to prevent and manage various health conditions.
Here are some of the key benefits of bilimbi:
Bilimbi’s unique flavor makes it a versatile ingredient in savory and sweet dishes.
Here are some recipe ideas that showcase its tangy appeal:
Bilimbi is more than just a sour fruit: It is a testament to nature’s ability to provide both flavor and healing. From its origins in the Moluccas to its widespread use in traditional medicine and cuisine, bilimbi has earned its place as a tropical superfruit.
Whether consumed for its health benefits or its culinary versatility, this tangy treasure is worth exploring. As research continues to uncover its potential, bilimbi may soon find its way into the global spotlight as a must-have addition to a wellness-focused diet.

In the vast landscapes of Africa, a fruit known as baobab, or “monkey bread,” has been a staple food for centuries, revered for its unique nutritional profile and health benefits.

The fruit also contains significant amounts of other essential nutrients, including potassium, magnesium and calcium. These minerals are vital for maintaining proper nerve function, muscle health and bone density.

In the world of superfoods, few fruits are as intriguing — or as polarizing — as the African cucumber, also known as bitter melon.
With its distinctive appearance, sharp flavor and impressive nutritional profile, this humble fruit has been a staple in traditional medicine and cuisine for centuries. Today, it is gaining global recognition for its potential to support good health and help prevent disease.
African cucumber, or bitter melon (Momordica charantia), is a tropical vine fruit native to Africa, Asia and parts of the Caribbean. Despite its name, it’s not a cucumber but a member of the gourd family, which includes pumpkins, watermelons and zucchinis.
The fruit is easily recognizable by its oblong shape, bumpy skin and vibrant green color, which turns yellow-orange as it ripens. When bitter melon is sliced open, it reveals a hollow center filled with seeds encased in a bright red pulp.
As its name suggests, bitter melon has a sharp, bitter taste that can be an acquired taste for some. But this bitterness is proof of its rich phytonutrient content, which makes it a powerhouse of health benefits.
Bitter melon is packed with bioactive compounds that contribute to its medicinal properties. These include:
Antioxidants
Bitter melon is rich in vitamin C, beta-carotene and other antioxidants that combat oxidative stress and inflammation, protecting cells from damage.
Charantin
Known for its blood sugar-lowering effects, charantin is a key compound in bitter melon that has been studied for its potential to support diabetes management.
Fiber
High in dietary fiber, bitter melon can support digestive health and helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels.
Flavonoids and phenolic acids
These compounds have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and immune-boosting properties.
Polypeptide-p
Often referred to as “plant insulin,” this compound mimics the action of insulin in the body, making it particularly beneficial for those with insulin resistance or diabetes.
Vicine
Vicine is another compound that may help regulate blood sugar levels.
The unique combination of phytonutrients in bitter melon makes it a versatile superfood with a wide range of health benefits. (Related: Study: Bitter melon shows promising results in fighting 6 CANCERS commonly found in women.)
Here’s how it can support your overall health:
Diabetes management
Bitter melon has been extensively studied for its ability to help lower blood sugar levels. Bitter melon compounds can mimic insulin and improve glucose uptake, making it a natural ally for those managing Type 2 diabetes.
Digestive health
Its fiber content can support regular bowel movements and a healthy gut microbiome.
Heart health
The fruit’s high fiber content helps reduce bad cholesterol (LDL) levels, while its antioxidants protect blood vessels from oxidative damage, supporting cardiovascular health.
Immune support
With its rich vitamin C content and antimicrobial properties, bitter melon can help strengthen your immune system and fight off infections.
Skin health
The antioxidants in bitter melon can combat free radicals that cause oxidative stress, thus helping reduce signs of aging and promoting a healthy complexion.
Weight management
Low in calories and high in fiber, bitter melon promotes satiety and aids in weight loss by curbing overeating.
Bitter melon has a long history of use in traditional medicine and cuisine. It is believed to have originated in India, where it has been used for over 5,000 years in Ayurvedic medicine. From there, it spread to Africa, China and the Caribbean, where it became a staple in local diets and healing traditions.
Today, bitter melon is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. It thrives in warm climates and is often grown in home gardens, making it accessible to many communities.
Its resilience and adaptability have contributed to its widespread popularity.
While its bitterness can be intimidating, bitter melon can be prepared in delicious ways that balance its flavor.
Here are some recipe ideas to get you started:
Bitter melon chips
Thinly slice the fruit, season with spices and bake until crispy for a crunchy, healthy snack.
Bitter melon smoothie
Blend a small piece of bitter melon with sweet fruits like apple, mango or pineapple to mask its bitterness while retaining its health benefits.
Bitter melon soup
Combine bitter melon with chicken or vegetable broth, ginger and turmeric for a warming, immune-boosting soup.
Stir-fried bitter melon
Saute thin slices of bitter melon with garlic, onions and your choice of protein for a savory, nutrient-packed dish.
Stuffed bitter melon
Hollow out the fruit and stuff it with a mixture of ground meat, spices and rice, then bake or steam until tender.
The African cucumber, or bitter melon, may not be the most approachable fruit at first glance, but its health benefits are undeniable. From helping manage blood sugar to boosting immunity, this superfood offers a natural way to support your well-being.
Whether you’re a seasoned health enthusiast or just beginning to explore the world of superfoods, bitter melon is a worthy addition to your diet.

Durian, often referred to as the “king of fruits,” is a tropical fruit that evokes strong reactions — both adoration and aversion — due to its unique aroma, flavor and texture. Native to Southeast Asia, this spiky, pungent fruit has been a culinary and cultural staple for centuries.
Beyond its polarizing reputation, durian is a nutrient powerhouse that is packed with phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals that offer a range of health benefits.
Durian is instantly recognizable by its large, oblong shape and thick, spiky rind, which can range in color from green to brown. The fruit typically weighs between two to seven pounds, with some varieties growing even larger.
Inside the tough exterior lies a creamy, custard-like flesh divided into segments, each encasing a large seed. The color of the flesh varies from pale yellow to deep orange, depending on the variety.
The taste of durian is as complex as its aroma. Described as a blend of sweet, savory and creamy flavors, it has been likened to a unique combination of almonds, caramel and cheese.
However, its strong, sulfurous odor — often compared to rotting onions or gym socks — has led to its ban in many public spaces, including hotels and public transportation in Southeast Asia.
Despite its divisive reputation, durian enthusiasts enjoy its rich, indulgent flavor and consider it a delicacy.
Durian is the edible fruit produced by several tree species within the genus Durio. Of the 30 recognized species in this genus, at least nine are known to bear edible fruit. Among these, Durio zibethinus, which is native to Borneo and Sumatra, is the sole species widely available in international markets.
Durian has a long and storied history, with its origins tracing back to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Historical records suggest that durian has been cultivated for over 400 years, with early mentions in texts from the 15th century.
Today, it is widely grown in tropical regions, particularly in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, which are among the largest producers and exporters of the fruit. The name “durian” is derived from the Malay word duri, meaning “thorn,” a nod to its spiky exterior.
Over time, durian has become deeply embedded in the cultural fabric of Southeast Asia, featuring prominently in local cuisines, festivals and traditional medicine.
Durian is not only a culinary delight but also a nutrient-dense superfood. It is rich in vitamins such as vitamin C, vitamin B6 and folate, as well as minerals like iron, magnesium and potassium.
Additionally, durian contains a variety of phytonutrients, including:
The unique combination of nutrients and phytonutrients in durian makes it a valuable addition to a health-conscious diet. Research suggests that durian may help prevent or alleviate several conditions:
Durian’s versatility in the kitchen makes it a favorite ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. Here are some recipe ideas that showcase its unique flavor:
Durian is a fruit of contradictions — beloved by some, reviled by others — but its nutritional value is undeniable. From its rich history in Southeast Asia to its potential health benefits, durian deserves recognition as more than just a pungent curiosity. For those willing to embrace its bold aroma, the “king of fruits” may just become a cherished addition to a balanced diet.

Dates, the sweet fruits of the date palm tree (Phoenix dactylifera), are a nutrient powerhouse that has been cherished for thousands of years. These small, oblong-shaped fruits are not only a delight to the palate but also a treasure trove of health benefits. With their rich, caramel-like flavor and chewy texture, dates have earned their place as a versatile superfood in modern diets.
Read on to learn more about the history, nutritional profile, health benefits and culinary uses of dates and why this ancient fruit deserves a spot in your pantry.
Dates are typically oval or cylindrical in shape, ranging from one to three inches in length. Their color varies depending on the variety and ripeness, spanning shades of amber, deep brown and even black.
The fruit’s skin is slightly wrinkled, while the flesh is dense and sticky, encasing a single, elongated seed. Dates are naturally sweet, with hints of caramel, honey and butterscotch, making them a popular natural sweetener in both traditional and contemporary cuisines.
The cultivation of dates dates back to around 4,000 BCE in ancient Mesopotamia, where they were considered a staple food. The date palm is believed to have originated in the Middle East, particularly in regions now known as modern-day Iraq and Egypt. Over time, its cultivation spread across North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and parts of South Asia.
Today, dates are grown in arid and semi-arid regions worldwide, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Algeria being among the top producers.
The date palm holds cultural and religious significance in many societies. In Islam, dates are traditionally eaten to break the fast during Ramadan, while in Christianity, they are sometimes associated with the biblical “land of milk and honey.”
The date palm tree’s resilience in harsh climates and its ability to provide sustenance in desert regions have earned it the nickname “the tree of life.”
Dates are a rich source of essential nutrients, including dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals. They are particularly high in potassium, magnesium and copper, which are known to support heart health, muscle function and energy production.
Dates also contain significant amounts of B vitamins, such as B6 and niacin, which play a role in metabolism and nervous system health.
One of the most remarkable aspects of dates is their phytonutrient content. These bioactive compounds have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and disease-fighting properties. (Related: Here are 10 kiwifruit benefits you shouldn’t miss out on.)
Dates are rich in flavonoids, carotenoids and phenolic acids, which help neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress in the body.
Specific phytonutrients in dates include:

https://food.news/2025-02-02-hidden-dangers-of-using-weight-loss-medications.html,The hidden dangers of using weight loss medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro,"Advertisement



With societal pressures and beauty standards that often dictate self-worth, more women are turning to weight loss medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro to shed pounds quickly and discreetly.
A recent poll revealed that one in ten women is already using these so-called “fat jabs,” while nearly three-quarters are considering them. However, many are doing so in secret, fearing the stigma associated with losing weight without using traditional methods like diet and exercise.
While these medications — known as GLP-1 receptor agonists — have been hailed as “miracle drugs” for their ability to curb appetite and promote significant weight loss, their growing popularity comes with a dark side.
Beyond the allure of rapid results, these drugs carry serious health risks that are often overlooked in the pursuit of a slimmer figure.
Weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro work by mimicking hormones that slow digestion and reduce hunger, helping users feel full for longer. While this can lead to impressive weight loss, it also comes with a host of side effects.
A recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine highlighted both the benefits and risks of these medications, revealing that while they may reduce the risk of certain conditions like dementia and addiction, they also increase the likelihood of severe gastrointestinal, pancreatic and kidney issues.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In rare cases, weight loss drugs may also cause stomach paralysis, a condition where the stomach muscles stop working, leading to severe discomfort and digestive problems.
More alarmingly, these drugs have been linked to pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and kidney damage, which can progress silently until it becomes life-threatening.
For women who are taking these medications in secret, the risks are compounded. Without medical supervision, they may not recognize the early warning signs of these serious conditions.
Additionally, the pressure to hide their use can lead to feelings of isolation and shame, further exacerbating mental health challenges.
The poll also revealed that many women feel compelled to keep their use of weight loss medications a secret due to societal judgment. The idea that weight loss should be achieved solely through diet and exercise is deeply ingrained, creating a stigma around using medical interventions.
This stigma can prevent women from seeking proper medical guidance, leaving them vulnerable to the risks associated with unsupervised drug use. (Related: Diane Kazer on Decentralize.TV: The dark side of WEIGHT LOSS and the rise of alternative therapies.)
Moreover, reliance on these medications often overshadows the importance of addressing the root causes of weight gain, such as poor eating habits, mental health struggles or a sedentary lifestyle. While weight loss drugs can provide a temporary solution, they are not a substitute for sustainable lifestyle changes.
For women seeking to lose weight without the risks of medication, here are several science-backed strategies that can help achieve sustainable results:
Prioritize protein-rich foods like lean meats, fish, eggs and legumes to preserve muscle mass and keep you feeling full.
Incorporate a variety of vegetables, such as leafy greens, tomatoes and bell peppers, to boost nutrient intake without excess calories.
Include healthy fats like olive oil, avocados and nuts in moderation to support overall health.
Combine cardio exercises like walking, jogging or cycling with strength training to build muscle and burn fat.
Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, as recommended by health guidelines.
Foods high in dietary fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, can help you feel fuller for longer and stabilize blood sugar levels.
Consume at least 25-30 grams of fiber daily to support healthy digestion and weight loss.
Stress, anxiety and depression can also contribute to overeating and weight gain. Seeking support from a therapist or counselor can help address these underlying issues.
Remember that sustainable weight loss is a gradual process. Aim to lose one to two pounds per week through consistent, healthy habits rather than quick fixes like weight loss drugs.
The rise in the secretive use of weight loss medications highlights the need for greater awareness of their risks and the importance of addressing weight loss holistically. Women should feel empowered to seek help without fear of judgment, whether through medical professionals, nutritionists or mental health counselors.
While weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro may offer short-term solutions, they are not without significant risks. For long-term health and well-being, a balanced approach that includes proper nutrition, regular exercise and mental health support remains the safest and most effective way to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.
In a society that often equates thinness with success, it’s crucial to remember that health is not just about the number on the scale — it’s about feeling strong, energized and confident in your own skin. And that’s something no medication can provide.

https://food.news/2025-01-18-natural-ways-reduce-harmful-fat-heart-tips.html,Natural ways to reduce harmful fat around the heart: Expert tips for better heart health,"Advertisement



Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, but emerging research suggests that managing fat around the heart — a type of visceral fat — can play a critical role in reducing cardiovascular risks.
Unlike subcutaneous fat, which lies just beneath the skin, visceral fat is deeper, surrounding vital organs like the heart and liver. This type of fat is particularly dangerous because it can trigger inflammation, disrupt heart function and increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular events.
The good news? Experts say that natural, lifestyle-based approaches can help reduce this harmful fat and improve overall heart health.
Visceral fat, including fat around the heart, is more than just a storage depot for excess calories. It’s metabolically active, releasing inflammatory substances called cytokines that can damage blood vessels and heart tissue.
Over time, this inflammation can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to heart disease.
A study published in Cardiovascular Diagnosis & Therapy highlighted the dangers of visceral fat, noting that its location — especially around the heart — can predict future cardiovascular events.
Dr. Sanjay Rajagopalan, a cardiovascular researcher at Case Western Reserve University, explains that this fat can even alter heart muscle function, increasing the risk of heart failure and irregular heart rhythms.
Here are three approaches that can help naturally reduce fat around the heart:
Dr. Sean O’Mara, a physician specializing in health optimization, emphasizes that reducing visceral fat — including fat around the heart — should be a primary focus for maintaining heart health. His program combines diet, fasting, exercise and environmental therapies to target fat at its source.
Diet
O’Mara recommends a carnivore-based diet that includes meat and fermented fruits, vegetables and dairy.
Fermentation eliminates sugars and inflammatory compounds while preserving nutrients and gut-friendly microbes. He also recommends avoiding processed foods.
Fasting
Prolonged fasting is a cornerstone of his approach. Studies suggest that extended fasts can reset metabolism and burn fat effectively.
Exercise
Instead of long-distance running, O’Mara advocates for anaerobic activities like sprinting or brisk walking, which promote fat loss without triggering the body’s fat-storage mechanisms.
Sauna and cold plunge
Alternating between heat and cold exposure can stimulate the production of protective proteins that improve overall health and reduce fat.
O’Mara reports that his patients often see an 80 percent reduction in heart fat within three to four months when following his program.
Dr. Jack Wolfson, a board-certified cardiologist and functional medicine expert, takes a holistic approach to reducing visceral fat. His program focuses on diet, lifestyle and mental well-being.
Diet
Wolfson recommends the Paleo diet, which emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods like grass-fed meat, wild seafood, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Avoiding artificial ingredients and pesticides is key.
Lifestyle
Adequate sleep, regular sun exposure and exercise are non-negotiable. Wolfson also stresses the importance of reducing environmental toxins by using air and water purifiers.
Mental health
Happiness and stress management are crucial. Wolfson encourages natural strategies to combat anxiety and depression, as mental health issues are closely linked to cardiovascular risks.
Supplements
Instead of pharmaceuticals, Wolfson suggests evidence-based supplements like berberine and vitamin C to support heart health.
Wolfson’s approach aims to lower insulin levels, a hormone that promotes fat storage, while reducing inflammation and improving cardiovascular function.
Caroline Mansfield, a registered naturopath, advocates for a natural, anti-inflammatory lifestyle to reduce heart fat.
Diet
Mansfield believes an anti-inflammatory diet rich in leafy greens, healthy fats and lean proteins, and devoid processed and sugary foods is the key to a healthy heart.
Exercise
Regular moderate- to high-intensity exercise can boost metabolism and fat burning.
Stress management
Prioritizing sleep and relaxation helps lower cortisol, a hormone that drives fat accumulation.
Detoxification
Using natural products like zeolite can help remove toxins that contribute to fat storage and inflammation.
Mansfield notes that these strategies not only reduce visceral fat but also improve overall metabolic and cardiovascular health.
While the approaches above vary, they all emphasize the importance of diet, exercise and stress management. Here are some additional tips to keep your heart in top shape:
Eat more fiber
Soluble fiber, found in oats, beans and fruits, can lower “bad” LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol.
Include omega-3s
Fatty fish like salmon and sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which protect against heart disease. (Related: A toast to heart health: How moderate wine consumption could support a healthy heart.)
Limit salt and saturated fats
Reducing salt intake and swapping saturated fats for healthier options like olive oil can lower blood pressure and cholesterol.
Quit smoking
Smoking is one of the most significant controllable risk factors for heart disease. Quitting can dramatically improve your heart health.
Stay active
Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week to improve cholesterol levels and overall cardiovascular health.
Hydrate
Drinking plenty of water supports liver function, which is essential for breaking down cholesterol.
Experts agree that reducing fat around the heart isn’t just about looking better, it’s about preventing disease before it starts. By adopting heart-healthy habits, you can lower your risk of cardiovascular events, improve your quality of life and set the stage for long-term well-being.
As Wolfson puts it, when losing weight with natural strategies, “fat everywhere — including around the heart — decreases.” He added that the secret lies in “keeping insulin low and inflammation in check.”
The bottom line? Small, consistent changes can lead to big improvements in heart health.
Whether it’s through diet, exercise or stress management, taking control of your lifestyle today can help you live a longer, healthier life tomorrow.

https://food.news/2025-01-12-moderate-wine-consumption-could-support-heart-health.html,A toast to heart health: How moderate wine consumption could support a healthy heart,"Advertisement

For centuries, wine has been celebrated not just for its rich flavors and cultural significance, but also for its potential health benefits. Now, emerging research suggests that enjoying a glass of wine in moderation – particularly as part of a balanced diet – could play a meaningful role in supporting heart health.
A groundbreaking study published in the European Heart Journal has shed new light on the protective effects of wine, revealing that moderate consumption could reduce the risk of heart disease by up to 50 percent.
But before you uncork that bottle, it’s important to understand the nuances of these findings and how they fit into a broader picture of heart-healthy living.
The study, led by Professor Ramon Estruch from the University of Barcelona, took a unique approach to measuring wine consumption. Instead of relying solely on self-reported data, researchers analyzed urine samples for tartaric acid, a biomarker that provides a more accurate measure of wine intake.
Over four to five years, they tracked 1,232 older adults at high risk of cardiovascular disease, all of whom lived in a Mediterranean country.
The results were striking: Participants who drank between 12 and 35 glasses of wine per month – roughly one glass per day – had a 50 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to those who drank one glass or less. Even those who consumed between three and 12 glasses per month saw a 38 percent reduction in risk.
These benefits were comparable to or even exceeded, the effects of statins, a commonly prescribed medication for lowering cholesterol.
However, the study also highlighted a crucial caveat – moderation is key. Drinking more than 35 glasses per month diminished the heart-protective effects. This underscores the importance of balance when it comes to alcohol consumption.
So, what makes wine, particularly red wine, so beneficial for the heart? The answer lies in its rich concentration of antioxidants, particularly polyphenols like resveratrol.
These compounds help neutralize free radicals – unstable molecules that can damage cells and contribute to chronic diseases, including heart disease. Resveratrol, in particular, has been shown to reduce inflammation, improve blood vessel function, and lower levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol or “bad” cholesterol.
But wine isn’t the only source of these powerful antioxidants. Foods like peaches, sweet potatoes, tangerines and walnuts also contain polyphenols, making them excellent additions to a heart-healthy diet.
For those who don’t drink alcohol, there’s no need to start solely for the sake of resveratrol.
One of the most intriguing aspects of the study is its focus on the Mediterranean diet, a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and olive oil, with moderate amounts of fish, poultry and dairy.
This diet has long been associated with reduced risks of heart disease, and the study suggests that wine may amplify its benefits.
Professor Paul Leeson, a cardiologist and professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Oxford, noted that the heart-protective effects of wine may only be significant when consumed as part of this dietary pattern. Leeson suggested that the health advantages of a glass of wine could only be seen “when being drunk alongside a plate of Mediterranean food.”
This also highlights an important point: Like other superfoods, wine isn’t a magic elixir. Its benefits are most likely to be realized when enjoyed as part of a broader lifestyle that prioritizes nutrient-rich foods, regular physical activity and other heart-healthy habits. (Related: Blueberries: Nature’s MIRACLE MEDICINE for optimal heart health and brain function.)
If you’re considering incorporating wine into your routine for its potential heart benefits, here are a few key guidelines to keep in mind:
Moderation is essential
The study defined moderate consumption as 12 to 35 glasses per month or roughly one glass of wine per day. For women, experts recommend limiting intake to half that of men due to differences in metabolism.
Pair it with meals
Drinking wine with food, particularly meals rich in fruits, vegetables and healthy fats, may enhance its benefits.
Know your limits
If you don’t currently drink alcohol, there’s no need to start. The potential benefits of wine can be achieved through other dietary and lifestyle choices.
Choose quality over quantity
Opt for high-quality wines, particularly red varieties, which tend to have higher concentrations of polyphenols.
Consult your doctor
If you have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or other health conditions, it’s important to discuss alcohol consumption with your healthcare provider.
The latest research adds to a growing body of evidence that moderate wine consumption, particularly as part of a Mediterranean diet, could be a valuable tool in supporting heart health.
However, it’s important to remember that wine is just one piece of the puzzle. A balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management and avoiding smoking are all critical components of a heart-healthy lifestyle.
The next time you drink a glass of wine, you can do so with the knowledge that, when enjoyed responsibly, it might just be doing your heart a favor.

https://food.news/2025-01-07-hidden-dangers-red-no-3-why-fda-should-ban-synthetic-food-dye.html,The hidden dangers of Red No. 3: Why the FDA should ban this synthetic food dye,"Advertisement



The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is on the verge of making a landmark decision that could reshape the American food industry. Red No. 3, a synthetic food dye also known as erythrosine, is under scrutiny for its potential health risks, and the FDA is considering banning it from the U.S. food supply.
This move comes after decades of mounting evidence linking the dye to cancer, hyperactivity in children and other serious health concerns.
Despite being banned in cosmetics since 1990 due to its carcinogenic effects, Red No. 3 remains a common ingredient in thousands of food products, from candies to baked goods.
Red No. 3 (erythrosine) is a petroleum-derived synthetic dye that is used to make foods bright cherry-red. It is commonly found in popular snacks like Betty Crocker products, Peeps, Pez and cake-decorating gels and maraschino cherries.
But while Red No. 3, also called Red 3, adds visual appeal to food, it offers no nutritional value. Its primary purpose is to make food look more enticing, often masking the lack of natural ingredients or quality in processed foods.
The controversy surrounding Red No. 3 is not new. In 1990, the FDA banned its use in cosmetics and topical medications after studies showed it caused cancer in laboratory animals.
This decision was based on the Delaney Clause, a 1960 amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that prohibits the use of any color additive shown to cause cancer in humans or animals.
However, the FDA allowed Red No. 3 to remain in food products, a decision that has puzzled public health advocates for decades.
Recent research has only added to the concerns. A 2021 review by the California Environmental Protection Agency linked synthetic food dyes, including Red No. 3, to hyperactivity and neurobehavioral issues in children.
The study found that some children are particularly sensitive to these dyes, experiencing symptoms that mimic attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Thomas Galligan, a principal scientist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), emphasized this point.
Galligan explained that evidence “shows pretty conclusively” that when some children consume foods containing synthetic food dyes, they will experience “nervous system effects that look like ADHD.”
The FDA’s potential ban on Red No. 3 follows California’s groundbreaking decision last year to ban four synthetic food dyes, including Red No. 3, by 2027. This move aligns California with stricter European Union regulations, where many synthetic dyes are either banned or require warning labels.
European countries have long taken a precautionary approach to food safety, prioritizing consumer health over industry interests. (Related: STUDY: Food dye tartrazine temporarily makes skin and muscle TRANSPARENT.)
Congressman Frank Pallone Jr., a vocal advocate for food safety, has been pushing the FDA to take action. In a letter to the agency, he wrote that there is “simply no reason for this chemical to be in our food except to entice and mislead consumers by changing the color of their food so it looks more appealing.”
Pallone Jr. also expressed concerns that during the holiday season, which often has sweet treats in abundance, children could be eating many foods that may contain Red No. 3.
Despite the growing evidence of harm, the food industry has historically resisted efforts to ban Red No. 3. In the 1980s, when the FDA first attempted to ban the dye, the maraschino cherry industry lobbied heavily to keep it on the market.
Today, the National Confectioners Association argues that synthetic dyes like Red No. 3 are essential for maintaining the vibrant colors consumers expect in their favorite treats. Christopher Gindlesperger, a spokesperson for the association, has claimed that these “vibrant colors” are important to the industry.
The FDA, for its part, maintains that Red No. 3 is safe when consumed in accordance with its regulations.
However, critics argue that the agency’s standards are outdated and fail to account for the cumulative effects of long-term exposure to synthetic dyes. As Galligan pointed out, food dyes only make food look “pretty” so consumers will want to buy them. He added that dyes don’t have any other function except as “a marketing tool.”
Red No. 3 is just one of many synthetic food dyes that have come under scrutiny. Other commonly used dyes, such as Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6, have also been linked to behavioral issues and hyperactivity in children.
While these dyes are approved by both the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), their safety remains a topic of debate. Some studies suggest that certain dyes may contain cancer-causing contaminants, though regulatory agencies argue that these contaminants are present in levels too low to pose a significant risk.
The inconsistency in global regulations further complicates the issue. For example, Green No. 3 is approved in the U.S. but banned in Europe, while Quinoline Yellow is allowed in the EU but prohibited in the U.S.
This patchwork of regulations makes it difficult for consumers to assess the safety of the foods they eat.
The potential ban on Red No. 3 represents a critical opportunity for the FDA to prioritize public health over corporate interests. By aligning U.S. regulations with stricter international standards, the agency could set a precedent for addressing other harmful additives in the food supply.
As Susan Little of the Environmental Working Group explained, it doesn’t make sense that “the same products food manufacturers sell in California are sold in the EU but without these toxic chemicals.” American children “need to be protected, too,” advised Little.
For consumers, the best course of action is to read labels carefully and avoid products containing synthetic dyes whenever possible. Natural alternatives, such as beet extract and beta carotene, can provide vibrant colors without the associated health risks.
While these options may be more expensive, the long-term benefits to health are well worth the investment.
The FDA’s impending decision on Red No. 3 is a pivotal moment in the fight for safer food. With overwhelming evidence linking the dye to cancer and behavioral issues in children, there is no justification for its continued use in food products.
By banning Red No. 3, the FDA can take a significant step toward protecting public health and ensuring that the foods consumers eat are as safe as they are appealing.

But amidst the indulgent feasts, there’s always room for a side dish that’s both nutritious and delicious: sauteed spinach with garlic. This simple yet elegant dish is steeped in history, packed with nutrients and perfect for Christmas dinner.
Spinach, the star of this dish, has a fascinating journey that spans continents and centuries. It is believed to have been initially cultivated by the Persians around 700 AD. The Persians developed an irrigation method that allowed the plant to thrive, overcoming its tendency to bolt in hot climates.
From Persia, spinach made its way to China as a gift from the king of Nepal to the Chinese Emperor. By the 11th century, it had reached Spain, thanks to the Moors, and eventually found its way to Italy, where it became a beloved ingredient.
One of the most intriguing chapters in spinach’s history involves Catherine de Medici, the Italian-born queen of France. Legend has it that she adored spinach so much that when she married King Henry II, she brought her love for the leafy green with her to France. Dishes featuring spinach became known as “a la Florentine,” a nod to her Florentine roots.
Interestingly, during the 17th century, spinach was often cooked with sugar and used in sweet recipes, showcasing its versatility even then. (Related: The sweet saga of fruitcake: A nutritional powerhouse with a long shelf life.)
In the United States, spinach faced a decline in popularity during the 1930s. However, its fortunes changed dramatically with the creation of the iconic comic strip character Popeye the Sailor Man. Created by E.C. Segar, Popeye’s love for spinach was said to be inspired by a miscalculation of its iron content in the 19th century.
While spinach’s actual iron content is lower than initially thought, the cartoon’s impact was undeniable. Spinach sales soared, and the town of Crystal City, Texas, even erected a statue of Popeye in gratitude for the vegetable’s revival.
Spinach is more than just a tasty green — it’s a nutritional powerhouse. One cup of raw spinach contains just seven calories and an abundance of essential vitamins and minerals. It provides 29.7 milligrams (mg) of calcium, 0.81 grams (g) of iron, 24 mg of magnesium and 167 mg of potassium. Spinach is also a great source of vitamins A, C and K, as well as folate and fiber.
Iron is a standout nutrient in spinach. This nutrient is crucial for transporting oxygen in the blood and supporting healthy immune function. While spinach contains less iron than previously believed, pairing it with vitamin C-rich foods (like garlic) can enhance iron absorption.
Calcium, though present in spinach, is less easily absorbed due to its oxalate content, but it still contributes to overall bone health.
Spinach is also a treasure trove of active plant compounds, including lutein, kaempferol, nitrates, quercetin and zeaxanthin. These compounds play vital roles in supporting eye health, reducing inflammation and preventing chronic diseases like cancer.
Studies suggest that diets rich in green vegetables, like spinach, may lower the risk of certain cancers and improve overall health.
Garlic, the aromatic ingredient in sauteed spinach, is more than just a flavor enhancer; this humble bulb has been revered for its medicinal properties since ancient times.
Civilizations from Egypt to China documented its use for maintaining health and healing. Today, scientists attribute many of garlic’s benefits to sulfur compounds formed when the cloves are chopped, crushed or chewed. One of the most well-known garlic compounds is allicin, which can support good health.
Garlic is also a nutritional powerhouse, containing fiber, manganese, selenium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. A single clove of garlic has just 4.5 calories but packs a punch in terms of health benefits.
Garlic has been shown to boost the immune system, making it an ideal ingredient during cold and flu season.
It also contains antioxidants that support overall health. Additionally, garlic contains compounds that may help lower blood pressure and improve heart health.
Sauteed spinach with garlic is a dish that’s as simple as it is satisfying. The key to success lies in preparing the spinach properly.
Wash the leaves thoroughly, even if they’re labeled as pre-washed, to remove any grit. Smaller leaves are generally more tender and less bitter, making them ideal for this dish. You can season your sauteed spinach with garlic with salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice for a bright, zesty flavor.
For a festive touch, consider adding a sprinkle of toasted pine nuts or a drizzle of balsamic glaze.
Ingredients:
Instructions:
Serve sauteed spinach with garlic with complementary dishes like baked chicken breasts, roasted chicken thighs or a hearty meatloaf. Add some red pepper flakes to the sauteed leafy greens to give the side dish a spicy kick. Alternatively, you can add cream or cream cheese to make creamed spinach.
As many families gather around the Christmas table, meals often lean toward indulgence. Rich desserts, savory roasts and creamy casseroles dominate the spread. But a side dish of savory sauteed spinach with garlic offers a refreshing contrast, balancing the richness of the meal with its vibrant green color and healthful properties.
The dish’s nutritional profile makes it an excellent choice for those looking to maintain a balanced diet during the holidays. Spinach’s high fiber content promotes digestive regularity, while its magnesium content supports muscle and nerve function. Garlic’s immune-boosting properties can help keep guests feeling their best, even during the busiest time of year.

https://food.news/2024-12-26-history-nutritional-profile-health-benefits-pecan-pie.html,"Festive flavors: The sweet history, nutritional profile and health benefits of pecan pie","Advertisement

Pecan pie, with its golden crust and sweet, nutty filling, is more than just a holiday dessert — it’s an iconic dish for a reason. This beloved treat, synonymous with Thanksgiving and Christmas in the U.S., has a rich history that ties it to the American South, Indigenous traditions and the evolution of American cuisine.
But beyond its sentimental value, pecan pie is also a surprisingly nutritious dessert, packed with health benefits that make it a festive favorite.
To understand what makes pecan pie special, you should first look at its star ingredient: the pecan. Native to North America, pecans have been a staple of Indigenous diets for centuries.
The Algonquin people, for example, valued pecans not only for their rich flavor but also for their nutritional benefits. The name “pecan” itself comes from the Algonquin word “pacane,” meaning “a nut that requires a stone to crack.” Pecans were a vital food source, providing sustenance during the colder months and symbolizing abundance and resourcefulness.
When European settlers arrived, they adopted pecans into their own culinary traditions. Settlers in the southeastern U.S., especially the French and the Spanish, then started cultivating pecans, which thrived in the region’s warm climate.
Pecans soon became a staple in Southern kitchens, symbolizing the area’s rich natural resources and the culinary traditions that grew around them.
The first documented pecan pie recipe appeared in the late 19th century, but it wasn’t until the early 20th century that the dessert America knows and loves today took shape. The introduction of corn syrup, particularly Karo syrup, revolutionized pecan pie. Karo syrup’s thick, sweet consistency created the signature gooey filling that defines modern pecan pie.
By the 1930s, Karo syrup’s recipe for pecan pie was printed on its bottle labels, making the dessert accessible to home cooks across the country. This marketing strategy helped pecan pie become a nationwide sensation, solidifying its place as a holiday staple.
In Texas, where pecan production is a major industry, the nut holds a special place in the state’s identity. In 1919, Texas declared the pecan tree its official state tree, and in 2013, pecan pie was named the official state pie. This recognition highlights the nut’s importance to Texas’s economy and heritage, as well as its role in Southern culture.
Pecan pie’s association with family gatherings and holiday celebrations makes it a beloved dessert for many. Whether it’s served at Thanksgiving, Christmas or a Sunday supper, pecan pie embodies the warmth and comfort of home. Its rich, nutty flavor and sweet filling bring people together, making it a dessert that transcends regional boundaries and connects people across the country.
While the classic pecan pie recipe features a buttery crust filled with pecans, sugar, eggs and corn syrup, there are many variations that reflect regional tastes and modern dietary preferences.
Here are a few popular versions:
Bourbon pecan pie
Adding a splash of bourbon whiskey to the filling gives this version a bold, Southern flair, often enjoyed in Kentucky and other parts of the South.
Gluten-free and vegan pecan pie
Modern dietary trends have led to the creation of gluten-free and vegan versions, using almond flour or rice flour crusts and plant-based substitutes for eggs and dairy.
Honey pecan pie
Replacing corn syrup with honey creates a slightly less sweet pie that highlights the natural flavors of the pecans.
Maple pecan pie
In New England, where maple syrup is a common ingredient, this variation uses maple syrup instead of corn syrup for a distinct earthy sweetness.
These variations showcase the versatility of pecan pie, allowing bakers to adapt the classic recipe to suit their tastes and dietary needs.
Pecan pie isn’t just delicious — it’s also surprisingly nutritious. Pecans, the key ingredient, are packed with essential nutrients that offer numerous health benefits.
Here’s a closer look at what makes pecans so good for you:
Copper
You need copper for proper nerve function, immune health and the production of red blood cells.
Fiber
Pecans are a good source of dietary fiber, which aids in healthy digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut.
Healthy fats
Pecans are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are linked to improved heart health and reduced inflammation
Thiamine (vitamin B1)
Thiamine helps convert carbohydrates into energy, keeping your body fueled throughout the day.
Zinc
Zinc supports immune function, cell growth, brain health and wound healing.
Despite its indulgent reputation, pecan pie can be part of a balanced diet. Here are some of the health benefits associated with pecans:
Antioxidants
Pecans are packed with antioxidants, which help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. These antioxidants can also support good health.
Brain function
Pecans are rich in nutrients that support brain health, including healthy fats and antioxidants. Studies have linked regular nut consumption to improved cognition and a reduced risk of cognitive decline.
Heart health
Pecans are a great source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which have been shown to improve cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. Studies have found that incorporating pecans into your diet can lower LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and improve the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol). (Related: The sweet saga of fruitcake: A nutritional powerhouse with a long shelf life.)
Corn syrup is another key ingredient in pecan pie, but the syrup is actually considered more unhealthy than sugar.
If you want to serve a healthier pie for the holidays, try this recipe. It features a healthy pie crust and filling. Instead of corn syrup, you can use other natural sweeteners, like raw honey or pure maple syrup.
Raw honey has a mild flavor but an intense sweetness. Use it as an alternative to corn syrup without changing the taste of your pecan pie. You can also use pure maple syrup, but it will give the pie a strong maple flavor, which some guests might not like.
Ingredients:
Instructions:
Pecan pie’s combination of rich history, cultural significance and nutritional benefits makes it a perfect dessert for Christmas. Its association with family gatherings and festive traditions adds an extra layer of meaning to this beloved treat.
Whether you’re enjoying a classic version or a creative variation, pecan pie is a dessert that brings people together and celebrates the warmth of the season.

https://food.news/2024-12-26-turkey-protein-packed-nutritional-powerhouse-christmas-feast.html,Not just for Thanksgiving: Turkey is a protein-packed nutritional powerhouse of Christmas feasts,"Advertisement

Christmas is a time of tradition, family and delicious food. At the heart of many holiday celebrations is the centerpiece of the Christmas dinner: roast turkey.
This iconic dish has a rich history, a nutritious profile and a host of health benefits that make it a perfect choice for the festive season.
The transformation of Christmas into a family-centered holiday with a focus on food can be traced back to Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” published in 1843. Dickens’ portrayal of a quaint, family-oriented Christmas, punctuated by acts of charity and a hearty meal, reshaped the holiday for many Americans and Britons.
Before Dickens, Christmas celebrations were often rowdy public affairs, and in America, they were even shunned by religious groups like the Puritans. Dickens’ story, however, offered a roadmap for a more intimate and wholesome celebration, one that revolved around the home and a special meal.
In “A Christmas Carol,” the Cratchit family’s Christmas dinner became a symbol of the holiday’s transformation. The meal, featuring turkey, cranberries and mincemeat, was later echoed in American cookbooks, solidifying turkey as a staple of Christmas dining. By the mid-19th century, turkey had become a symbol of the festive meal, celebrated for its size, flavor and, as the world now knows, its nutritional benefits.
Turkeys are native to the Americas, where they were first domesticated by indigenous peoples. The birds made their way to Europe in the early 16th century, with the first recorded arrival in Spain in 1519.
By 1526, a sailor named William Strickland brought the first turkey to England, and it quickly became a delicacy among the wealthy. King Henry VIII is believed to be the first British monarch to enjoy turkey as part of his Christmas feast.
The bird’s name also has an interesting history. One theory suggests that early settlers in the Americas thought turkeys were a type of guinea fowl, which were imported into Europe by Turkish traders.
These birds were often referred to as “Turkish birds,” which eventually led to the name “turkey” for the new bird. Another theory posits that turkeys were imported into Europe via Turkish traders, further solidifying the connection to the name.
By the 18th century, turkey farming had become widespread in England, particularly in Norfolk. Initially, turkeys were a luxury item, but by the 1840s, they had become fashionable for Christmas.
Aside from Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” Queen Victoria also had a role in popularizing the bird. She first served turkey at Christmas in 1851. By the end of the 19th century, turkey had become a staple of the Christmas meal, particularly for the growing middle class.
Turkey is a lean source of protein, low in fat – especially if the skin is removed – and rich in essential vitamins and minerals. A three-ounce serving of roasted turkey breast without the skin contains only about 1.8 grams of fat and 125 calories, making it a healthier option compared to many other holiday dishes. (Related: 3 Health benefits of cranberries, a Thanksgiving staple (recipes included).)
Turkey is particularly rich in B-complex vitamins, including niacin (B3), pyridoxine (B6) and cobalamin (B12), which are essential for energy production and brain function. Turkey also provides important minerals like iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.
One standout nutrient in turkey is selenium, a powerful antioxidant that supports the immune system and helps protect cells from oxidative damage.
Turkey offers several health benefits, making it an excellent choice for a festive meal. Its high protein content helps keep you feeling full and satisfied, which is especially important during the holiday season when portion sizes can get out of hand. Protein also plays a key role in muscle repair and maintenance, making turkey a great post-holiday recovery food.
One of the most famous claims about turkey is that it makes you sleepy due to its tryptophan content. Tryptophan is an amino acid that helps the body synthesize protein and produce serotonin, a neurotransmitter that promotes relaxation. However, the idea that turkey is uniquely responsible for post-feast drowsiness is just a myth.
While turkey does contain tryptophan, its levels are similar to those in other meats like roast beef and canned tuna. The real culprit for sleepiness is often the large amounts of carbohydrates consumed during the meal, which can cause a spike in blood sugar followed by a crash.
Another benefit of turkey is its low-fat content, especially when the skin is removed. This makes it a healthier alternative to many other holiday dishes, which can be high in saturated fats and calories.
By choosing turkey and avoiding the skin, you can enjoy a festive meal without overloading on unhealthy fats.
While turkey is a nutritious choice, how you prepare it matters. For example, frying turkey in oil can significantly increase its fat and calorie content, as most of the oil is absorbed by the skin.
To keep your holiday meal healthy, opt for roasted turkey and avoid the skin. Seasonings and marinades can add sodium, so be mindful of your intake if you’re watching your salt consumption.
For those who enjoy processed turkey products like turkey sausage or bacon, it’s important to check the labels. These items often contain high amounts of sodium, which can contribute to high blood pressure and cardiovascular issues.
Choosing lean cuts of turkey and avoiding processed forms is a great way to enjoy this food while keeping your diet healthy. While turkey is most commonly associated with Thanksgiving and Christmas, its popularity has grown to the point where it’s enjoyed year-round.
Whether it’s a hearty turkey sandwich, a nutritious turkey soup or a simple turkey salad, this versatile bird can be part of a healthy diet throughout the year.

https://food.news/2024-12-23-history-nutritional-profile-health-benefits-gingerbread-cookies.html,"From ancient spices to modern delights: The history, nutritional profile and health benefits of gingerbread cookies","Advertisement

Gingerbread cookies have been a beloved treat for centuries, delighting taste buds and warming hearts during the holiday season. But beyond their festive appeal, these spiced cookies boast a rich history and some surprisingly health-boosting ingredients.
From ancient ceremonial roots to modern-day gingerbread houses, gingerbread has evolved into a treat that’s as nutritious as it is delicious.
The story of gingerbread began thousands of years ago, with early forms of the treat appearing in ancient Greece and Egypt. These early versions were used for ceremonial purposes, often shaped into intricate designs to honor gods and celebrate special occasions.
Fast forward to the 11th century, and gingerbread made its way to Europe, thanks to Crusaders who brought ginger back from the Middle East. Initially reserved for the aristocracy, ginger and other spices eventually became more affordable, allowing gingerbread to spread to the masses.
In Europe, gingerbread took on new forms and meanings. Early recipes included ground almonds, rosewater, stale breadcrumbs, sugar and ginger. The dough was pressed into wooden molds, creating intricate designs that often depicted the likeness of royalty or religious symbols. These gingerbread cookies were sometimes decorated with edible gold paint or flat white icing, making them both a treat and a work of art.
By the 16th century, the English had refined the recipe, replacing breadcrumbs with flour and adding eggs and sweeteners to create a lighter, more cake-like gingerbread.
Queen Elizabeth I is credited with popularizing the gingerbread man, presenting visiting dignitaries with cookies baked in their own likeness. Gingerbread became a symbol of love and friendship, often exchanged at fairs and festivals.
Today, gingerbread comes in many forms, from thin, crisp cookies to cake-like versions and even gingerbread houses.
The classic gingerbread cookie is a blend of ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and other spices, sweetened with molasses, brown sugar, or honey. These flavors combine to create a warm, aromatic treat that’s perfect for the holiday season.
Gingerbread houses, a beloved Christmas tradition, originated in Germany after the Brothers Grimm published their fairy tales, including “Hansel and Gretel.”
The tradition soon spread to the Americas, where gingerbread houses have become a staple of holiday celebrations. While they may be made of cookies, these festive creations can offer some unexpected health benefits.
Despite being a sweet treat, gingerbread cookies contain several ingredients that offer real health benefits.
Let’s take a closer look at the key components:
Cinnamon, a key ingredient in gingerbread, is derived from the bark of cinnamon trees. This spice contains compounds like cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid and cinnamate, which have a range of health benefits.
Studies have shown that cinnamon can act as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and help reduce cholesterol and blood pressure. Some research suggests that cinnamon may also have benefits for neurological disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.
While the amount of cinnamon in gingerbread is relatively small, it’s a reminder that this spice can be a healthy addition to a balanced diet.
Ginger is the star ingredient in gingerbread, and for good reason. This powerful spice has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to aid digestion and alleviate nausea. (Related: Here’s a healthy and delicious tiger nut gingerbread cookie recipe you’ll love.)
Studies have shown that ginger can help reduce nausea and vomiting and improve digestive function. Some research suggests that ginger may also help fight off cold and flu symptoms, ease arthritis pain and reduce menstrual discomfort.
While the amount of ginger in gingerbread cookies may not be enough to provide these benefits on its own, it’s a reminder that small amounts of this spice can have a big impact on your overall well-being.
Molasses, which is a dark, thick syrup made during the refining of sugarcane or sugar beet, add a rich sweetness to gingerbread.
While it’s primarily sugar, molasses also contains important nutrients like iron, calcium, potassium, magnesium and vitamin B6. These vitamins and minerals are essential for bone health, hair growth and preventing anemia.
Additionally, molasses is rich in antioxidants, which help protect the body’s cells from damage caused by free radicals.
However, it’s important to remember that molasses is still a sugar, so it should be enjoyed in moderation. While it may contain some beneficial nutrients, the best way to get these vitamins and minerals is through whole foods like fruits, vegetables and nuts.
Nutmeg, used in small amounts in gingerbread, has been linked to reduced inflammation and heart health benefits.
While gingerbread cookies are a treat, there are ways to make them a bit healthier without sacrificing flavor. One approach is to swap out some of the less nutritious ingredients for healthier alternatives.
For example:
Whole wheat pastry flour, in particular, is a great option for gingerbread cookies. It’s finely ground, lighter in taste and produces tender, flavorful cookies.
These substitutions can make your gingerbread cookies a bit healthier while still keeping them delicious and festive.
Gingerbread cookies are more than just a Christmas treat – they’re a celebration of tradition, flavor and the surprising ways food can nourish both body and soul. So this holiday season, enjoy a gingerbread cookie and embrace the warmth and wellness it brings.

When you think of festive holiday meals, ham with pineapple glaze and cloves may be one of the first foods that you think about. This classic pairing is more than just a delicious dish—it’s a culinary tradition with a rich history, a nutritional profile that packs a punch and health benefits that make it a standout choice for celebrations.
Let’s dive into the fascinating story of how this dish came to be, what makes it so nutritious and why it’s worth adding to your holiday table.
The story of ham and pineapple begins with exploration and innovation. In 1493, Christopher Columbus stumbled upon pineapples during his second voyage to the New World.
While he was initially disappointed to find the fruit instead of gold, others, like Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo, were captivated by its beauty. Pineapples quickly became a symbol of luxury, reserved for royalty and the wealthy due to their scarcity and the high cost of shipping them to Europe.
Fast forward a few centuries, and pineapples began to lose their exclusivity thanks to the invention of canning in the early 19th century. This technology made tropical fruits like pineapples accessible to the masses, transforming them from a rare delicacy into an everyday ingredient.
By the early 20th century, pineapple was a staple in American kitchens, and companies like Dole and Del Monte were promoting its use in recipes, including one for baked ham with pineapple.
The pairing of ham and pineapple isn’t just a coincidence.
Allan Benton, owner of Benton’s Country Hams, explains that pineapple’s natural sweetness helps balance the saltiness of ham. This harmonious combination has made ham with pineapple a beloved dish around the world, from luaus in Hawaii to holiday tables in the United States.
Ham, the star of this dish, is a versatile and nutrient-dense food. Made from pork legs, ham is typically preserved through salting or smoking, though the exact process varies.
Despite being a processed meat, ham offers several health benefits when consumed in moderation.
A 2-ounce serving of ham provides:
Ham is particularly rich in selenium, an essential nutrient that supports immune function, DNA repair and thyroid health.
It’s also a good source of protein, providing all nine essential amino acids, which are crucial for building muscle, supporting metabolism and maintaining overall health.
Additionally, ham contains carnosine, an amino acid compound with antioxidant properties that may help reduce inflammation and improve exercise performance.
Ham also offers the following health benefits:
While ham is high in sodium, it also contains potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure and supports cardiovascular health.
The high protein content in ham can help maintain muscle mass, which is especially important as you age.
Selenium and zinc in ham play a role in strengthening the immune system, helping your body fight off infections.
Pineapple, the tropical fruit that complements ham so perfectly, is more than just a sweet addition to your dish.
It’s a nutritional powerhouse that offers a range of health benefits.
One cup of pineapple chunks provides:
Pineapple is best known for its high levels of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that supports immune function, skin health and tissue repair.
It’s also rich in manganese, an essential mineral involved in bone formation, metabolism and immune response. The fiber in pineapple promotes digestive health, while its B vitamins help your body convert food into energy.
Vitamin C in pineapple strengthens your immune system, helping you stay healthy during cold and flu season.
The dietary fiber in pineapple aids in digestion and can prevent constipation.
Bromelain, an enzyme found in pineapple, has anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce pain and swelling.
Cloves, the aromatic spice that adds depth to ham with pineapple glaze, have a long history of use in traditional medicine. (Related: Herbs and spices that support good metabolic health.)
These tiny buds are packed with nutrients and offer several health benefits.
One teaspoon of ground cloves provides:
Cloves are an excellent source of manganese, which helps boost optimal bone health and metabolism. They also contain vitamin K, a nutrient essential for blood clotting and bone health.
Clove oil is often used in dental care for its ability to numb pain and kill bacteria.
Cloves can stimulate digestive enzymes, aiding in the breakdown of food and improving digestion.

https://food.news/2024-12-21-fruitcake-history-nutritional-powerhouse-long-shelf-life.html,The sweet saga of fruitcake: A nutritional powerhouse with a long shelf life,"Advertisement


Nothing says Christmas like a decadent fruitcake — or, at the very least, a silly fruitcake joke. For decades, this dense, fruit-and-nut-laden dessert has been the butt of holiday humor, with jokes about its longevity and questionable taste circulating as freely as the cake itself.
But beneath the punchlines lies a rich history, a fascinating nutritional profile and a surprising array of health benefits that make fruitcake worth a second look this holiday season.


Fruitcake’s origins date back to ancient times, making it one of the oldest desserts in human history. The Romans are credited with creating the first version, a simple yet practical energy bar made from barley, honey, wine and dried fruit.
This early fruitcake was designed to fuel soldiers on the battlefield, proving that even in its infancy, fruitcake was a symbol of endurance and sustenance.
By the early Middle Ages, fruitcake had evolved into a more refined treat, with European bakers incorporating sweet spices like cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. These aromatic ingredients were not only a sign of culinary sophistication but also a way to preserve and enhance the flavors of the dried fruits and nuts that were becoming increasingly popular in baked goods.
Over time, fruitcake consumption spread across Europe, with the cake taking on regional variations that reflected local ingredients and traditions.
In America, fruitcake found its footing with the arrival of European colonists. The influx of cheap sugar from the Caribbean made it possible to preserve fruit year-round, and candying fruit — a process that involves boiling it in sugar syrup and coating it in granulated sugar — became a popular method for extending the shelf life of summer harvests. This allowed colonists to enjoy the fruits of their labor well into the winter months, making fruitcakes a staple of holiday celebrations.
One of the most enduring myths about fruitcake is its seemingly infinite shelf life. Stories abound of fruitcakes that have survived for decades, even centuries, thanks to their high sugar content, low moisture and the occasional soak in high-proof spirits like brandy or bourbon. These factors create an environment inhospitable to bacteria and mold, allowing the cake to remain edible for years — or even decades — if stored properly.
Fruitcake’s legendary longevity made it a natural choice for mail-order businesses in the early 20th century.
With the advent of Rural Free Delivery in 1896 and the Parcel Post service in 1913, fruitcake companies like Claxton’s of Georgia and Collin Street of Texas became household names. Their fruitcakes, packed in sturdy tins and shipped across the country, became a beloved holiday tradition for many American families.
Despite its reputation as a dense, sugary indulgence, fruitcake offers a surprising array of nutritional benefits. (Related: Christmas pudding: A delectable, healthy treat worth serving this holiday season.)
At its core, fruitcake is a blend of dried fruits, nuts and whole grains, all of which are rich in essential nutrients. Here’s a closer look at what makes this holiday treat a potential health ally:
Dried fruits and nuts are rich in antioxidants, which help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. This can reduce oxidative stress and lower the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.
Dried fruits like apricots, cranberries and raisins are packed with natural sugars, fiber, potassium and iron. While the body processes these sugars similarly to refined sugars, the dried fruit also delivers a host of additional nutrients. Dietary fiber, in particular, helps promote satiety, making fruitcake a less likely culprit for overeating during the holiday season.
Nuts like almonds, pecans and walnuts are a cornerstone of many fruitcakes. These ingredients are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are known to support optimal cardiovascular health. Nuts also provide a dose of protein, which can help keep you feeling full and satisfied.
When made with whole wheat flour, fruitcake offers plenty of dietary fiber, which supports digestive health and helps regulate blood sugar levels. This makes fruitcake a healthier choice than many other holiday desserts, which are often loaded with refined carbohydrates.
While fruitcake does offer some health benefits, it is still an overindulgent dessert. Fruitcake’s high sugar content, even if it is natural, can contribute to blood sugar spikes if consumed in excess. Pairing a slice of fruitcake with a glass of water or a cup of tea can help slow digestion and reduce the risk of a sugar crash.
This Healthy Christmas fruitcake recipe involves some soaking of the fruit used, but this step only takes 15 minutes. When you’re done, just mix all the ingredients, place it in the oven and glaze or ice it if you want to.

Glaze (optional):

When you think of Christmas dinner, what comes to mind? For many, it’s the centerpiece of the meal: a beautifully glazed, golden-brown baked ham.
This festive dish has been a staple of holiday feasts for centuries, bridging ancient traditions with modern celebrations. But beyond its rich history and cultural significance, Christmas ham also offers a range of nutritional benefits that make it a healthier choice than you might expect.
The tradition of eating ham during the winter months dates back long before Christmas was even celebrated. In fact, the origins of this festive dish can be traced to the ancient Germanic and Norse pagan traditions of Yule, a midwinter festival honoring the Winter Solstice.
During these celebrations, wild boars were sacrificed as offerings to Freyr, the Norse god of fertility and abundant harvests. The meat from these boars was then prepared and shared among celebrants, becoming a central part of the feast.
As Christianity spread across Northern Europe, the religious significance of the wild boar sacrifice faded, but the tradition of enjoying pork during the winter solstice remained.
By the time Pope Julius I designated Dec. 25 as the official date to celebrate Jesus Christ’s birth in 350 A.D., the custom of eating ham had already become deeply ingrained in wintertime traditions.
Over time, the wild boar was replaced with domesticated pigs, and the dish evolved into the honey-glazed or baked ham that is known and loved today.
Interestingly, the connection between ham and Christmas isn’t just about tradition — it’s also tied to religious identity. In some parts of Europe, particularly Spain, Christians historically ate pork to distinguish themselves from the region’s large Muslim population, who abstain from consuming pork. (Related: Christmas pudding: A delectable, healthy treat worth serving this holiday season.)
Of course, not every culture celebrates Christmas with ham. In the United Kingdom, turkey reigns supreme as the star of the Christmas dinner table, while in Italy, fish and pasta take center stage. In Sweden, the traditional “julebord” features an array of cured meats, cheeses and fish.
Despite its varying popularity, ham has remained a beloved holiday dish in many Western countries, with Americans alone purchasing over 318 million pounds of ham during the Christmas season.
So, what makes ham such a popular choice for holiday meals? Beyond its rich flavor and festive appearance, ham offers a surprising array of nutrients that contribute to its nutritional value.
A 3.5-ounce serving of cooked ham contains approximately:
While the high sodium content is a drawback, ham is also packed with essential vitamins and minerals, including:
These nutrients make ham a valuable addition to your holiday meal, especially when paired with other nutrient-dense dishes like vegetables, whole grains and fruits.
Despite being classified as processed red meat, ham offers several health benefits when consumed in moderation.
High-quality protein
Ham is an excellent source of lean protein, which is essential for building and repairing tissues, maintaining muscle mass and supporting overall health.
Protein also helps keep you feeling full, which can be especially helpful during the indulgent holiday season.
Essential vitamins and minerals
The vitamins and minerals in ham play a crucial role in maintaining optimal health. For example, selenium protects your cells from damage caused by free radicals, while thiamin supports your body’s ability to convert food into energy.
Niacin and phosphorus contribute to healthy skin, digestion and bone strength.
Energy boost
The combination of protein and B vitamins in ham helps your body produce energy more efficiently, making it a great choice for fueling up during busy holiday gatherings.
Traditional Christmas ham is glazed and offers a delicious combination of sweet and salty. However, the amount of butter, brown sugar and honey that goes into the glaze isn’t always good for your gut.
If you’re watching your sugar intake, the recipe below is a great alternative because it is free from dairy, sugar and gluten.
This glaze is a delicious alternative to the usual honey maple glaze.

Christmas ham is more than just a holiday tradition – it’s a dish with a rich history and a surprising nutritional profile. While it’s important to enjoy it in moderation, the nutrients it provides can make it a valuable part of your festive feast. Whether you’re celebrating with family, friends or loved ones, Christmas ham is a delicious reminder of the joy and nourishment that food brings to your life.

As the holiday season approaches, the aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg and pine fills the air, and with it comes the tradition of sipping on a creamy, indulgent drink: eggnog. Whether you’re gathering around the fireplace or attending a festive party, eggnog is a beloved holiday treat that has been enjoyed for centuries.
But what exactly is eggnog? Where did it come from and is it a healthy choice for the holidays?
Keep reading to learn more about the nutritional profile, health benefits and rich history of this seasonal favorite.
Eggnog’s roots trace back to medieval Europe, where a drink called “posset” was popular. Posset was a mixture of hot, sweetened milk curdled with ale or wine, often spiced with ingredients like figs and eggs.
By the 17th century, sherry had replaced ale or wine, making posset a luxurious drink reserved for special occasions. This rich beverage eventually made its way to Colonial America, where rum from the Caribbean became the liquor of choice. (Related: Here’s a healthy and delicious tiger nut gingerbread cookie recipe you’ll love.)
The exact moment when posset became known as eggnog is unknown, but the popularity of this drink soared. In fact, eggnog’s appeal was so strong that it sparked a riot at West Point in 1826. When cadets were told they would be served alcohol-free eggnog, they smuggled in whiskey, leading to the infamous Eggnog Riot.
Today, eggnog remains a symbol of celebration and togetherness, with variations like Mexico’s “rompope” and Peru’s pisco-infused version adding to its global charm.
Eggnog is undeniably rich and creamy, but its nutrient content varies depending on the recipe and ingredients used. A four-ounce serving of traditional, non-alcoholic eggnog contains about 200 calories and 10 grams of fat.
While this may seem indulgent, it is worth noting that eggnog is packed with nutrients like protein, calcium and vitamins A and D, thanks to its milk and egg base.
However, adding alcohol, such as brandy or whiskey, increases its calorie count. For example, a single ounce of brandy adds 65 calories, and many recipes call for double that amount. This can push the calorie count of a single serving to 265 – 330 calories.
Meanwhile, vegan versions of eggnog made with almond or coconut milk are lower in calories and fat, making them a lighter alternative for those watching their intake.
Despite its indulgent reputation, eggnog offers several health benefits. The combination of milk and eggs provides a good source of protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. The calcium in milk supports bone health, while vitamins A and D promote good health and support healthy skin.
The warm spices often added to eggnog, such as cinnamon and nutmeg, also offer health perks. Cinnamon, for instance, has been shown to boost overall well-being, while nutmeg contains antioxidants that can also support good health.
These spices not only enhance the flavor of eggnog but also add a touch of wellness to your holiday celebration.
If you’re concerned about the sugar and calorie content of traditional eggnog, there are several ways to enjoy a healthier version. One option is to reduce the amount of sugar in your recipe. Instead of using granulated sugar, try a natural sweetener like honey or maple syrup, which can add a subtle flavor boost without causing blood sugar spikes.
Another approach is to use plant-based milk, such as almond or coconut milk, as the base. These alternatives are lower in calories and fat, making them a great choice for those looking to lighten up their eggnog.
You can also skip the alcohol if you’re watching your calorie intake or prefer a non-alcoholic option. Making a booze-free eggnog reduces your caloric intake by almost 100 calories. If serving a non-alcoholic eggnog is not an option, try cutting your alcohol serving in half.
If you want to avoid the health risks of using raw eggs, consider using pasteurized eggs or a vegan recipe. Pasteurized eggs are heat-treated to eliminate bacteria like Salmonella, ensuring a safer option for everyone. You can also heat your eggnog to at least 160 F (71 C), which is sufficient to kill most pathogens. Alternatively, you can buy store-bought eggnog, which is pasteurized and ready to drink without heating.
Vegan versions, made with ingredients like cashews and spices, offer a creamy texture and festive flavor without the need for eggs or dairy.
Eggnog’s versatility has led to countless variations across the globe. In Mexico, “rompope” combines almond paste and milk with spices like vanilla and cinnamon.
Puerto Rican “coquito” swaps heavy cream for coconut milk. These adaptations showcase the creativity and cultural diversity of eggnog, making it a truly international holiday treat.
The recipe below uses plant-based milk instead of whole milk, light coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and maple syrup or honey instead of refined sugar.
This healthy version is easy to make and is just as creamy and delicious as classic eggnog.
Ingredients:
Instructions:
Notes:
It is normal for the eggnog to thicken more as it cools. However, if the eggnog is too thick after refrigeration, whisk in a bit of additional plant-based or coconut milk to reach your desired consistency before serving.
It is also normal for eggnog to separate a bit over time. Stir it before serving to blend the ingredients back together and ensure an even texture.
Eggnog is more than just a holiday drink — it is a symbol of joy, tradition and togetherness. While it may be indulgent, it also offers nutritional benefits and can be enjoyed in healthier forms. Whether you’re sipping on a classic recipe or experimenting with vegan alternatives, eggnog is a delightful way to celebrate the season.

https://food.news/2024-12-17-christmas-pudding-delectable-healthy-treat-holiday-season.html,"Christmas pudding: A delectable, healthy treat worth serving this holiday season","Advertisement


Christmas is a time of tradition, indulgence and celebration, and for many British households, the festive season wouldn’t be complete without the iconic Christmas pudding. Served with brandy sauce, brandy butter or custard, this dense, fruit-packed dessert has been a staple of Christmas dinners for centuries.
But beyond its rich, indulgent taste and cultural significance, the Christmas pudding is also a surprisingly nutritious treat packed with health benefits.
Let’s dive into the fascinating history, nutrient profile and health perks of this beloved holiday dessert, as well as how you can make it healthier if you’re watching your sugar intake.
The origins of the Christmas pudding date back to the 14th century, when it began as a humble dish known as “frumenty.” This early version was more like a savory porridge, made with hulled wheat, boiled in milk and seasoned with spices like cinnamon and saffron.
It was often associated with meatless days, such as Lent and Advent, and was a simple dish meant to sustain the body during periods of abstinence. Over time, the recipe evolved, incorporating other ingredients like beef, currants, mutton, prunes, raisins, spices and wine.
By the 17th century, the dish had transformed into something closer to the sweet pudding that is consumed today, with the addition of eggs, breadcrumbs, dried fruit and spirits like brandy or beer. (Related: Pumpkin spice latte: Savor the perfect beverage for late autumn.)

It was the Victorians who perfected the recipe, turning it into the Christmas pudding that is celebrated today. The pudding traditionally contains 13 ingredients, symbolizing Jesus and the 12 disciples.
These ingredients typically include brandy, brown sugar, breadcrumbs, citron, currants, eggs, flour, lemon peel, milk, mixed spices, orange peel, raisins and suet. The flaming brandy is said to represent the passion of Christ, adding a dramatic flair to the presentation.
While the Christmas pudding may seem like an indulgent treat, its ingredients are surprisingly nutritious.
Here’s a breakdown of the health benefits packed into this festive dessert:
Fiber-rich fruits
Dried fruits like currants, prunes, raisins and sultanas are rich in dietary fiber, enzymes, polyphenols (antioxidants), vitamins and minerals. These fruits are also high in potassium and iron, making them a great addition to your diet.
While dried fruits do contain natural sugars, they have a lower glycemic index, meaning they won’t spike your blood sugar as quickly as other sweet treats.
Digestion-friendly prunes
Prunes are known for their ability to support healthy digestion, relieve constipation and protect cells from free radical damage, thanks to their high antioxidant content.
Heart-healthy raisins
A flavorful ingredient, raisins are not only delicious but also packed with fiber and iron. These nutrients can support good health.
Nutritious nuts
Almonds, hazelnuts, pecans and walnuts are often added to the pudding mix. These nuts are rich in healthy fats, vitamin E, polyphenols and melatonin, which can all boost your overall well-being and even improve sleep quality.
Antioxidant-rich spices
The mixed spices in a typical Christmas pudding — such as allspice, cinnamon, cloves and ginger — are not just for flavor. These spices are rich in antioxidants and can support optimal digestive health. They can also help reduce bloating, cramps and nausea, making them a great addition to a heavy holiday meal.
Underrated carrots
Often overlooked, carrots are a secret ingredient in many Christmas pudding recipes. Rich in beta-carotene (which the body converts to vitamin A), carrots are good for supporting optimal eye health and boosting your overall well-being.
This recipe retains the rich, festive flavors of a traditional Christmas pudding while being lighter, sugar-free and gluten-free.
It’s a great option if you want to enjoy the holidays without overindulging in decadent desserts.
Ingredients:
Instructions:
The best way to reheat this tasty, healthy Christmas pudding is to steam it again. Steam it for one and a half hours before serving. The pudding will keep well for three or four days, but if you want to store it for longer, freeze it. Wrap the pudding well before freezing.

Mushrooms are a great addition to many savory dishes. Research suggests the benefits offered by mushrooms go beyond the kitchen.
Several studies have found that a compound in mushrooms can help extend the human lifespan. One recent study looked into the potential benefits of fungi-derived bioactive compounds on lifespan and health span. The study also highlighted the importance of finding interventions to minimize age-related diseases.
Another study published in the Nutrition Journal investigated the health benefits of mushrooms. Researchers found that mushroom consumption is linked to a longer lifespan. They credited this benefit to mushrooms’ high content of ergothioneine, an antioxidant amino acid found in fungi and bacteria.
While conducting the study, researchers reviewed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‘s Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The 20-year prospective cohort study involved 15,000 participants.
Results revealed that the people who included mushrooms in their diet had a 16 percent lower chance of early death.
The researchers also discovered that consuming one serving of mushrooms per day instead of processed meat reduced the chances of dying prematurely from any cause by at least 35 percent.
The research team explained that this benefit may be due to ergothioneine’s antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. They also suggested that ergothioneine’s anti-aging properties could stem from its ability to protect against telomere shortening.
Telomeres are usually described as protective “caps” for chromosomes. These long strings of delicate, elaborately folded DNA act like the protective plastic tips on shoelaces that help prevent fraying and damage.
Longer telomeres are associated with better cellular health and are also usually linked with longevity.
But telomeres naturally shorten over time, which makes them less able to preserve the structure of chromosomes. Shorter telomeres are linked with aging and chronic degenerative disease.
In a study with participants over 60, those with shorter telomeres were three times more likely to die of heart disease than those with longer telomeres. They were also at least eight times more likely to die from infections.
In another preliminary study published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements in 2022, a research team discovered that treating cells with ergothioneine for eight weeks alleviated telomere shortening from oxidative stress. They suggested that this can help potentially avoid mutations in DNA that could cause cancer.
The researchers concluded that the results support “a potential role for ergothioneine in oxidative stress-related conditions and healthy aging.” Ergothioneine also supports longevity by helping to replenish and recycle glutathione, the body’s master antioxidant.
Data also suggests that ergothioneine offers a valuable “trifecta” of anti-aging gifts: supporting longer telomeres, protecting DNA and recycling glutathione.
In a separate study, scientists found that people over 60 were found to display lower levels of ergothioneine. They added that those over 60 with mild age-related cognitive impairment showed even sharper declines in this important amino acid.
This is bad because ergothioneine, which helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress, is believed to help aging adults maintain healthy cognition and memory.
Test tube and animal studies have indicated that ergothioneine may also help support memory by creating new neurons or brain cells.
In a trial published in the Japanese Journal of Pharmacology, the research team gave both healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment a mushroom extract containing 5 mg of ergothioneine a day for 12 weeks.
They found that the supplementation resulted in significant improvements in verbal memory, working memory and sustained attention for both the healthy and the mildly impaired volunteers. (Related: 6 Mushrooms you can eat to prevent cognitive impairment and reduce your dementia risk.)
Aside from its anti-aging properties, ergothioneine also helps support a healthy immune system, promotes optimal cardiovascular function and supports healthy skin.
Ergothioneine is even used in skincare serums and creams to reduce the appearance of fine lines and soothe redness and irritation. It is also used in products that help fight against damage and photoaging caused by ultraviolet radiation.

Many savory dishes feature garlic, a flavorful superfood. According to scientific data, garlic offers many amazing health benefits, such as supporting optimal heart health and protecting against cancer.
Known scientifically as Allium sativum, garlic is a culinary staple and an impressive powerhouse of bioactive compounds with beneficial effects on human health.
Garlic is a great source of potassium, which helps with muscle contraction and heart function.
Garlic also contains selenium that your body uses for reproduction and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) production.

Additionally, garlic contains manganese, a mineral that is used by the body for building strong bones and maintaining a healthy immune system.
Here are five science-backed benefits of incorporating garlic into a balanced diet:
According to a study published in the journal Proceedings From the National Academy of Sciences, consuming garlic boosts the production of hydrogen sulfide.
This bioactive compound acts as a powerful antioxidant and assists with cellular signaling to increase circulation and relax blood vessels. This could explain why garlic has long been known as a natural treatment that can also prevent heart disease, which includes atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, heart attack and stroke.
A study published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements revealed that consuming crushed raw garlic significantly improved fasting blood sugar, waist circumference, cholesterol levels (both by lowering triglyceride levels and raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels) and blood pressure in those with metabolic syndrome.
Metabolic syndrome is a deadly collection of comorbidities, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excessive abdominal fat.
According to a meta-analysis published in the journal Gastroenterology, consuming vegetables from the Allium family, which includes garlic, onions, leeks and chives, significantly reduces someone’s risk of developing stomach cancer.
Several studies have also suggested that garlic consumption can reduce the risk of cancer in the brain, esophagus, lungs and prostate. (Related: Harness the legendary power of garlic, the everyday superfood, with this simple recipe.)

A meta-analysis published in the journal Food & Nutrition Research evaluated nine randomized controlled trials looking at garlic consumption in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
The results revealed that there were statistically significant improvements in blood sugar and other key diabetic biomarkers when the subjects took garlic supplements, which contained a compound called allicin, with daily amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1.5 grams.
A cross-sectional study published in the journal BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders revealed that women who regularly consume garlic and other Allium vegetables had a significantly reduced risk of hip osteoarthritis.
The authors suggested that this could be due to diallyl disulfide, a compound in garlic believed to repress enzymes that break down skeletal bone matrixes.
Additionally, diallyl disulfide is well-known due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, contributing to garlic’s ability to support optimal cardiovascular health and protect against various diseases.
Other reported benefits of garlic include a reduced risk of preterm delivery, alcohol-induced liver damage and the common cold.
Now that you know about the health benefits of garlic, how much garlic do you need to eat to reap these benefits?
The exact amount isn’t confirmed yet.
According to a study published in the journal Proceedings From the National Academy of Sciences, a concentration of garlic extract equivalent to about two medium-sized garlic cloves per day should be enough.
That may sound like a lot, but garlic is a versatile ingredient. You can easily add it to almost any meal, such as homemade salad dressings, hummus, chicken, fish, meat, poultry, stir-fry, omelets and more.
Here are more ways to add garlic to your regular diet:
Eat it raw
This isn’t the most palatable way to consume garlic, but research, such as an August 2013 study published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology, suggests that garlic loses its powerful anti-inflammatory properties once it has been heated.
Know the right way to prepare garlic
If you are going to cook garlic, chop, slice, or smash the cloves for at least 10 minutes before putting it on the heat.
Preparing garlic this way initiates an enzymatic process that maximizes its health-boosting benefits.
Try an aged garlic extract
If you can’t stomach the taste of fresh garlic or have trouble with it due to indigestion, try a high-quality aged garlic extract instead.
Make garlic bread at home
Follow the steps below to make garlic bread:
Store garlic cloves in the pantry or a cupboard in your kitchen. Room-temperature places that remain cool and dark are the perfect places to store garlic.
If you’re worried about having smelly “garlic breath,” chew on raw mint. You can also try eating lettuce, fennel seeds, or apples after a garlicky lunch or dinner.
If you have a heart condition and are taking heart medications, keep in mind that garlic and garlic extracts may interact with certain drugs, such as blood thinners.

https://food.news/2024-06-10-fda-proposes-ban-popular-food-additive-bvo.html,FDA proposes ban of popular food additive linked to negative side effects,"Advertisement
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has finally proposed a ban on a popular food additive used in various consumer foods and beverages that has been linked to many negative side effects.
Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) is a food additive that is used to help emulsify citrus-flavored soft drinks and prevent the flavoring ingredients from separating during distribution.
BVO contains bromine atoms which are bonded to the triglycerides that are derived from vegetable oil.
The concern with BVO is due to the presence of bromine, an element also found in brominated flame retardants. Some research has suggested that excessive consumption of BVO can lead to bromine accumulation in the body, potentially causing adverse effects. (Related: Maker of Prime drinks sued over PFAS and claims of excessive caffeine in its beverages.)

Because of these health concerns, BVO has been subjected to scrutiny and regulatory action in various parts of the world:
The Food and Drug Administration explained that it wants to “revoke the regulation authorizing the use of BVO in food.”
Officials have concluded that the use of the oil in food is no longer considered safe, especially since several studies have suggested that it could possibly cause adverse effects in people.
According to the FDA’s announcement, BVO is a vegetable oil that is modified with bromine.
In 1970, the FDA ruled that BVO was no longer “Generally Recognized as Safe” and started monitoring its use under the agency’s food additive regulations.
Throughout the years, many beverage makers reformulated their products to replace BVO with an alternative ingredient. Now, only a few beverages in the U.S. contain BVO.
Recent toxicology studies conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health have also given the FDA conclusive scientific evidence to support the agency’s proposal to remove its food additive authorization for BVO.
There has been controversy regarding the use of the oil for many years, and some other countries have already banned BVO from being used in food. Reports have also suggested that the ingredient bromine can irritate the skin and the mucous membranes.
Additionally, long-term exposure can cause neurologic symptoms such as headaches, memory loss and impaired balance or coordination.
BVO is often included on the nutrition facts list on diet soda drinks.
It is also used in the following products:
The food additive is typically derived from corn or soybean oil.
In 2013, PepsiCo announced that it would remove BVO from Gatorade products. And in 2014, Coca-Cola announced the removal of BVO from all its products.

The maker of the Prime beverage line has been sued over claims of its beverages containing both so-called “forever chemicals” and excessive caffeine.
The class-action lawsuit against Prime Hydration LLC was filed on April 8 in the Southern District of New York. Poughkeepsie, New York resident Lara Vera filed the suit in federal court on behalf of herself and other shoppers who purchased Prime products across the country.
The plaintiffs accused Prime Hydration of “misleading and deceptive practices” concerning the company’s 12-ounce (oz) energy drinks. Despite being advertised as having only 200 milligrams (mg) of caffeine, the drinks actually contain between 215 mg and 225 mg.

According to Vera, she bought Prime’s Blue Raspberry products several times in August 2022 for about $3 to $4 each. However, she added that she would have avoided them if she had known the actual caffeine content. The Poughkeepsie resident is seeking $5 million from Prime Hydration, USA Today reported. (Related: Michelle Obama’s juice brand fails health standards set by her husband’s administration.)
The suit pointed out that Prime’s 200 mg of caffeine is equivalent to “half a dozen Coke cans or nearly two 12-oz Red Bulls.” One 12-oz can of Red Bull energy drink contains 114 mg of caffeine, and one cup of coffee contains around 100 mg of caffeine.
It also reiterated that “there is no proven safe dose of caffeine for children.” Common side effects for kids consuming caffeine may include headaches, rapid or irregular heartbeats, seizures, shaking and an upset stomach. Aside from physical side effects, the complaint also said that caffeine may have adverse emotional effects on the mental health of children.
Moreover, the lawsuit also referenced a call by U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate Prime energy drinks due to their dangerously high caffeine levels. In a letter, the senator for the Empire State said vague marketing targeting young people encouraged parents to buy a “cauldron of caffeine” for their children.
Prime Hydration was founded in 2022 by YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI (born Olajide Olayinka Williams “JJ” Olatunji). Paul has since joined professional wrestling, becoming the World Wrestling Entertainment franchise’s United States Champion.

While their products are growing more popular and lucrative, the company is still dealing with class action suits because of the ingredients in their energy and sports drinks. Prior to Vera’s lawsuit, Prime Hydration was sued in 2023 over a variant allegedly containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), or “forever chemicals.”
The class-action lawsuit filed Aug. 2, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleged that Prime Grape flavor drink contained PFAS as per independent third-party testing. This complaint was filed by the Milberg law firm, which specializes in class action lawsuits, on behalf of lead plaintiff Elizabeth Castillo and other similarly affected consumers.
According to the law firm, Prime Hydration “generated more than $250 million in retail sales in its first year, including $45 million in a single month.” Castillo’s suit is seeking a $5 million judgment – a small amount compared to the company’s profits.
A news release by Milberg said PFAS are dubbed “forever chemicals” as they “bioaccumulate,” or accrue, in the body over time. The chemicals have been found to have adverse effects on both the human body and the environment, they added.

As a superfood full of “healthy” fat, avocados are popular among health enthusiasts or those trying to support their overall well-being. According to a study published in Current Developments in Nutrition, consuming one avocado per day may also help “improve overall diet quality.”
The study was led by a team of researchers from Pennsylvania State University’s Department of Nutritional Sciences. The team included Kristina Petersen, associate professor of Nutritional Sciences, and Penny Kris-Etherton, retired professor of Nutritional Sciences.

For the study, the research team investigated how food-based intervention, specifically one avocado per day, can affect overall diet quality. The findings are important because poor diet quality is a risk factor for many diseases, including heart disease.
Additionally, many American adults have poor diet quality and do not meet key dietary recommendations provided by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
According to Petersen, avocados are a nutrient-dense food and they contain a lot of fiber and other important nutrients.
While conducting the study, the researchers tried to find out if the regular intake of avocadoes would result in “an increase in diet quality.
Petersen said previous observational research suggests that avocado consumers have higher diet quality compared to non-consumers. As a result, the research team developed the study to find out if “there is a causational link between avocado consumption and overall diet quality.”
Petersen explained that because only two percent of American adults are regular avocado consumers, the researchers tried to confirm if including avocados in someone’s daily diet could significantly increase their diet quality.
Before the study, researchers conducted phone interviews with participants. Interviews were also conducted throughout the study to find out what their dietary intake was like in the previous 24 hours.
The researchers also evaluated their diets using the Healthy Eating Index to measure how well they adhered to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
The researchers worked with 1,008 participants divided into two groups. One group continued with their usual diet and limited their avocado intake during the 26-week study. The second group incorporate one avocado a day into their diet.
Petersen said the participants who consumed one avocado per day “significantly increased their adherence to dietary guidelines.” This suggests that some strategies, like eating one avocado per day, “can help people follow dietary guidelines and improve the quality of their diets.” (Related: Latest EWG consumer’s guide reveals 2024’s DIRTY DOZEN and CLEAN FIFTEEN.)
In the study, the researchers classified avocados as a vegetable and they observed an increase in vegetable consumption attributed to the avocado intake.
Some participants also used avocados to replace some unhealthier options. Petersen warned that having poor diet quality significantly increases one’s risk for conditions like heart disease, kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes and other preventable diseases.
She advised that improving people’s adherence to dietary guidelines is an effective way of helping reduce their risk of developing chronic conditions and “prolong healthy life expectancy.”
Petersen has conducted similar studies about the impact of food-based interventions, including the link between pistachios and diet quality. However, she added that more research is needed to find out what other food-based strategies can be used to improve people’s adherence to dietary guidelines.
Avocados can easily be incorporated into diets through making green smoothies or adding them to scrambled eggs. Avocados can also be used as a substitute for dips like mayo and sour cream. Here are some tips on how to incorporate an avocado into nutritious meals:
Seasoned
Keep things simple by sprinkling avocados with a bit of salt and pepper. Other flavorful seasonings to try include balsamic vinegar, cayenne pepper, lemon juice or paprika.
Cut an avocado into chunks and add your preferred seasonings and spices before serving.
On toast
Start the day with avocado on toast, a healthier substitute for regular spreads like butter and margarine. Avocado can also be pureed as a spread on toast and sandwiches for a more nutritious meal.
In salads
Studies also suggest that the extra calories from fat and fiber in avocados may help keep people fuller for longer. This can then help reduce calorie intake at subsequent meals.
Because salads can be light in calories, adding avocados can make them a more filling meal.
In soups
Avocados can be used as the main ingredient in avocado soup. Chunks of the superfruit can also be added into other soups.

The latest edition of the Environmental Working Group (EWG) annual consumer’s guide has found that almost three-fourths of the non-organic fruits and vegetables they sampled contained traces of toxic pesticides. The EWG’s 2024 “Dirty Dozen,” which include strawberries and spinach, tested at levels closer to 95 percent.
In the EWG researchers’ report titled “2024 Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides In Produce,” they revealed that four out of five of the most frequently detected pesticides found on the 12 most-contaminated produce items were fungicides that could have serious side effects on consumer health.

Alexa Friedman, an EWG senior scientist, warned that these fungicides “can disrupt the hormone function in our body.” She added that the chemicals were also associated with things such as “worse health outcomes” and negative effects on the male reproductive system.
Researchers reported that the four fungicides detected on the Dirty Dozen produce included fludioxonil, pyraclostrobin, boscalid and pyrimethanil.
Two of the fungicides – fludioxonil and pyrimethanil – had the highest concentrations of any pesticide detected.
The EWG’s annual Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen lists are based on a review of Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration data.
For the 2024 lists, EWG looked at data from 47,510 samples of 46 fruits and vegetables.
2024’s Dirty Dozen list is similar to previous years, with strawberries, spinach and hearty greens taking the top three spots. Below is the full list:
Friedman explained that it’s possible fungicides were seen in high concentrations compared to other types of pesticides because they are often sprayed on produce later in the process.
Farmers usually spray fungicides after harvest to protect crops from mildew or mold as they are transported to the grocery store.
Aside from fungicides, testing also revealed the presence of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid and imidacloprid which, as neuro-active insecticides, can harm bees and other pollinators. Neonicotinoids have also been linked to issues affecting the development of children’s nervous systems.
Testing also confirmed the presence of pyrethroid insecticides like cypermethrin and bifenthrin. While there are fewer studies on these pesticides, existing research has warned that they may also harm children’s brains.
More than one in 10 pear samples tested positive for diphenylamine, a compound that is currently banned in the European Union over cancer concerns.
While most of the pesticides detected in the Dirty Dozen are legal, scientists also found acephate, an organophosphate insecticide that is essentially prohibited for use on green beans.
One sample tested positive for levels at an alarming 500 times the Environmental Protection Agency‘s (EPA) legal limit. (Related: Herbicide in every bite: GLYPHOSATE detected in 100% of U.S. fast-food brands tested.)
The EWG also reported that at least 65 percent of the conventional items on the Clean Fifteen list were pesticide-free. Below is the full list:
The consumer’s guide is primarily aimed at helping shoppers make informed choices as they choose between conventional and organic items, which are often more expensive or harder to find.
Friedman said EWG always recommends that shoppers “consume as many fruits and veggies as possible, whether they’re organic or conventional.”
However, for people worried about consuming pesticides, EWG recommends checking the consumer’s guide to prioritize which fruits and vegetables to buy organic to help reduce pesticide exposure.
EWG recommends prioritizing organic versions of Dirty Dozen items to limit possible exposure to contaminants.
Overall, EWG encourages policymakers and regulators to be more proactive in understanding the risks posed by pesticides and protect consumers from them. Friedman said that conducting research that focuses on the side effects of these pesticides, specifically the pesticides that were found in high detection in 2024, can help researchers learn more about how these could affect the health of susceptible populations, such as children.
She also explained that even though many of the pesticides detected in tests were at or below legal limits set by the EPA, “legal doesn’t always mean that they’re safe for everyone.”
To illustrate, EWG researchers discovered in a 2020 study that for nearly 90 percent of common pesticides, the EPA had failed to apply an extra margin of safety for children when setting limits.

By using the proper food preservation techniques, you can keep your harvest fresh and edible, even without a refrigerator or freezer. (h/t to PreppersWill.com)
Note that even though refrigeration slows down spoilage, it doesn’t halt it completely. Meanwhile, food preservation methods can actively inhibit bacterial growth and other decay processes, ensuring that food doesn’t go to waste.

Dehydration is a traditional food preservation method that uses the power of the sun to remove moisture from food and significantly extend its shelf life. This technique can also be used if you prefer convenient modern electric dehydrators.
While electric dehydrators offer a controlled environment, the basic principles remain the same when harnessing the power of the sun. If you want to save money, you can create a simple solar dehydrator using readily available materials. (Related: Why freeze-drying is the best food preservation method.)
For example, you can use wood frames with screens stretched taut to create a platform for the food to lie on. Place this dehydrator in direct sunlight for several hours so the sun’s heat can naturally dehydrate the food.
To dehydrate food successfully regardless of the method, you must make sure that the food is thoroughly dried. Properly dehydrated food will have a crisp texture.
This means that no moisture could cause spoilage.
Dehydrating is great for fruits and vegetables such as:
Canning is another classic food preservation method that has stood the test of time.
While advancements in food science have resulted in the refinement of canning techniques, the core principle is the same: Using the method, you create a shelf-stable food product by destroying microorganisms that cause spoilage and sealing the food in airtight containers.
There are two main types of canning: Water bath canning and pressure canning.
Water bath canning is best for high-acid foods like fruits (applesauce, peaches and pears), some vegetables with added pickling liquid (pickles, relish) and certain condiments (BBQ sauce, jams and tomato sauce).
Using this canning technique, the filled jars are submerged in simmering water until they reach a temperature high enough to destroy harmful bacteria.
Meanwhile, pressure canning is best for low-acid foods like broths, dry beans, meats, vegetables and cooked dishes (baked beans, chili, soups and stews).
For pressure canning, you need a pressure canner that traps steam and raises the temperature above boiling, ensuring the safe preservation of low-acid foods.
While usually done on a stovetop, both water bath canning and pressure canning can be adapted for off-grid use. Keep in mind that you need a reliable heat source like a fire pit or BBQ and a way to accurately monitor the temperature throughout the canning process to ensure food safety.
As the name implies, you will need salt for salting various foods. Like dehydration, this technique actively extends the shelf life of food by drawing out moisture and inhibiting microbial growth.
The salting process involves the generous application of salt directly onto the food. You can do this by creating a thick salt rub or packing the food into a bed of coarse salt.
After the initial salting, the food must be placed in a cool area for an extended period, usually one month, to allow the dehydration process to take effect.
Once cured, the food is ready for cooking.
Alternatively, you can use a brine solution. You will need enough water to cover the food completely, and then slowly add salt while stirring until a layer of undissolved salt forms on the bottom.
The food is then submerged in the brine and stored in a cool location for a week or more, depending on the size and type of food.
Salting is a versatile technique that is best for meats, fruits, vegetables and eggs.
However, this method has several downsides, such as requiring a lot of salt and time. Additionally, the preserved food will have a higher sodium content, which might not be ideal for someone who has to monitor their sodium intake for health reasons.
Smoking is a food preservation method that uses smoke to naturally extend the shelf life of various foods. This technique is best for meats, fish, fruits and vegetables.
There are two main types of smoking: Cold smoking and hot smoking.
With cold smoking, you need to keep the temperature below 100 F as the smoke slowly dries out the food within one to five days. This method typically requires additional preparation, such as curing meat with salt ahead of time or cooking it fully to prevent bacteria growth during the slow drying process.
If possible, use a smokehouse for cold smoking to keep the meat away from direct flames.
Hot smoking cooks the food at around 220 F. This method is quicker, but hot-smoked meats still require refrigeration after smoking.
For long-term storage, dehydrate the hot-smoked meat after the initial smoking process.
Smoking is versatile. You can choose this method if you prefer a certain smoker design and you can either purchase or make your smoker.
Here are some alternatives to refrigeration that you can try after SHTF.
The icebox or ice room is a food preservation method that uses ice harvested during the winter months to keep food cool during the warmer seasons.
Iceboxes are well-insulated containers, often made of wood, that have a compartment for storing ice. The ice slowly melts, which provides a cool environment for the stored food.
Meanwhile, ice rooms are larger, often walk-in structures, that are built with thick walls and insulation to retain the cool air generated by all the stored ice.
Note that these methods require planning and a dedicated ice harvesting routine if you are looking for a reliable approach to off-grid cooling.
The root cellar is a traditional and highly effective off-grid cooling solution. These underground chambers utilize the natural insulating properties of the earth to maintain a cool, stable temperature year-round, which is ideal for storing different food items.
There are many guides online on how to construct different kinds of root cellars. Some need a hole dug in the ground, while others can be built using a closet in your home.
Root cellars offer a slightly cooler environment to store fruits and vegetables.
If you have the space and resources, you also have the option to build a root cellar or basement in your home. Use these structures for long-term food storage.
A zeer pot is a traditional food preservation method that uses clay pots and evaporation for cooling.
To make a zeer pot at home, you will need two terracotta pots. Make sure one is slightly smaller than the other.
Place the smaller pot inside the larger one. Fill the gap between the two pots with sand. This sand will act as a heat sink, absorbing and retaining cool temperatures.
Keep the sand damp. As the water evaporates from the sand, it draws heat away from the inner pot, which creates a cooler environment.
Cover the larger pot with a terracotta lid, metal lid, or a damp cloth to minimize evaporation from within the pot itself.
The zeer pot should be kept in a shady area for optimal cooling effect. This method is best for fruits and vegetables. Note that the damp environment can attract insects, so you need a secure lid.
If you want to live off the grid and become self-sufficient, learn how to harvest and preserve food properly so you have access to a variety of food year-round.

Honey is a sweet liquid that honeybees produce from plant nectar. A common ingredient in many foods, honey is available in several different forms, such as raw honey or Manuka honey.
Honey also has several health benefits and is a common ingredient in many home remedies and alternative medicine treatments.

One tablespoon (20 grams) of honey contains the following nutrients:
Because honey is essentially pure sugar, it contains no fat and only trace amounts of protein and fiber. While honey contains small amounts of some nutrients, most people don’t usually consume enough for it to be a significant dietary source of vitamins and minerals.
However, honey is a great addition to a healthy diet because it is a great source of health-promoting plant compounds called polyphenols.
Minimally-processed honey is a great source of different important bioactive plant compounds and antioxidants, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids.
Darker honey varieties offer more antioxidants than lighter varieties.
Antioxidants can help neutralize reactive oxygen species in the body, which can build up in your cells and cause damage. Data suggests that this damage may be linked to health issues such as heart disease, premature aging and Type 2 diabetes.
One study suggests that honey may also help protect against heart disease because it helps improve blood fat levels, lower blood pressure, regulate your heartbeat and prevent the death of healthy cells. These factors can help boost heart function and health.
In an observational study, researchers worked with more than 4,500 volunteers over 40. The results showed that moderate honey intake was linked to a lower risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) among women.
Raw honey usually contains propolis, a resin that bees produce from sap-producing trees and similar plants. Data suggests that propolis may improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
If you are worried about blood sugar management, honey may offer some benefits over regular sugar.
While honey raises your blood sugar level like other types of sugar do, the antioxidants in honey may help protect against metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes.
Scientists have revealed that honey may increase adiponectin levels, a hormone that reduces inflammation and improves blood sugar regulation. Data also suggests that daily honey intake may improve fasting blood sugar levels in individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.
Coughing is a common health issue for children with upper respiratory infections. These infections can affect both sleep and quality of life for children and parents.
According to a review of several studies on honey and cough in children, honey seems to be more effective than diphenhydramine for cough symptoms. Honey may also help reduce cough duration.
Another review revealed that honey may also help improve sleep quality among children with coughs, along with their parents. As a bonus, unlike some cough medicines, honey doesn’t have any negative effects. (Related: Herbs and honey: 7 Natural home remedies for a cough.)
In the past, honey has been used topically to help treat wounds and promote burn healing. The practice is still common today.
According to a review of 26 studies on honey and wound care, honey was most effective at healing partial-thickness burns and wounds that have become infected after surgery.
Data also found that Manuka honey may have positive applications in burn treatments. Keep in mind that if you have a severe burn, home remedies are not a viable substitute for emergency care. Seek medical attention instead.
Researchers think that honey’s healing powers are due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects.
You need to shop smart when buying honey. Just because a container says it contains honey, it may not be honey. In other cases, it may only contain a tiny percentage of honey.
Try to look for organic or raw honey because some producers dilute honey with plain syrup. While honey adulteration is illegal in most countries, it is still a widespread issue.
Some containers may also have some harmful ingredients that you don’t want to feed your family.
Remember that honey is a type of sugar and that consuming it will cause your blood sugar levels to rise. Additionally, eating large quantities of honey, especially consistently over a long period, can contribute to weight gain and increase your risk of diseases like heart disease or Type 2 diabetes.
Honey is easy to incorporate into a balanced diet. You can get a small boost of antioxidants from honey by using it as a natural sugar alternative.
You can use honey as a glaze for roasted vegetables or grilled meats for a caramelized finish. Try adding honey to baked goods like cakes, cookies and muffins for added moisture and sweetness. You can also add honey to marinades or sauces to give savory dishes a hint of sweetness. Try combining a bit of honey with mustard or mayo for a simple and tasty sandwich spread or veggie dipping sauce.

Studies have shown that beets offer many benefits, such as promoting heart health.
Data has also revealed that the nutritious root vegetable contains natural plant pigments and phytochemicals that have science-backed abilities to sustain and boost the health and function of several body systems.
Additionally, a recent study found that unique compounds in beets can help fight oxidative stress and inflammation. Researchers also reported that these compounds may help reduce fatigue, boost energy levels and even improve athletic performance.

The study was published in the journal Current Nutrition Reports. For this study, the research team analyzed betalains for their therapeutic potential.
Betalains, the natural plant pigments responsible for the bright red color of beets, have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. These compounds also boost the levels of beneficial nitric oxide in the body, in turn helping to relax arteries and improve blood flow and circulation.
The researchers said this increases the availability of oxygen, which leads to enhanced performance during exercise. The review authors credited betalains with alleviating exercise-induced fatigue and improving sports performance.
The new review builds on previous studies, such as a small randomized controlled trial published in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise that showed how beet juice can improve oxygen use and enhance performance in a group of amateur cyclists exercising at simulated high altitudes. (Related: Un-beet-able: Study shows beetroot can boost athletic performance.)
The authors of the recent review also mentioned other studies showing how betalains could help ease exercise-induced muscle damage.
Both professional and amateur athletes know that intense physical activity can damage skeletal muscles, which causes symptoms like stiffness, pain and loss of muscle strength that can last from two to 14 days.
People who have overexerted themselves at the gym may understand the aching and weakness that can follow after intense physical activity. Fortunately, beets and beet juice might offer some relief.
A 2024 study published in the journal Nutrients found that beetroot extracts can significantly decrease blood levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and malondialdehyde. For the study, researchers observed 32 elite athletes who had just run a marathon.
The results of the 2024 study also revealed that beet extracts boost the activity of glutathione, a potent antioxidant and detoxicant produced in the body. The research team suggested that beetroot supplementation “positively influences” recovery from muscle damage.
The 2024 study also supports the findings of an earlier article published in the journal Sports Medicine, where researchers credited betalains with reducing post-exercise muscle damage, inflammation and fatigue. They also added that the compounds helped speed recovery after workouts.
Experts also think that the same properties of beets that enhance athletic stamina, like boosting increasing nitric oxide and promoting blood flow, can support optimal heart health.
Aside from betalains, research has suggested that healthy levels of potassium in beets can help lower blood pressure.
In addition, one cup of cooked beets contains four grams of fiber, which can help support lower levels of homocysteine. This can offer benefits because excessive amounts of homocysteine have been linked to heart disease.
Sarah Thomsen Ferreira, a registered dietitian, has advised that beets can help improve arterial health and reduce LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol.
Beets are savory and earthy with a satisfying consistency. A low-calorie superfood, beets may help create a sense of fullness that can reduce overeating and fight against obesity. As a bonus, beets can help stabilize blood sugar. These root crops are also a good source of folate, a B vitamin that can help prevent strokes.

To keep the list manageable, only include items that your family likes to eat so nothing goes to waste. You should also avoid buying things that require refrigeration once opened, like mayonnaise.
One week’s worth of food, or about twenty-one full meals, that your family will eat and doesn’t require refrigeration is the ideal starting point for a newbie prepper who wants to try food storage.
Because power outages are one of the most common survival scenarios, start thinking of ways you can prepare and store food without power. Consider getting a solar oven or a small gas stove so you can still cook even without electricity.
Alternatively, you can build a fire outdoors so you can cook. (Related: Unlocking the mastery of bucket food storage: Essential for complete preparedness.)
Use either a pen and notebook or a computer program like Excel to lay out your meal plan. Create columns to track each day and rows for each meal. You can also include snacks and drinks.
Before SHTF, learn how to meal plan using a system that works for you.
Breakfasts that are easy to prepare include peanut butter, chicken sandwiches, or soup with bread for lunch. Some dinner suggestions include chili, chicken fried rice, pasta with chicken and vegetables, rice and beans, spaghetti, tortellini soup and taco soup.
Quick snacks include nuts, dried fruit and common pantry items like cheese crackers.
For drinks, stock up on one gallon of water per person then add beverages like dry milk, drink powder, coffee, or tea.
After you decide on the dishes for your meal plans, check each one and make a grocery list of what you would need for that week’s worth of food. Don’t forget to include seasonings for the meals and ingredients for bread.
Keep in mind your individual family members’ food and drink preferences while you plan your meals so you only buy items that everyone won’t mind eating a lot of after SHTF.
List the food item you need to stock up on and the minimum amount you have as a goal. You can either buy the amount of a food item you need all at once or spread it across several smaller purchases so you don’t have to shell out a lot of money in one go.
Try not to pay for items at full price. To save more money, check which stores offer promos and sales on items that you need for your stockpile.
It can take you a week or at least one month to buy all items, depending on how many items you buy and if you buy them when there is a sale. Note that most sales usually happen around major holidays.

The Health Ranger Store is committed to helping you prepare your stockpile before disaster strikes, which is why we’re proud to introduce items like the Ranger Bucket Set – Organic Emergency Storable Food Supply and Organic Goji Berries.
The Ranger Bucket Organic Emergency Storable Food Supply is the world’s first emergency food supply that’s certified organic and laboratory-verified. All the food items are organic, non-GMO, laboratory tested for heavy metals and completely free of chemical ingredients such as MSG or preservatives.

https://food.news/2024-04-05-largest-producer-eggs-halts-production-avian-flu.html,Largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S. halts production because of claimed avian flu outbreaks in Texas and Michigan,"Advertisement
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S., reported on Tuesday, April 2, that it had temporarily paused production at a Texas plant after bird flu was found in chickens. Bird flu was also detected at the company’s poultry facility in Michigan.
In a statement, Cal-Maine Foods, which is based in Mississippi, said an estimated 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, or about 3.6 percent of its total flock, was destroyed after avian influenza (also known as bird flu) was found at the facility in Parmer County, Texas.

The plant in Texas, Ridgeland, is on the Texas-New Mexico border in the Texas Panhandle about 85 miles southwest of Amarillo and about 370 miles northwest of Dallas.
According to the company’s statement, Cal-Maine Foods is cooperating with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to “mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage the response.” The company also said it is working to “secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers.”
Additionally, Cal-Maine Foods has claimed that there is no known bird flu risk associated with eggs that are currently on the market. The company also didn’t recall any eggs.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, eggs that are properly handled and cooked are safe to eat.
The announcement by Cal-Maine comes one day after state health officials announced that one person was diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with allegedly infected cows. Officials have also said that the risk to the public remains low.
Michigan’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has reported that Michigan State University’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has also detected bird flu in a commercial poultry facility in Ionia County. The county is located 100 miles northwest of Detroit.
The department added that it received confirmation of the disease on April 1, Monday, from the lab. It is the fourth time since 2022 that bird flu was detected at a commercial facility in Michigan.
Jennifer Holton, the department’s spokesperson, explained that state law prohibits the department from disclosing the type of poultry at the facility in Ionia. She added that the facility was placed under quarantine and that the department does not foresee any disruptions to supply chains across the state.
The human case recorded in Texas marks the first known instance worldwide of a human getting infected with this version of bird flu from a mammal, said federal health officials.
According to reports, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were infected with avian flu last week. Soon after, federal agriculture officials confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas.
The company said Cal-Maine sells most of its eggs in the Southwestern, Southeastern, Midwestern and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. (Related: Hong Kong recently banned U.S. poultry amid bird flu outbreak in 5 states.)
Bird flu primarily spreads through close or unprotected contact with infected birds. Most cases in humans have occurred after someone has had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), bird flu viruses infect birds’ respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which causes them to shed the virus via their saliva, mucous and feces.
Humans and other mammals can get infected when they get enough virus in their eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale it into their lungs.
Those who have had close contact or unprotected contact with infected animals for long periods are at greater risk of infection. Avian flu can cause mild upper respiratory issues or severe illness, including pneumonia and multiple organ failure that results in death.
In the U.S., the disease usually spreads because of wild birds.
However, outbreaks in commercial poultry or backyard flocks that have resulted in deaths have been reported in 48 states since February 2022.
It’s rare for humans to be infected with avian flu. The only other human case in the country occurred in 2022, when someone incarcerated in a Colorado prison was exposed to poultry infected with bird flu.
On April 2, the CDC explained that the current public health risk is low and that there is no person-to-person spread of bird flu so far. The organization said it is a vital measurement that would prompt concern for the spread of bird flu.
Officials also advised that there is still an increased risk for poultry, livestock and farmers and workers in these sectors, along with veterinarians, veterinary staff and first responders who respond to cases.

Planning for different emergencies such as a civil war or a hurricane may seem stressful. But you can start preparing by doing something as simple as building an emergency prepping kit. Like a bug-out bag for when you need to evacuate after SHTF, an emergency prepping kit will be useful if you plan to bug in, or stay at home, after unexpected disasters or emergencies.
An emergency prepping kit ensures that you have access to a variety of essential supplies, which can help your family stay safe during an emergency.
If you already have emergency prepping kits at home, you can create more kits for family and friends who aren’t preppers so they can get started on their journey to preparedness and self-sufficiency. (h/t to  FoodStorageMoms.com)

Food and water supplies will ensure that you have enough to eat and drink and give you the energy you need to accomplish various tasks that might need doing after a disaster, like repairing damage to your home.
Water
Get at least one gallon of water per person per day for at least three days. You will need clean water for drinking and personal sanitation.
If you have extra space in your garage or stockroom, try to prepare extra water, allocating four gallons per person per day. This should be enough for your hydration, cooking, sanitation and limited laundry needs.
Non-perishable/shelf-stable food
If possible, prepare a three-day supply of non-perishable food, or close to it, such as:
These non-perishable items will provide sustenance without requiring refrigeration.
Manual can opener
Electric can openers are convenient, but when preparing an emergency prepping kit it’s better to include a manual can opener so you can still eat canned food even during a power outage. (Related: Prepping tips: How to prepare a food storage starter kit.)
Water purification tablets or filters
Since clean water is key to your survival, you can benefit from having water purification tablets or filters in your kit.
If the water supply becomes contaminated, you can use items like purification tablets or a portable water filter to make water safe for consumption.
These items are essential for maintaining proper hygiene and for treating minor medical emergencies after SHTF.
Prescription medications
If someone in the family has asthma, diabetes, hypertension or other health conditions that require prescription medications, look into getting extra supplies of those.
If possible, try to get enough medication that will last them at least several days.
First aid kit
Find a sturdy container and turn it into your first aid kit.
Include the following first aid supplies:
Don’t forget other supplies for babies or older people.
Basic personal hygiene items
Prepare toiletries like soap, shampoo, toothbrushes and toothpaste so you can maintain proper hygiene even after SHTF.
You might also need items like dust masks, a solution for your contact lenses and hand sanitizer for disease control during emergencies.
Miscellaneous personal hygiene products
Women in the family will need various feminine hygiene products like pads or tampons. If you have a baby at home, stock up on diapers and baby wipes.
Even if you don’t have an infant at home, moist towelettes or baby wipes can be used to maintain cleanliness when water is scarce. You should also get extra toilet paper and paper towels.
Garbage bags
You will need garbage bags for proper waste disposal and sanitation purposes.
These items are important for keeping everyone at home safe.
Portable radio
Use a battery-operated or hand-crank radio to stay informed about all emergency updates and news broadcasts. If you have a NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) weather radio, you can check the weather conditions at all times.
Flashlights
Prepare several flashlights and extra batteries for battery-powered devices. Use the flashlights to provide illumination during power outages.
You can also get solar flashlights that you can charge in window sills when the sun is up.
Whistle
Tiny but important, a whistle can be used as a signaling device when SHTF or to attract attention if you need rescue.
Multi-tool or Swiss army knife
A multi-tool has many uses, and you may need one for cutting, opening, or repair work.
Other useful tools for your tool kit include:
These items will help you stay warm and shelter you if you have to bug out after a disaster.
Warm clothing
When preparing kits for the family, include a spare change of clothes with items like hats, gloves, socks and additional layers so you can stay warm in inclement weather.
If possible, the kits should have a complete change of clothing for each family member.
If your area has severe rain storms, you should also have rain gear in addition to a change of clothes.
A pair of sturdy shoes or boots
Shoes protect your feet, especially if you have to walk in an area with debris or if you need to walk long distances as you bug out.
Plastic sheeting and duct tape
If you need to evacuate, you can use these items for temporary shelter or to seal windows and doors in case of damage.
Tent or tarpaulin sheet
It’s ideal to have a portable shelter option for outdoor emergencies or evacuation scenarios.
Thermal blankets
Use thermal blankets to stay warm, especially in cold weather conditions. If you live in very cold climates, you may need a sleeping bag for all family members.
Communication and navigation
Maps and other tools in this section can help you navigate if you need to bug out.
Compass and local maps
These navigational tools will help you find your way if you can’t use your GPS or electronic devices.
Signal flares
Use signal flares if you need to signal for help or alert rescue teams to your current location.
Portable battery or hand-crank charger
With a portable battery, you can keep your electronic devices charged for communication and information access.
Emergency/survival whistle
An emergency or survival whistle can be used as an additional signaling device to attract attention after SHTF.
These supplies are crucial if you have food in your kits that require cooking.
Matches or lighters
Store matches or lighters in a waterproof container so you can use them even in wet conditions.
Portable stove or camp stove
With a portable stove, you can cook and boil water when traditional methods are unavailable.
Cooking utensils
Your kits should include pots, pans, utensils and other cooking tools for meal preparation. To conserve water, include paper cups and plates along with plastic utensils for multiple meals.
Fire extinguisher
Make sure you have a fire extinguisher to put out small fires and prevent them from spreading.
Pet supplies
If you have pets, they’ll also need food, water and supplies. Their kits should include pet food, a leash, a collar with an ID tag, a pet carrier and additional items specific to your pet like treats and toys.

One ingredient often used to make various baked goods and processed foods may cause DNA damage, oxidative stress and decreased testosterone levels and sperm counts in male mammals: sodium aluminum phosphate.
Respected author and journalist Naomi Wolf discussed in an article the widespread use of sodium aluminum phosphate on common food products such as baking powders, pancake mixes, frozen pizzas and processed cheeses.
She also discussed several peer-reviewed studies that were linked to broader trends in reproductive health and masculinity, warning that sodium aluminum phosphate affected blood testosterone linked to libido, and sperm counts associated with fertility. (Related: Studies show ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS put millions of people in the U.K. at risk of cardiovascular disease.)

Sodium aluminum phosphate is an additive often used in food products as an emulsifying agent, leavening acid and stabilizer. It is a white, odorless solid that is slightly soluble in water.
Sodium aluminum phosphate is used to make a variety of commercially baked goods like biscuits, cakes and muffins. It is also used for baking powders and self-rising flours and in processed cheeses to improve their texture and melting properties.
Sodium aluminum phosphate is also used in school lunches and fast food items, like hamburger buns and pizza dough, said Wolf.
Wolf warned that people are often exposed to sodium aluminum phosphate, especially if they consume food products like processed baked goods like burgers and frozen pizza.
She also called for sodium aluminum phosphate to be “taken out of our food supply.”
Chemicals company Innophos sells sodium aluminum phosphate under the brand name Actif-8. The product’s brand safety data sheet has classified sodium aluminum phosphate as a “hazardous substance or preparation” that can cause serious eye damage and skin and respiratory irritation.
The safety data sheet also warned that users must avoid breathing dust, fumes, gas, mist, vapors, or sodium aluminum phosphate spray and to wash “thoroughly after handling.”
The Innophos safety data sheet also advised users to wear protective gloves and eye or face protection when handling sodium aluminum phosphate.
If inhaled, Innophos warned that sodium aluminum phosphate “may cause upper respiratory tract irritation.” Additionally, ingesting large quantities of the toxic additive may cause negative side effects such as abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
However, despite these warnings, Wolf explained that sodium aluminum phosphate is still often used to make various food products without safety precautions for consumers.
“People who handle this product have to suit up and ventilate and avoid eye and skin and lung irritation, yet it is also used to make food that children are eating, warned Wolf.
She also discussed a summary of peer-reviewed scientific literature on aluminum reproductive toxicity by Robert A. Yokel, published in the journal Critical Reviews in Toxicology. According to the review, aluminum exposure may cause “adverse reproductive outcomes in male and female mammals.”
Yokel’s analysis also suggested that “male reproductive endpoints were significantly affected after exposure to lower levels of [aluminum] than females.” Increased aluminum intake resulted in higher concentrations of the metal in the fetus, placenta and testes in both male and female mice and rats.
The proposed mechanism for aluminum’s reproductive toxicity was linked to “oxidative stress as the initiating event, followed by increased DNA damage, impaired spermatogenesis and reduced testosterone levels and sperm count.”
Christopher Exley, a researcher on aluminum toxicity and the author of “Imagine You Are An Aluminum Atom: Discussions With Mr. Aluminum,” praised Wolf’s efforts to bring the toxic effects of sodium aluminum phosphate to a wider audience.
Exley cautioned that humanity is now “in the [aluminum]” age and that it is becoming harder to avoid sodium aluminum phosphate exposure. He also warned that the additive “has a significant impact upon human health — including the male reproductive system.”
Exley, who is a leading expert on aluminum toxicity, has studied the effects of aluminum exposure on human health with his team at Keele University in the United Kingdom. Exley and his research team have also looked into the additive’s potential link to autism.
In a 2014 study published in the journal Reproductive Toxicology, Exley and his fellow researchers provided “unequivocal evidence of high concentrations of aluminum in human semen.” The research team also warned about “concerning implications for spermatogenesis and sperm count.”
In 2017, Exley published research that showed how two months of aluminum exposure at human dietary levels negatively affected spermatogenesis and sperm quality in rats.
According to Wolf, the studied effects of ingesting aluminum correspond to observed declines in masculinity, muscle mass and libido among younger men.
She also warned that some environmental factors, like aluminum exposure, could help explain increased rates of depression, disinterest in sex and weight gain among men. Wolf also warned that sodium aluminum phosphate may cause brain inflammation, dementia and Parkinson’s disease.
She also said that other potential sources of aluminum exposure include antacids, cookware, vaccines and geoengineering projects that “spray aluminum particles into the atmosphere.”
Wolf was “horrified” to find proof of a “chemical war on men” that is targeting traditional masculinity, along with “the ability to strengthen a physical relationship” and in turn a family, or to fight in a “hot war.”
Wolf also criticized the Food and Drug Administration’s oversight of food additives like sodium aluminum phosphate, particularly the agency’s “extraordinarily corrupt and negligent” handling of Pfizer’s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine trials.
According to Wolf, the FDA has not recalled lead-contaminated cinnamon applesauce products, instead claiming that manufacturers and distributors must make sure that their products are not contaminated with harmful chemicals.
She advised consumers to have a more proactive approach to avoid aluminum-containing food additives. Wolf said that shoppers should always check ingredient labels and remove products with aluminum from their pantries.

When you’re getting ready before SHTF, stocking up on healthy and long-lasting freeze-dried foods like berries and vegetables is an important part of your preparedness plan.
Detailed below are some of the benefits of freeze-dried food, such as a long shelf life and nutrient retention. (h/t to WeLovePrepping.com)
Freeze-drying is a food preservation method that reduces the surrounding pressure to allow the frozen water in the food to sublimate directly from solid to gas.
This method removes up to 98 percent of the food’s moisture content. The lack of water in the processed food makes it impossible for spoilage reactions to occur. It also greatly reduces weight and volume.

Freeze-dried ingredients are lighter and take up little space compared to canned goods, making them an ideal addition to your stockpile if storage space is an issue. (Related: Dive into the world of berry foraging: Unravel the secrets to spotting and gathering Mother Nature’s sweet treasures.)
Freeze-dried foods are a great option for your survival stockpile.
When water is removed from fresh foods through freeze-drying, the resulting lightweight, compact foods may have an extended shelf life of up to 25 years. It’s also easy to rehydrate freeze-dried foods because you only need to add water to return them to almost their original state.
Here are some of the benefits of stockpiling freeze-dried foods:
Freeze-drying better preserves nutrients compared to other food preservation methods like canning.
This also means that stocking up on freeze-dried foods like acai berries and kale ensures that you have access to nutritious ingredients even after SHTF.
Most freeze-dried foods retain excellent flavor and texture qualities after rehydrating, making them a great addition to your emergency food stockpile.
When packaged and stored properly freeze-dried foods can last up to several years, making them a great option for a prepper’s food stockpile.
The removal of water makes freeze-dried food very lightweight and compact compared to traditional canned goods.
If you want to maximize shelf space in your pantry or stockroom, freeze-dried food is also easy to transport and store.
Kitchen staples like meats, vegetables and fruits can be freeze-dried. Versatile ingredients like freeze-dried blueberries or kale are great for adding diversity to your food supplies.
If you have a home freeze dryer, you can freeze-dry fresh foods that you grow or hunt. You can then use these ingredients to cook customized meals for your family.
The Health Ranger Store is committed to helping you find the best products for your survival stockpile. It offers a variety of nutritious, freeze-dried fruits and vegetables for your prepping and survival needs.

If you are experiencing symptoms of dehydration like cracked skin and chapped lips, coconut oil can help.
Apply a bit of melted coconut oil to cracked skin or chapped lips to keep them moisturized. The coconut oil can also help relieve any pain or discomfort.
Coconut oil can be used as a hair mask. Melt some coconut oil in a small bowl, but check the temperature. If it gets too hot, you can burn your scalp.
Slowly massage the warm, melted coconut oil into your scalp and roots. Leave the oil on for an hour and then wash it out.
Coconut oil can support healthy hair because it is a natural conditioner and is great for hair growth and split ends. For a scented conditioner, add a couple of drops of lavender essential oil before applying it to your hair.
If you or someone at home is suffering from deep bruising, apply coconut oil directly to the bruise.
Massage the oil into your skin using small circular motions for about three to four minutes. This can help soothe damaged tissue associated with deep bruising.
Coconut oil has natural cleansing properties that can help with minor cuts and scrapes. To use, simply apply a thin layer of coconut oil directly to the open wound.
Cover the wound with an adhesive bandage to keep it clean. (Related: Natural healing: Survival uses for coconut oil.)

A coconut oil-based salve can help relieve the itchiness and redness of a rash.
A coconut oil salve can also support your body’s natural healing process, thanks to its beneficial properties.
Homemade salves and balms are usually made with essential oils and a carrier oil like coconut oil.
Coconut oil is a great carrier oil and can be used to make healing salves and balms after SHTF.
You can restore knives with rusty blades with a bit of coconut oil.
Apply a thick layer of coconut oil to your knife blade. Let it sit for one to two hours then wipe it off. Repeat if necessary.
Before SHTF, you can make DIY candles if you have coconut oil.
Melt the coconut oil until it is liquid. Next, secure a wick into a heat-resistant glass container.
Carefully pour the melted coconut oil into the glass container and make sure the wick stays in place while pouring. Let the coconut oil dry completely until it is solid again, then light the wick as needed.
If you need coconut oil for your stockpile, try Health Ranger Select Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. This product is a pure coconut oil that is laboratory verified for cleanliness and purity.
It is a great source of healthy medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), which can support healthy energy levels and optimal health.
A highly versatile ingredient, you can use our premium organic coconut oil as a delicious and nutritious replacement for cooking and baking oil. It can also be added to drinks like coffee, tea and smoothies.
Health Ranger Select Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is carefully extracted from high-quality coconuts sourced from our trusted growers in the pristine islands of the Philippines. This product is vegan, non-GMO, non-China and certified Kosher and organic.
Health Ranger Select Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is also lab tested for glyphosate, heavy metals and microbiology. If you want to try our premium organic coconut oil, buy handy 14-ounce containers or get the long-term storable one-gallon buckets.

Apple cider vinegar’s origins as a health tonic can be traced to Hippocrates, who used it to treat wounds, fever and skin sores. (Related: Natural healing: A warming apple cider vinegar recipe that helps boost your immune health.)
For the experimental study, a research team in Lebanon conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving overweight and obese young volunteers aged 12 to 25 years old.
The scientists randomly placed 30 participants in one of four groups. The participants were instructed to consume either five, 10 or 15 milliliters (mL) of apple cider vinegar diluted in 250 mL of water every morning before they ate anything for 12 weeks.
The control group consumed an inactive drink – a placebo – made from lactic acid added to water to look and taste the same.
This sort of study usually provides high-quality evidence because it can demonstrate cause and effect that the intervention, which is apple cider vinegar, results in a specific outcome.
The study was also double-blinded, which means neither the volunteers nor the research team involved with collecting the data knew who was in which group.
After three months, data revealed that the regular consumption of apple cider vinegar was linked with a significant decrease in body weight and body mass index (BMI).
On average, the volunteers who drank apple cider vinegar during that period lost six to eight kilograms (13 to 18 pounds) in weight and reduced their BMI by 2.7 to three points, depending on the dose. The volunteers also showed significant decreases in the waist and hip circumference.
Additionally, the scientists observed significant decreases in levels of blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol in the apple cider groups, which echoes previous studies.
The placebo group, who consumed water with lactic acid, had smaller decreases in both their weight and BMI. There were also no significant decreases in their blood glucose and blood lipids.
Before you take apple cider vinegar, keep in mind that it is acidic and there are concerns that it may erode tooth enamel.
This can be an issue with other acidic beverages, including fizzy drinks and sodas, lemon water and orange juice.
To reduce the risk of acid erosion, some dentists recommend the following after drinking acidic drinks:
This study offers some evidence of a potential connection between apple cider vinegar and weight loss. But before health professionals can recommend this as a healthy and natural weight loss strategy, experts recommend conducting bigger and better conducted studies across a wider age range.
Such research must be conducted with a controlled background diet and exercise across all volunteers to provide more robust evidence that apple cider vinegar could be a useful aid for healthy weight loss.
But if you don’t mind the acidic taste of apple cider vinegar then you could try consuming a bit to help with weight loss, alongside a balanced diet. This study does not suggest that you can eat whatever you want and drink apple cider vinegar as a way to control your weight.

Pineapples are sweet and delicious tropical fruits. A popular ingredient for fruit and green smoothies, studies have also shown that pineapple offers several health benefits, such as supporting digestive health and relieving sports injuries.
Despite their name, pineapples don’t grow on pine or apple trees. In the 17th century, pineapples were named the way they were because, at the time, the term “apple” was applied to unknown fruits. And pineapples looked like pinecones.

Pineapples originated in South America. By the 15th century, the tropical fruit reached Europe and India because sailors found that eating pineapples helped support their overall well-being during their long voyages. There are now over 100 different pineapple varieties sold worldwide, mainly from Costa Rica, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.
Experts think that pineapple’s therapeutic value is mainly due to bromelain. The proteolytic enzyme bromelain is found in different supplements and herbal preparations.
The most important substance in pineapple is bromelain. Bromelain is still being studied for its potential use in other medical applications.
As a proteolytic enzyme, bromelain helps break down the protein molecules in food for optimal absorption and digestion. This characteristic is also linked to other beneficial actions.
The copper levels in pineapples may help maintain neural pathways in the brain, which then helps support cognitive function.
According to a 2017 study in Iran, pineapple juice positively affected the cognitive ability of memory-impaired mice subjects to recognize objects. The scientists concluded that pineapple has the potential to treat certain cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease.
Additionally, pineapples may help support mental health by reducing anxiety and improving mood due to tryptophan and magnesium. Both are known to help boost the body’s production of serotonin, the substance that elevates mood.
Pineapples contain fiber and potassium, which can both support heart health by reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Potassium is vital in regulating blood pressure, while fiber helps lower cholesterol levels. (Related: Grapefruit found to help reduce high blood pressure.)
Pineapple antioxidants are flavonoids and phenolic compounds that reduce inflammation and damage from free radicals. The results of a laboratory study on rats revealed that these antioxidants may have heart-protective effects by reducing cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation.
Bromelain was first identified in 1891 and has been used as a dietary supplement for gastric upset and inflammation for over 50 years.
Eight proteolytic substances have also been isolated from bromelain. Bromelain therapy is used with pancreatic insufficiency patients who are unable to produce enough digestive enzymes.
Aside from bromelain helping digest the proteins in food, pineapple fiber also contributes to gut mobility and healthy bowel elimination.
Bromelain is used for sports injuries and swelling because of its anti-inflammatory effect, especially on the muscles, joints and soft tissue.
One clinical study revealed that, when administered to boxers, bromelain “completely cleared all bruises on the face and hematomas of the orbits, lips, ears, chest, and arms in four days.”
The magnesium in pineapple also helps relieve muscle cramps and fatigue.
The first critical step in burn or wound care is to treat the affected area before systemic complications such as inflammation and infection set in. Bromelain gel is typically used to remove as much of the damaged skin as possible so cells can regrow with minimal scarring.
Some studies have suggested that bromelain may reduce bruising, inflammation, swelling and pain after surgery. Bromelain has also been found effective in controlling pain after periodontal surgery.
Some topical skin cosmetics products contain bromelain because it has exfoliation properties that can help remove damaged tissue.
Cancer is a chronic disease linked to uncontrolled cell growth. Cancer progression is linked to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.
Studies have found that pineapples have cancer-fighting compounds, such as beta-carotene, bromelain, quercetin and vitamin C, that are known to support the immune system and neutralize harmful free radicals, which helps minimize oxidative stress and reduces inflammation.
Research has also found that bromelain can reduce tumor growth, induce cell death, and reduce inflammation.
According to a laboratory study, bromelain was able to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells. Another study also revealed that the compound inhibited the growth of colon cancer cells.
Research is still being conducted to help experts learn more about pineapple’s anti-cancer properties. Some cancer centers also include pineapple in their patients’ daily diets.
Fresh pineapples are imported from warm climates and the fruits are in season during the spring, fall and winter.
Frozen and fresh pineapple are naturally sweet and free of added sugars. You can enjoy frozen pineapple any time of year.
However, some brands of canned pineapple can be high in sugar, especially if the fruit is sold canned or jarred in syrup. Read the ingredients list to see if sugar is added to the brand before buying.
If there aren’t other options, drain the liquid and rinse the fruit to reduce excess sugar.
To reduce the sugar content of the pineapples that you consume, choose pineapple canned or jarred in water or its own juice. You should also choose similar products for fruit cups marketed for children.
If you’re worried about how to cut pineapples, you can also buy it pre-sliced fresh or frozen.
Follow the steps below to cut a whole pineapple:
You can add fresh pineapples to salads. Chopped pineapple can also be added to cottage cheese, ricotta, or yogurt.
Use frozen pineapples to make refreshing fruit or green smoothies. Bake or grill pineapple rings or add some of the chopped fruit into your favorite soups and stews.

For a newbie prepper, deciding which food items to stock up on can be overwhelming. If you’re not sure where to start, focus on stockpile staples like canned food, dried foods and nutritious items like sprout powders.
Starting your prepper stockpile before SHTF ensures that your family has access to shelf-stable, nutritious food when things go south and you can’t buy things at the grocery store. (h/t to WeLovePrepping.com)
Food prepping for emergency scenarios involves starting a supply of long-lasting food items and implementing proper storage techniques to preserve quality and prevent spoilage.

The tips below can help you get started:
When prepping food for SHTF scenarios, you must assess your family’s unique needs. Start by calculating the calories required per person based on age, health status and activity levels.
Next, determine the quantity and type of food items needed to meet those needs over a specific period, accounting for potential spoilage. Usually, you can do with a three to six-month supply. (Related: Stock up on nascent iodine to protect your thyroid from radioactive iodine in case of a nuclear emergency.)

You can find a variety of suitable prepper foods found at regular grocery stores.
Make the most of your prepping budget by purchasing nutritious, non-perishable items with long shelf lives like beans, canned meat and fish, honey, rice, salt and cooking oil.
Try to avoid foods requiring refrigeration or frequent rotation. When making a list of things to buy, choose items your family likes and doesn’t mind eating a lot of to avoid waste when it’s time to hunker down.
Consider the nutritional variety and calories and ensure that you maintain optimal health by stocking up on vitamins, supplements or sprout powders.
Starting a food stockpile can be expensive, but you can save some money by incorporating cost-effective options without sacrificing nutrition.
You can buy staple ingredients like beans, pasta and rice in bulk. Another option is to check sales and promos for canned or pouched chicken, salmon and tuna.
Learn how to forage so you can harvest berries, various greens and mushrooms for free. For a long-term option, start a home garden and grow organic fruits and vegetables.
When prepping food for long-term emergency situations, you should focus on shelf-stable items that can last a long time without refrigeration.
Here are some suggestions for your stockpile:
Canned foods like meats, soups, vegetables and fruits can last for years past their printed expiration date if stored properly. Prioritize high-acid foods like tomatoes that can last 18 months or even longer.
Low-acid foods like meats and vegetables can last for at least three to five years when canned.
Beans are another great item for your stockpile because they are full of protein and fiber. Stock up on dried black beans, chickpeas, lentils and pinto beans.
Dried beans will last indefinitely when stored in airtight containers.
You need fats like lard olive oil, shortening and vegetable oil for cooking and to help round out calories. Buy small bottles and rotate your stock to prevent spoilage.
Grains like oats and rice are cheap, long-lasting carb sources to stockpile.
Choose white rice over brown because the former has a longer shelf life. Store rice and grains in airtight containers.
Sprouts, which come from sprouting seeds like broccoli seeds, are also great for your stockpile because they are full of vitamins and minerals.
When dealing with a long-term SHTF scenario, having a reliable source of nutrients like sprouts ensures that you stay healthy.
To save time and money, you can stock up on sprout powders, a more convenient form of sprouts.
Broccoli sprouts are the newly sprouted seeds of the Brassica oleracea var. italica plant, a cruciferous vegetable related to wild cabbage. Despite their unassuming size, broccoli sprouts pack an impressive nutritional punch, which is why they are considered one of the world’s most nutritious vegetables.
Made from organic broccoli sprouts, Health Ranger Select Organic Broccoli Sprout Powder is vegan, non-GMO, non-China and is certified Kosher and organic.
Our premium formula for Health Ranger Select Organic Broccoli Sprout Powder contains no gluten, artificial sweeteners, colors, preservatives or other additives and is lab-tested for glyphosate, heavy metals and microbiology.

https://food.news/2024-03-13-florida-bill-banning-lab-grown-meat-desantis-signature.html,Florida bill BANNING lab-grown meat awaits Gov. DeSantis’ signature,"Advertisement
The Florida House on Wednesday, March 6, gave final approval to a wide-ranging bill that would ban cultured, or lab-grown, meat and local regulation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.
The Republican-controlled House voted 86-27 to approve SB 1084, with the bill finally ready to go to Governor Ron DeSantis. SB 1084 would make several modifications related to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS).
Democrats fixated on parts of SB 1084 that would ban the sale and manufacture of cultivated meat, which DeSantis has condemned as “fake meat,” and prevent local governments from regulating EV vehicle charging stations.

Rep. Lindsay Cross (D-St. Petersburg) claimed that both bans were meant to “stop innovation, put barriers on the free market and to lock [Florida] into existing frameworks.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Christine Hunschofsky (D-Parkland) insisted that the “food fight” section of SB 1084 “sends a bad message” to researchers and investors about lab-grown meat.
Hunschofsky added that the move could discourage manufacturers from working in Florida because “they don’t know what day of the week that the Legislature will be OK with them being in the state of Florida.”
House bill sponsor Danny Alvarez (R-Hillsborough County) said that there are still questions about the safety of lab-grown meat. He explained that selling cultivated meat needs to wait, adding that research over time could help confirm that “it is viable for consumption.”
He noted that the bill is being passed because they “know that Florida agriculture can hold us down and provide plenty of safe, quality beef and agricultural products.” Alvarez also said lab-grown meat is being banned in Florida to help protect consumers.
The measure, which passed the Senate early in March, would allow research into cultivated meat. Production involves a process of taking cultured cells from animals and growing them in controlled settings to produce food.
A potential research ban was removed from earlier versions of the bill due to worries that such a ban could affect the space industry, which is also considering the development of lab-grown meats for long-term space journeys.
Rep. Dean Black (R-Jacksonville) clarified that while it’s fine to develop “Moon meat” for astronauts, cattlemen like himself won’t support it. (Related: FDA approves lab-grown meat produced by Chinese firm linked to biowarfare program.)
“They can make it on the Moon and export it to Mars, and it’s fine to have Martian meat as well,” Black said, adding that he supported SB 1084 because you shouldn’t be able to buy lab-grown meat in Florida, or anywhere in the United States.
Under SB 1084, selling or manufacturing lab-grown meat will be considered a second-degree misdemeanor. Additionally, the bill would put oversight of EV charging stations under the FDACS, which regulates pumps at gas stations. Florida has at least 3,230 public charging stations in 44 of the 67 counties.
According to a staff analysis of the bill, electric cars made up at least three percent of cars sold in Florida from July 2020 to July 2021.
A 2021 state law already prohibits local governments from mandating such things as EV charging stations on gas retailers. That law was enforced after a move by Petaluma, California, to ban new gas stations with the intention of fast-tracking the shift to electric cars.

As a prepper, you can sleep better at night knowing that you have access to essential food supplies in case of disasters like blizzards or tropical storms.
Make sure your stockpile contains staples such as canned food, assorted spices and grains like beans and rice. If possible, stock up on food buckets to ensure your supplies last longer. (h/t to FCS.UGA.edu)
When SHTF, you need to eat balanced meals regularly to maintain your strength and stay healthy.
However, before you spend money on food supplies, you should first plan menus to include as much variety as possible. Don’t waste money on food that your family doesn’t like, but make sure you stock up on nutritious ingredients to ensure overall health when bugging in after SHTF.
When deciding what foods to stock, choose wisely. Think of the different ways you can cook with versatile items, and make a list of several ways to prepare it.
One approach to long-term food storage is to store bulk staples, such as beans and rice, together with different canned and dried foods.
To save money, buy things like salt, beans, corn and wheat. When stored properly and in sturdy containers, these items are fairly inexpensive and have nearly unlimited shelf life.
Bulk staples offer a limited menu, which is why you need to supplement them with air-dried or freeze-dried foods, packaged mixes and other supermarket goods.
Canned meats are ideal, along with other items like rice and various beans. You can also add ready-to-eat cereals, dried fruits, pasta mixes and rice mixes since they will add variety to your menus.
If you’re only starting your survival stockpile, start slow. Build your everyday stock of canned goods until you have extra supplies for a two-week to one-month supply.
Rotate your supplies periodically to maintain a supply of common foods that will not require special preparation, water, or cooking.
If you want to, buy commercially packaged, freeze-dried, or air-dried foods. Other options include stored meat or canned meats.

Make sure all dry ingredients or supplies are properly stored in sturdy containers and off the floor in clean, dry, dark places away from moisture. Foods will maintain their quality longer if you avoid any extreme changes in temperature and exposure to light. (Related: Emergency food prep: Stock up on manuka honey, a must-have survival food and barter item.)

If you want to stock up on bulk wheat, choose dark hard winter or dark hard spring wheat. Choose wheat with a #2 grade or with a protein content of 12 to 15 percent and moisture content that is less than 10 percent.
If wheat is not already stored in nitrogen-packed cans, store it in sturdy five-gallon food-grade plastic buckets or containers with tight-fitting lids.

Berries are a nutritious source of vitamins and minerals. If you don’t have a home garden, you can harvest wild berries once you learn how to forage safely. (h/t to BackdoorSurvival.com)
Wild berries are elusive and they only appear for a short period during the summer and fall. If you want to forage wild berries, remember that their period of perfect ripeness moves quickly to a state of over-ripeness, meaning you only have a few weeks of harvesting.

While fresh wild berries taste better than store-bought berries, they spoil faster so you have to use them quickly. (Related: 12 Wild summer edibles to harvest for your food stockpile.)
Blueberry/highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum)
Highland blueberries grow on a thin-branched shrub with glossy leaves. The plant also bears bell-shaped, usually white to light pink flowers that bloom in groups of five to ten.
The plants prefer acidic soil. Blueberry leaves are sometimes red, especially during autumn. The leaves are small and oval to lance-shaped.
Blueberries have a unique five-pointed star shape on the underside of each blueberry. Berries that fall off the plant are already ripe.
Unripe blueberries may appear green or red. Once they turn blue, wait several days before they’re at full ripeness.
Raspberry (Rubus strigosus, etc.)
Raspberries grow in sharp-prickled bushes and they taste tart and sweet.
Ripe raspberries are deep red and very sweet. Less than perfectly ripe berries are sour but edible.
When foraging for raspberries, look for spindly raspberry bushes along disturbed lots and roadsides, especially in dry soil.
Raspberry leaves are opposite and they grow in groups of three on the tips of the stems.
Wild Strawberry (Fragaria virginiana)
Wild strawberry is a creeper. The plant is often hidden, spreading close to the ground as fruits dangle from its low-lying vines.
Make sure you don’t miss wild strawberry patches by keeping an eye out for the vines and berries in the ground.
Wild strawberries look similar to commercial berries, but the former are smaller.
Wild strawberries bear white, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are toothed and appear in threes.
Wild berries look similar to false strawberries, which are also edible, but tasteless and dry.
False strawberries bear yellow flowers and the seeds rub off easily. These berries usually point up instead of dangling at the vine tips.


If you don’t have time to forage for berries, another option is to stock up on freeze-dried organic blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and bananas.
Organic blueberries are a close relative of cranberries, huckleberries, gooseberries and bilberries, and they are one of the most nutritious and antioxidant-rich fruits in the world.
Loaded with a variety of essential nutrients, Health Ranger Select Freeze-Dried Organic Whole Blueberries are an excellent healthy snack you can enjoy all year round. They have been carefully freeze-dried to preserve the taste, texture and nutrients of fresh produce without the use of any chemical preservatives.

Before disaster strikes, you need to make sure that your survival pantry or stockpile includes a variety of emergency drinks. (h/t to SurvivalFrog.com)
Aside from supporting proper hydration, your emergency drink should also be able to provide you with energy, nutrients and comfort when things go south.
Some beverages, like organic non-fat milk powder or drink mixes, can also be used for bartering in a long-term survival scenario.

Water
Water, which is essential for hydration, is a crucial supply for your beverage prepping pantry. After all, many prepper “beverages” and survival foods must be reconstituted with water before you can consume them.
For basic hydration, sanitation and cooking needs, you need at least one gallon of water per person per day. Store enough water so your family has enough if you’re worried about a long-term survival scenario.
Coffee
Stock up on coffee if you need a cup of joe every morning. Even if you don’t drink coffee, you can use it for bartering in a post-SHTF world.
If storage space is an issue and you don’t want to clutter your stockroom with cans of whole bean coffee and a coffee grinder, buy ground coffee and instant coffee. (Related: SHTF bartering must-haves: 13 Things that will be in demand after an EMP attack.)
Tea
Depending on the type you choose, tea can also be used as a source of caffeine and energy like coffee.
If you prefer energizing teas, choose black tea or green tea. For a calming cup of tea, buy an herbal tea like chamomile, which has soothing properties and can help promote relaxation during stressful survival events.
Powdered milk
Milk is a great source of calcium, protein and B-vitamins. This beverage is also versatile and can be used for drinking or baking.
However, it is also one of the first things to spoil when the power goes out.
Unless you have a dairy cow on your homestead, you’re better off having an ample supply of powdered milk. Powdered milk can last years, and you can use it to make dairy products like butter, yogurt, sour cream and cream cheese.
Powdered milk is also great for creamy sauces, dips and gravies.
Full of essential nutrients, organic milk is one of the world’s most nutritious beverages. This is especially true when milk comes from healthy cows raised under strict organic standards because they provide milk without toxic hormones or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) often found in conventional milk products.
But because fresh milk spoils quickly, it can be very difficult to store long-term in case of a food emergency. Fortunately, organic milk can be dried to significantly extend its longer shelf life.


Versatile, shelf-stable and cost-effective, Groovy Bee Organic Non-Fat Milk Powder is a highly nutritious beverage that belongs in your survival pantry.
This high-quality lab-verified milk powder can easily increase your daily intake of calcium, potassium, protein and other nutrients in any situation. Just add water to make a convenient healthy beverage or incorporate it into your other recipes for a nutritional upgrade.
Groovy Bee Organic Non-Fat Milk Powder is sourced from healthy cows that are ethically raised without the use of growth hormones, antibiotics or pesticides. It contains no added gluten or GMOs.
Groovy Bee Organic Non-Fat Milk Powder is also extensively lab-tested for glyphosate, heavy metals and microbiology. It is also non-China, certified Kosher and organic.
For a no-fuss way to enjoy organic non-fat milk powder, add four tablespoons of premium Organic Non-Fat Milk Powder to a glass of hot water. Stir well and drink it like regular milk.
Organic non-fat milk powder can also be used in a wide variety of recipes.
Try using it to make:

When finalizing your emergency preparedness plans, you should also spend time building your stockpile of survival supplies. It’s also best to get a variety of bartering items so you can get more supplies as needed in a post-SHTF world.
If you’re not sure what to stock up on, you can buy extra food supplies and versatile items like raw manuka honey, which offers several health benefits and has a long shelf life. (h/t to SurvivalFrog.com)
Bartering refers to the act of trading goods or services in exchange for others without using money as payment. When the grid goes down, even your prepping stockpile may run out of certain items, which is why bartering is a crucial part of your preps.

Think of stocking items to barter as one way to shock-proof your SHTF plans. If you need essential supplies and you have other things to barter with, trade for items that you don’t have in your stockpile.
If possible, try to stock up on items that you can easily make or produce so that you won’t run out of them. If this isn’t an option, you can also get items with the highest trade value, such as necessities that people can’t live without.
This includes essential bartering items such as:
However, all of these valued items, especially clean water and food, are also things that you may want to keep for your family. These items will quickly fly off the shelves after a large-scale disaster.
If you want to build a barter kit and stockpile certain items to trade, they need to last a long time. Small items like manuka honey are also great since you can store more of them. They are also easier to transport.
Follow these tips to ensure a safe transaction when bartering post-SHTF:
It’s often safer to barter with people you trust. Try to barter locally and barter items that are relevant to where you live.
Find out what your neighbors need and what they can offer.
Don’t announce that you have a survival stockpile in your garage. This is crucial if you have plans to barter with other people outside your community.
Bartering after a disaster means you should always be alert. Head to your location with a partner or a small group of people you trust so you have a backup plan in case things go south.
Don’t trade the same thing every time unless you’re dealing with someone you know and trust.
This helps prevent you from becoming known for one specific item, which can end up in people targeting you for your supplies.
Aside from common items like food and toiletries, make sure to stock up on manuka honey, one of the world’s most potent varieties of honey.
This shelf-stable survival food has many applications for daily use and emergencies, such as supporting the natural healing of minor cuts and burns, maintaining your natural energy levels, and even helping preserve food.
With its high levels of methylglyoxal (MGO), manuka honey has powerful immune-supporting properties and other health benefits. This means manuka honey is an ideal barter item when SHTF. (Related: Prepper medicine: How to make herbal cough syrup.)
Visit the Health Ranger Store to stock up on high-quality manuka honey products with verified NPA/MGO levels backed by lab testing.
Health Ranger Select Premium Manuka Honey MGO 514+ (15+ NPA) has an MGO rating of at least 514 and a non-peroxide activity (NPA) rating of at least 15. It is Halal-certified by trusted suppliers and harvested from Australia’s pristine bushlands and forests.
This premium manuka is also raw, non-China certified Kosher and has been extensively lab-tested for glyphosate, heavy metals and microbes. Supplies are limited, so stock up on high-quality manuka honey now, while supplies last.

The savory superfood miso is a functional food with several health benefits. But its health-supporting properties come from the fermentation process, not the soy itself.
Fermenting soy significantly changes its chemical properties, changing it from an estrogen-mimicking food to an anti-estrogenic food. The fermentation process used to create miso unlocks its full nutritional potential while improving its digestibility. (h/t to ThePrepared.com)
Before SHTF, stock up on long-term storable foods like organic miso to ensure that you have access to nutritious ingredients once the stores close.

There are two ways to add to your emergency food stockpile.
First, you can stock up on the non-perishable foods that you eat daily. This includes products that you can easily buy at the grocery store, like canned food or peanut butter.
Second, you can buy “survival” food that you don’t have to use until an emergency but could last much longer than supermarket food. (Related: Prepping tips: How to prepare a food storage starter kit.)
Whether you’re a newbie or an experienced prepper, it’s a good idea to add food from both categories so you have a wide variety of supplies to choose from once you’re facing a long-term disaster, like civil war.
If you’re not sure where to start, make a list of foods that meet the following basic criteria:
When SHTF, your body will need nutrients to ensure that you stay healthy. This means avoiding junk food and empty calories and focusing on nutritious ingredients like canned vegetables or miso.
When you’re dealing with an emergency, you might lose access to utilities or other items that make it easier to cook. This means food like organic miso soup powder is ideal since you can make soup for your family with boiling water and miso powder.
You can also stock up on other foods that can be eaten as-is, only need reheating or rehydrating, or are easy to pair with other ingredients.
If possible, try to stock up on freeze-dried food with a shelf life of several years.
But if this isn’t an option, you can be smart about picking long-lasting products, like organic miso powder. Avoid anything that doesn’t last at least one year in your prepping stockpile.
When buying supplies for your stockpile, it’s best to purchase items in durable packaging, like a can or box, instead of flimsier packaging like what you’d find with potato chips.
If you’re worried about the power going out, avoid food that needs to be cold or frozen.
Some foods will be more calorie dense than others. Consider this when buying supplies, especially if limited space is going to be an issue building up a pantry.
An emergency isn’t the time to be a picky eater, you can save money by avoiding foods that your family doesn’t like to eat a lot of.
Make sure to get alternatives for any family members with a dietary problem, like gluten or lactose intolerance.
Before disaster strikes, stock up on long-term storable food items like Health Ranger Select Freeze-Dried Organic Red and Yellow Miso Powders.
Made using only the highest-quality ingredients, these organic red and yellow miso powders offer the same nutritional benefits as regular miso but with a much longer shelf life.
They have been carefully freeze-dried to extend their shelf life and retain maximum freshness and nutritional quality. In a survival scenario, you can make a cup of nutritious and delicious soup within seconds by simply adding hot water.
Health Ranger Select Freeze-Dried Organic Red and Yellow Miso Powders contain no added gluten and are extensively lab-tested for glyphosate, heavy metals and microbiology.
They are also vegan, non-GMO, non-China and certified Kosher and organic. These premium red and yellow miso powders are available in convenient 100-gram pouches and long-term storable #10 cans (1300 grams).
Supplies are always limited for this product, so stock up now, while inventory lasts.

https://food.news/2024-02-13-king-charles-royal-doctor-supports-homeopathic-medicine.html,King Charles has entrusted his health to a royal doctor who supports HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE,"Advertisement
King Charles supports homeopathic medicine, and the monarch believes that there is “great value in complementary therapies.”
In 2022, he appointed Dr. Michael Dixon, 71, another staunch supporter of homeopathy, as the head of his royal medical household.
After Dixon’s appointment became public, Buckingham Palace released a statement announcing that the doctor thinks complementary therapies can “sit alongside conventional treatments, provided they are safe, appropriate and evidence-based.” (Related: 12 Potent ANTICANCER agents found in edible plants.)
According to Cancer Research U.K., some patients use complementary therapies to feel better, ease the side effects of several cancer treatments and improve their quality of life.
Some common examples of beneficial therapies include acupuncture, aromatherapy, herbal medicine, massage therapy, visualization and yoga.
Cancer Research U.K. also said: “A good complementary therapist won’t claim that the therapy will cure your cancer,” adding that they will “always encourage you to discuss any therapies with your cancer doctor or GP.”
Many health professionals also support patients with cancer using complementary therapies.
However, some may be reluctant for their patients to use them. They claim that this is because many therapies have not been tested in the same way as more conventional treatments. But Dixon has been vocal about his support for natural treatments like aromatherapy and reflexology on the National Health Service (NHS).
Naysayers insist that while alternative therapies are often used instead of medical treatment, there is no scientific evidence they can cure cancer.
Others also claim that these natural therapies may cause harmful side effects or interfere with other treatments.
Some examples of alternative therapies for cancer include laetrile (a plant substance), “shark cartilage supplements” and Gerson therapy, which involves following an organic vegetarian diet and having up to five coffee enemas a day.
King Charles has previously expressed his support for Gerson therapy, which involves drinking up to 13 glasses of fruit juice a day. In 2004, he told the Royal College of Gynecology that the therapy should be investigated for its “beneficial nature” instead of being dismissed.
The German doctor Max Gerson developed Gerson therapy in the 1920s and 30s. He said that it helped cure his migraine headaches.
He then went on to use it to treat other diseases such as tuberculosis and cancer. Gerson therapy is also known as the Gerson diet, Gerson regimen or the Gerson method.
Gerson therapy involves changes to your diet and nutrient intake. It aims to rid the body of toxins and strengthen your immune system.
Gerson therapy can help bring the body back to its normal metabolic state, allowing your body to heal itself.
The Gerson regime has three main parts:
Gerson therapists believe that people with cancer have too much salt (sodium) in their bodies compared to the amount of potassium.
People following Gerson therapy only eat organic, vegetarian food. The therapy also encourages followers to consume up to 13 glasses of fresh juices a day.
Consuming fresh juices can help restore the right balance and cleanse the liver.
Having up to five coffee enemas a day is also required in Gerson therapy. Practitioners believe that coffee enemas further help to excrete toxins from the liver and colon.
Additionally, taking certain supplements and enzymes can help the body eliminate cancer cells.

As a prepper, knowing how to protect your home from pests and rodents ensures that your survival stockpile lasts for a long time.
Keeping your home clean is also important for maintaining proper hygiene when SHTF. (h/t to TheSurvivalMom.com)
Pests are some of the biggest enemies of food storage. Keeping pests away from your food stockpile is crucial, especially if you don’t want to waste any of your hard-earned supplies.
Bugs
Bugs may hide in the long grass around your home. You can cut down their numbers by keeping the grass cut short.


Some types of bugs can die before maturing due to exposure to sunlight. Short grass allows the sunshine to kill them before they spread to your pantry.
Buy or borrow a push lawn mower and use it regularly to keep bugs at bay. If you live on a property with tall grasses and plants, use a machete to cut them down quickly.
Mosquitos
Mosquitoes are dangerous because they can multiply after laying their eggs in standing water.
Always remove or minimize any standing water on your property. Check around your yard and empty containers like buckets, trash cans or anything that could collect standing water.
Check all the screens in your windows and doors. Repair or replace screens that have holes.
Rats and mice
Rats and mice can carry 35 different diseases and they can be hard to keep out of a home.
Rodents only need a hole the size of a dime to squeeze through. Neither mice nor rats have a collarbone. This means if their head can fit through a hole, so can the rest of their body.
Rodents have sharp teeth and will gnaw through just about anything, even plastic food containers.
If you have rodents at home and you want to avoid using rat poison with harmful chemicals, try using traditional mouse traps. If you don’t want to kill them, get a no-kill catch-and-release trap.
Alternatively, you can adopt a pet cat or foster one so it can catch mice or rats for you.
Seal or cover any openings around your home and remove bushes and trees near your house so rodents can’t use them to access the roof and enter.
Termites
Termites eat constantly and in the spring, they will swarm and start looking for food in your home.
Termites like dark and damp rooms. If possible, treat termites by hiring a professional.
If you’re worried about termites after SHTF, protect and maintain the integrity of your shelter. Divert water away from your home and trim and cut back trees nearby to keep termites away. Make sure none of the roots or branches are touching your home. (Related: Food storage tips: Keep pests away from your food supplies with diatomaceous earth.)
You can keep most pests away from your home and stockpile by sealing all openings properly.
Inspect your foundation and look for any cracks. You should also check for gaps around windows, frames and doors. If possible, hire a professional to seal and double-check your home.
Stockpile some expanding insulation and rolls of thick metal screening. Use the insulation to seal small holes and reinforce the metal screening. Insulation can also help prevent rodents with sharp teeth from entering through the hole.
Check the following areas for any openings:
You can eliminate rodents and other pests by cutting off their access to food. Store food in sturdy, thick plastic or metal containers with tight-fitting lids.
Always clean outdoor grills, cooking spaces and spills. When you’re done cooking, wash the dishes and put leftover food away.
If you have pets, don’t leave their pet food or water bowls out overnight.
If you have a bird feeder, use a squirrel guard on it. Any other food for animals should be at least 100 feet away from your home. The farther away, the better.
If you have livestock, keep all animal feed in heavy plastic or metal containers. Elevate all trash cans, hay and woodpiles at least one foot above the ground.
Keep woodpiles as far away from your home as possible. Aim for at least 100 feet.
Clearing the property of old vehicles and equipment means that rodents won’t have access to spaces that they can live in. If you can prevent rodents from having nesting sites outside your home, you can decrease your chance of mice and rats trying to get inside your house.
If you’re having trouble with rats sniffing around your food stockpile, use snap traps.
Peanut butter is perfect for bait because it is sticky and won’t fall off if the trap is knocked over. Rodents will have to get very close, if not onto the trap, to eat the peanut butter.
You only need a 1/4 teaspoon of peanut butter on the trap to attract vermin. Read all the instructions before setting up your trap.
Place snap traps along the wall with the short end of the trap touching the wall. It should look like the letter “T.” Because rodents often run along the edges of walls, this placement will either get their attention with the peanut butter or snap them when they pass by.
However, rats and other rodents are cautious. It may take a week before they decide to approach your traps. Just be patient.
If you decide to use snap traps, place them in sheds or outbuildings you have on the property.
Try to avoid live traps and glue traps. When rodents get caught in them, they often become afraid and will urinate. Animal urine may contain germs. To minimize the risk of being exposed to disease, it is best to kill rodents before they urinate.
When dealing with a long-term survival scenario, you must know how to deal with annoying pests and rodents. Keep your home clean and store food properly to keep pests away from your property.

Food prices have gone up by at least 15 percent from October 2021 to October 2023. As a self-sufficient prepper, this means finding different ways to save on your grocery bills without sacrificing taste and nutrient value. If you don’t want to spend money, winter foraging is one way to add more supplies to your prepper pantry for free. (h/t to SimpleFamilyPreparedness.com)
There are many benefits of learning how to forage, such as getting free food in the form of wild edibles. Foraging can also be fun for the whole family. It’s also a good way to exercise, and foraging is one way to reconnect with nature.


And while foraging in winter seems harder compared to foraging in late summer, there are still plenty of wild edibles to harvest once you know where to look.
When SHTF, knowing how to forage year-round can also help you find food after the stores run out of supplies.
Winter is the hardest time to find wild food, but it’s not impossible. When you’re foraging, only harvest plants and mushrooms that you are sure are safe to eat. Don’t go foraging without taking some classes or reviewing reference materials to avoid poisoning yourself and your family if you make a mistake.
Avoid these dangerous mistakes by using detailed guides or signing up for foraging or survival classes. You can also forage with a more experienced prepper so they can teach you as you harvest.
Whether you’re winter foraging or hunting for wild edibles in spring or summer, you should always forage in a way that’s good for the environment. This means only taking what you need and leaving enough food for wildlife and future harvests.
Try following the rule of thirds. This means only taking a third, leaving one-third for the wildlife and leaving one-third to grow back or reproduce.
If you’re not sure where to start, harvest fruits, nuts and leaves. Nuts and fruits can generally be harvested in abundance without causing any harm. Meanwhile, roots, shoots and tubers require the proper understanding of plants and their life cycles to ensure a sustainable harvest.
Oak trees drop lots of acorns, and they’re one of the most overlooked wild edibles to forage in winter. You can find them on the forest floor or lurking beneath the snow cover around the base of the oak tree.
Once you get rid of the tannins, acorns can be turned into flour.
Beechnuts are tiny but full of flavor. You can eat them raw or roasted.
Beechnuts can be collected in the fall to use throughout winter. They’re full of fat and protein, making them a great snack when it’s cold.
Chickweed is a hardy winter plant that grows almost anywhere. It should be ready to harvest when the snow melts.
Chicory root has a strong, earthy flavor and can be used as a coffee substitute when roasted and ground.
Crabapples get sweeter and full of pectin as winter goes on and they are great in desserts, jellies and syrups.
Many crabapple varieties stay on the tree into winter, and the fruit gets sweeter with time.
Crabapples can survive cold temperatures better than regular apples and you can usually find them clinging onto their branches well into the winter season.
Wild cranberries can be foraged from late fall to early winter, especially in boggy areas. You can also find some under the snow in winter.
The berries are tart and add a vibrant flavor to dishes, from sauces to baked goods.
Daisy greens are a nutritious and edible wintergreen. They’re a bit bitter, like other leafy greens, and are great for winter salads.
Dandelions have edible leaves, roots and flowers.
In winter, dandelion leaves are milder. The leaves are great in salads or cooked like spinach.
Goosefoot or wild quinoa produces seeds that are a great alternative to expensive quinoa often sold in stores.
Goosefoot seeds are high in protein and can be used in various dishes, from stews to wraps.
Hop hornbeam trees produce nutty seeds. Pick these seeds and use them like you would grains or nuts in different dishes.
The seeds are great in bread or as cereal. Lightly toasting them brings out their flavor even more, so add them to give salads or homemade granola a natural crunch. (Related: Tips for responsibly and safely foraging and hunting for food.)
Jerusalem artichokes or sunchokes are tubers that you can dig throughout winter. They are nutty and sweet, and a versatile ingredient.
Roast Jerusalem artichokes to make a caramelized treat. You can also boil and mash them, or slice them raw into salads for some crunch. Jerusalem artichokes are delicious and a natural source of iron and potassium.
Nettles are a winter favorite, especially in milder climates.
Nettles are full of vitamins and minerals. You can use them like other tender greens once you cook them to remove the sting.
Use nettles for soups, stews or as steamed greens.
In winter, oyster mushrooms will grow on the sides of trees and are easy to spot because of their unique shape.
Oyster mushrooms are tender, slightly sweet and full of protein and vitamins. Serve oyster mushrooms sauteed, add them to various dishes like stir-fries, or use them to make creamy pasta sauces.
Pine nuts have a buttery flavor, especially when toasted. Add pine nuts to pasta, pesto or salads.
Pine nuts are also a good source of energy and healthy fats and they are a great addition to your winter diet. However, you should make sure you’re picking from trees that are safe to eat from.
Pine nuts are an early winter forage item because squirrels love them and will gather as many as they can find before winter sets in.
Purple dead nettle is easy to spot. Just look for its purple tops, even in winter.
Purple dead nettle is a little bitter but it mixes well with other greens.
Dry it out for homemade smoothies. You can also use purple dead nettle to make a healing salve that can help with inflammation and allergies.
Purple dead nettle can also be used to dye wool a beautiful spring green.
You can find watercress growing near streams and rivers.
Watercress adds a fresh, peppery flavor to any dish. You can often find it all year round and is high in nutrients.
Watercress is remarkably spicy, making it a great green for winter meals like soups and stews.
Like other common plants, wild violets are beautiful and a versatile ingredient. Wild violet leaves and flowers are edible and will add a lovely dash of color and a sweet, floral flavor to winter salads or desserts.
If you love to bake, use wild violet flowers for decorating cakes and other desserts. Use the heart-shaped leaves to add a mild, sweet taste to salad greens.
Learn how to forage so you can find wild edibles even in winter.

https://food.news/2024-01-29-farmer-protests-erupt-across-europe-green-policies.html,Farmer protests erupt across Europe over GREEN POLICIES that demand the obliteration of food production,"Advertisement
Agricultural workers in several European countries say that green policies and taxes are eating into their profits, with farmers calling for more government subsidies.
Farmer protests have sprung up in France, Germany and Romania ahead of the 2024 European Parliament election in June. The farmers’ demands vary in general, but they are all suffering from environmental reforms and need more government subsidies to offset their losses.
Over the past few days, mass protests in Southern France have forced the government to address farmers’ issues.


On Jan. 22, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal met with Arnaud Rousseau, the president of the National Federation of Agricultural Operators’ Unions (FNSEA).
Earlier, farmers warned that they would continue to block some motorways until Attal listened to their demands. The FNSEA has since announced that it will decide later in January whether it will call for nationwide action.
According to the farmers, the government’s eco-transition policies make national producers uncompetitive. This makes farms unprofitable and forces France to buy food products from countries where environmental standards are weaker.
The farmers are seeking better remuneration for their produce, less red tape and protection against cheap imports. Protesters are using their tractors to close down long stretches of road and slow traffic. Protest groups have also dumped agricultural waste at the gates of government offices.
The protests in France are a sign of discontent in agricultural heartlands across the European Union.
In Berlin, eco-activists stood alongside protesting farmers.
According to the farmers, they are fully supportive of environmentally friendly, genetically unmodified farming. However, they explained that they can only support organic farming methods if they have subsidies or, at least, fair prices set for their products.
Farmers in Germany have complained that the government has hesitated to enforce such measures even after they have forwarded their demands to Agriculture Minister Cem Ozdemir.
The farmers have been protesting on the streets of Germany since December 2023, when the federal government agreed on a budget canceling several decades-old farming subsidies and benefits. These could have saved German farmers more than 480 million euros ($521 million).
Later, Berlin decided to ease the effect of the plans by making the benefit cuts gradual.
The January protests in Germany highlight the deep frustration of the public with Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government, which came to power just over two years ago with a progressive, modernizing agenda but has been considered by many as “dysfunctional and incapable.”
Scholz’s government is struggling to resolve many issues and reconcile lofty aims, such as transforming Europe’s biggest economy to meet climate targets and investing in neglected infrastructure while also meeting Germany’s strict self-imposed rules on racking up debt.
Scholz has said that he recognizes the various concerns that go beyond cuts to tax breaks on farmers’ diesel fuel.
Joachim Rukwied, the head of the German Farmers’ Association (DBV), has explained that farmers are disappointed because they are being ignored “and they can’t understand why they should be further burdened in European competition.”
Rukwied added that the DBV will try to win over lawmakers in talks within the coming days, but he warned that there will still be smaller-scale “actions” by farmers to emphasize their point. (Related: German farmers: Ukraine’s accession to the EU would destroy family farming and flood markets with cheap crops.)
Other groups have sympathized with or joined in some German farmers’ demonstrations. The groups have included road transport and hospitality associations.
In Romania, farmers and truckers have been blocking main roads with their tractors and trucks for several weeks.
The farmers are demanding lower taxes and fairer subsidies. However, talks with the government have failed, and they’re continuing to protest.
Farmers are also upset over the growing cost of insurance for heavy machinery.
In a statement that was sent to media outlets by a local protest leader, protesters warned that they would continue protesting until they “see the first law approved that enforces solutions for as many of the problems” that they have pointed out.
These protests are not centrally coordinated, which has hindered negotiations with the coalition government, which then faces local, parliamentary, presidential and European elections later this year.
On Jan. 15, Agriculture Minister Florin Barbu and 10 farmer associations announced that they had reached an agreement on several demands, setting clear deadlines for meeting them.
But despite the ongoing talks, the protests have continued. Haulers were still in negotiations with transport and finance ministries.
The protesters have demanded a moratorium on loan repayments, faster subsidy payments and separate lines at border crossings and the Black Sea port of Constanta for EU lorries and trucks from outside the bloc, including Ukraine.

https://food.news/2024-01-23-russia-shipment-wheat-food-insecurity-mali-africa.html,"Russia sends another shipment of FREE WHEAT to help address food insecurity in Mali, Africa","Advertisement
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced on Jan. 17 that Mali has received 25,000 tons of humanitarian grain from Moscow.
Zakharova added that Russia would continue to help several African nations address socioeconomic hardships.
The shipment of grain was delivered through the port of Conakry in neighboring Guinea on Jan. 6 and handed over to the authorities of the landlocked West African country three days later, said Zakharova.
Zakharova added that the recent grain shipment was the fourth delivery of “much-needed Russian goods to the population on a free basis.” Overall, 50,000 metric tons of wheat and more than 22,000 metric tons of fertilizers had been transported to Mali through the Russian Ministry of Emergencies, with the first three shipments being received on June 7, June 18 and Dec. 6, 2023, according to Zakharova.
The deliveries are in fulfillment of Moscow’s pledge to provide food assistance to African nations facing food insecurity. The pledge is part of an agreement announced last summer by President Vladimir Putin at the Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg.
In 2023, Russian Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev said up to 200,000 tons of free wheat would be supplied to six African countries: Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic (CAR), Eritrea, Mali, Somalia and Zimbabwe. (Related: Globalists weaponize food and energy supply to pave the way for global “Holodomor.”)
Earlier in January, Igor Mozgo, Russia’s ambassador to Eritrea, unloaded 25,000 tons of food aid at the East African nation’s port of Massawa. Somalia received the same amount of wheat from Moscow last November.
Burkina Faso, where Moscow recently reopened an embassy, is also scheduled to receive a share of the humanitarian grains.
Alexey Saltykov, Moscow’s ambassador to the former French colony, told officials in Ouagadougou last December that supplies would arrive in “the coming days”
According to reports, a shipment bound for CAR has arrived in neighboring Cameroon and been milled into wheat flour before transfer to the former French colony.
Additionally, Zimbabwe is slated to receive a 25,000-ton grain cargo that arrived in Mozambique’s port of Beira later in January.
In December 2023, the United Nations (UN) reported that a record 49.5 million people are expected to go hungry in West and Central Africa alone because of a combination of conflict, so-called climate change and high food prices. The figure is four percent higher than in 2023.
According to a new regional food security analysis released by the UN World Food Program (WFP) and other humanitarian agencies, in coastal countries, the number of people facing acute hunger is predicted to reach 6.2 million in 2024, up 16 percent from 2023.
Margot Vandervelden, the WFP’s acting regional director for Western Africa, explained that acute hunger remains at record levels in the region. However, funding needed to address the issue “is not keeping pace.”
Vandervelden added that insufficient funding means those who are moderately hungry will be forced to skip meals and eat less nutritious food. This unfortunately puts them at risk of “falling back into crisis or emergency phases, perpetuating the cycle of hunger and malnutrition.”
The analysis also revealed that more than two out of three households in West and Central Africa cannot afford healthy diets. According to the analysis, the cost of a daily nutritious diet in the central Sahel countries Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger is 110 percent higher than the daily minimum wage in the region.
According to UN figures, Sahel countries are dealing with an Islamist insurgency that has displaced at least four million people from their homes and farms. The Democratic Republic of Congo also has several ongoing conflicts that have displaced nearly seven million people.
The Sahel crisis has forced people to seek refuge in neighboring coastal countries such as the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Togo, which is struggling with its worst economic crisis in a generation.
Ollo Sib, a senior research adviser for the WFP, said almost 80 percent of people who are currently in a difficult food situation are in areas affected by conflict. Sib also advised that without intervention, the situation could worsen in certain areas as more than 2.6 million people were at risk of falling into famine.

https://food.news/2024-01-23-israel-palestine-war-brings-famine-at-incredible-speed.html,"UN official: Israel-Palestine war brings FAMINE at incredible speed, leaving hundreds of thousands starving in Gaza","Advertisement
According to Martin Griffiths, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, the Israel-Palestine war in Gaza has brought famine with “such incredible speed.”
Griffiths said that a “great majority” of 400,000 Gazans characterized by UN agencies as at risk of starving are already living in famine conditions. He also lamented that the famine was an “extraordinary and wholly unwelcome aspect of the Gazan war.”
Griffiths lamented that the ongoing war has brought famine with incredible speed “to the front of the lines.” Those caught in the crossfire are suffering because while some want to help, aid has been trickling very slowly into Gaza from two border crossings in the south. Agencies have also warned that it is only a fraction of what the people need.
Early in January, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that Israel had denied critical supplies from entering northern Gaza. However, Israel countered by accusing the UN Palestine Refugee Agency (UNRWA) of not doing enough and “stalling” the progress.
Griffiths said that it is still difficult to provide humanitarian aid to the 300,000 Gazans who remain in the northern part of the Strip, where much of the fighting is ongoing. He explained that it’s not just a matter of the number of trucks that can get in.
Griffiths also brought up many roadblocks stopping aid, such as unreliable “deconfliction of access routes” and civilians having to move from one place of insecurity to another. He warned that if people cannot rely on deconfliction of access routes and if hospitals keep getting attacked, humanitarian aid deliveries will continue to be a challenge. (Related: Israel weaponizes food supply as almost 600,000 people go hungry in Gaza.)
The Gaza Health Ministry reported that more than 24,000 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 60,000 others injured since Oct. 7.
On the other hand, the UN has reported that almost 90 percent of Gaza’s pre-war population has been displaced due to Israel’s persistent bombing, which has caused widespread devastation and forcing Gazan civilians to live with the threat of imminent death either by airstrike, starvation or disease.
Griffiths said that the dire humanitarian situation in the enclave could create “generational hatred.” He added that the UN worries for the security of both Israel and Gaza.
On Jan. 14, UN agencies issued a joint appeal for greater aid access to Gaza, saying that “a fundamental step change in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza is urgently needed.”
The heads of the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Program (WFP)  and the World Health Organization have said that getting enough supplies into and across Gaza depends on several factors, such as the opening of new entry routes, more trucks being allowed through border checks every day, fewer restrictions on the movement of humanitarian workers and guarantees of safety for all those accessing and distributing aid.
Cindy McCain, WFP head, lamented that people in Gaza are at risk of dying of hunger when they are only miles from trucks transporting food. She added that every hour lost puts many innocent lives at risk. McCain added that famine can be prevented, but only if those giving and distributing aid can quickly deliver sufficient supplies and have safe access to people in need.
Back in December, the WFP warned that the “catastrophic hunger crisis” in Gaza, which already threatens to overwhelm the population, will only get worse as the war continues.
Salwa Tibi, a 53-year-old aid worker and mother of four in Gaza, recently told reporters that her children are “screaming all day from hunger.”
As heavy rains, winds and cooler temperatures descend on Gaza from November to February, aid workers and civilians trying to survive constant bombings said that they are suffering from harsh living conditions, insufficient access to warm clothing and outbreaks of disease in overpopulated makeshift shelters.
Food, fuel and water remain scarce, and the price of what little supplies remain are increasing.
Shadi Bleha, a 20-year-old student who was displaced from northern Gaza to Rafah near the border with Egypt, said that adults ration their meals so that children do not go hungry. Bleha, who eats one meal a day, has seen many people starving.
The Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification (IPC) has reported that the entire population of Gaza, which includes at least 2.2 million people, is facing high levels of acute food insecurity or worse. At least one in four households is facing catastrophic conditions.
The IPC added that it is the highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity the initiative has ever classified for any given area or country.
Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director, said that children at high risk of dying from malnutrition and disease require immediate medical treatment, clean water and sanitation services. Unfortunately, the conditions on the ground do not allow aid workers to safely reach children and families in need.
According to UNICEF, Gaza’s 350,000 children under the age of five are especially vulnerable. The agency warned that in the coming weeks, child wasting, which is the most life-threatening form of malnutrition in children, could affect at least 10,000 children.
Russell said that some of the material aid workers “desperately need to repair and increase water supply” are still restricted from entering Gaza. She added that the situation must soon be resolved because the lives of children and their families are hanging in the balance.
However, the agencies echoed Griffiths’ warning that humanitarian aid alone cannot fight the worsening hunger among Gaza’s population.
Phillipe Lazzarini, Commissioner General for the UNRWA, warned that commercial supplies are essential to allow the markets and private sector to re-open and provide an alternative to food accessibility to those in Gaza.

https://food.news/2024-01-12-mjn-voluntarily-recalls-batches-nutramigen-powder-contamination.html,Mead Johnson Nutrition voluntarily recalls batches of Nutramigen Powder due to contamination,"Advertisement
Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN), a company acquired by Reckitt Benckiser Group, is voluntarily recalling select batches of Nutramigen Powder from the U.S. market. A product recall was issued because of the possibility of contamination with Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria in products sampled outside the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced.
Nutramigen Powder, a specialty infant formula for the dietary management of Cows Milk Allergy (CMA) that is sold in 12.6- and 19.8-ounce cans, underwent extensive testing by MJN and tested negative for the bacteria, reported the FDA.
The agency said the Nutramigen containers were manufactured in June 2023 and distributed primarily in June, July and August.
The FDA said based on the limited availability of the remaining stock of this special infant formula, it is believed that much, if not all, of the products recalled in the U.S. have already been consumed. The agency said there are no reports of illnesses or adverse events to date.
Reckitt Benckiser said all the recalled products have the “Use By Date” of January 1, 2025. The company asked customers to dispose of the products if they belonged to the recalled batches.
Reckitt Benckiser claimed that no other U.S.-distributed Nutramigen batches or other Reckitt products were affected by the recall. (Related: FDA warns 3 baby formula makers over violations of food safety standards.)
Cronobacter bacteria can cause severe, life-threatening infections or meningitis. Cronobacter infection can also cause bowel damage and may spread through the blood to other parts of the body.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned that it can also cause “often fatal meningitis” in young infants.
Cronobacter bacteria will usually infect those that are very young, particularly infants born prematurely.
Even though this infection is treatable with antibiotics, death occurs in at least 40 percent of those who develop meningitis because of underlying risk factors and complications.
According to the FDA, this bacteria is naturally found in the environment and can exist on almost any surface. The bacteria can also survive in dry foods, like herbal teas, powdered infant formula, powdered milk and starches.
Despite these serious complications, it is estimated that only 18 cases of invasive C. sakazakii occur each year in the U.S., most of which happen because of the contamination of infant feeding products and equipment.
While this bacteria can cause serious harm, Dr. Anna Morad, Director of the Newborn Nursery and Associate Professor of Academic General Pediatrics at the Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt in Tennessee, said people must keep in mind “that this is not a common infection.”
The infection does not cause illness for older children and healthy adults, but it can cause illness in young infants who are under three months of age or those with a weakened immune system, said Morad.
Because young infants are usually affected by this bacteria, detection can sometimes be difficult. Parents should note that many symptoms may start with excessive crying, fever, poor feeding and low energy. In more severe cases, some infants may develop seizures because this bacteria can infect the brain and the fluid within the spinal cord.
Cronobacter is the same bacteria that caused the shutdown of Abbott Nutrition’s infant formula plant in 2022.
Because C. sakazakii can survive on many surfaces, it can enter factories or homes simply from one’s hands by not washing. The bacteria can also spread through the soles of shoes.
It is believed that in factories C. sakazakii can contaminate formula powder if the powder touches a contaminated surface or questionable ingredients were used to make the formula.
If you have an infant at home, prevent the spread of the bacteria with the proper sterilization of bottles, utensils, or other breast pump accessories. Thorough hand washing and using clean water to mix the formula can help protect against infection.
Prevention is key to minimizing the risk of Cronobacter infection.
The CDC recommends using a ready-to-feed formula for infants under two months old, babies born prematurely, or infants with a weakened immune system.
Taking extra steps at home will help prevent Cronobacter infection. For example, you can boil water to at least 158 F, let it cool and then use that to mix with powdered formula.
In the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency said that due to the widespread presence of C. sakazakii in the environment, caregivers of infants must follow proper and thorough hygiene, preparation and storage practices, and learn steps to protect infants from Cronobacter infection.
Morad warned parents that Cronobacter bacteria can also be found on breast pump parts and bottles so it is important to thoroughly clean these things.
To reduce transmission, Morad recommended proper hand washing with soap and water before preparing bottles, milk, or meals.
While there are many cleaning products on the market, you can also use alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol as an alternative.
Even though Cronobacter bacteria can cause serious illness in infants, Morad advised parents to be careful with their formula preparation, “but not overly worried as this infection is a rare occurrence.”
Practice thorough hand washing and cleaning techniques to protect children and young infants from Cronobacter bacteria, especially if they have a weakened immune system.

https://food.news/2024-01-02-california-first-fully-autonomous-ai-powered-restaurant.html,California welcomes world’s first fully autonomous AI-powered restaurant,"Advertisement
The world’s first fully autonomous restaurant controlled and operated by robots that prepare and serve the food has been officially launched in Pasadena, California.
The restaurant is CaliExpress by Flippy, derived from a partnership with Cali Group, a holding company that uses technology to transform the restaurant and retail industries. The collaboration also includes Miso Robotics, the creator of Flippy, the world’s first AI-powered robotic fry station, and PopID, a technology company that simplifies ordering and transactions with biometrics.
CaliExpress by Flippy will use the most advanced systems in food technology, with both grill and fry stations fully automated and powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.
Restaurant guests can watch their food being cooked robotically after checking in with their PopID accounts on self-ordering kiosks to get personalized order recommendations. The PopID accounts can also be used to pay for orders It’s a contactless facial recognition payment system that allows customers to pay for their items using just their faces.
The new CaliExpress by Flippy restaurant is located in Pasadena, California on the northwest corner of Green Street and Madison Avenue at 561 E. Green St. (Related: SMASHING the AI threat matrix – How human resistance defeats Skynet.)
According to a press release, CaliExpress by Flippy will use these various technologies “to deliver freshly made burgers based on a wagyu blend at price points competitive with other premium burgers using standard meat.”
The restaurant uses a unique grill robot that grinds high-quality beef in real-time after the order is placed, resulting in a burger patty that melts in the mouth.
Flippy, the robotic fry station, will then serve crispy, hot fries made from top-grade potatoes that are cooked for exact times. The menu is very simple and customers can order burgers, cheeseburgers and fries.
The CaliExpress by Flippy kitchen will still be run by a much smaller crew. The press release added that the smaller crew will receive above-average wages.
John Miller, CEO of PopID and board member of Miso Robotics, said that CaliExpress by Flippy “is the world’s first operating restaurant where both ordering and every single cooking process are fully automated.”
The combination of these different technologies to create the most autonomous restaurant in the world is the product of “years of research, development, and investment in a family of revolutionary companies.”
The CaliExpress by Flippy location will also be a pseudo-museum experience presented by Miso Robotics.
The museum will feature dancing robot arms from retired Flippy units, experimental 3D-printed artifacts from past development, photographic displays and more exhibits. The CaliExpress by Flippy museum is designed to inspire the next generation of kitchen AI and automation entrepreneurs.
Other restaurants are also experimenting with AI technology, with some using AI to design new menu options and flavors.
Some local restaurants are testing generative AI technology, and several establishments think their tests are exceeding expectations.
Greg Tierney, the owner of Motor City Pizza, a Detroit-style pizzeria in Lewisville, Texas, said AI has enhanced his menu. According to Tierney, one of his regular customers had an idea for a new pizza. The customer got the recipe from AI by using standard pizza ingredients, and then suggesting ideas like “Mexican street-corn pizza” to the AI.
Chat GPT then produced an initial recipe.
Tierney explained that the customer made several adjustments, such as making the recipe more savory and adding protein. The AI then produced the recipe for “Winston’s Elote.”
The Winston’s Elote pizza is a blend of ingredients like chicken, jalapenos, onions, red peppers and roasted corn on a Detroit-style crust. The AI-developed pizza is then topped with queso fresco and cilantro, and drizzled with a tangy cream and hot sauce.
Tierney noted that Winston’s Elote is now a permanent item on their menu and that customers love it.

https://food.news/2024-01-02-herb-honey-7-home-remedies-for-cough.html,Herbs and honey: 7 Natural home remedies for a cough,"Advertisement
Parents often give cough medicine to sick children, but they’re not that effective. This is bad news for the more than 30 million people who consult a doctor every year because of a cough.
If you or someone in the family has a cough, try natural remedies like honey or herbal teas instead.
But if cough medicines don’t work, why do people spend billions of dollars annually on over-the-counter (OTC) products to get rid of a cough?
According to Dr. Norman Edelman, a senior scientific advisor at the American Lung Association, people with a cough are often desperate to get some relief.
According to Edelman, there isn’t “good evidence that cough suppressants and expectorants help with the cough.” Worse, many cough syrups on the market contain harmful ingredients, such as artificial colors or flavors and sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup.
Did you know that coughing is therapeutic?
Coughing is the body’s way of trying to eliminate mucus or foreign materials from your lungs and upper airway passages. You also cough as a reaction to something that is irritating your airway.
A cough is a symptom, not a disease. When you find out the underlying cause, you can better deal with a cough.
A productive cough produces mucus or phlegm. It’s best not to suppress this type of cough because you want to clear the mucus or phlegm.
Productive coughs are often associated with viral illnesses like the common cold, lung or upper airway infections (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia or sinusitis), postnasal drip, chronic lung diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), gastroesophageal reflux disease and smoking.
Meanwhile, nonproductive coughs can occur with the common cold, allergies, asthma, bronchospasm, the use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (such as captopril, enalapril or lisinopril) and exposure to environmental irritants.
While people of all ages can get a cough, parents often worry when children start coughing.
If you have young kids at home, keep these tips in mind before giving them cough medicine:
Don’t give cough or cold medication to a child younger than two years old. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding cough or cold medicine in children younger than six years old.
Most of the time, giving your child cough medicine won’t make the cough go away faster than if you did nothing at all. Edelman explained that the medicine has little to do with a cough disappearing, which it will usually do on its own.
Cough medicine may cause different side effects. For example, the OTC drug dextromethorphan can cause confusion, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting. Guaifenesin may cause side effects like nausea and vomiting.
If you give cough medicine to a child older than two, never give more than one drug with the same active ingredient, such as a decongestant or pain reliever. This may cause an overdose.
Never give children antibiotics for a cough because they won’t work. If you give a child antibiotics, it can lower his or her resistance to future infections.
The same guidelines apply to adults, with age adjustments.
There hasn’t been a new effective development in cough treatments for more than half a century. Research has been conducted to provide proof that common OTC drugs sold to treat coughs, such as dextromethorphan and guaifenesin, are effective.
However, these studies haven’t proven that cough medicines do work. Instead, the results have revealed that there is no proof that they do.
Instead of risking your health with conventional cough medicine, try these natural remedies that aren’t linked to dangerous side effects.
Fenugreek is a culinary and medicinal herb that can be used as a tea and as a gargle to soothe your throat and cough.
Fenugreek is bitter so try adding a bit of honey to your cup of tea. Let the tea cool before gargling.
One study published in the Journal of Herbal Pharmacotherapy has revealed that a mixture of eight herbs (anise, black seed, caraway, cardamom, chamomile, fennel, licorice and saffron) provided significant improvements in cough intensity and frequency among people with allergic asthma.
Drinking tea alone or with lemon and honey can help soothe a productive and nonproductive cough.
Aside from the herbal teas already mentioned, other teas that can help relieve a cough include:
Young children are more likely to enjoy the taste of orange, lemon or peppermint tea.
Honey is ideal for children two years and older and adults.
In one study, researchers worked with 105 young volunteers ages two to 18. The researchers compared honey with no treatment and honey-flavored dextromethorphan to study its effect on coughing during the night and sleep quality.
Parents of the volunteers rated honey as providing the best symptomatic relief.
To treat a cough, add organic honey or fresh lemon juice to herbal tea. Instead of honey, give agave syrup to children younger than one year.
If you don’t like peppermint tea, you can still benefit from the menthol in peppermint vapors.
Add four to five drops of peppermint oil to eight ounces of hot water in a shallow bowl. Drape a towel over your head and inhale deeply. Breathe in the soothing vapors for several minutes.

Marshmallow (Althaea officinalis) is an ancient remedy for cough and sore throat. The herb contains a substance called mucilage that helps soothe the throat.
Dried marshmallow leaves may be used in fluid extracts, infusions, teas and tinctures. Marshmallow roots are available dried, peeled or unpeeled in capsules, creams, cough syrups, extracts (dry and fluid), ointments and tinctures.
Marshmallow is not recommended for young children.
Probiotics are beneficial bacteria in your gut. While they don’t reduce coughing directly, they have a significant impact on the bacterial population in your gut.
Probiotics can support your immune system and this can be beneficial if you have a cold and cough.
Slippery elm (Ulmus fulva) has been used in the past as a traditional as an oral herbal remedy for cough, diarrhea, sore throat and stomach problems.
Like marshmallow, slippery elm contains mucilage that helps soothe the throat.
To treat a cough, look for slippery elm tea or lozenges that are both made from the herb’s inner bark.
If you’re sick, avoid conventional cough medicines. Instead, try natural remedies like herbal tea or a fenugreek gargle.

https://food.news/2023-12-20-apple-cider-vinegar-recipe-boost-immune-health.html,Natural healing: A warming apple cider vinegar recipe that helps boost your immune health,"Advertisement
Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a popular superfood ingredient for beverages, salad dressings and pickled foods. It is also often used as a natural ingredient for non-toxic cleaning solutions.
This winter, you can also use apple cider vinegar to make a natural remedy that offers several health benefits, such as promoting digestive health and boosting your immune system.
Detailed below is a recipe from herbal medicine educator Erica Kuo, who shares that taking the apple cider vinegar mixture can help you boost your immune health this winter.

Apple cider vinegar is made by fermenting apple juice. ACV is a popular ingredient for natural health remedies.
According to Kuo, apple cider vinegar contains yeast that can help suppress appetite. Combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise, incorporating apple cider vinegar into your routine can help you achieve your weight management goals. (Related: Prepper essentials: The many survival uses of vinegar.)
During winter, use superfoods like honey, apple cider vinegar and warming spices and herbs to create an immune-boosting tonic.
In the West, this herbal tonic is often called oxymel. The ancient Greek word “oxymeli” translates to “acid and honey.” Oxymel is an herbal extraction of vinegar and raw honey.
Below is Kuo’s personal recipe for a spicy apple cider vinegar mixture.
Ingredients:
Preparation:
How to use:
Combining raw apple cider vinegar, which offers unique health benefits, with other superfoods like honey, is a great way to enjoy the benefits of both.
You can also make ACV oxymel to extract and ingest supportive herbs, especially pungent ones that aren’t always pleasant to take on their own.
Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) promotes gastric acid secretion and appetite. When a cold or fever sets in, horseradish can help induce sweating and improve respiratory and urinary infections.
Chili pepper supports heart function, especially irregular or weak heartbeat, poor blood circulation and cold limbs. Chili peppers also help invigorate the body and can promote gastrointestinal digestion and increase gastric secretion.
Ginger warms the stomach and intestines, promotes blood circulation, improves cold hands and feet in winter, enhances immune health and strengthens the body’s anti-inflammatory function.
It can also help induce sweating, reduce fever, and relieve nausea caused by certain food smells. Additionally, ginger can promote healthy bowel function.
Onions and garlic are rich in beneficial flavonoids and polyphenols, of which allicin is the most important component. Both have antiviral, antioxidant, immune health-boosting and anti-inflammatory effects.
American or Korean ginseng can help activate blood circulation and enhance the body’s resilience during stressful situations.
Aside from the ingredients used in the recipe above, some herbalists may recommend adding other medicinal herbs such as rosemary, thyme or turmeric.
Rosemary can help stimulate healthy blood circulation and support optimal brain function. Because it promotes intracranial blood circulation, recent studies suggest that rosemary, like sage, can help prevent Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, memory loss, loss of smell and vision loss.
Rosemary also helps boost digestive health and relieves flatulence, dizziness, headaches and fever.
Thyme can boost your immune system and has antibacterial and antimicrobial effects.
Turmeric is a natural “cleansing” ingredient that can purify the blood, aid metabolism and promote liver health. The spice can also help relieve fever, cramps and menstrual pain.
Kuo warns that if you have low blood pressure, you should reduce your consumption of garlic and onions.
If you have hypertension (high blood pressure), add cinnamon to spicy apple cider vinegar to boost its flavor and sweetness. Cinnamon and garlic can prevent blood coagulation, so skip the cinnamon and garlic if you are taking anticoagulants.
If you don’t have horseradish, replace it with turmeric.
You should avoid apple cider vinegar if:

https://food.news/2023-12-06-research-nutrient-beef-milk-kill-cancer-cells.html,Research suggests nutrient from meat and dairy can help KILL cancer cells,"Advertisement
According to a study published in Nature Journal, a nutrient found in both dairy and meat products may help protect against cancer by killing cancer cells.
Researchers from the University of Chicago also reported that the nutrient showed promise for use in cancer treatments.
While conducting the study, the research team looked for compounds that could activate a group of immune cells called CD8+ T, which are known to kill cancerous or virally infected cells.
The researchers discovered that a nutrient called trans-vaccenic acid (TVA) was able to boost the ability of CD8+ T cells to infiltrate tumors and potentially kill cancer cells. TVA is a long-chain fatty acid found in meat and dairy products from grazing animals like cows and sheep.

Additionally, the study showed that cancer patients with higher TVA levels circulating in their blood responded better to immunotherapy. This indicated that TVA shows promise as “a nutritional supplement to complement clinical treatments for cancer.”
In the human body, only 20 percent of the TVA is broken down into other byproducts and the remaining 80 percent circulates in the blood.
The research team used TVA while experimenting on mice. For the study, the mice were fed a diet rich in TVA. Data revealed that the TVA “significantly reduced the tumor growth potential of melanoma and colon cancer cells compared to mice fed a control diet.”
The researchers also found that the TVA diet helped boost the ability of CD8+ T cells in mice to infiltrate tumors. TVA inactivates a receptor on the surface of CD8+ T cells, then activates a cellular signaling process involved in cellular growth, differentiation and survival.
Mice with the receptors of CD8+ T cells removed lacked improved tumor-fighting ability. The researchers also studied leukemia cells and found that TVA could help enhance “the ability of an immunotherapy drug to kill leukemia cells.”
Jing Chen, one of the senior authors of the study, said it was “amazing and intriguing” to observe how a single nutrient like TVA “has a very targeted mechanism on a targeted immune cell type, with a very profound physiological response at the whole organism level.”
Even though the study suggests TVA has potential as a dietary supplement in cancer treatments, Chen advised against focusing too much on the food source.
He explained that because research suggests that a diet with too much red meat or dairy can have adverse effects on overall health, the study should not be taken as an excuse to follow an unhealthy diet and consume a lot of fast food like cheeseburgers or pizza.
Chen added that the focus should be on using TVA nutrient supplements and learning more about the optimized amount to be used in treating cancer. He also suggested that there could be other nutrients that would potentially be able to perform the same function as TVA. (Related: STUDY: Carotenoid in brown seaweed has potent anticancer properties.)
“There is early data showing that other fatty acids from plants signal through a similar receptor, so we believe there is a high possibility that nutrients from plants can do the same thing,” said Chen.
The research team also spoke of their plans to build a more comprehensive library of nutrients circulating in the human body to learn how they affect immunity and other biological processes.
An earlier study also revealed a potential positive impact of TVA on cancer. Researchers reviewed the impact of TVA on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a cancer that occurs in the nasopharynx located behind the nose and above the throat.
The results showed that TVA “significantly inhibited cell proliferation” of the NPC cancer cells. The study authors suggested that using TVA could offer an advantage in treating the illness.
In an earlier study from 2014, scientists reported that TVA exerted a “direct anti-carcinogenic effect” on human breast cancer cells.
The recent TVA study follows other significant scientific breakthroughs in the last few years concerning cancer research.
In October 2023, researchers from the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center in Sacramento, California, reported that they discovered a biological “switch” that could make cancer cells destroy themselves.
Through a UC Davis news release the research team reported that CD95 receptors (Fas) are called death receptors. “These protein receptors reside on cell membranes. When activated, they release a signal that causes the cells to self-destruct,” the researchers explained.
On the other hand, researchers from Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) discovered that a flavonoid in licorice root could inhibit the progression of pancreatic cancer. The HKBU researchers also said the chemical may boost the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs used to treat the illness.
The American Cancer Society (ACS) warns that cancer is the second most common cause of death in the U.S. and that it is exceeded only by heart disease.
According to the ACS, more than 1.9 million cancer cases will be diagnosed in the country in 2023. The organization expects an estimated 609,820 deaths this year, which comes to around 1,670 deaths per day.
To reduce your cancer risk, avoid harmful habits like smoking. Following a balanced diet and eating a variety of nutritious foods can also help protect against cancer.

https://food.news/2023-11-29-nutmeg-versatile-protects-against-free-radical-damage.html,"Spice up sweet and savory dishes with nutmeg, a versatile spice that can help protect against free radical damage","Advertisement
While nutmeg isn’t as popular as cinnamon, this spice is also used to add flavor to cakes, cookies or a warm cup of eggnog.
Nutmeg is a versatile ingredient that can be used for both sweet and savory goods. It offers health benefits and contains antioxidants that can protect against free radical damage.
Nutmeg comes from Myristica fragrans, a tropical evergreen tree indigenous to the Banda Islands in the Moluccas (Spice Islands) of Indonesia.

It’s unclear exactly when nutmeg was first discovered, but experts say that as early as the 6th century A.D., nutmeg has been traded in the Greek colony of Byzantium, which was later known as Constantinople — now modern-day Istanbul.
It’s believed that the spice traveled as far as Rome, where it was sold as a flavoring and was known for its health benefits and effectiveness as an aphrodisiac. (Related: Keep well this winter with these warming spices packed with health benefits.)
Nutmeg is a great spice to have in your kitchen because it can be used in a wide variety of recipes. Nutmeg has a warming, slightly nutty flavor that’s also perfect for beverages like mulled wine and chai tea. Nutmeg can be used on its own or paired with other spices like cardamom and cinnamon.
Nutmeg goes well with cakes, cookies, gingerbread and muffins. You can use it to make desserts like nutmeg cheesecake, cinnamon sugar pull-apart bread, cinnamon nutmeg scones or spice Bundt cake. Nutmeg can also be added to savory dishes like curry.
Nutmeg is usually sold in its ground form. But if you prefer whole nutmeg, try visiting larger supermarkets that may sell them. Whole nutmeg should not smell, so if you can smell any mustiness do not buy it.
Here are some of the benefits of using nutmeg:
Nutmeg seeds are tiny, but they are full of plant compounds that act as antioxidants in your body.
Several studies have looked into the organic antioxidants from dietary plants as they can protect cells from oxidative stress caused by harmful free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells and their components.
Research has found that nutmeg is a powerful antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiseptic and antibacterial agent that can support skin health and function.
When mixed into a cream, nutmeg helps reduce inflammation and irritation of the skin while promoting hydration.
Nutmeg is also considered an aphrodisiac. The Hindus believed that a pinch of nutmeg could improve sexual desire and performance.
While there is no specific human evidence of this, it is widely known that a bit of nutmeg can improve male libido.
Research suggests that nutmeg oil has antiseptic properties that can inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria.
When consumed in small doses, nutmeg is considered safe. However, large doses could trigger adverse effects.
Nutmeg contains two compounds called myristicin and safrole which, when ingested in large quantities, can cause you to hallucinate and lose muscle coordination.
While there are no specific guidelines on how much nutmeg you should consume per day, it is recommended that you do not exceed one to two milligrams a day. Studies show that toxic reactions occur when nutmeg is taken at five grams and above.
Purchase clean, organic nutmeg and use it to make hot chocolate or delicious desserts for the family.

Sweet potatoes are nutrient-rich, with a sweet yet earthy flavor profile. This superfood is a great source of nutrients like dietary fiber and vitamins A and C.
One large sweet potato (180 grams (g)) provides 162 calories, 3.6 g of protein, 37 g of carbohydrates and 0.2 g of fat. It also contains the following nutrients:
Sweet potatoes are filling and provide plenty of health benefits. Here are some of the benefits of adding sweet potatoes to your diet:

The anthocyanins in sweet potatoes have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce heart disease risk. Studies show that purple sweet potato extract can suppress the activities of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Meanwhile, the fiber in sweet potatoes has been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels. Their high potassium content can also help keep blood pressure normal.
Several studies have found that consuming flavonoids from foods like purple sweet potatoes can reduce the risk of heart disease. The alkaloids, anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids and tannins in sweet potatoes can also minimize serum creatinine and lactate-dehydrogenase activity, which is beneficial for your heart.
Sweet potatoes are a great source of beta-carotene, which is essential for eye health.
One cup of sweet potatoes provides 11.3 mg of beta-carotene. Beta-carotene can protect against age-related macular degeneration (AMD), especially when combined with vitamin C, copper and zinc.
The anthocyanins in sweet and pigmented potatoes have also been shown to support eye health. Sweet potatoes with orange flesh contain more carotenoids, like the antioxidant lutein, than other types of potato.
Lutein is concentrated in the macula of your eye’s retina and is associated with healthy vision. Research suggests that lutein-rich foods like sweet potatoes can help treat diet-related diseases and eye conditions.
According to the American Diabetes Association, sweet potatoes are low-glycemic index (low GI) foods that are ideal for diabetes management. Replacing regular potatoes with sweet potatoes not only does wonders for your blood sugar control, but it also helps boost your intake of potassium, vitamins A and C and dietary fiber.
Sweet potatoes also contain phenolic compounds and flavonoids that can protect against diabetes. Flavonoids promote glucose absorption in peripheral tissue and enhance insulin secretion, both of which can help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels and manage diabetes. (Related: Support brain health with lutein, a brain-boosting carotenoid.)
There are two main varieties of sweet potatoes: dry flesh and moist flesh.
Dry flesh sweet potatoes have tan-colored skin, light-colored flesh and a higher starch content. Moist-flesh sweet potatoes have darker skin and a richer orange interior. They taste sweeter and are more commonly available in the supermarket.
Note that while the term “yams” is commonly used interchangeably with sweet potatoes, true yams come from an entirely different plant.
When buying sweet potatoes, look for fresh sweet potatoes that are heavy for their size, hard, smooth and free of bruises. Avoid sweet potatoes with shriveled skin, dark spots or indentations because these are common signs of decay. You’ll find sweet potatoes in most grocery stores at any time of the year.
Don’t refrigerate sweet potatoes. Instead, keep them in a cool, dry and dark place. The ideal storage temperature for fresh sweet potatoes is around 55 F and they will keep for at least a month or longer. Make sure you use sweet potatoes that are stored at warmer temperatures within a week to prevent spoilage.
Before prepping sweet potatoes, scrub their skin with a vegetable brush under running water and dry them with a paper towel. Cut or cooked sweet potatoes should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator and used within five days.
Sweet potatoes are versatile and can be baked, boiled, roasted, grilled, fried, whipped or pureed. They can serve as a side dish or be used to make salads, breads, pies or chilis. If you prefer a spicy dish, add chili powder. For a slightly sweet option, add cinnamon and nutmeg.
When mashing or whipping sweet potatoes, skip the heavy cream and add rosemary and Parmesan for a savory flair with less fat and calories. Sweet potatoes can also be used to make lasagna, casserole, sweet potato hash or sweet potato gnocchi.
Sweet potatoes are great for breakfast, lunch or dinner because they’re nutritious and inexpensive ingredients.

Native to northern parts of the U.S., cranberry is a popular superfood loaded with beneficial polyphenols that have antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.
You can buy cranberries as fresh or dried berries, or in juice or supplement form.
Many studies have investigated the effects of cranberries on urinary tract infections (UTIs).
Research suggests that cranberries can help prevent recurring UTIs.

UTIs are common in females older than 18. At least 60 percent of females have had at least one UTI, while up to 30 percent have had subsequent ones. Children, the elderly and patients with catheters are especially susceptible to UTIs.
Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins (PACS) that are credited with cranberry’s beneficial effects against UTIs. PACS prevent bacteria that commonly cause UTIs, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli.), from attaching to cells in the urinary tract and causing infection.
Recent guidelines suggest that cranberry products may help reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs in women, children and those who have undergone interventions such as bladder radiotherapy. Consuming cranberries is also linked to a 30 percent decreased risk of recurrent UTIs in these groups.
Cranberry juice was also found to be more effective than other dosage forms, like capsules or tablets, in preventing UTIs.
The PACS in cranberries may also help suppress stomach or intestinal infections caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).
A study of 522 adults with H. pylori bacteria revealed that participants who drank cranberry juice with a high amount of PACS twice a day for eight weeks had a 20 percent lower infection risk than those who took cranberry powder or a placebo. (Related: 4 Health benefits of pomegranate, an ancient superfood.)
A review of 22 studies concluded that cranberries may lower fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c — a test that measures average blood sugar levels over the past three months — in those with Type 2 diabetes.
Researchers suggest that the polyphenols in cranberries are responsible for this effect.
Research also suggests that cranberries may reduce some risk factors for heart disease, such as blood pressure and body mass index (BMI).
Additionally, they can help increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good” cholesterol, in individuals younger than 50.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), a 100-gram (g) serving (one-half cup) of cranberry juice provides the following nutrients:
Cranberry juice has a similar sugar content to other juices, which should be considered if you are monitoring your sugar intake.
You can easily add cranberries to your regular diet. While fresh cranberries are not usually consumed raw due to their acidity and tartness, they are often added to recipes.
Cranberry is often sweetened and consumed as a juice or used to make sauces. Cranberry extracts and powders may be added to dishes.
Use cranberries to make a refreshing fruit smoothie or fresh cranberry salsa. If you prefer something savory, make roasted Brussels sprouts with cranberries, bacon and maple. Alternatively, you can take cranberry supplements.
Store raw cranberries or cranberry juice according to package directions. Once opened, refrigerate cranberry juice. Store cranberry supplements at room temperature and out of the reach of children and pets.

The typical school lunch for many young students in the United States often includes a ubiquitous carton of milk. But some school cafeterias may soon run out the half-pint cartons of milk they usually serve, with several districts across the U.S. already trying to find alternatives.
Strangely enough, the problem is not a shortage of milk but of the cardboard cartons used to package and serve it, reported dairy industry suppliers and state officials.
According to a statement from Pactiv Evergreen of Lake Forest, Illinois, which calls itself “the leading manufacturer of fresh food and beverage packaging in North America,” the company is still dealing with “significantly higher than projected demand” for its milk cartons.
Matt Herrick, spokesperson for the International Dairy Foods Association, explained that the shortage is affecting the company’s ability to fully supply some school milk orders.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acknowledged that the supply chain problem now affects several states. School officials in California, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington state said they are preparing for the shortage.
The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service previously required milk to be served with school meals. But in a memo issued in late October, districts were given leeway to serve different types or sizes of milk during the supply shortage. As a last resort, districts could even skip offering milk.
It remains to be seen how long the carton shortage could last. In Everett, Washington, school officials told parents to expect a disruption in cafeteria milk supply that could last for several months. (Related: Shortage of feedstock caused by severe drought leading to MILK shortage in France.)
Herrick said U.S. milk processors are cooperating with other package suppliers to address the carton shortage. He said that he expected the problem to improve within weeks and to be resolved by early next year.
As the shortage continues, school districts are now sending messages to their families and communities about how they are either currently managing or preparing to navigate serving milk without the half-pint cartons.
According to several districts, they expect the milk carton shortage to last until January 2024.
In West Virginia’s Preston County Schools, school nutrition officials are considering options aside from their usual milk supplier. Beth Doerr, the district’s child nutrition director, released a statement to advise the public that in some cases, “juice and water will need to be substituted.”
For Walla Walla Public Schools in Washington, Pamela Milleson, the district’s nutrition services director, has prepared a multi-tiered contingency plan with other district departments in case the milk carton shortage reaches the district.
The 5,600-student district also released an FAQ page on its website and plans to inform parents should the shortage impact local school milk offerings. Milleson said Walla Walla schools usually serve 22,000 cartons of milk per week.
A July 2023 USDA report revealed that 97 percent of school food authorities surveyed between November 2022 and January 2023 experienced one or more supply chain-related issues, including increased costs and staff or product shortages.
Milleson said one of the important lessons that came out of the pandemic is that it taught schools “how to be flexible, stay calm and develop effective contingency plans” during emergency scenarios. However, the ongoing supply chain woes are negatively affecting staff and families.
Meanwhile, dairy suppliers are pointing at packaging manufacturer Pactiv Evergreen as the source of the milk carton supply issue. Milleson thinks the increase in states and districts serving universal school meals could also be a factor affecting the carton supply shortage.

Sweet potatoes are a staple for Thanksgiving dinners, but the vegetable deserves the spotlight year-round.
Sweet potatoes contain dietary fiber, vitamins and other essential nutrients. They also offer several health benefits, such as improving digestion.
While some people use the terms “sweet potato” and “yam” interchangeably, the two are not related. Yams have a drier texture and are more starchy compared to sweet potatoes.
Here are some of the health benefits of sweet potatoes:
The dietary fiber in sweet potatoes can help prevent constipation and promote regularity, which are important for a healthy digestive tract.
Studies have also found that high dietary fiber intake can help reduce the risk of colorectal cancers.
Sweet potatoes are a great source of beta-carotene, a plant pigment that acts as a potent antioxidant. It is also a provitamin.
Your body converts beta-carotene into the active form of vitamin A.
Antioxidants may help reduce the risk of different types of cancer, including lung and prostate cancer.
Antioxidants like beta-carotene can help prevent cellular damage from free radicals. If levels of free radicals in your body get too high, cellular damage can occur. This can increase the risk of some conditions.
Obtaining antioxidants from dietary sources like sweet potatoes may help prevent diseases like cancer.
After the age of 18, the Dietary Guidelines recommend an intake of 700 milligrams (mg) of vitamin A per day for women and 900 mg per day for men. The vitamin is crucial for protecting eye health.
According to the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), a baked sweet potato with the skin on contains around 1,403 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin A, or 561 percent of the daily requirement.
Vitamin A also acts as an antioxidant. Combined with other antioxidants, it can help protect you from different health conditions.
One 124-gram (g) serving of sweet potato provides 12.8 mg of vitamin C. Current guidelines recommend a daily intake of 75 mg of vitamin C for adult women and 90 mg for adult men.
If you consume little or no vitamin C, you can develop scurvy. Many of the symptoms of scurvy are due to tissue problems linked to impaired collagen production.
Vitamin C also supports the immune system and enhances iron absorption. A low vitamin C intake may increase your risk of iron deficiency anemia.
According to the American Heart Association (AHA), it’s best to avoid eating foods that contain high amounts of added salt. Instead, you should eat more potassium-rich foods to maintain a healthy cardiovascular system.
A 124 g serving of mashed sweet potato provides 259 mg of potassium or around five percent of the daily requirements for an adult. Current guidelines recommend that adults consume 4,700 mg of potassium daily.
In one 2008 study, scientists reported that an extract of white-skinned sweet potato improved insulin sensitivity in people with Type 2 diabetes.
The dietary fiber in sweet potatoes is also good for you. According to research, people who consume more fiber appear to have a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.
A 124 g serving of mashed sweet potato, or around half a cup, will provide 2.5 g of fiber.
The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that adults aged 19 years and above consume 22.4 to 33.6 g of fiber each day, depending on their age and sex. (Related: Support healthy blood sugar levels with this delicious sweet potato and pumpkin soup.)
When buying and cooking sweet potatoes, always check if the potato is firm with smooth, taut skin. Store sweet potatoes in a cool, dry place for no longer than three to five weeks.
Sweet potatoes are naturally sweet and creamy. Roasting sweet potatoes will bring out their natural flavor so you can eat them without toppings.
Other ways to incorporate sweet potatoes into a balanced diet include adding roasted sweet potatoes and pecans to a salad and topping it with balsamic vinegar.
You can also add sweet potato to pancakes or hash browns.

Pumpkin is a variety of squash that may come to mind during popular holidays like Halloween or Thanksgiving. This nutrient-rich vegetable is low in calories, but full of vitamins and minerals.
Pumpkin seeds, leaves and juice are also full of nutrients.
Pumpkin offers amazing benefits, including being one of the best-known sources of beta-carotene, the powerful antioxidant that gives orange vegetables and fruits their vibrant color. Your body converts ingested beta-carotene into vitamin A.
Studies show that pumpkins can do the following:
Pumpkins are full of beneficial antioxidants. The vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene in pumpkins can support eye health and prevent degenerative damage in older adults.
In 2019, the National Eye Institute conducted a clinical trial called the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS). The results of the study suggested that high doses of vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene are associated with a significantly reduced risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Pumpkins contain dietary fiber, potassium and vitamin C that all support heart health.
Results of a 2017 study involving 2,722 volunteers revealed that consuming enough potassium could be as important as decreasing sodium in the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension), which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Reducing sodium intake involves preparing meals that contain little or no salt.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements, consuming more potassium may also reduce the risk of other types of CVD. (Related: Grapefruit found to help reduce high blood pressure.)
If you have diabetes, incorporating pumpkins into your diet may help control your condition and blood sugar levels.
The results of a 2019 study suggest that a combination of two plant extracts, one of which was pumpkin polysaccharides, helped bring down the blood sugar levels in mice.
While the study did not involve humans, the findings suggest that pumpkin compounds may have some potential to protect against Type 2 diabetes.
The results of a 2016 study suggest that there is a connection between a diet rich in beta-carotene and tumor suppression in prostate cancer.
The results of a 2014 cross-sectional study also showed that beta-carotene slowed the development of colon cancer in a Japanese population.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Food Data Central database, one cup (245 grams (g)) of cooked, boiled, or drained pumpkin prepared without salt contains:
Pumpkin also contains the following essential vitamins and minerals:
Pumpkins are also full of dietary fiber. The recommended intake of fiber is between 25 g and 38 g per day for adults.
Fiber helps slow the rate of sugar absorption into the blood, promotes regular bowel movements and smooths digestion. Getting enough fiber in your diet can also help reduce the risk of colon cancer.
There are many ways to add more pumpkins to your diet.
Preparing fresh pumpkin at home will offer the most health benefits, but canned pumpkin is also a great choice because the vegetable retains many of its health benefits in the canning process.
Try to avoid canned pumpkin pie mix for regular consumption because this product contains added sugars and syrups. When buying canned pumpkin, look for products that only have one ingredient, pumpkin.
If you’re buying sweet or pie pumpkin varieties, choose a pumpkin that has a few inches of stem remaining. Get a pumpkin that is hard and heavy for its size.
You can store uncut pumpkins in a cool, dark place for up to two months.
Here are other ways to include pumpkin in a balanced diet:

Most people associate cranberries with Thanksgiving, but there are lots of good reasons to eat cranberries year-round. Perfect as a snack or a main dish, cranberries are a nutrient powerhouse. With just 50 calories and four grams of sugar per cup, cranberries are low in calories and sugar, especially when compared to other fruits.
Cranberries have also been linked to a number of impressive health benefits as they can help do the following:
Cranberries are packed with antioxidants. In fact, when it comes to fruits, they rank just below blueberries, the so-called king of antioxidants, in antioxidant potency. Those antioxidants help reduce chronic inflammation, which contributes to the development of several chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
Previous studies have shown that people who consume cranberries often have lower levels of C-reactive protein than those who don’t eat cranberries. C-reactive protein is a blood marker of inflammation, which has been shown to trigger premature aging and cognitive decline.
Cranberries contain bioactive compounds called phytochemicals. Many phytochemicals act as antioxidants. Aside from reducing inflammation, antioxidants also protect healthy cells from free radicals. These reactive molecules are naturally generated by our bodies. But at very high levels, they can damage healthy cells, fats, proteins and even DNA.
Therefore, it’s important to eat foods rich in phytochemicals, such as cranberries.
One of the best-known benefits of cranberries is their use in promoting urinary tract health. For decades, many people used cranberries as a remedy for bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs), which caused frequent and painful urination. Scientists first thought that cranberries worked by acidifying the urine, thus killing the bacteria causing the UTI. (Related: Prevent urinary tract infections naturally with this antioxidant-rich superfood.)
It wasn’t until the 1990s that scientists would determine that something in cranberries prevented bacteria from sticking to the lining of the bladder. That “something” was identified as proanthocyanidins.
Finally, in 2016, a landmark study found that drinking cranberry juice every day reduced symptomatic UTIs by nearly 40 percent in women with recurrent UTIs. The study’s findings suggest a reduction in the need for antibiotics when treating UTIs and highlight the role of cranberries as a natural treatment for UTIs.
It’s best to buy fresh, raw cranberries when they are in season, which usually runs from mid-September to mid-November in North America. They can be refrigerated or frozen for later use, but it’s best to eat them fresh. The skins contain many of the beneficial properties of cranberries, so your best bet is to add them whole to oats or cereals or blend them into juices and smoothies.
You can also incorporate cranberries into both sweet and savory recipes.

https://food.news/2023-11-20-allspice-natural-source-of-beneficial-plant-compounds.html,"The nice spice: Try allspice, a natural source of beneficial plant compounds","Advertisement
It may sound like allspice is a premade blend of spices, but it’s actually a single spice.
Allspice has a unique flavor profile that is often described as a blend of up to four different spices, hence the name. The spice is also used in folk medicine due to its potential health benefits.
Allspice, also called Jamaican pepper, newspice or pimienta, is the dried, unripe berries of Pimenta dioica, a plant that belongs to the Myrtaceae family. It’s native to Jamaica, the tropical forests of South and Central America, and Southern Mexico, but it’s also commercially grown in Cuba, Honduras and Trinidad.
Allspice is made by picking the berries from the plant’s small flowers and drying them in the sun until they’re browned. Allspice is available ground or whole. It is often used as a seasoning for meats, desserts and liqueurs. (Related: Tips to help bring out the flavor of your homemade spice blends.)
When used as a spice in small amounts, allspice is considered safe to use.
However, older research suggests that people with hand dermatitis may develop allergic reactions when cooking with it.
Drug interactions are not well documented. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests a potentially negative effect when large amounts of allspice are consumed while taking blood clotting medication.
Because of the lack of human studies on allspice’s health benefits, an appropriate dosage has yet to be determined.
Due to its many uses in folk medicine, the compounds in allspice have been studied widely.
Those behind allspice’s benefits include:
Ericifolin
Ericifolin is a phenolic compound that may have antibacterial and cancer-fighting properties.
Eugenol
Eugenol is derived from phenylpropene. It has potential antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and cancer-fighting properties.
Gallic acid
Gallic acid is yet another powerful antioxidant and it may have cancer-fighting and antiviral effects.
Gallic acid has also been studied for potential protective effects on brain health, especially the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s.
Quercetin
Quercetin is a type of flavonoid, a powerful antioxidant that may help protect against harmful molecules called free radicals.
Its antioxidant capacity may have cancer-fighting properties, and it’s also known for its potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects.
Allspice provides many health benefits. Here are some of them, all backed by science:
Antimicrobial and antifungal effects
The eugenol and ericifolin in allspice may provide antimicrobial and antifungal effects.
Studies on essential oils extracted from allspice berries suggest that it has antifungal properties against Candida albicans, a yeast that is resistant to certain antifungal drugs.
Additionally, the essential oil shows antibacterial properties against E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, salmonella and S. aureus. Its effects are mainly attributed to its eugenol content, which may damage bacterial membranes.
Menopause treatment
Menopause is the termination of the menstrual cycle in women aged 45 to 52. The condition causes hormonal changes, particularly a decline in estrogen and progesterone levels.
This may cause the following symptoms:
While hormone therapy has traditionally been the primary treatment for menopause symptoms, complementary therapies are becoming more popular, such as herbal remedies.
Research suggests that allspice extract binds to estrogen receptors. This means it may trick your body into believing that its estrogen levels are up, thus helping manage symptoms.
Can protect against cancer
Many of allspice’s beneficial plant compounds have potential cancer-fighting properties.
According to test-tube and animal studies, ericifolin, eugenol, gallic acid and quercetin may decrease tumor growth, prevent the spread of tumors and promote apoptosis or the programmed death of cancerous cells.
Allspice’s anticancer effects have been studied on breast, colon, duodenal, gastric and prostate cancers. Its effect varies depending on the type of cancer.
Research conducted on breast cancer cell lines suggests that allspice extract leads to autophagy, or the body’s way of clearing unnecessary or damaged cells, such as cancerous cells, by degrading them.
Prostate cancer cells can also be eliminated through apoptosis, while gastric cancer cell lines were affected by allspice extracts’ ability to inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that’s considered carcinogenic.
You may buy allspice berries, whole or ground, in the supermarket’s spice aisle. Allspice essential oil can also be bought at stores and online.
Store allspice in a cool, dry place, like your kitchen pantry.
Allspice’s unique flavor profile makes it a versatile ingredient that can be used to give a warm, peppery flavor to different dishes. Use allspice to season seafood or fish or a dessert like allspice crumb muffins.
Use whole berries the same way you would use whole cloves. Ground allspice is mostly used in baking or as a seasoning for meats, poultry, stews and vegetables.
Here are some sweet and savory dishes that you can make using allspice:
Since allspice can be used in almost any dish, make sure you have it in your pantry as you prepare for the holidays.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), vitamin C can:
Cranberries are a great source of nutrients and antioxidants and they can provide various health benefits when eaten as part of a balanced diet.
Cranberries are native to North America. Now, cranberries are grown across the northern United States, Canada and Chile.
Can help with UTIs
Cranberries are often used as traditional treatments for UTIs.
The high level of antioxidant proanthocyanidins (PACs) in cranberries may help prevent certain bacteria from binding to the urinary tract walls. This suggests that PACs in cranberries may help prevent a urinary tract infection (UTI).
In a 2016 review, researchers found that medical professionals most commonly recommend cranberries for women with recurrent UTIs.
Another 2014 study of 516 participants revealed that taking a capsule of cranberry extract twice per day reduced the incidence of UTIs. (Related: Prevent urinary tract infections naturally with this antioxidant-rich superfood.)
May help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease
According to a 2019 systematic review, supplementing cranberries in your diet may help you manage several risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). These include systolic blood pressure, which is the blood pressure during a contraction of the heart muscle.
The review also suggested that cranberry supplementation helped reduce body mass index (BMI) and improve levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or “good” cholesterol.
In another study from 2019, scientists examined 78 volunteers who were overweight or were obese. Their findings showed that consuming a single dose of a low-calorie cranberry beverage with a high content of plant compounds daily improved someone’s regulation of blood sugar, chemical signs of inflammation and increased levels of HDL lipoprotein.
May help slow cancer progression
A 2016 review of 34 preclinical studies showed that cranberries or compounds in cranberries had several beneficial effects on cancer cells in test tubes.
These benefits included reducing inflammation, slowing the growth of cancer cells and triggering the death of cancer cells.
The 2016 review also found that cranberries can affect several other mechanisms that promote cancer growth and spread.
Can help promote oral health
The PACs in cranberries may also benefit oral health. A 2019 study revealed that PACs in fruits like cranberries may help teeth against a strand of bacteria that causes tooth decay.
Cranberries may also help protect against gum disease.
Farmers harvest fresh cranberries in September and October, so fall is the best time to purchase them. If you want to get cranberries the rest of the year, they are also available dried, frozen, or canned.
Another option is to refrigerate fresh cranberries or freeze them for later use.
Here are some suggestions on how to incorporate cranberries into a balanced diet:
Keep in mind that some store-bought cranberry products may contain added sugars because cranberries are quite tart and may be difficult to consume without some added sweetener.
Always check the ingredients label and choose the product with the least added sugar.
Store-bought cranberry juice may contain other fruit juices and added sweeteners. When looking for cranberry juice that offers the most benefits, check labels that lists cranberry as the primary ingredient.
Cranberries are usually safe to consume, but if you are taking the blood-thinning drug warfarin (Jantoven), discuss your intake of cranberries with your doctor. Data suggests that it may interact with warfarin or other blood thinners and cause increased anticlotting effects.
Cranberry products may also cause a higher excretion of oxalate in urine. This could promote the formation of kidney stones if you are susceptible to calcium oxalate-type stones.
If you have a history of kidney stones, talk to your healthcare provider before increasing their intake of cranberries.
Follow a balanced diet and add cranberries to salads or bake goods to boost your intake of vitamin C and various nutrients.

Cinnamon is a popular spice known for its pleasant scent and sweet and warm flavor profile.
It’s often associated with fall and Thanksgiving in the U.S. and is a common ingredient for various sweet and savory dishes around the world.
Cinnamon is a fragrant spice that is made by cutting the stems of cinnamon trees (Cinnamomum verum). The inner bark is removed and saved while the outer parts, which are too woody, are discarded.
The inner bark forms strips that curl into rolls when dried, forming the cinnamon sticks that you may already be familiar with. Cinnamon sticks can be used whole for cooking and seasoning or ground into powder.
Cinnamon is native to Asia, particularly in Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), the coast of India and Myanmar (Burma). Now, cinnamon is also cultivated in South America and the West Indies.
Cinnamon has been consumed by humans for thousands of years, dating back as early as 2,000 B.C. The spice was also used in Egypt for embalming and religious practices.
Cinnamon was used as a preservative for meats during the winter thousands of years ago.
In medieval times, doctors used cinnamon to treat conditions like arthritis, coughs and sore throats.
Research suggests that cinnamon offers some health benefits, depending on the variety and quality used.
Cinnamon has beneficial antioxidants
Cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde, a polyphenol compound that has been found to have antioxidant properties. Antioxidants are substances that can help protect cells from harmful free radicals. Free radicals can be found in the environment and food and they may contribute to health issues like heart disease and cancer.
Cinnamon may help with Type 2 diabetes
Some studies suggest that cinnamon can help reduce insulin resistance and blood sugar levels. (Related: Study: Cinnamon compound boosts metabolic health and helps fight obesity.)
Here are some suggestions on how different cultures use cinnamon:
Below are more healthy recipes you can try if you have cinnamon at home:
There are two main types of commercial cinnamon: Ceylon Cinnamon and cassia cinnamon.
Ceylon cinnamon
Ceylon cinnamon is mostly produced in Sri Lanka. Some people call it “true cinnamon.”
Ceylon cinnamon is more expensive than cassia cinnamon and has more health benefits. It has a milder, sweeter flavor, and it’s best for baking and hot drinks such as hot chocolate.
If you buy supplements, they will likely be Ceylon, especially if it is a good quality supplement.
Cassia cinnamon
Cassia cinnamon comes from Southern China and is mostly produced in Indonesia. It has the stronger smell and flavor of the two varieties.
This cheaper variety is what you can typically find in the spice aisle at the grocery store. Cassia cinnamon is often used in various products containing cinnamon.
Other types of cinnamon include:
The best way to store cinnamon is in a cool, dry place away from heat and sunlight, such as your pantry.
Cinnamon is generally safe to use, but here are some things to consider if you haven’t tried cinnamon before.
Because there is limited research on cinnamon supplementation, children, pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding should avoid using cinnamon as a treatment.
Cinnamon may affect your blood sugar levels, so if you have diabetes talk to your doctor before taking supplements.
If you regularly take any medications, check with your doctor before you start using cinnamon supplements. They could affect the way antibiotics, blood thinners, diabetes drugs, heart medicines and others work.
Buy high-quality cinnamon, preferably Ceylon cinnamon, and add it to hot chocolate or baked goods for a sweet and warm flavor boost.

Pumpkin is a popular autumn and Thanksgiving dinner ingredient. It is a nutritious, versatile vegetable that’s full of a variety of nutrients, including dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and beneficial antioxidants. Many of the health benefits of pumpkin are focused on its fiber content and micronutrients, including beta-carotene and vitamin A.
Pumpkin is a type of winter squash that belongs to the same plant family as cucumbers and melons. It’s technically a fruit since it contains seeds.
However, in terms of nutrition, pumpkin is more like a vegetable.
Pumpkins are usually round and orange, although their size, shape and color can vary depending on the variety. They have a thick outer rind that’s smooth and ribbed and a stem that connects the pumpkin to its leafy plant.
Pumpkins are hollow, except for ivory-colored seeds covered in stringy flesh. They are native to North America and have a big role in two holidays. They are carved into jack-o’-lanterns for Halloween and cooked into pies for Thanksgiving dessert in the U.S. and Canada. Pumpkins are also grown on every continent except Antarctica. Pumpkin seeds, leaves and flesh are all edible.
There are several varieties of pumpkins, such as:
Most of the pumpkins sold in America are canned. (Related: The sweet spice: Health benefits of nutmeg and tips for proper storage.)
Pumpkin is a nutritious food and it contains different vitamins and minerals and relatively few calories.
One cup (245 grams) of canned pumpkin provides:
A cup of canned pumpkin also contains smaller amounts of several other nutrients.
The vitamin A contained in pumpkin is in the form of vitamin A precursors beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. Your body can turn these beneficial antioxidants into vitamin A after you consume them.
Pumpkin seeds, also called pepitas, are also commonly eaten as a snack.
A one-ounce (15 grams) serving of pumpkin seeds in their shell contains:
Pumpkin seeds are low in carbs but high in fat, so they’re an ideal snack if you are on a low-carb or plant-based diet.
Most of a pumpkin’s health benefits come from its vitamin and mineral content, along with its low sugar and high fiber content.
Supports optimal eye health
Pumpkins are full of beta-carotene, which helps keep your vision sharp by helping the retina absorb light.
The combination of other vitamins and minerals in pumpkin may help prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Study findings suggest that individuals with AMD could slow its progression by taking supplements containing zinc, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene or a combination of these nutrients.
Supports optimal immune health
The beta-carotene in pumpkin is partially converted into vitamin A, which can help protect your body from fight infections.
Scientists have found that vitamin A is important for strengthening the intestinal lining, making it more resistant to infections. Additionally, vitamin C has a key role in immune health by strengthening the immune cells that respond when a pathogen is identified.
Supports optimal heart health
Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables is key to maintaining optimal heart health.
Pumpkin contains specific nutrients that are good for heart health. One nutrient, potassium, may help reduce high blood pressure levels.
Pumpkin also contains fiber that may help lower blood cholesterol levels by binding with the cholesterol in the foods you eat and preventing its absorption.
Pumpkin is popular in sweet treats like custards, muffins, pancakes and pies, but it can also be used to make savory dishes.
Use pumpkin to make soup or roast it with other vegetables. If you have canned pumpkin, add coconut milk and spices to make a creamy curry base.
Pumpkin seeds are roasted for a crunchy snack or salad topping, while the flowers can be battered and fried.
Here are more healthy pumpkin dishes to try at home:
Keep in mind that not all products that have pumpkin in their name are healthy.
For example, store-bought pumpkin spice lattes lack the health benefits of eating an actual pumpkin. Many pumpkin-spice-flavored desserts also lack real pumpkin and only contain pumpkin pie spice.
To reap the health benefits of pumpkin, cook with it at home and use other nutritious ingredients.

Nutmeg is a popular spice used on eggnog, desserts and various baked goods.
But did you know that nutmeg also offers some health benefits and contains beneficial antioxidants?
Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) is a spice that is commonly used in baked goods, holiday treats, ethnic cuisine and different beverages.
Nutmeg is produced by grinding nutmeg seeds from a flowering plant of the Myristicaceae family, sometimes called the nutmeg family. The plant is native to Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands.
Nutmeg spice has a sweet taste and is often used with other sweet spices such as cinnamon, clove and allspice.
Some studies have found that nutmeg has antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic, pain-relieving, liver-protecting and cancer-preventative properties.
Aside from its use as a flavoring spice in Asian, European, Middle Eastern and African cuisines and traditional American baked goods, nutmeg also has a history of medicinal use.
Data suggests that nutmeg has a long history of being used to relieve chronic pain. Findings from rat studies have also suggested that nutmeg oil may have potential as a chronic pain reliever.
According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one serving (one teaspoon or 2.2 grams) of ground nutmeg provides 12 calories. The calories come from carbohydrates (1.08 g), protein (0.13 g) and fat (0.8 g).
Nutmeg contains a small amount of vitamins A and C, choline and folate, but not in amounts that will impact your daily recommended intake of those vitamins. It also contains minerals like calcium (3.7 mg), magnesium (3.7 mg), potassium (7.0 mg), phosphorus (4.3 mg) and small amounts of sodium and manganese. (Related: Support brain health and improve cognitive function with these herbs and spices.)
You can buy nutmeg in whole or ground form. Ground nutmeg is commonly found in almost every grocery store.
If you want to buy whole nutmeg seeds to grind at home, you may need to visit a specialty market or purchase it online.
Keep in mind that ground nutmeg will lose its flavor quickly. This is why some cooks choose to buy it whole. Whole nutmeg seeds stay fresh indefinitely, so you can grind what you need at home and save the rest for later.
You can use nutmeg to flavor sweet baked goods such as apple pie, cookies and other desserts.
Nutmeg is used to make a bechamel sauce. The spice can also be used to make baked or stewed fruit and custards.
Nutmeg is also used when making curries, eggnog, punches, sauces (especially onion-based and milk sauces), pasta and vegetables, like spinach.
Lastly, nutmeg can also be used to flavor meats, like lamb or starchy vegetables.
While nutmeg is often used in cooking and baking, the spice or its essential oil can be used to gain a nutmeg high. Remember that using nutmeg-like this can have serious side effects.
According to some sources, nutmeg affects the nervous system and the imagination. Some experts have warned that nutmeg essential oil can have a hypnotic or hallucinogenic effect.
There are also published reports of nutmeg being used as a psychotropic drug with harmful consequences.
According to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, nutmeg is safe when consumed in amounts typically found in food. However, the overconsumption of nutmeg may be risky and can cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting and hallucination.
There are reports of nutmeg poisoning dating back to the early 1900s, with symptoms including burning pain in the stomach, giddiness, or precordial anxiety. Scientists suggest that the toxic effects of nutmeg are due to the presence of myristicin oil, a natural organic compound found in the spice.
In one published report, scientists discovered that nutmeg poisoning is rare but probably underreported and should be considered in recreational substance users with acute psychotic symptoms and central nervous system symptoms.
Use nutmeg in moderation to make delicious desserts and savory sauces.

https://food.news/2023-10-30-grapefruit-can-help-reduce-high-blood-pressure.html,Grapefruit found to help reduce high blood pressure,"Advertisement
Multiple studies have found that grapefruit can help lower high blood pressure.
Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) was named for the grape-like clusters that form in the tree it grows in. The fruit belongs to the Rutaceae family and comes in white, pink and red varieties.
Each type offers different flavor profiles, ranging from intensely tart to deliciously sweet. Grapefruit is full of vitamins A and C, and it is a great source of dietary fiber. The fruit also has an extremely low glycemic index of 25.
The glycemic index measures how much food raises blood glucose levels, which means grapefruit is ideal for people with diabetes. (Related: Health tips: 7 Ways to control your blood pressure.)

Additionally, grapefruit contains vitamin B6, calcium, folate, magnesium and thiamine. It also contains potassium, a nutrient with an essential role in controlling heart rate and blood pressure, as well as maintaining normal fluid levels inside cells, which is then balanced by sodium, which keeps normal fluid levels outside the cells.
One grapefruit provides at least 10 percent of our daily potassium requirements.
High blood pressure (hypertension) is a serious health condition and a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.
A 2023 report from the American Heart Association has found that almost 50 percent of Americans over 20 have high blood pressure, which represents 122 million people. Experts warn that the likelihood of having high blood pressure increases as you age, reflected in the fact that at least three-quarters of Americans over 65 have the condition.
Data suggests that grapefruit is effective for lowering blood pressure because of its high potassium content, which counteracts the adverse effects of sodium, one of the common causes of high blood pressure.
Several studies support the use of grapefruit for lowering blood pressure.
In a randomized controlled trial published in the journal Metabolism, researchers observed 74 overweight adult volunteers and divided them into two groups. The first was given half a grapefruit before each meal three times a day, while the control group didn’t eat any grapefruit.
The results showed that grapefruit helped lower blood pressure. Those in the grapefruit group also lost weight, decreased their waist circumference and had a decrease in LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein).
In another study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, scientists reported that grapefruit juice enhanced the systolic blood pressure-lowering effects of beetroot juice.
Researchers conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis set out to study evidence for or against the effect of grapefruit consumption on body weight, blood pressure and lipid profiles. The analysis indicated a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure for those given grapefruit compared to the control group.
Grapefruit is naturally high in potassium, and studies show that greater potassium consumption can lower blood pressure.
According to a systematic review of 22 randomized controlled trials, increased potassium intake reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults with hypertension. Findings also indicated a decreased risk of stroke with increased potassium intake.
A 1991 clinical trial published in the journal The Lancet revealed that grapefruit significantly increased the absorption of some medications, suggesting that regular doses could be turned into potentially deadly overdoses. The trial studied the effects of felodipine and nifedipine, two medications used to treat high blood pressure.
Six men with borderline hypertension were given five milligrams (mg) of felodipine with either water, grapefruit, or orange juice. When taken with grapefruit juice, the bioavailability of felodipine averaged 284 percent, but ranged between 164 to 469 percent, compared to when taken with water.
When the same test was repeated with 10 mg of nifedipine, its bioavailability with grapefruit juice was 134 percent, with a range of 108 to 169 percent, compared to that with water.
David Bailey, a Canadian pharmacologist who received his doctorate in pharmacology from the University of Toronto, initially made the discovery.
Bailey made the discovery by accident while researching the effect of alcohol on the blood pressure medication felodipine in the late 1980s. He wanted to disguise the taste of the alcohol and tried doing so using grapefruit juice.
Bailey discovered that the subjects taking the medications with grapefruit juice had higher levels of the drug in their bloodstream. Upon continued study, he found that the grapefruit juice inhibited CYP3A4, an enzyme that helps break down the medication in the gut.
This then makes the body absorb more of the drug. Bailey’s discovery resulted in the Lancet article mentioned above, and the phenomenon was known as “the grapefruit effect.”
Bailey’s subsequent research showed grapefruit’s interactions with approximately 100 oral medications, where its effects either increased levels of the drug in the body to potentially dangerous levels, or the opposite: Reducing their effectiveness.
His pioneering work resulted in many medications having warning labels, alerting patients not to take them with grapefruit juice.
Here are some examples of medications that can interact with grapefruit juice:
While reactions vary depending on the person, you should always check the labels and inserts of medications you are taking to confirm if grapefruit juice could interact with them.
Grapefruit is also full of dietary fiber, antioxidants and potassium. If you have hypertension, try incorporating grapefruit into a balanced diet to lower your blood pressure naturally.

A study has found that grapes are rich in antioxidants that can boost eye health.
The vibrant pigmentation of this fruit reflects the rich concentration of polyphenols and antioxidants in their skin, making them a valuable addition to your diet. Polyphenols are plant compounds that offer many health benefits, from relaxing blood vessels to fighting free radical damage.
Singaporean scientists analyzed the powerful antioxidant effects of grapes to assess their impact on oxidative stress markers, especially concerning eye health. Oxidative stress is one of the most significant contributing factors to all modern diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.

Researchers focused on oxidative damage as a causal factor in reducing eye health. The buildup of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and a reduction in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) are indicators of a decline in eye health due to oxidative stress.
Due to the effects of grapes on fighting free radicals, the researchers hypothesized that an increase in grape compounds in the diet would increase MPOD and decrease AGE.
For the study, researchers worked with 44 Singaporean adult volunteers. They all had their MPOD and AGE calculated during intake.
Throughout the 16-week trial, the group was given either grape powder or a placebo. At the end of the study, both MPOD and AGE were once again evaluated in both groups.
The researchers found that the group that was given regular doses of grape powder had “significantly more dense macular pigment and significantly less advanced glycation end products.” (Related: Grapes: Versatile fruit with health benefits.)
Note that the study did not look at the concept of eating grapes and how it affects your vision directly. Instead, the research team tried to understand the effects of grape consumption on factors that coexist in those with declining eye health.
With that in mind, the study suggests that an increase in grapes within the diet of adults is correlated to a reduction in oxidative stress in the eyes.
The study suggests that grapes can help protect against oxidative stress within optical structures. This means that the more you follow an antioxidant-rich diet and eat organic fruits and vegetables, the more likely you are to reduce the threat of oxidative stress.
The study is not overly complicated. While the researchers gave some of the volunteers grape powder, you can simply add organic grapes to your regular diet to reap similar protective benefits.
Keep in mind that grape powder is extracted from whole grapes and the same benefits are possibly not present if you simply drink grape juice or wine. This is likely because the polyphenols are densely aggregated within grape skin.
Another thing worth noting is that polyphenols and other plant substances beneficial for human health are almost always densest in the skin of said fruits and vegetables.
A diet full of a variety of whole foods is almost universally beneficial for human health.
Specifically, vibrantly colored plants and fruit are highly nutritious, so eat grapes as part of a balanced diet.
Here are other nutritious foods that you can eat to boost eye health:
Like grapes, broccoli can also help protect eye health.
Broccoli is full of vitamin C, an antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress in the eyes and helps prevent cataracts.
A cup of raw broccoli contains 81.2 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C, which offers at least 90 percent of the daily value for men and more than 100 percent for women.
Broccoli is also a natural source of vitamin A. According to a July review, broccoli’s antioxidant load may help prevent age-related macular degeneration.
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics lists kale as one of the best foods for eye health, along with other dark leafy greens like collard greens, spinach and turnip greens.
Kale is full of the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, and experts suggest that it could help reduce sun-related damage to eye tissue and reduce the risk of age-related eye issues.
While salmon is often associated with brain health, the omega-3 fatty acids known as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in salmon are also essential for eye health.
While the eye benefits of DHA and EPA found in salmon start kicking in before birth, they offer benefits throughout your whole life.
Wild sockeye salmon is one of the richest food sources of DHA. It’s also a food source of vitamin A and zinc, other nutrients that are beneficial for your eye health.
Carrots often hold the title of the best food for eye health because they are full of beta-carotene, the pigment that gives orange vegetables their vibrant hue. While carrots are full of beta-carotene, sweet potatoes actually contain more of this beneficial pigment.
One serving of boiled carrots provides 8.3 mg of beta-carotene, while the same portion of baked sweet potato contains at least 11.5 mg.
Beta-carotene is good for you because the body converts it to vitamin A, which is essential for good vision. Additionally, the beta-carotene in sweet potatoes helps your eyes adjust in low light.
Nuts are excellent foods for healthy eyes and vision because they are chock-full of nutrients like vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids and zinc.
Nuts also contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant form of omega 3s. ALA can then be converted to DHA and EPA by the body, so walnuts are a great source of omegas for vegans and vegetarians or those who can’t eat fatty fish like salmon.
The ALA in walnuts may be especially beneficial if you have diabetes-related eye issues. According to studies, ALA may help improve dry eye disease and retinopathy in those with diabetes.
High blood sugar can negatively affect blood vessels in the eyes, so eating fiber-rich foods that help stabilize blood glucose levels can further improve eye health in people with diabetes
Walnuts also contain vitamin E, an antioxidant usually found in healthy fats. The vitamin E and other polyphenols in walnuts help reduce inflammation and protect against free radical damage. Additionally, walnuts provide zinc, a mineral that’s highly concentrated in the retina.

https://food.news/2023-10-24-california-skittles-ban-prompts-ban-cancer-causing-additives.html,California “Skittles ban” prompts call to ban other CANCER-CAUSING food additives already BANNED in Europe,"Advertisement
California has become the first state to take a major legal step in banning cancer-causing additive ingredients often used in food products. Now, health experts are encouraging the rest of the U.S. to also ban other potentially dangerous additives in different food products.
Governor Gavin Newsom signed the “Skittles ban” on Oct. 7.
Despite the name, the Skittles ban doesn’t ban the candy called Skittles. Instead, it bans the use of four very common food additives that have been linked to health problems like kidney, thyroid and gastrointestinal cancer, and mood disorders.

These four ingredients are brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and red dye No. 3.
Some products that use these ingredients include:
However, there are other ingredients that, despite their known health risks and prohibition in European countries, are still present in foods Americans eat every day.
Dr. Carolyn Williams, a registered dietitian, emphasized that it’s “about time legislation was enacted to protect Americans from harmful food additives.”
Williams added that it’s embarrassing that California had to [enact a ban] before the federal government because there are numerous studies about harmful ingredients and their “potential health risks.”
None of the ingredients on the banned list are necessary in products but they are often cheaper, easier and faster to use in recipes. The ingredients also help manufacturers achieve more uniform products, but a natural ingredient could be used as a safer alternative.
Williams hopes other states will soon follow California’s lead. She added that she also wants to see better regulation at the federal level.
Williams knows that significant change will take some time because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) often takes several years to make changes. She added that there is “a lot of bureaucracy,” with the FDA often requiring “overwhelming evidence” that a certain ingredient has a specific negative impact on health.
According to Williams, since various additives can have a range of effects on different people and their true adverse effects on health cannot be tested over time in humans, it is often difficult to conclusively determine what the side effects of each ingredient are. (Related: Learn how to decipher packaged food labels and avoid harmful ingredients.)
Williams explained that it is not safe to give a group of human volunteers large amounts of potassium bromate to find out what happens.
It is impossible to “give them a huge dose for a year and then see how many develop cancer.”
For the desired changes to take effect, researchers must conduct “animal studies and longevity population studies,” which involves studying people eating certain foods for 50 years and looking at cancer rates. However, these methods do not demonstrate cause and effect.
For example, animal studies usually show that if ingredients are “linked to potential cancer risk in animals,” it’s assumed that it can be potentially carcinogenic in humans.
The California Skittles ban includes potassium bromate, a suspected carcinogen. Potassium bromate is already banned in Europe, China and India, but it is still being used in more than 100 products sold in the United States.
It is a chemical compound typically used to strengthen dough. Potassium bromate comes in the form of white crystals or powders and is often used to make baked goods and breads.
As a suspected carcinogen, potassium bromate has been shown to cause kidney, thyroid and gastrointestinal cancers in animals. Data shows that when potassium bromate breaks down in the body, it oxidizes and turns into free radicals. Studies have proven that free radicals are linked to cancer, mutation and DNA changes.
Regulators in the European Union rely on the “precautionary principle,” which looks at the scientific possibility of harm, even if a risk analysis has not proven it, and enforcing measures so the ingredient is avoided. Meanwhile, the FDA relies on “overwhelming evidence.” The agency approaches risk associated with food additives differently compared to other countries.
Williams said the U.S. and the EU are “working from two opposite spectrums.” While the EU and other countries are wary of potentially harmful ingredients, the U.S. is more willing to use these ingredients.
The EU’s precautionary principle is more conservative than the FDA’s regulation, which is demonstrated by the fact that most of the controversial food additives common in America have already been banned in Europe.
Research also shows that the levels of potentially harmful ingredients often present in food are a lot higher than the FDA threshold. Meaning, consumers “may be getting a much larger dosage.”
In 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that there were “emerging child health concerns related to the use of colorings, flavorings and chemicals deliberately added to food during processing.”
A 2022 National Institutes of Health (NIH) study also revealed that chemical food additives can cause many health problems like congenital eye and brain abnormalities.

Ending dinner with a piece of chocolate is a nice treat, but you may need to rethink your eating habits if you often finish off a whole chocolate by yourself.
Sugar cravings can affect your overall health and may cause different complications like obesity and diabetes. Experts are still only beginning to understand the nature of sugar addiction, but studies have revealed that sugar raises dopamine levels.
In a 2005 article published in the Journal of Neuroscience, scientists reported that binging daily on sugar “repeatedly releases dopamine in the accumbens shell [a section of the brain affected by dopamine].” The findings also showed that intermittent binging on sucrose or table sugar had effects similar to addictive drugs and it repeatedly increases dopamine in the brain.

In another earlier study, researchers discovered that the repeated and excessive intake of sugar created a state “in which an opioid antagonist caused behavioral and neurochemical signs of opioid withdrawal.”
The indices of anxiety and DA/ACh (dopamine/acetylcholine) imbalance were “qualitatively similar to withdrawal from morphine or nicotine,” suggesting that the rat subjects had become sugar-dependent.
A clue to the remarkable release from sugar addiction could be explained by a 2020 study where scientists observed what happened to rats when fed a chronic high-fat diet (HFC).
The diet contained 42 percent of calories as fat, mostly lard. Researchers found that the rats with chronic HFD intake were less motivated to obtain sweet palatable foods. This reduced motivation did not seem to be linked to pleasure upon tasting sweet food because the researchers did not observe any alteration in reactivity to sweet taste.
Data suggested that chronic HFD causes a significant motivational impairment for sweet palatable foods and that these changes may be linked to “a decreased dopaminergic and cannabinoid neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens.”
But what does it mean that the rats showed “significant motivational impairment for sweet palatable foods?”
If you make changes to your eating habits, such as trying to ease your sugar addiction, you can eventually learn how to control your bad food choices.
Instead of finishing a whole package of store-bought cookies, eat other foods that can regulate dopamine levels.
The amino acid tyrosine, which can be found in foods like beef, chicken and cheese, is the precursor to dopamine. Try a healthy diet that contains foods rich in vitamin D, B vitamins, magnesium and omega-3 fatty acids, all of which contribute to healthy dopamine levels.
Bone broth contains glycine, another dopamine precursor, so make some chicken broth on a cold night.
You can also change your diet by focusing on lacto-fermented foods like sauerkraut that will help provide healthy gut flora, which then produces feel-good chemicals and a fat called arachidonic acid (AA), which is unique to animal fats.
AA is the raw material out of which your body makes feel-good endocannabinoids. (Related: 6 Reasons why you’re always craving sugar, plus expert tips that can help curb sugar cravings.)
To beat a sugar addiction, you can try to follow a balanced diet that gives you steady levels of dopamine throughout the day, but make sure it’s not too low that you feel listless and depressed and not too high that it makes you agitated and anxious.
This is important because sugar triggers a whipsaw effect by sending dopamine levels high followed by a significant drop, like a bad dopamine roller-coaster where the highs are short-lived and the lows require another sugar fix.
Charles Eisenstein, author of the book “The Yoga of Eating,” said many people are often worried about following a healthy diet because they don’t think they have the willpower to do so.
While willpower can help you maintain a healthy and satisfying diet, it does not really stop sugar addiction.
Eisenstein said people often use willpower to improve themselves, like making changes to their diet or bad habits. However, any effort at self-willpower is destined to fail.
If you tell yourself, “I will make myself do it,” you are fighting yourself. This makes you divided, as if on some level you do not want to do it. Eventually, when your willpower is at its weakest, “your true desires will express themselves as actions,” warned Eisenstein.
Instead, he advised that it’s better to focus on aligning “joyful, nurturing eating with the authentic needs of body and soul.”
A healthy diet isn’t meant to make you feel like you’re being punished.
Focus on nurturing eating, where you allow yourself to enjoy foods that you love but in moderation and nutritious meals until your body and brain become sufficiently nourished that you no longer crave sugar.
Instead of pitting your mind against your body by following the soulless, low-fat dietary guidelines, use your mind to teach yourself eating practices that nourish the body.
If you’re hungry, eat a meal that is delicious, healthy and filling. If you get a craving when you’re hungry, eating a healthy meal with protein-rich foods will help curb hunger.
If your cravings are bad, try distracting yourself by going for a brisk walk. This offers two benefits: One, you distance yourself from the sugary treats you are craving.
Two, the exercise will help release endorphins or “feel good” chemicals in your brain, which can also help “turn off” the cravings. If you can’t go outside, do push-ups, burpees or body-weight squats until you’re breaking a sweat.
With time, your food addictions, to sugar, chocolate, coffee or alcohol, will end because your body is getting the nutrients it needs from healthier foods and beverages.

https://food.news/2023-08-18-biden-administration-launches-billion-initiative-carbon-capture.html,"Biden administration launches $1.2 billion initiative to “CAPTURE” CARBON DIOXIDE from the sky, depriving food crops of the molecule needed for photosynthesis","Advertisement
The administration of President Joe Biden has announced a $1.2 billion taxpayer-funded initiative to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere in an attempt to achieve a so-called “net-zero global economy” by 2050.
In a statement, Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the $1.2 billion fund will be used to develop two commercial-scale “direct air capture” facilities in Texas and Louisiana.

The projects are the first of this scale in the U.S. and represent the initial selections from the president’s bipartisan infrastructure law-funded Regional Direct Air Capture (DAC) Hubs program, which is focused on jumpstarting a nationwide network of large-scale carbon removal sites to deal with legacy CO2 dioxide pollution and complement rapid emissions reductions.
The government claims these emissions are already in the atmosphere and are to blame for climate change and extreme weather. The emissions are also blamed for jeopardizing public health and ecosystems worldwide. The Hubs are supposed to “ensure meaningful community and labor engagement and contribute to the president’s Justice Initiative.”
These projects are expected to eliminate over two million metric tons of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere annually and create 4,800 jobs in Texas and Louisiana.
This will be the world’s largest investment in engineered carbon removal in history, with each Hub eventually removing more than 250 times more CO2 than the largest DAC facility currently in operation.
This is despite experts highlighting the crucial role of CO2 in supporting life on Earth. Without CO2, photosynthesis will not be possible.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water and CO2 to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar.
Still, both the government and mainstream media insist on the narrative that CO2 and greenhouse gases are bad for the environment. Granholm also noted that removing the CO2 already in the atmosphere is crucial to achieving a net-zero global economy.
According to the Biden administration’s plan, development of the Hubs will jumpstart a new industry critical to addressing the climate crisis on a global scale and fast-track attempts to meet the government’s goal of a net-zero economy by 2050.
DAC is a process that separates CO2 from the air to allegedly help reduce legacy CO2 in the atmosphere. The separated CO2 will be stored deep underground permanently or converted into useful carbon-containing products like concrete to prevent its release back into the atmosphere.
The government insists that the widespread deployment of DAC and other innovative technologies that capture emissions are necessary to “fighting” the climate crisis and reinforcing America’s global competitiveness in the zero-carbon economy of the future.
According to DOE estimates, achieving Biden’s ambitious plan for net-zero emissions will require at least 400 million to 1.8 billion metric tons of CO2 to be removed from the atmosphere and captured from emissions sources annually by 2050.
It’s worth noting that the Biden administration’s alleged goal of a “zero-net global economy” by 2050 follows the Great Reset blueprint first put forward by the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF). (Related: Battle against carbon dioxide a ploy to TAKE AWAY FREEDOMS under the guise of “fighting climate change.”)
Aside from the “carbon capture” projects, the WEF’s Great Reset plan also includes reducing coal and petrol production, eliminating private vehicle ownership, using wind and solar energy, and replacing meat consumption with insects.

Early in August, Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hosted an insightful roundtable discussion on farming and food with regenerative farmers who are working hard to develop an alternative farm model for the United States.
The participants included Ben Dobson, Gail Fuller, Will Harris, Reginaldo Haslett-Marroquin, Kerry Hoffschneider, John Kempf, Judith McGeary, Wayne Swanson and Bob Quinn as more than 6,000 viewers watched live.
The speakers discussed their visions on how to revitalize American farming with Kennedy.

Kennedy started the conversation by recounting his experience litigating against Big Ag companies, and how it taught him how corporations and politicians plotted to consolidate the industry.
According to Kennedy, passing legislation that protects factory farms, manipulating subsidy programs and forming crucial partnerships with industrial farmers helped greedy companies like Smithfield dominate the pork and chicken industries. In turn, these companies gradually turned the remaining family farmers into “indentured servants on their own land,” added Kennedy.
Smithfield used marketing tactics on its websites and social media accounts to convince consumers that its pork products are environmentally friendly, which is greenwashing at its finest. In time, Smithfield’s low prices forced the entire industry to switch to the same model.
Kennedy said his experience fighting against Big Ag inspired him to try “the other end of the spectrum” with individuals with a true desire to produce “real food and healthy food and wholesome communities” that everyone can be proud of.
Kennedy then listened, took notes and asked questions while Elizabeth Kucinich, an organic food activist and filmmaker, moderated the panel. The farmers then talked about their challenges, successes and lessons from their work to help “rebuild the critical life system” of the American landscape and communities in it.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently banned genetically modified (GMO) corn in Mexican tortillas to help reduce GMO corn imports to Mexico from the U.S. and produce a demand for non-GMO corn.
However, instead of supporting the switch to non-GMO agriculture, the Biden administration’s U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is taking Mexico to trade court, said Ben Dobson.
Dobson, who is from Hudson Carbon, a non-profit on-farm soil laboratory in Hudson Valley, New York, said the agency’s self-serving move would be cutting the brakes on a market that could support U.S. farmers who want to end their dependence on GMO crops. (Related: FRANKENFOOD ALERT: Piggy Sooy GMO soybean contains 26.6% animal protein.)
Bob Quinn, a Montana organic grain farmer, said enforcing different systems of compensation for farmers is important for setting up a different agricultural system. Unfortunately, the current system rewards high yields instead of the cultivation of the healthy environments that make farms prosper.
Quinn explained that U.S. grain production has two goals: higher yield for farmers and higher-yield wheat needed by bakers. To address this, farmers transitioned to shorter, higher-yielding, gluten-heavy wheat treated with glyphosate.
But the combination is hard for the human body to process, which often leads to allergies and other diseases. According to Quinn, the transition to organic heritage grains could help prevent those allergies.
Reginaldo Haslett-Marroquin, a Guatemalan agronomist and the owner-founder of Regeneration Farms in Minnesota, said that the government institutions and corporations that control the food system are only interested in a model that has caused “a systemically and verifiable and quantifiable way of killing the planet in the name of food.”
Haslett-Marroquin explained that on his farm, they discovered ways to use modern scientific advances in technology to help them “engage the natural design and the most efficient ways of working with the land.”
Gail Fuller, a Kansas family farmer, spoke in detail about the policies that often hurt farmers and the land. To illustrate, crop insurance incentivizes bad management.
And because tillage and pesticides are considered “best management practices,” farmers who use alternative practices are at a disadvantage. But he said that farmers aren’t always willing to switch to alternative practices because “industry writes the farm bill.”
Fuller warned that one in four children in Kansas is food-insecure and the food that they have is often “low nutrient quality, highly toxic, food-like substances.” He also called for the end of the monopolies that control agriculture, the censorship of experts and researchers and ending subsidies for destructive farm practices and conservation programs that are a dead-end.
Fuller added that policymakers should aim to improve food, health, water, farmer welfare and quality of life.
Wayne Swanson, owner of Swanson Family Farm and consultant for small farms, explained why it’s crucial to grow localized farm economies and make small farms economically viable.
He said that for the project to work, the public must be educated on how to value farming that isn’t always high-yielding or aesthetically beautiful. Instead, Swanson said that the focus must be on valuing relationships and environmental and community health.
Dobson added that the farmers at the roundtable represented “food as food” and not as a commodity.
He also explained that meaningful conversation about how to replace agro-industrial techniques, chemical inputs and genetically modified (GM) crops will help “rebuild the critical life system” of the U.S., adding that this is only possible if people talked about the communities, farms and the ecosystems involved, along with international relationships.

https://food.news/2023-08-09-usda-must-end-policy-on-gmo-vaccines.html,"Watchdog group: USDA must end “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy on GMO vaccines in organic livestock","Advertisement
OrganicEye, an agribusiness watchdog, has demanded that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) hold a public hearing on the use of mRNA and other genetically engineered vaccines in organic livestock production, or else the agency would face litigation.
OrganicEye warned that the continued use of genetically modified (GM) products violates the legal definition of “organic.”
The request comes after reports revealed that the USDA and some organic certifiers have done nothing while commercial livestock producers started using genetically engineered vaccines in animals producing organic-certified meat, eggs and dairy products.

One significant difference between conventional and organic food is the organic label’s strict prohibition on GM farm inputs and ingredients, as detailed in the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990.
Wisconsin-based OrganicEye warned that instead of enforcing this rule, the USDA has sanctioned a “don’t ask, don’t tell” protocol that was pushed by Big Ag which allows producers to administer genetically engineered vaccines to animals and still market them as “organic.”
Mark Kastel, executive director of OrganicEye, said that the issue must be addressed immediately due to the imminent use of mRNA vaccines for livestock, which are currently being developed with massive funding from the government and industry.
OrganicEye said that it is unacceptable for the USDA to delay dealing with this highly controversial issue. The agribusiness watchdog said the USDA’s National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) must conduct a meeting of all stakeholders – not only with industry interests who want these vaccines, but also with farmers. “These people have a right to be heard,” said Kastel. (Related: GMO MEAT? Bill Gates now spending tens of millions to genetically modify livestock.)
By default, synthetic materials are banned in organics unless they have been explicitly permitted because they are considered “essential” to production and have been evaluated and determined to be safe for human health and the environment.
Congress created the NOSB in the 1990s to recommend industry standards for regulating these materials. The NOSB is a powerful advisory board, and the USDA cannot allow synthetic substances in organic production unless the board specifically approves and recommends them.
The NOSB was designed to represent stakeholders from all over the organics industry, including small farmers and consumers. However, the board has been misused and is now increasingly dominated by powerful agribusiness lobbyists, eventually becoming increasingly subordinate to agribusiness’ orders.
Kastel said the first question that must be investigated is whether vaccines are “essential” for livestock. After all, they are usually not required in livestock production, unless there are state regulations about the interstate transportation of livestock.
Despite this, many producers, especially those in industrial agriculture, continue to vaccinate their animals to “mitigate risks.”
According to Kastel, a USDA hearing would allow the public to investigate if there is any reasonable justification from anybody other than those involved in conventional livestock production for the use of vaccines. Kastel also suggested that animals don’t need vaccines, particularly those cared for “in a healthy environment with plenty of outdoor access and pasture for ruminants like beef and dairy cows on family-scale farms.”
Several vaccines previously approved for organic production have already been phased out and replaced with vaccines produced through genetic modification. At recent NOSB meetings, accredited organic certifiers revealed that they do not check if the vaccines used violate the prohibition against genetic engineering even though federal regulations mandate their review.
In response, the NOSB recommended that the USDA approve a regulatory amendment allowing for the use of these GM vaccines in organic production in cases where the traditionally produced vaccine was not available.
In a policy brief, OrganicEye criticized the move as “likely illegal” because in all cases, vaccines produced using methods of genetic engineering/modification are “forbidden by the national organic standards and are currently excluded from use.”
The agency did not enact that recommendation and has stated that it won’t act in this regulatory area.
Kastel said this means the USDA is saying they have no plans for new rulemaking and are only going to let things stand, insisting on a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach to regulating GMO vaccines.
In the OrganicEye policy brief, the watchdog proposed that the USDA devise a clear categorization for vaccines, review all vaccines for safety prior to approval, especially for the persistence of “foreign” DNA, RNA and antibodies in meat and develop a way to address concerns that may arise from that review, including removing such vaccines from the market if necessary.

https://food.news/2023-08-04-avocado-leaves-help-repair-injuries-major-organs.html,Study shows avocado leaves can help repair injuries in major organs,"Advertisement
Multiple studies have shown that avocado leaves are full of beneficial nutrients. Research also suggests that avocado leaves are a promising natural therapeutic alternative for restoring damaged organs.
In a recent study, researchers found that avocado leaf extracts helped repair heart, kidney and liver injuries. Details of the study were published in the International Journal of Phytomedicine and Phytotherapy.
For the study, researchers turned air-dried avocado leaves into powder and mixed it with 80 percent ethanol for three days. They then freeze-dried the mixture containing the avocado leaf extract.

The researchers observed 40 rats that were randomly divided into eight groups. Within two weeks, the rat groups received different treatments:
The study revealed that the avocado leaf extract showed favorable competition with commercially available drugs used for treating heart, kidney and liver diseases.
The researchers also reported that the avocado leaf extract presented fewer side effects compared to rifampicin, which caused significant oxidative stress on tissues in the heart and liver.
The researchers believe that the effectiveness of avocado leaves could be due to disease-inhibiting phenolic compounds and flavonoids which have anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.
The study suggests that avocado leaves are a potential alternative medicine for managing disorders affecting several major organs. (Related: Protect your skin from the inside out by eating nutritious superfoods.)
In another study, researchers discovered that avocado leaves can help treat lead poisoning in the brain and support tissue regeneration in the cerebellum.
Researchers observed animal subjects and found that after exposure to lead acetate, albino rats exhibited signs of aggression, inflammation and irritability.
However, their healing process improved significantly after the rats were given the avocado leaf extract. The topical application of the extract to wounds helped speed up recovery, resulting in complete healing after six days.
The avocado leaf extract also helped protect against lead acetate toxicity in the cerebellum.
Using microscopic examination of tissue samples, the researchers found that lead acetate caused considerable changes to the structure of the cerebellum, but the avocado leaf extract helped damaged tissues regenerate.
A recent study reported that avocado leaves may also have therapeutic potential against Type 2 diabetes.
Researchers found that avocado leaves promoted the regeneration of pancreatic cells and suppressed enzyme activity during carbohydrate metabolism, which are anti-diabetic characteristics.
Avocado leaves contain significantly more disease-inhibiting phenolic compounds than avocado fruit, making them a valuable option for managing diabetes naturally.
Avocado has 145.7 milligrams gallic acid equivalents of phenolic compounds per gram (mg GAE/g), while avocado leaves contain 178.95 mg GAE/g.
A separate study also found that avocado leaves can help reduce high blood pressure. Researchers reported that this could be due to the presence of the flavonoid quercetin, which is also a powerful natural antioxidant.
If you have both diabetes and high blood pressure, you face as much as four times the risk of developing heart disease compared to someone without either health problem.
Several studies in hypertensive rats have shown that quercetin has a diuretic effect and increases urine volume, which helps reduce blood pressure.
Experts recommend drinking tea made from organic avocado leaves to enjoy their health benefits.
To make avocado tea, boil the leaves and steep them in water. You can add natural sweeteners and spices of your choice before drinking. You can also purchase organic avocado tea from farmers’ markets.
If you can’t find avocado leaves or avocado tea, here are some healthy and delicious ways to add avocados to various dishes and beverages:
Follow a balanced diet and drink avocado tea to boost your heart health.

https://food.news/2023-08-04-niacin-prevent-covid-reduce-heart-disease-risk.html,"Niacin found to help prevent COVID, reduce heart disease risk and support overall health and well-being","Advertisement
Studies have shown that niacin, a relatively unknown vitamin, offers many health benefits.
In the second edition of the book “Niacin: The Real Story,” Dr. Andrew Saul wrote that orthomolecular physicians have discovered that the vitamin can help prevent heart disease and reverse arthritis.
Niacin was also found to protect against Alzheimer’s disease and address mental illnesses.
Dr. Saul is one of the principal authors of the book and the late Dr. Abram Hoffer, a psychiatrist who treated many patients with niacin, is credited as the lead author.

In a 2020 study published in the journal Kidney360, researchers found that niacin (vitamin B3) could help reduce mortality in Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) patients suffering from acute kidney injury.
Patients who received daily doses of 1,000 milligrams of niacinamide, a form of niacin, had a 25 percent lower death rate than patients who did not. To date, this COVID-related illness has no known cure.
Doctors in India also reported that niacinamide supplements can reduce the recovery time of COVID-19 patients by as much as 30 percent compared to those receiving only standard care. This makes niacinamide an effective supportive treatment and preventive measure against COVID infection.
Dr. Todd Penberthy, the author of the chapter on COVID-19 in the niacin book, has been researching niacin and its beneficial properties for 23 years. He believes that niacin can help reverse chronic kidney disease based on studies.
The human body converts niacin to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is a coenzyme found in every living cell and works with enzymes to facilitate chemical reactions that help produce energy.
Viral diseases like COVID-19 trigger an immune response that depletes NAD in infected cells. Without NAD, cells will die in 30 seconds.
Penberthy said people can boost their NAD levels by taking high doses of niacin.
Because NAD is required for more than 400 gene functions, the vitamin’s effects can help change the course of today’s most prevalent diseases.
If you have diabetes or heart disease, niacin could be an important supplement to take, said Penberthy.
Niacin has been studied for more than 50 years and many clinical trials have shown its usefulness in preventing heart disease, the number one cause of death in people with diabetes. Niacin can also help boost your insulin sensitivity. (Related: 4 Reasons to take Vitamin B3 every day.)
Because niacin has an incredible safety record, Penberthy isn’t worried about side effects. According to Penberthy, vitamin B3 is “unparalleled in its ability to safely reduce cardiovascular disease risk.”
In 2006, Mary MacIsaac from Saskatchewan, Canada, died at the age of 112.
MacIsaac was the second oldest Canadian resident at the time. According to reports, she skied cross-country and rode horses until she was 110. She was sprightly and even played the piano up until her death.
MacIsaac had a clear mind until she died and attributed her longevity to niacin, which she took for her final 40 years.
While many studies have proven that a balanced diet and vitamins promote health, the role of vitamin B3 in promoting longevity isn’t as well-known or accepted.
Niacin can inhibit the formation of plaque in the arteries, protecting the heart and brain. Advocates of niacin believe that it has the best record for lowering cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein (a). Niacin can also help elevate blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the “good” cholesterol.
Additionally, niacin has anti-aging properties that work at the cellular level. Because many deaths are the result of damage to neurons and blood vessels, the preventive effects of niacin qualify it as an anti-aging nutrient.
An epidemic of pellagra, a health issue characterized by dementia, dermatitis, diarrhea and death, ravaged the U.S. in the 1930s and early 40s. Research revealed that vitamin B3 deficiency was the root cause of it.
There were about three million cases of pellagra, with about 100,000 reported deaths. This disease was more frequent among impoverished Southerners, who died at a higher rate than residents of any other region.
After the federal government mandated adding vitamin B3 to flour, the pellagra epidemic ended.
In the early 1950s, Hoffer discovered that the psychosis linked to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia was similar to the psychosis diagnosed in pellagra patients. He then conducted a series of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on non-chronic patients.
The results of Hoffer’s studies showed that administering niacin doubled the recovery rate of patients compared to those who were given placebos.
You can support your overall health and well-being by taking niacin supplements and eating foods rich in niacin like chicken breast, liver, salmon, tuna and turkey.

https://food.news/2023-08-03-radioactive-fish-discovered-near-fukushima-dump-wastewater.html,RADIOACTIVE fish discovered near Fukushima renews concerns over plans to dump nuclear wastewater into the ocean,"Advertisement
Japanese plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) studied a black rockfish in May and found that it contained levels of radioactive cesium that were 180 times over Japan’s regulatory limit.
The radioactive fish was caught near drainage outlets at the TEPCO plant, where three nuclear reactors melted down amidst a tsunami in March 2011. Rainwater from areas near the reactors flows into the area where the fish was caught.

The alarming discovery reignited concerns over TEPCO’s plans to start releasing 1.3 million tons of treated wastewater from the former Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant by August.
A report from July 23 showed that the problem is still unaddressed, prompting questions about how dangerous the company’s plans are for the public.
Radioactive cesium has been detected in surface water and different kinds of food, such as breast milk and pasteurized milk. The amount of radioactive cesium in food and milk depends on several factors.
The most important factor is whether or not there has been a recent fallout from a nuclear explosion, like a weapons test or an accident at a nuclear power plant.
Depending on one’s level of exposure, cesium can cause diarrhea, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, coma and death.
TEPCO wastewater has been mixed with rainwater and groundwater since the tsunami. The company admitted that fish near the drainage outlets are unsafe for consumption because the concentration of cesium in seabed sediment in the area has measured more than 100,000 becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg). The maximum legal level is only 100 Bq/kg.
A TEPCO official explained that the company has regularly removed fish from inside the port since 2012 because contaminated water flowed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station port immediately after the accident.
In January 2022, a fish caught near Fukushima was found to have high levels of radiation. Authorities said that the fish had escaped from the drainage outlet.
Following the report, shipments of black rockfish caught off the coast of Fukushima prefecture were immediately suspended. As of writing, they have not been resumed.
More than 40 fish with cesium levels over the legal limit were caught in TEPCO’s port between May 2022 and May 2023. At least 90 percent of the fish were from the inner breakwater, where water flows from the area surrounding the melted TEPCO reactors.
The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) in Japan and the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have both approved TEPCO’s plan to release wastewater into the Pacific Ocean. The company claims the move is necessary to “secure space for decommissioning the plant.” (Related: Japan gets green light to release Fukushima radioactive water into Pacific Ocean.)
However, the process would take decades to complete using an Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS). Earlier in July, the IAEA said the plan would have a “negligible radiological impact” on people and the environment.
Paul Dorfman from Ireland’s Radiological Protection Advisory Committee warned that reports like the one about the contaminated rockfish are likely far from over.
Companies believing and pretending certain things are not harmful because it is convenient is “literally killing the planet,” said Celine-Marie Pascale, an American University sociologist. She added that most of the time, corporate interests “triumph at global expense.”
Meanwhile, officials in Hong Kong have declared that they will ban food imports from 10 prefectures in Japan if the release moves forward in August. Some Chinese wholesalers have already stopped accepting seafood imports from Japan.
Aside from concerns about cesium, TEPCO has admitted that ALPS, which it plans to use, may not be enough to eliminate isotopes such as cobalt, plutonium, ruthenium and strontium. The system is also unable to remove tritium, the radioactive isotope of hydrogen.
In June, Masanobu Sakamoto, president of JF Zengyoren, Japan Fisheries Cooperatives, said the group does not support the Japanese government’s stance that “an ocean release is the only solution.”

https://food.news/2023-07-20-piggy-sooy-gmo-soybean-contains-animal-protein.html,FRANKENFOOD ALERT: Piggy Sooy GMO soybean contains 26.6% animal protein,"Advertisement
Companies are growing bolder as they continue to sell various GMO products to unwitting consumers. One such company is Moolec, which produces Piggy Sooy – a soybean genetically engineered to contain pig protein.
Moolec, the U.K.-based company that developed this Frankenfood, said that it spliced pig genes into conventional soya to create a soybean with 26.6 percent animal protein.
The exact pig genes used in Piggy Sooy are a trade secret. Because of genetic engineering, the interior flesh of the soybean is a rosy flesh color.

That’s not all. Moolec is also working on a pea plant that produces beef protein. The company claimed that these transgenic hybrids will have a similar taste, texture and nutritional value as meat, but without the high cost of cultured or lab-grown meat alternatives.
According to Moolec, farmers apply conventional agricultural practices to grow the plants used to make Piggy Sooy. After the beans are harvested and processed using conventional techniques, their proteins will be used to make meat substitutes and other products.
Moolec added that the commercial adoption of Piggy Sooy could help eliminate the raising and slaughtering of pigs, along with the associated ethical and environmental concerns.
Amit Dhingra, Moolec’s chief science officer, said the company has worked on a “unique, successful and patentable platform for the expression of highly valuable proteins in the seeds of economically important crops such as soybeans.”
Dhingra added that Moolec’s achievement can help pave the way for the entire scientific community as it explores more ways to “achieve high levels of protein expression in seeds via molecular farming.”
The company noted that there is still no exact date on when Piggy Sooya may be available to consumers. (Related: FRANKENFOOD ALERT: Brazil approves planting of genetically modified wheat.)
In June, scientists found that CRISPR/Cas gene editing causes significant changes in the plant genome.
Researchers observed “chromothripsis-like” effects after the application of CRISPR/Cas gene editing in the genome of tomatoes.
Chromothripsis is a phenomenon wherein several hundred genetic changes may occur simultaneously in a catastrophic event. The phenomenon can result in many sections of the genetic material getting swapped, recombined or lost.
The researchers also warned that this catastrophic cascade of gene swaps, recombination and loss occurs in mammalian and human cells because of gene editing.
This is the first time that scientists have found proof that chromothripsis also occurs in gene-edited plants, and unintended genetic alterations occur more frequently than first suspected as they also occur across large parts of the genome.
Data also found that gene-edited (GE) plants are not safe.
When both strands of DNA are cut, like in the case with CRISPR/Cas, the ends of the chromosomes can lose contact with each other. When the repair of the break in the chromosomes fails, the severed ends can be lost, restructured or incorporated elsewhere.
Chromothripsis seems relatively rare in plants. CRISPR/Cas applications can also cause changes at genomic sites that are rather well-protected by natural repair mechanisms.
Because the risks cannot generally be estimated, scientists must investigate them thoroughly in every case.
The recent findings can help researchers learn more about the alleged “precision” of gene scissors. While new technology can be used to target and cut precise locations in the genome, the consequences of “cutting” the genome are, in some ways, still unpredictable and uncontrollable.
This means plants obtained from new genetic engineering (New GE) cannot be regarded as safe per se, and they may need to be thoroughly investigated for risks.
Without exact genomic analyses, chromothripsis can be overlooked. For example, it is likely that it also occurred in plants obtained from New GE that were already deregulated in the country, warned experts.
To date, the U.S. has no specific regulations for gene-edited plants. Additionally, the same regulations that apply to conventional crops apply to GMOs.
In May, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule on “Pesticides and Exemptions of Certain Plant-Incorporated Protectants (PIPs) Derived from Newer Technologies,” which now requires GMO developers to submit data that proves plants that were gene-edited to resist pests are harmless to other components of the ecosystem; don’t contain pesticide levels beyond those found in conventional crops; and won’t cause adverse side effects in consumers.

https://food.news/2023-07-13-report-humans-not-allowed-meat-dairy-2030.html,2019 REPORT: Humans will no longer be allowed to eat meat or dairy by 2030 in order to reduce “consumption-based emissions”,"Advertisement
A restrictive 2019 report, which resurfaced recently, revealed that consumers will no longer be allowed to eat meat or dairy products freely by 2030.
The report also claimed that people should be limited to only three items of new clothing per year and one airplane flight every three years. These “suggestions” will start in countries that “consume the most” to help reduce “the impact of urban consumption.”

The report, titled “The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World” was published in 2019 and sets out targets for cities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement ambitions.
The report allegedly aims to quantify and suggest ways for city leaders to reduce consumption-based emissions. This translates to enforcing measures that include reducing the things people consume, like food, clothing and travel. (Related: NO ENERGY FOR YOU! SF Bay Area to phase out heating appliances powered by natural gas.)
According to the report, the measures will be effective if they are first enforced among those who consume the most. The report also warned that “consumption-based emissions” need to be reduced by at least 50 percent by 2030.
The report details six sectors where the world’s cities can take rapid action to address consumption-based emissions:
The 2019 report was co-created and co-delivered by C40, Arup and the University of Leeds, with funding from Arup, Citi Foundation and the University of Leeds.
The report claims to be an analysis and not a plan, but the tone of the report reads like a plan.
C40 is a global network of mayors representing the world’s leading cities that are working together to address the “climate crisis.” The network includes almost 100 cities, along with 1,143 cities and local governments that have joined C40’s “Cities Race to Zero” campaign.
The cities that sign up for the campaign commit to keeping global heating below the 1.5 C goal of the Paris Agreement.
Without reading the reports and recommendations addressed to the “Cities Race to Zero” signatories, it’s hard to determine if the actions set out in the report are specifically included in the action plan.
If they are, both the 100 C40 Cities and 1,000 additional cities are committing to the report’s reductions in consumer-based emissions. It stands to reason that Arup’s network is committed to doing the same.
Arup is a global network of “experts” that claim to shape cities “in a thousand ways.” The network has over 17,000 members and offices in 46 of the 97 cities that make up C40’s global network.
C40 and Arup have been collaborating since 2009. They have worked together on dystopian publications such as Deadline 2020, Green and Thriving Neighborhoods and a guide for creating net-zero neighborhoods.
But there’s a chance that collaborations have pushed through with money changing hands.
The first C40/Arup report, titled “Powering Climate Action: Cities as Global Changemakers,” was published in 2015. In the same year Arup, committed to investing $1 million over three years in a research partnership with C40.
In 2019, the year the C40/Arup consumer-based emissions report “The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World” was published, Arup tripled its advisory support to C40 to $3 million over three years.
In 2023, Arup continued its investment in C40 with up to $300,000 a year to allegedly help C40 drive resilience and decarbonization in cities around the world.
In March, C40 Cities re-highlighted the 2019 C40/Arup consumer-based emissions report in an article titled “A spotlight on consumption-based emissions.”
C40 claimed that since the 2019 report was published, cities across the globe have started to map consumption-based emissions and studied ways to reduce them.
Starting on page 66, the report summarizes what they hope to impose on consumers. These plans are being made and agreed upon outside the democratic process and under false pretenses.
Some of the changes the report is pushing for include:
The acknowledgment section at the beginning of the report shows that it was written by people from the following groups and universities:
On paper, these measures seem beneficial, but in practice they are draconian. C40 and Arup’s activities must be halted immediately and their operations shut down permanently.

https://food.news/2023-07-12-12-prepping-skills-to-teach-next-generation.html,A self-sufficient legacy: 12 Useful prepping skills to teach the next generation,"Advertisement
The prepping lifestyle requires hard work and discipline. If you have children, you can help them prepare before SHTF by starting them young and teaching them useful skills like gardening and cooking.
Instead of just letting them waste time on their smartphones and computers, teaching children useful skills can help them grow up into self-sufficient adults.
As a prepper, think about your life and list the practical prepping and survival skills you’ve learned as you got older. (h/t to TheEpochTimes.com)

These useful prepping skills can help your children become independent preppers before SHTF:
If you have experience caring for livestock, you can share your knowledge with your children or grandchildren.
Children are naturally drawn to animals, and learning how to care for other living creatures like chickens, ducks, goats or even honeybees can help teach them a sense of responsibility and compassion.
Teaching kids how to care for different kinds of animals can also help them understand the importance of meeting the needs of another creature and sensitivity toward its needs.
If children at home are old enough, you can also teach them simple recipes so they can start cooking and baking.
This useful life skill isn’t just good for an emergency scenario, it can help them as they get older because cooking meals at home is one way to save money on food and dining out.
Teach them some of your favorite recipes so they can cook these special dishes for their own families even after you are gone. Before SHTF, it can help to teach children and grandchildren basic cooking and baking skills like how to cook from scratch and bake a loaf of bread.
Not sure how to start? Here are some tips on how to teach kids of different ages how to cook and bake:
Children under three years old
Kids this age can be tricky because they’re still very young, but you can start fostering an appreciation of food and cooking by letting them help with simple tasks, like washing produce.
If your child wants to help, let them wash the fruits and vegetables. Have some clean towels ready, and let them try a salad spinner.
Kids aged three to five
Kids in this age bracket can start learning some simple knife skills. Make sure to keep things safe in the kitchen by giving them a dull knife.
A three-year-old can practice their knife skills by cutting soft foods like cucumbers or strawberries with a butter knife or a plastic knife.
Teach them how to hold a knife: By the handle only, and not touching the blade. Make sure they also know how to pass a knife from one person to another safely: Point the handle toward the person you’re passing it to, with the blade pointing away from them.
Kids aged six to eight
Kids in this age group can start with some actual cooking skills.
First, teach them the basics of using a stove, but always with your supervision. Let them practice turning the stove off and on.
Teach them how to cook scrambled eggs and other simple “recipes,” like sandwiches and salads.
Have a pot holder or dry dish towel ready in case you need to touch hot pan handles.
Kids aged eight to 10
Kids eight and older may be ready to handle a sharp knife, with supervision. Keep in mind that you are the best judge of your child’s readiness to handle sharp kitchen tools.
You can teach kids how to bread food, like veggies or chicken tenders in flour. Use this time to teach them how to fry food. If they want to help with meal planning, let them.
Gardening takes time, patience and knowledge gained through the years of working in your garden.
Teaching kids how to care for a garden ensures that they also spend more time outdoors, under warm sunshine as they enjoy the fresh air.
You can also help them plant, grow and harvest their favorite vegetables.
You can avoid big messes by starting small. For example, you can teach younger children to plant and grow beans in cups placed near sunny windows.
If the children are older, you can help them grow a tomato plant in a pot on the patio.
Choose high-interest plants like cherry tomatoes, which are a tasty snack, or pumpkins, which you can carve by Halloween.
Not everyone is skilled in handicrafts like crocheting, embroidery, knitting or sewing, and these skills are some of the most useful ones you can teach young children.
As a bonus, these skills produce practical and beautiful results, and they also help improve hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills.
Other fun and useful crafts to try include herbal remedies, soap-making and woodworking.
Basic home repairs like painting a room or fixing a clogged sink or toilet aren’t taught in school, but these skills will be very helpful for young children.
Before you start, make a list of everything you know how to repair, typical home improvement projects and car maintenance.
Choose something that will interest your child, such as painting a room or repairing a bicycle, and ask them to help you. (Related: Basic survival and prepping skills that your kids should learn ASAP.)
Teaching kids about the beauty of nature can also help them appreciate nature exploration activities like bird watching, nature walks and tree identification.
As you explore nature with your family, you can also try fun, educational activities like learning the difference between a squirrel and a chipmunk. These activities will help entertain your kids and teach them observation skills that are important for preppers.
Enjoying the beauty of nature and disconnecting from technology can help foster creativity and curiosity in your children.
Exciting outdoor activities like camping, fishing, hiking and cooking over a campfire are great for children who love exploring nature.
Take some time off during weekends and teach your children how to forage for wild edibles while you are camping. With parental supervision, you can also teach them how to cook simple meals over a campfire, with adult supervision to keep them safe.
Power tools are convenient, but if you want to help your children prepare before SHTF, it’s better to teach them how to use simple hand tools. Knowing how to handle tools like a hammer or a screwdriver is an important skill, especially if you want them to be more independent.
Children may struggle with hand tools at first, but teach them patiently so they can learn how much pressure and leverage to use with different tools. With enough practice, you can even help them with simple projects like a birdhouse or a small wooden stool for their playhouse.
Every child comes from a family with a rich heritage of multiple cultures, but not all of them learn about these traditions.
Share important traditions and stories and help pass them along to young children just as they were passed down to you by your parents and grandparents.
Sharing family roots, language, customs and holidays can help preserve them with the next generation.
This might seem obvious, but not everyone knows about basic good manners and etiquette.
Teach kids about the importance of having good table manners, and tell them to always say please and thank you.
Good manners never go out of style. These skills are subtle, but they make a lasting impression in social settings, at school or the office.
Passing on your musical skills can help children develop a passion for music. Teach them how to play an instrument you are familiar with, or help them learn an instrument that they are interested in.
You can also share your favorite albums and genres with them, like jazz or classical music. Music lessons can be expensive for some families, but lessons taught by a close friend or family member can help teach kids musical skills and help reinforce relationships.
When SHTF, you can entertain each other by telling stories.
Older people know many stories from their childhood, and these stories are too valuable to lose. Share them with children of all ages, until one day they are old enough to tell them to their children.
If possible, make a book of these stories shared among your family and illustrate them with your kids.
As a prepper, it’s easy to dismiss the value of your skills and experience, but sharing them with the next generation can help enrich their lives and prepare them for future emergency scenarios.

https://food.news/2023-07-10-coffee-natural-remedies-that-help-with-hangover.html,Coffee and other natural remedies that can help you recover from a hangover,"Advertisement
When you drink alcoholic beverages, your liver breaks down the alcohol into acetaldehyde, a toxic compound that can cause headaches, nausea and other unpleasant symptoms. After a night of drinking too much alcohol, your body will try to eliminate the acetaldehyde by making you take numerous trips to the restroom.
Here are some of the symptoms of a hangover:

Fortunately, there’s something readily available that can help you recover from a hangover: coffee. But there’s more to it that you need to know.
Coffee is a popular hangover remedy because it contains caffeine, a stimulant that can help with some hangover symptoms. If you need a remedy for hangover fatigue, drink a cup of coffee so you can become more alert.
Since caffeine is a natural diuretic, drinking coffee can make you urinate more. This can help your body eliminate toxic substances.
Coffee can also help relieve headaches by constricting blood vessels in the brain. (Related: Study: Consuming walnuts found to reduce the negative effects of stress.)
There are some downsides to drinking coffee when you’re already hungover.
Caffeine is a stimulant, so if you’re already dehydrated after drinking, it might make your dehydration worse.
Drinking coffee can make your hangover worse. It can also cause anxiety, jitters and heart palpitations in some people.
It depends. If you’re only experiencing mild hangover symptoms and you’re not too dehydrated, you can drink one cup of coffee to boost your energy levels in the morning and relieve some of your symptoms.
But if you’re already dehydrated, avoid coffee and try the other remedies listed below.
Here are some hangover remedies that can help with your symptoms:
Drink water
Alcohol is a diuretic and can cause dehydration. Drinking water can help rehydrate your body and reduce the severity of a hangover.
Drink herbal tea
Soothing herbal teas like chamomile or peppermint can help soothe an upset stomach and promote relaxation.
Replenish electrolytes
Drinking sports drinks or fresh coconut water can help replenish electrolytes lost during alcohol consumption.
Eat watermelon
Since headache associated with a hangover is usually due to dehydration and decreased blood flow to the brain, eating watermelon may help relieve your symptoms.
Watermelon is rich in L-citrulline, a nutrient that may increase blood flow. It is also a delicious and hydrating fruit with a high water content.
Consume ginger
Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can help relieve nausea and vomiting associated with a hangover.
Try drinking ginger tea or adding fresh ginger to your food.
Eat a healthy breakfast
Eating a healthy breakfast can help regulate blood sugar levels and provide nutrients to your body.
Alcohol blocks the production of a hormone that helps your body hold on to water, which can cause dehydration and the loss of electrolytes like potassium and sodium.
Bananas are full of potassium and can help replenish your body’s stores. One medium banana contains nine percent of the daily value (DV) for potassium.
Get some rest
If drinking more water and tea doesn’t help, try to get some rest and sleep until you feel better.
With some rest, your body can eventually recover from a hangover.
If you don’t like getting hangovers, the best way to prevent them is to drink responsibly. Limit your alcohol intake and drink enough water throughout the night.
If you find yourself with a hangover the next morning, a cup of coffee might give you some temporary relief. Remember that moderation is key when it comes to alcohol and caffeine.

Apple juice seems like a healthy alternative to sugary drinks like soda. However, data suggests this beverage may actually pose a risk to children’s health.
Consumer Reports, a consumer advocacy organization, recently criticized the Food and Drug Administration‘s (FDA) final guidance on the limit for inorganic arsenic in apple juice due to concerns about possible health risks to children.
The FDA issued the final guidance on June 1, setting the action level for inorganic arsenic in apple juice at 10 parts per billion (ppb), a level that was first proposed back in 2013. The FDA’s testing revealed a decrease in inorganic arsenic levels, with many samples showing levels below 3 ppb and 5 ppb. But some apple juice samples still had levels of 10 ppb, leading to the establishment of the limit at that level.

Consumer Reports challenged the FDA’s belief that 10 ppb can be considered a safe level achievable through good manufacturing practices. The organization warned that the importance of lower limits on inorganic arsenic can help protect public health, especially for foods consumed by children.
Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, said “the action level should be lower than 10 ppb based on current science.” Ronholm also explained that because the majority of the industry had already met this level, the FDA’s action is “virtually irrelevant.”
Despite his concerns, Ronholm thinks the FDA’s recent ruling is encouraging because it points to a renewed focus on solving the issue of food chemicals and heavy metals. He hopes that the agency will continue to focus on and monitor these issues, taking action as needed if there are “troubling levels of inorganic arsenic in apple juice.”
Consumer Reports suggested that the FDA should instead recommend a lower level of 3 ppb. (Related: Michelle Obama’s juice brand fails health standards set by her husband’s administration.)
The nonprofit organization conducted its own testing in 2018, and results revealed that there were elevated levels of cadmium, inorganic arsenic and lead in 21 out of the 45 tested fruit juices. But the majority of the tested juices had inorganic arsenic levels below the FDA’s limit, suggesting that with stricter measures manufacturers can still reduce the content in their products.
Consumer Reports added that its own tests have confirmed that it is both feasible and necessary to establish lower limits on inorganic arsenic in apple juice to protect public health. The organization thinks that stricter regulations are necessary to effectively ensure the safety of consumers.
Some foods contain arsenic because it is often present in the environment where food is produced and processed.
Arsenic can occur naturally or result from human activities like the use of pesticides containing arsenic, or pollution from mining, fracking and coal-fired power plants.
Studies have found that exposure to inorganic arsenic may be linked to several health issues in humans, such as cancer, diabetes, negative impacts on birth outcomes and cardiovascular and neuro-developmental problems.
The FDA admits that it is currently not feasible to completely eliminate arsenic from the environment or food supply. But to address the problem, the agency sets action levels to inform the industry about contamination levels that exceed safety thresholds and could render certain foods unsafe for public consumption.
These action levels serve as guidelines to protect public health from situations where it is impossible to completely eliminate arsenic in products.
According to the FDA’s report, an extensive study spanning almost 10 years has shown that the average level of arsenic in apple juice was 4.6 ppb. Shockingly, some samples exhibited significantly higher levels, reaching up to 44 ppb.
The presence of arsenic in apple juice is alarming because it is a product often marketed to and consumed by children, who consume a larger quantity of the liquid relative to their body weight compared to adults.
The FDA also referenced data suggesting a potential link between exposure to arsenic and negative effects on the neurological development of infants and children. The FDA said it will continue to monitor the arsenic levels in apple juice samples. If any testing reveals levels above 10 ppb in certain products, the FDA may take enforcement action to resolve and address the issue.
With further action from groups like Consumer Reports, it is possible to reduce the current limit on arsenic. After all, the majority of the juices tested have inorganic arsenic levels below the FDA’s 10 ppb limit.

Spending some time under the sun is good for you, but there may be people who avoid sunbathing or walking to the park on a sunny day due to fears of increasing their skin cancer risk.
If you’re one of those worried about overexposure or skin cancer, you can eat superfoods that can help support healthy skin, such as berries and nuts. In addition to using natural and organic sunscreen, these dietary choices can help boost your natural defense against harmful sun exposure.
Consuming the right foods will also help protect your skin against the sun’s ultraviolet rays, in a way protecting your body from the inside out. Studies have shed light on the protective role of antioxidants, including vitamins and various nutrients, in the battle against harmful free radicals, which are often linked to skin cancer.

Because of these recent findings, many dermatologists are encouraging their patients to incorporate nutrient-rich foods into their diet to promote better skin health. The foods listed below are a natural source of essential antioxidants and offer a synergistic blend of nutrients that work together to maximize their effectiveness.
Avocados are chock-full of healthy fats. These “good” fats have a role in many bodily functions, including the health of your skin.
Getting enough of these healthy fats can help your skin be flexible and moisturized.
In one study involving over 700 women, scientists reported that a high intake of total fat — specifically the types of healthy fats found in avocados — was linked to more supple, springy skin.
Preliminary evidence also suggests that avocados contain compounds that may help protect skin from sun damage. UV damage to your skin can cause wrinkles and other signs of aging.
Avocados are also rich in vitamin E, which is an important antioxidant that helps protect skin from oxidative damage. However, most Americans don’t get enough vitamin E in their diet.
Research has revealed that vitamin E seems to be more effective when combined with vitamin C.
Vitamin C is also essential for healthy skin. Your skin needs vitamin C to create collagen, the main structural protein that keeps skin strong and healthy. Vitamin C deficiency is rare in modern times, but common symptoms may include dry, rough and scaly skin that tends to bruise easily.
Vitamin C also functions as an antioxidant that helps protect your skin from oxidative damage caused by the sun and the environment, which can cause signs of aging.
A 100-gram serving (about 1/2 of an avocado) provides 14 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin E and 11 percent of the DV for vitamin C.
Berries, which are full of ellagic acid, are a tasty and nutritious way to naturally boost sun protection.
Ellagic acid, derived from ellagitannin, is a compound found in different red fruits. Out of these fruits, raspberries have been identified as particularly potent in the fight against skin cancer, making them a great addition to your sun protection diet.
Carotenoids are the pigments that make fruits and vegetables yellow, red and orange, and they help protect your skin against damage from the sun’s ultraviolet radiation.
Some fruits and vegetables with carotenoids include cantaloupe, carrots, kale, spinach and tomatoes.
Curcumin is the plant pigment that makes turmeric yellow and it is known for its ability to destroy dangerous melanoma skin cancer cells.
Curcumin also fights the formation and spread of cancer by acting as a potent antioxidant that prevents the formation of aflatoxin and nitrosamine processes that increase cancer risk. (Related: Boost your skin health with astaxanthin, a potent natural antioxidant.)
Use turmeric while cooking to add a flavorful twist to carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, rice and other vegetables.
Not all fats are bad for you and fatty fish, like herring, mackerel and salmon, are foods you should eat more of if you want healthy skin.
Fish like salmon are full of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for maintaining skin health.
Omega-3s help keep the skin thick, supple and moisturized. You need omega-3s because an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency can cause dry skin.
The omega-3 fats in fish help reduce inflammation, which can cause redness and acne. Omega-3s also help make skin less sensitive to the sun’s harmful UV rays.
Research suggests that taking fish oil supplements may help fight inflammatory and autoimmune conditions affecting the skin, such as lupus and psoriasis.
Fatty fish also contains vitamin E, one of the most important antioxidants for healthy skin. Getting enough vitamin E can help protect your skin against damage from free radicals and inflammation.
Seafood like fatty fish is a source of high-quality protein, which you need to maintain the strength and integrity of your skin.
Additionally, fatty fish contains zinc, a mineral that helps regulate inflammation, overall skin health and the production of new skin cells.
Zinc deficiency can cause lesions, skin inflammation and delayed wound healing.
Mushrooms are a great source of beta-glucans that also contain compounds that can help actively fight the development of melanoma.
Beta-glucans from mushrooms can attract immune cells to the cancerous area, aiding in the destruction of malignant cells and potentially acting as a valuable defense against melanoma.
Crunchy and savory nuts like pecans and walnuts contain ellagitannin, which detoxifies harmful liver enzymes and stops carcinogens from clinging to DNA. This acid also makes cancer cells destruct and gets rid of harmful free radicals that cause skin cancer.
Eating selenium-rich foods like Brazil nuts, cod, halibut and mushrooms can boost your body’s antioxidant defense system, which gives you an additional layer of protection against the damaging effects of sun exposure.
By adding these selenium-rich superfoods into your diet, you can fortify your body’s natural defense mechanisms, bolstering its ability to protect you from the harmful effects of the sun’s rays.
Eating a combination of nutritious carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables and foods containing vitamin E can help counteract and mitigate the effects of the sun’s ultraviolet light on your skin.
This powerful combination of superfoods works synergistically to provide enhanced protection and nourishment, helping to maintain the health and vitality of your skin even with sun exposure.
Here are also some of the things you to avoid for healthy skin:
Studies have found that chlorophyll in plants and plant-based foods can effectively reduce the risk of aflatoxin contamination.
Aflatoxins are harmful substances that can damage DNA, consequently increasing your risk of developing skin cancer.
Note that peanuts are particularly susceptible to aflatoxin contamination. Follow a nutritious diet full of chlorophyll-containing foods to help minimize your exposure to aflatoxins.
Regular alcohol intake has been linked to an increased risk of malignant melanoma. Experts think this could be linked to the conversion of alcohol into acetaldehyde within the body.
This process can result in DNA damage, increasing the likelihood of developing skin cancer.
Nitrates, which are compounds present in soil, water and air, are commonly used as additives in cured meat products for their visual appeal.
However, mounting scientific data suggests that there may be an alarming link between nitrates and cancer risk.
Make healthy choices in your diet and lifestyle. Eat sun-protective foods, avoid drinking too much alcohol and reduce your intake of nitrates in cured meats to boost your skin health and reduce the risk of skin cancer.

https://food.news/2023-06-12-support-brain-health-lutein-brain-boosting-carotenoid.html,"Support brain health with lutein, a brain-boosting carotenoid","Advertisement
According to a study published in the journal Molecules, the carotenoid lutein can help boost brain health.
Lutein, a natural plant pigment responsible for the yellow, orange and red colors of various fruits and vegetables, has been found to support healthy cognitive function and help prevent cognitive decline.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in every nine Americans older than 45 is affected by cognitive decline. This age-related condition is characterized by gradual impairments in a person’s ability to learn, reason, focus and remember. Cognitive decline can also manifest as an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease.

The Molecules study highlights the potential of lutein to address that issue.
For the review, the researchers analyzed different randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving volunteers who received either dietary or supplementary lutein.
Next, the research team assessed the effect of lutein in three areas:
The researchers discovered that lutein supplementation caused “modest improvements” in all three areas. They also cited several studies that found “significant improvements” in executive function.
Although most improvements overall were slight, the researchers highlighted one significant finding: The groups given a placebo did not see improvements in their cognitive abilities. Instead, they experienced a substantial decline during the study. This points to the benefits of lutein for the brain – especially for older adults.
The researchers highlighted several mechanisms that could explain the health-promoting effects of lutein.
Specifically, they found that lutein has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which allow the carotenoid to reduce oxidative stress and activate anti-inflammatory pathways.
Data also showed that lutein helped increase blood flow to the brain while enhancing neural response. (Related: Choline: An essential nutrient for brain and heart health.)
The promising research findings suggest that lutein can help protect against cognitive decline.
In another study published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, researchers discovered that taking a daily supplement of 10 mg of lutein, along with other carotenoids, was effective at improving memory within one year.
Lutein naturally accumulates in your brain and retina. It is known to contribute to macular pigment optical density, which is crucial if you want to prevent eye diseases. Increased macular pigment optical density has also been linked to better cognitive function.
Research suggests that lutein, especially when accompanied by zeaxanthin, another beneficial carotenoid, can help reduce the risk of cataracts and slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Lutein is also effective at helping filter harmful ultraviolet rays and blue light, which is why some researchers call it “sunscreen for the eyes.”
Lutein is an essential nutrient, meaning your body is unable to produce this carotenoid. You can only obtain lutein from plant-based foods and supplements.
While there is no recommended dietary intake of lutein, it’s generally considered to be safe, even when taken in high amounts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies it as Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS).
It’s estimated that many Americans consume only around one to two milligrams (mg) of lutein each day. But studies suggest that you may need a higher intake of lutein to reduce your risk of developing AMD.
Taking 10 mg of lutein and two mg of zeaxanthin supplements has been reported to slow the progression of AMD. Researchers observed no negative side effects with this dosage, except for minor yellowing of the skin.
The Council for Responsible Nutrition also confirms that a daily dose of up to 20 mg of lutein is safe for the body.
Different vegetables provide healthy doses of lutein. The following leafy green vegetables contain the highest amount of dietary lutein:
Lutein can also be found in other foods, such as:
Lutein is absorbed best when consumed with fats because low-density lipoproteins are the main transport vehicles for lutein in your body.
You can try pairing lutein-rich vegetables with healthy fats such as EPA and DHA, the omega-3 fatty acids found in wild-caught fish.
Avocado, a superfood that contains beneficial monounsaturated fat and lutein, is also a great food for maintaining healthy lutein levels. Egg yolks are similarly full of good fats and lutein.
While dietary consumption is the best way to get more lutein, you can also boost your lutein intake by taking dietary supplements.
Lutein supplements are usually sourced from marigold flowers and mixed with oils, but they can also be made synthetically.
For your safety and in order to maximize its benefits, consult with a natural health provider before taking lutein supplements.
Other healthy habits can help preserve brain health, such as exercising regularly, getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet.
Researchers from Harvard Medical School say that the Mediterranean diet, which prioritizes nutritious fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, olive oil and moderate amounts of fish, poultry and dairy products, is linked to lower rates of cognitive decline and dementia.
Research also suggests that meaningful social engagement and mental stimulation through activities like reading, writing or puzzle-solving, can help boost cognitive health.
Follow a balanced diet and eat nutritious foods rich in the carotenoid lutein to support your brain health and vision.

https://food.news/2023-06-05-michelle-obamas-juice-fails-her-health-standards.html,Michelle Obama’s juice brand fails health standards set by her husband’s administration,"Advertisement
Michelle Obama, the wife of former U.S. President Barack Obama, is known for her health advocacy. However, products from her juice brand Plezi have failed health standards set by the Obama administration.
The finding is based on discussions with 12 independent health professionals and organizations.
After discussing with 12 independent health professionals and organizations, data showed that Plezi’s current flavors, which were released earlier this month, do not meet the requirements to be served at elementary and middle schools.

“Under the Obama-era school-meal regulations currently under review, U.S. elementary and middle schools may only serve water, milk or 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice with no added sweeteners (the regulations do permit schools to dilute juices with water) – and none of Plezi’s four current flavors meet these criteria,” a Bloomberg article stated.
Instead, all Plezi juices are sweetened with stevia and monk-fruit extracts, which the experts raised concerns over after dubbing them “non-nutritive sweeteners” and “potentially unhealthy.”
Although Plezi juices fail regulations because they’re sweetened and highly processed – processed foods lose most of their nutrient content during processing – studies beg to differ about the healthfulness of stevia and monk fruit.
According to a review by an international team of researchers, these natural sweeteners are not only safe for consumption but also possess antidiabetic, anti-obesity and other beneficial properties that make them excellent alternatives to artificial sweeteners and refined sugar.
On the other hand, the use of artificial sweeteners like aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal) and acesulfame potassium (Sunnett, Sweet One) has been linked to a higher risk of heart problems, including heart attack, and stroke.
However, earlier in May, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its own report advising against the use of sweeteners like stevia to control body weight. (Related: Build up your health with beet juice.)
Nutrition experts were critical of Michelle Obama for promoting a brand that may “ultimately be a less healthy option.”
Jerold Mande, a nutrition professor, explained that Michelle Obama “has been ill-served by advisers who convinced her to target 6- to 12-year-olds with a flashy, ultra-processed beverage that may not be any healthier than diet soda.”
Most children prefer sweet beverages like soda and store-bought fruit juice. But guiding them towards more balanced options is important for their overall well-being.
If you’re having a hard time finding nutritious and appealing beverages for your kids, here are some delicious alternatives to consider:
Water
If your child says they’re thirsty, always offer water first. Water is essential for many bodily processes, such as temperature regulation and organ function.
In relation to body weight, children have greater water requirements than adults because the former have rapidly growing bodies and higher metabolic rates.
Unlike other beverages, water doesn’t contain liquid calories, making it less likely to cause your child to feel full and refuse to eat food. This is important if your kid is a picky eater.
Naturally flavored water
If your child thinks plain water is boring, he or she may end up hating this essential beverage. Thankfully, you can encourage your kid to drink more water without adding extra sugar and calories by infusing water with fresh fruits and herbs.
Try different flavor combinations until you find one that your kid likes. As a bonus, your child will get a boost of nutrition from the fresh fruit and herbs you add to the water.
Here are some tasty and refreshing combinations to try:
Coconut water
While fresh coconut water contains calories and sugar, it’s still a healthier choice than other beverages like soda and sports drinks.
Coconut water also provides nutrients like magnesium, potassium and vitamin C, all of which are essential nutrients for children.
Additionally, coconut water contains electrolytes like calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium, which are lost through sweat after physical activity. This means coconut water is the ideal hydration alternative to sugary sports drinks for active children.
If your child is sick with diarrhea or vomiting, you can give them coconut water to help them rehydrate.
When buying coconut water, check the label since some brands contain added sugars and artificial flavors. If possible, give children unsweetened coconut water.
Fruit and veggie smoothies
If your child is very picky about what they eat and drink, serving them smoothies is a delicious way to sneak fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods into their diet. However, you need to avoid premade smoothies, which are usually full of sugar.
Instead, give them homemade smoothies so you can control the ingredients. Smoothies are great for children who are picky eaters because you can easily blend vegetables like cauliflower, kale or spinach into a sweet-tasting smoothie that your child will enjoy.
Try these kid-friendly smoothie combinations:
Blend the ingredients with unsweetened non-dairy or dairy-based milk and try healthy add-ins like avocados, cocoa powder, ground flax seeds, hemp seeds or unsweetened coconut.
Don’t buy smoothies at grocery stores or restaurants because these often contain added sugar. Make homemade versions whenever possible.
Because smoothies are high in calories, it’s best to offer them as a snack or alongside a small meal.
Unsweetened milk
Many kids prefer sweetened milk drinks like chocolate or strawberry milk, but plain, unsweetened milk is the healthiest choice for growing children.
Plain milk contains various nutrients that are critical for the growth and development of young children. Milk contains calcium, phosphorus, protein and magnesium, all of which are essential nutrients for bone health.
Milk is also often fortified with vitamin D, another important vitamin for bone health.
Some parents prefer giving their children fat-free milk, but milk with a higher fat content may be healthier for younger children since they need fat for proper brain development and growth.
Unsweetened plant-based milks
If your child is intolerant to dairy milk, you can give them unsweetened plant-based milk as an alternative. Plant-based milk includes almond, cashew, coconut, hemp, rice and soy milk.
Like sweetened dairy milk, sweetened plant-based milks can contain loads of added sugar so it’s best to buy unsweetened versions.
Unsweetened plant-based milks can be served on their own as a low-calorie drink or as a base for kid-friendly smoothies, oatmeal and soups.
Avoid giving your children store-bought fruit juices that may contain added sugar and other harmful ingredients. Instead, give them healthy alternatives like water, coconut water or fruit and veggie smoothies.

Preppers can learn a lot from the pioneers who survived without modern technology and many of the useful tools that make life much easier, like power tools and modern survival gear.
In the past, pioneers learned how to make bread without an oven.
When SHTF, you can make no-oven bread using the recipes below. (h/t to PreparedSurvivalist.org)
Frying pan bread is more commonly known as bannock bread. The recipe is simple, but you have to be careful so you don’t burn the bannock.

Bannock, which comes from the Gaelic word bannach, was once a generic term for bread in Scotland and other areas in the British Isles, where wheat and ovens were rare.
Bannock requires only a handful of ingredients, is affordable and endlessly versatile.
Ingredients:
Preparation:
Bread on the stick, which is a rather simple recipe as the name implies, was popular with mountain men and people who had sourdoughs.
If you don’t have a lot of time to cook or are low on supplies, this recipe is worth trying. All you need to do is wrap a long roll of dough around the end of a shaved stick and set the stick over the fire. (Related: Homemade recipes: No-knead artisan bread.)
The stick with the dough is usually inserted into the ground at an angle to the fire and turned occasionally.
You can also give the finished bread a pretzel-like texture by dipping a clean hand in water and spritzing the dough as it bakes.
Ingredients:
Preparation:
“Hoe cake” is a pioneer cornbread that was baked on the curved metal side of a hoe. Pioneers made hoe bread by placing a clean hoe next to the fire and letting the hot iron cook one side of the hoe cake as the heat from the fire cooked the other side.
If you have a cast-iron skillet, you can use it to finish cooking the hoe cake. It’s the same concept, but you need to flip the hoe cake from time to time to finish both sides.
Ingredients:
Preparation:
This recipe is a modern one, but like the pioneer bread recipes above, you can make it even without an oven.

https://food.news/2023-05-12-hangry-bacteria-spreading-toxins-making-you-sick.html,Hungry and angry: “Hangry” bacteria could be spreading toxins that make you sick,"Advertisement
Some people may feel “hangry,” or hungry and angry, when they miss a meal. But according to a study, bacteria can feel hangry too – which can make them release disease-causing toxins.
The research was conducted by scientists from the University of North Carolina (UNC) and published in the journal Nature Microbiology.
Adam Rosenthal, an assistant professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at UNC, and his colleagues from Harvard University, Princeton University and Danisco Animal Nutrition discovered that “genetically identical cells within a bacterial community have different functions.”

While some of cells behave normally, other cells act abnormally and cause illness.
The research team set out to learn more about the unusual behavior of certain bacteria within a community. For their study, they used a microfluidic droplet generator, a device made using newly-developed technology, and Clostridium perfringens, a rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the intestinal tract of humans, other vertebrates, insects and soil.
They separated single bacterial cells into droplets to study each cell and found that well-fed C. perfringens cells didn’t produce toxins. Only the cells that lacked nutrition did. (Related: Bacteria “gangs” defend their turf by forming “social networks” that release toxins to neutralize enemies, according to new research.)
Rosenthal hypothesized that giving the abnormally behaving cells more nutrients can help them “behave a little bit better.”
To test their theory, the researchers exposed the harmful cells to a substance called acetate.
After exposure to acetate, toxin levels declined across the bacterial community, along with the number of individually harmful cells.
The researchers said that continued study is required to find out if this behavior is exclusive to C. perfringens or if specific environmental factors activate the production of toxins in other types of infections as well.
Rosenthal and his team hopes that their findings can also be used to develop an alternative treatment for animals and humans.
C. perfringens is a common pathogen found in factory farms, particularly in chicken farms. The study findings could be used to develop a means for farmers to keep animals healthy without using antibiotics that may harm consumers.
As for humans, Rosenthal is currently working with colleagues at UNC to learn about antibiotic resistance, an increasingly prevalent public health issue that prevents modern treatments from working effectively.
The demand for food products raised without harmful antibiotics is increasing. Back in 2012, sales of these food products had increased by 25 percent compared to the previous three years.
Some say the overuse of antibiotics in food-producing animals could be linked to the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or “superbugs.” When superbugs are passed to humans, they can cause serious illness.
Antibiotics are used to prevent or treat bacterial infections in animals. Since the 1940s, antibiotics have been given to farm animals like chickens, cows and pigs to treat infections or prevent an illness from spreading.
Additionally, low doses of antibiotics are added to animal feed to promote growth and make the animals produce more meat or milk. Since these low doses were said to reduce animal death rates and improve reproduction, the use of antibiotics became widespread in agriculture.
But from 2015 to 2018, sales for antimicrobials for use in food-producing animals decreased by 38 percent. Strict legislation is currently enforced in the U.S. to ensure that no contaminated food products reach the food supply.
While it may be impossible to completely avoid antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animal products, here are some steps that could significantly reduce your risk of exposure:

Worried about where to find food when SHTF? Learn how to forage for nuts from various trees.
When SHTF, you can forage for different kinds of nuts to add to your food stockpile. Despite their small size, nuts are great superfoods because they are nutritious and delicious. Nuts are rich in antioxidants, dietary fiber, protein and other beneficial vitamins. They also have a long shelf life when properly stored. (h/t to FoodStorageMoms.com)
Below are some easy-to-find nuts you can forage for to secure your food supply.

Raw acorns are bitter because they contain tannins.
Fortunately, you can safely remove tannins by leaching acorns. This means putting the acorns in boiling water for about 15 minutes.
After the acorns are boiled, replace the brown water with clean water and boil the nuts again for another 15 minutes.
To leach acorns properly, repeat this process until the hot water is mostly clear. Don’t discard the brown tannin water; you can use it to help soothe sunburns, bug bites and rashes.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook acorns:
Beechnuts come from the beech tree. Beechnut trees begin to produce nuts when they are about 20 years old. They will generate nuts about every two years or so.
Beechnuts taste similar to walnuts and are rich in protein. If you want to gather beechnuts, do it early to beat squirrels and raccoons, which love the nuts.
You should also take note that beechnuts spoil quickly. Try dry roasting them not long after harvesting to make them last longer.
You can roast the nuts in a slow oven or leave them out in the sun for a day. Keep an eye on the beechnuts so squirrels don’t eat them.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook beechnuts:
Black walnut trees produce delicious and nutritious nuts. If you spot black walnuts, harvest them immediately because squirrels and raccoons might beat you to it.
Black walnuts can be difficult to open, so you may need a hammer to smash through the shell or outer husk. Wear an apron and gloves when deshelling black walnuts because the inside of their shells contains a brown oil that can easily stain your clothes.
Alternatively, you can scrape the husks away with a knife.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook black walnuts:
You can harvest butternuts in temperate forests. They can be identified by their yellowish-brown husks that often have a rough texture.
Butternut husks can easily be cracked open with a nutcracker or with two rocks. They are sweet, creamy and full of nutrients.
Once you harvest butternuts, consume them as soon as possible or dry them immediately because they go rancid rather quickly. (Related: 5 Tips for safely foraging nutrient-dense food.)
Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook butternuts:
When foraging for hickory nuts, look for shellbark hickory, which has loose bark that separates in narrow strips. You can also look for shagbark hickory, which has long strips of bark that shed and fall to the base of the tree.
Hickory nuts are easier to open than black walnuts, but it’s better to use a tool to get them open. They are loaded with oil and have a unique flavor that pairs wonderfully with sauces and desserts.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook hickory nuts:
Pecans are a type of hickory nut that are commonly found in the southeastern U.S. and parts of Mexico.
They are often used as toppings for salads, desserts and other dishes due to their sweet taste and buttery texture.
Pecans and walnuts have a similar nutritional profile, but pecan shells don’t stain like black walnuts do.
Harvest pecans when they start to fall off the tree. Pick them up from the ground or try to shake them out of tree branches.
Be observant when foraging for pecans. Make sure the nuts have recently fallen and have not cracked open. If possible, use gloves to protect your hands since pecan shells can have a sharp point at the end.
Once you have enough deshelled pecans, store them in an airtight container. You can refrigerate them for up to six months.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook pecans:
Pine nuts come from pine trees, but not all pine trees produce edible pine nuts.
These tree varieties can be found in western North America:
The most common pinyon pine varieties for eating are the Colorado pinyon, Mexican pinyon and the single-leaf pinyon. During autumn, you can harvest pine nuts once you notice the cones open up, revealing large seeds.
Unlike other nuts that are hard to crack open, pine nuts can be shelled by hand. But they do have one downside: Pine nuts are so small, making them difficult to shell. A hammer might not be as helpful, unless you use it with a gentle hand.
To avoid tedious work, you can pop pine nuts into your mouth and gently crack them open.
You can make pine nuts last for several months by storing them in a heavy-duty freezer bag and refrigerating them. Alternatively, you can store pine nuts in the freezer for three to six months.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook pine nuts:
Not sure when to harvest nuts? Most nuts grow well in the warm summer sunshine. Nuts should be ready for harvest by late summer or early fall.
Generally, nuts are great sources of vitamins and minerals. The most common vitamins in nuts are vitamins E and B6, folate and niacin.
Nuts also contain minerals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, potassium, selenium and zinc. These nutrients can help you maintain good overall health, especially in a survival situation.

https://food.news/2023-05-03-fruit-invasive-weed-boost-collagen-prevent-aging.html,"Fruit of known invasive weed found to boost collagen production, prevent skin aging","Advertisement
The sight of weeds in a garden may stress out a gardener, but in a recent study, researchers discovered that the fruit of cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium), an invasive weed, can boost collagen synthesis and even prevent early signs of skin aging.
Cocklebur commonly grows in backyards in the United States. According to the study, the weed’s spiky fruit could not only help reduce damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays, but it could also help wounds heal faster.
The researchers presented their findings at the annual meeting of the American Society For Biochemistry And Molecular Biology in Seattle.

The research team reported that extracts of the fruit boosted the production of collagen, a protein that helps maintain skin elasticity and prevents wrinkles. (Related: Boost your skin health with astaxanthin, a potent natural antioxidant.)
Cocklebur is native to parts of Europe, Asia and North America. It commonly grows in open, often moist places like river banks in agricultural land and other areas.
Cocklebur is widely used in Traditional Chinese and Native American Medicine to treat various health issues, such as a stuffy nose, headaches and more severe conditions like arthritis and tuberculosis. It is also traditionally used to treat rabies, malaria and leprosy.
However, cocklebur fruit seeds contain a chemical called carboxyatractyloside, which can poison and kill livestock when eaten. Humans who accidentally consume cocklebur may experience mild symptoms like an unpleasant taste and nausea. Severe symptoms can include abdominal pain, low blood sugar, vomiting, seizures and severe liver injury.
According to the research team from Myongji University in South Korea, cocklebur fruit extracts can be used as a natural ingredient in topical skin creams and other cosmetics.
Eunsu Song, a doctoral candidate at the university and one of the study authors, said cocklebur fruit has the potential to protect the skin and help boost collagen production.
Cocklebur could also have “a synergistic effect if it is mixed with other effective compounds, such as hyaluronic acid or retinoic acid, against aging,” added Song.
For the study, the researchers investigated the molecular properties of cocklebur fruit extracts. They also isolated particular compounds that could provide some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
Additionally, they conducted laboratory experiments in cells and on a 3D tissue model with properties similar to human skin to find out if these compounds affect collagen production, wound healing and damage from UVB radiation which is linked to sunburns, skin aging and skin cancers.
Results showed that cocklebur fruit extracts promoted collagen synthesis, accelerated wound healing and exerted a protective effect against UVB radiation. Cocklebur fruits harvested in South Korea also showed slightly higher antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing activities than cocklebur fruits from China.
The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds in cocklebur fruit make it an appealing cosmetic agent for anti-aging products.
However, despite cocklebur fruit’s skin-protective properties, the researchers emphasized that it should be used with caution since it may also cause adverse effects at higher concentrations.
As you age, your eating habits can significantly affect your appearance, fitness, quality of life and disease risk.
Your body also needs many different nutrients to support the natural aging process. Some nutrients may help slow signs of aging and boost skin health. Eating more nutritious foods can also help you look and feel your best as you age.
To age well, eat healthy sources of protein and essential fats as well as antioxidant-rich foods. These superfoods can promote skin health and boost collagen production.
Fatty fish
Fatty fish contains long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that can help fight heart disease, inflammation and many other health issues.
Studies show that omega-3s are linked to a strong skin barrier and may help decrease inflammation that damages the skin.
Fatty fish like salmon offer skin benefits thanks to astaxanthin, a powerful antioxidant responsible for the pink color of salmon.
In one study, people with sun-damaged skin were given a combination of astaxanthin and collagen for 12 weeks. Researchers reported that the volunteers experienced significant improvements in skin elasticity and hydration.
Salmon and other fatty fish are also full of protein, which your body needs to produce collagen and elastin. These two macromolecules are responsible for the strength, plumpness and elasticity of your skin. Eating foods rich in protein can also promote wound healing.
Fatty fish is rich in selenium, a mineral and antioxidant with a crucial role in DNA synthesis and repair. Selenium may also help protect against skin damage caused by UV light. Having adequate levels of selenium may reduce the severity of skin diseases like psoriasis.
Pomegranates
Like most fruits, pomegranates are rich in various nutrients, such as dietary fiber, potassium and vitamin K, which help support heart health.
Pomegranates are also full of beneficial antioxidants like flavonols, tannins, phenolic acids and lignans.
According to human and animal studies, the antioxidants in pomegranates can support healthy skin aging by decreasing UV skin damage and brown spots caused by excessive sun exposure.
The antioxidants in pomegranates can also protect your skin’s existing collagen and help you produce new ones.
Vegetables
Most vegetables are nutritious and low-calorie. Vegetables are full of antioxidants, which help reduce the risk of heart disease, cataracts and certain types of cancer.
Many vegetables are also rich in carotenoids, such as beta carotene and lycopene. According to some studies, a diet high in carotenoids may protect your skin against UV rays, the main cause of premature skin aging.
Carrots, pumpkins and sweet potatoes are some of the best sources of beta carotene.
Many vegetables are also rich in vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant vitamin that plays an important role in collagen production. Collagen is a key building block of your skin, but its production starts to decline after you turn 25.
Vegetables with the highest vitamin C content that promote collagen synthesis are bell peppers, broccoli, tomatoes and leafy greens.
Make sure you eat a variety of vegetables in different colors since each color represents different antioxidants that can offer health benefits for your skin and overall well-being.
Try to include at least two different vegetables in each meal and protect your skin using sunscreen.

https://food.news/2023-04-25-40-percent-meat-products-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs.html,Study reveals 40% of meat products test positive for antibiotic-resistant SUPERBUGS,"Advertisement
A study conducted by researchers in Spain revealed that almost half of the meat products in supermarkets could be hiding potentially deadly drug-resistant superbugs.
The study found multidrug-resistant E. coli strains in 40 percent of beef, chicken, pork and turkey products for sale in shops across the country. The study also revealed that E. coli strains that can cause severe infections in people were “highly” prevalent in the tested meat products.
Experts warned that antibiotic resistance is reaching “dangerously high” levels globally.

Drug-resistant infections kill an estimated 700,000 people around the world annually. That figure could skyrocket to 10 million by 2050 if not addressed immediately, according to estimates.
Multidrug-resistant bacteria can spread from animals to humans through the food industry. But data on the levels of antibiotic-resistant bugs detected in food is often unavailable.
To address this, Spanish researchers developed a series of experiments to accurately measure levels of multidrug-resistant and extraintestinal pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae, a family of bacteria that includes E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other bacteria that can cause health issues like sepsis and urinary tract infections (UTIs).
For the study, the researchers tested 100 meat products from random supermarkets across Oviedo, Spain, in 2020. The products included 25 samples each of chicken, turkey, beef and pork.
The results showed that nearly three in four meat products (73 percent) contained levels of E. coli that were within food safety limits. (Related: Antibiotic-resistant SUPERBUGS found in imported SHRIMP sold at Canadian supermarkets.)
Meanwhile, almost half (49 percent) of the samples contained multidrug-resistant bacteria or potentially pathogenic strains of E. coli. Out of this group, the researchers recovered and characterized 82 E. coli isolates.
The research team also recovered a dozen K. pneumoniae isolates from 10 of the 100 meat products, including seven samples of poultry.
Study findings revealed that 40 of the 100 meat products contained multidrug-resistant E. coli. The highest prevalence of positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli was found in turkey (68 percent) and chicken products (56 percent).
The researchers explained that the higher presence of ESBL-producing E. coli strains in poultry compared to beef and pork could be due to differences in the slaughter and production of these meat products.
The study also found that more than a quarter of the meat products (27 percent) contained potentially pathogenic extraintestinal E. coli (ExPEC).
ExPEC has genes that allow them to cause disease even outside of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Dr. Azucena Mora Gutierrez of the University of Santiago de Compostela-Lugo said ExPEC causes the vast majority of UTIs. It is also a leading cause of sepsis and the second-leading cause of neonatal meningitis.
One of the meat products was found to contain E. coli harboring the mcr-1 gene, which creates resistance to colistin, an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by bacteria resistant to all other antibiotic medications.
Gutierrez advised that manufacturers must prioritize “farm-to-fork interventions” to protect consumers. She also suggested that enforcing surveillance lab methods for further study of high-risk bacteria common in farm animals and meat could help address the issue.
According to Gutierrez, consumers should always cook meat thoroughly. Meat should also be stored properly in the refrigerator, and knives, chopping boards and other cooking utensils used to prepare raw meat must be properly disinfected to avoid cross-contamination.
Enforcing these measures can help reduce risk to zero, concluded Gutierrez.
Different types of bacteria can grow on animal products. This highlights the importance of safely handling and storing all types of meat.
If you are confused about the different rules for handling different types of meat, follow the tips below to protect your family from harmful bacteria found in meat.
Don’t buy meat that’s past the expiration or sell-by date. When buying groceries, buy meats last to reduce the time the meat is out of refrigeration.
Here are some specific guidelines for selecting certain meats:
Buy organic meat from trusted stores and cook food thoroughly to protect your family from harmful bacteria and food poisoning.

https://food.news/2023-04-20-fructose-consumption-linked-to-high-blood-pressure.html,Study reveals link between fructose consumption and high blood pressure,"Advertisement
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a serious health problem in the U.S. According to data, 47 percent or almost half of American adults are diagnosed with this condition.
Hypertension is a condition characterized by systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg.
Traditionally, doctors warn their patients to limit their sodium intake, which can cause or exacerbate high blood pressure. But a recent study suggests there’s another culprit besides sodium that can raise your blood pressure: fructose.

Aside from increasing blood pressure in adults, a high-fructose diet can also raise the likelihood of children developing hypertension as adults.
Fructose is a naturally occurring monosaccharide present in fruits, but it can also be produced by your body when the polyol pathway is activated. Fructose is the main ingredient in high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), an artificial sweetener commonly added to packaged foods and beverages. Although fruit sugar is very similar in structure to glucose, fructose affects your body differently.
When you consume fructose, your body processes the sugar for fuel storage. This happens so that the fuel can be used later to provide your body with water and energy. However, this has an adverse effect because fructose makes your body retain sodium, which increases blood pressure.
A diet high in fructose upregulates the activity of sodium transporters, which can trigger an increase in blood pressure. Additionally, it inactivates vasodilators while activating vasoconstrictors and can increase appetite and cause thirst.
When combined with other substances to form HFCS, fructose’s harmful effects at high concentrations are amplified.
For the study, researchers analyzed data from participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.
The study took a closer look at cardiovascular risk factors in Caucasian and African American young adults aged 17 to 35 at the time of enrollment.
The research team gathered both dietary data and blood pressure at the time of enrollment. The dietary information quantified sodium and fructose intakes.
Each participant’s blood pressure was taken at several points throughout the study: At seven years, 15 years and 30 years.
Consumption of sodium and fructose had a significant impact on the prediction of higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures during year 30 of the follow-up. The researchers concluded that following a diet high in both sodium and fructose during adolescence could influence systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adulthood.
Another study suggested that consuming fructose during pregnancy could contribute to the development of preeclampsia.
Fructose is vital for fetal development and is naturally produced by the body. Fructose production is increased when a woman is pregnant. But if production does not return to normal or if the woman’s diet also includes fructose and its derivatives, it can lead to preeclampsia, which causes symptoms like hypertension and protein in urine (proteinuria).
To protect your children and ensure that they remain healthy as they age, teach them how to have good eating habits. Pregnant women can also protect themselves by reading product labels and knowing the different names of fructose so they can avoid it.
HFCS is associated with many health problems. It appears as fruit sugar, d-fructofuranose, d-fructose, d-arabino-hexulose or levulose in product labels.
Make sure you avoid sugary food and beverages containing HFCS and eat a lot of organic whole foods instead. (Related: Vitamin C found to improve blood sugar and blood pressure control in people with Type 2 diabetes.)
Many food products, such as junk foods and various beverages, contain this harmful sweetener. Keep your family healthy by avoiding these products:
Some products labeled “healthy” may also contain HFCS. Review labels to avoid this sweetener and cut back on processed foods.
Teaching young children the importance of good eating habits is key to ensuring their overall wellness as adults.
Follow the tips below to prevent hypertension:
Follow a balanced diet
Whatever your age is, following a low-sodium diet can help improve your blood pressure. According to data, at least 90 percent of Americans consume too much sodium, which can be traced to overconsumption of processed and restaurant foods.
Maintain healthy blood pressure by eating a nutritious diet full of various fruits and vegetables. Reducing your intake of foods rich in fats and sugars and avoiding processed foods can help boost your heart health.
Exercise regularly
Regular physical activity can help reduce your risk of developing hypertension. The more active you are, the better. But even moderate activity, such as 30 minutes of exercise three times a week, can offer health benefits.
Engaging in physical activity regularly helps your heart use oxygen more efficiently. This means it doesn’t need to work as hard to pump blood, which can help lower your blood pressure.
Lose weight/Maintain a healthy weight
Eating well and staying active is key to successful weight management, another significant prevention method for high blood pressure.
If you are overweight, losing a little weight can help reduce the strain on your heart and lower blood pressure.
Don’t smoke/quit smoking
Like drinking alcohol, smoking has many adverse effects. Aside from many health problems, smoking raises blood pressure and increases your risk of heart attack and stroke.
If you need help quitting, consult your physician and ask about programs and resources that may be right for you.
Monitor your blood pressure
Hypertension is often symptomless. Take regular readings to monitor your blood pressure. This will allow you to quickly address any changes if your health takes a turn for the worse.

https://food.news/2023-04-19-reducing-daily-sugar-intake-benefits-overall-health.html,Reducing daily sugar intake to less than 6 teaspoons found to benefit overall health,"Advertisement
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), added sugar should not make up more than 10 percent of your daily energy intake. A recent study also found that limiting your sugar intake to only six teaspoons a day and having only one sugary drink a week could significantly improve your overall well-being.
The researchers who conducted the study highlighted the fact that consuming too much added sugar daily increases your risk of developing 45 different health conditions, including depression, diabetes and heart disease.

More details were published in the journal The BMJ.
For the study, an international team of researchers reviewed multiple studies to explore the link between sugar consumption and various health outcomes. The review included 73 studies from at least 8,600 articles that covered 83 different health outcomes in adults and children.
Data from the studies revealed that consuming too much sugar can cause health problems like:
The data also showed that a high-sugar diet may increase the risk of seven specific types of cancer, including breast, prostate and pancreatic tumors. (Related: Study links use of artificial sweeteners to increased cancer risk.)
A sugary diet was also linked to other health problems like asthma, tooth decay and premature death.
If you wish to stay healthy, it’s important to reduce your sugar intake because drinking high-sugar beverages like soda is linked to an increase in body weight. At the same time, adding sugar to your food and drinks can increase both liver and muscle fat.
The data also suggested that for each additional serving of sugary drinks per week, there is a four percent increase in the risk of developing gout.
The researchers warned that drinking 250 milliliters (mL) of sugary drinks per day is associated with a 17 percent higher risk of coronary heart disease and a four percent higher risk of death. Evidence also suggest that each 25-gram serving of fructose per day is linked to a 22 percent greater risk of pancreatic cancer.
Associate Professor Liangren Liu of the West China Hospital of Sichuan University said the umbrella review suggests that high dietary sugar consumption, “especially intake of sugars that contain fructose, is harmfully associated with large numbers of health outcomes.”
Liu added that data for the harmful links between dietary sugar consumption and changes in body weight, ectopic fat accumulation, coronary heart disease, obesity (in children) and depression seem to be more reliable than data for other outcomes.
Based on their findings, Liu and colleagues recommend reducing the amount of sugar you add to food and beverages to only six teaspoons a day. They also recommend consuming only one or fewer sugary drinks every week.
In addition, Liu said that while the link between dietary sugar consumption and cancer is limited, it warrants further research.
Sugary treats like candy and soda can be comforting, but reducing your intake of sugary foods and beverages is key to improving your well-being.
Follow the tips below if you have a sweet tooth but want to reduce your daily sugar intake:
Limit your intake of sugary drinks
Most added sugars in the average American diet come from sugary drinks like sodas, energy drinks, sweetened teas and sports drinks. Drinks that many people think are healthy, like fruit smoothies and fruit juices, may also contain a lot of added sugar.
For example, one cup (271 grams) of cranberry juice cocktail contains more than seven teaspoons of sugar (31 grams), which is more than the recommended six teaspoons a day.
Reducing your intake of sugary drinks can help with weight loss and improve your overall well-being.
If you are looking for drinks that are naturally low on sugar, consider water, unsweetened sparkling water, herbal teas, plain black or green tea and coffee with little to no added sugar or creamer.
Avoid sugary desserts
Most desserts contain little to no nutrients and are full of sugar, which causes blood sugar spikes that can leave you feeling tired and hungry and make you crave even more sugar.
According to data, grain- and dairy-based desserts, like cakes and ice cream, make up over 18 percent of the added sugar in the standard American diet.
For healthier dessert alternatives, try a piece of fresh fruit or some Greek yogurt with cinnamon or berries. You can also try baked fruit with cream and dark chocolate that contains at least 70 percent cocoa or higher.
Eat more whole foods
Whole foods refer to foods that haven’t been processed or refined. They are free of any additives and other artificial substances like flavorings. Whole foods include whole fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and meat on the bone.
Ultra-processed foods or packaged foods contain a lot of fat, salt, sugar and additives. These ingredients make these unhealthy foods taste good, making it hard to avoid them once you get a taste. Examples of ultra-processed foods are chips, sugary cereals and soft drinks.
Almost 90 percent of the added sugar in the average American’s diet comes from ultra-processed foods, while only 8.7 percent comes from foods cooked at home using whole foods.
Whenever possible, cook food at home instead of eating fast food or dining out to avoid added sugars.
If you don’t have a lot of free time, you don’t have to cook elaborate meals. You can prepare delicious meals by simply preparing marinated meats and roasted vegetables.
Avoid stocking up on foods and beverages with high sugar content
Keeping high-sugar foods in the house makes you more likely to eat them. To effectively reduce your sugar intake, avoid buying soda and sugary desserts like cake and ice cream.
If you want to improve your family’s eating habits, you should have a plan in place when the sugar cravings strike. Try stocking up on healthier alternatives, like herbal teas, fruits, healthy homemade desserts and low-sugar snacks and beverages.

https://food.news/2023-04-18-pork-producers-mrna-gene-therapy-on-animals.html,Pork producers have been using mRNA-based GENE THERAPY on animals since 2018,"Advertisement
Dr. Joseph Mercola, an osteopathic physician, has been avoiding pork since 2018.
Mercola takes a “whole-person” approach to wellness, helping his patients develop attitudes and lifestyles that can help them take control of their health. That’s why he is also urging them to avoid consuming pork.
According to Mercola, pork producers have been using customizable mRNA-based gene therapy on animals.
Harrisvaccines developed the first RNA-based livestock vaccine, a swine influenza (H3N2) RNA shot licensed in 2012. In 2015, the company developed an avian influenza mRNA shot. Harrisvaccines was acquired by Merck Animal Health in 2016. That same year, CureVac developed an mRNA-based rabies shot for pigs.

Sequivity, a swine vaccine platform introduced in 2018, was developed by Merck in partnership with Moderna. Sequivity can produce customized “vaccines,” none of which undergo safety testing.
This means Americans have been consuming pork treated with gene therapy for almost five years. More of the country’s meat supply is about to get the same treatment.
After all, companies are working on mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines for avian influenza, along with mRNA vaccines for cows. Lobbyists for the Cattlemen’s Association recently confirmed that they have plans to use mRNA “vaccines” in cattle, which might affect both dairy and beef. (Related: Why is eating large amounts of processed meat bad for your health? It comes down to the toxic additives and preservatives.)
When Merck purchased Harrisvaccines in 2015, the company also entered into a partnership with Moderna to develop several undisclosed mRNA “vaccines.”
This was slated to be a three-year collaboration, with a one-year optional extension that would allow Merck to perform research and development and commercialization of five potential products using Moderna’s mRNA technology.
Even if you only consume organic meat, you still need to look for products from reliable producers. Since search engines only provide a short list of curated and heavily censored content, it’s almost impossible to confirm how many pork producers in America use Sequivity.
Without that data, Mercola recommends avoiding pork altogether, including organic pork, especially since “organic standards do not have any rules on the use of vaccines, mRNA-based or otherwise.”
Since the Sequivity platform has been around for at least five years already, it seems reasonable to assume that almost all large-scale swine producers have made this transition.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this issue is that the industry didn’t tell consumers they were using novel gene therapy to develop harmful customized “vaccines” within weeks and without the required safety testing.
Mercola noted that other health experts only became aware of this issue because attorney Tom Renz started warning others about it.
According to Renz, consumers can be protected from gene-therapied pork and other meats with the Missouri House Bill 1169, which would require labeling of products that can alter your genes.
The bill requires that “fully informed consent must be given for all vaccines, gene therapies and medical interventions, and would require companies to share information about the potential transmissibility of gene-altering interventions.”
And it shouldn’t surprise consumers that there has been significant pushback by the industry against this bill.
Why are companies so against the bill when it doesn’t ban anything and only requires transparency? What do they have to hide?
It’s not a stretch to think that they consider Missouri House Bill 1169 a serious threat because many of them are selling foods that can have gene-altering effects.
The bill would also prevent Big Pharma’s attempts to use the food supply as a tool to distribute vaccines to unknowing consumers.
Renz warned that Big Pharma will do whatever it takes to prevent people from finding out that they have plans to “use food to alter their genetics.” Unfortunately, this means some farmers are also being set up as the fall guys.
Additionally, major factory-farmers like Bill Gates have legal teams that can help protect the torts that may come if the food supply starts poisoning consumers while the small farmers could be at risk of being sued if it turns out that the food they are selling is unsafe, even if most of them don’t understand what is happening.
If the corn growers, soybean, cattle and pork associations really care about farmers, they should be demanding that seed companies and vaccine manufacturers indemnify small farmers rather than opposing a bill that requires them to tell farmers exactly what is in their products.
Missouri House Bill 1169 would help protect farmers from being sued because it would force the makers of GMO seeds and vaccines to be transparent about putting potential gene therapies into their products.
If the bill is passed in Missouri, it would also help protect the American food supply from contamination with gene-altering vaccines.
In the meantime, Mercola advises consumers to avoid all pork products, including organic products, that may have been tainted with mRNA vaccines.

If you are stocking up on supplies and preparing for possible survival scenarios, you need to learn how to protect food staples like rice, flour and other items from various pests.
When SHTF, you don’t want to bugs or rats to gain access to your food supply. Detailed below are tips that will help keep various pantry pests away. (h/t to ApartmentPrepper.com)
Keep in mind that the foods below can attract pests like bugs and mice to your pantry or storeroom:

Common pantry pests include small beetles, moths and weevils. These bugs are more annoying although they are often harmless.
Pests like moths don’t bite, sting or do any damage to your home, but they can get into stored foods. In some cases, you might even see pests inside a completely sealed package or in a clean kitchen and pantry. (Related: Food storage tips: Keep pests away from your food supplies with diatomaceous earth.)
Most of the time, pests get into food back at the processing plant, warehouse, delivery truck or grocery store. Pests can get into products that have been opened, but they can also get into unopened boxes by chewing their way in or crawling through packaging folds and seams.
While you can’t see tiny bug eggs with the naked eye, if the food sits in your pantry for too long, the eggs will eventually hatch. The larva will then eat the food in the container.
To prevent bugs from infesting your food, you can use simple food storage hacks like adding bay leaves or using certain storage techniques like freezing.
Bay leaves
Place dried bay leaves in containers with flour, rice, or any stored bulk foods.
The fragrance of bay leaves can help deter pests and bugs such as:
Freezing
If you notice weevils in your food supply, you can kill them and their eggs by freezing them. Freezing is often done with flour.
First, place the flour in a freezer bag. Squeeze the bag to let the air out, then freeze the flour for at least 48 hours. This will kill any eggs weevils in the flour.
Make sure you don’t freeze flour in the original paper packaging since condensation may occur and ruin the flour.
Before repackaging flour in Mylar bags, leave the flour on the counter until it reaches room temperature.
Heating
Some recommend using heat to kill insect eggs.
When exposed to temperatures of just less than 100 F, insect growth will slow. At temperatures of 100 F to 120 F, an insect will die in a day.
At temperatures above 120 F, an insect will die in minutes. However, for this method, you will need the help of companies that offer thermal remediation services.
Oxygen absorbers
Add oxygen absorbers to jars, other airtight containers and Mylar bags when storing pantry staples.
You can also use oxygen absorbers when storing food using a vacuum food sealer.
Insects require oxygen to survive and removing the oxygen from the container will eventually kill any insects or eggs in it.
If you see a package of food that already has bugs in it, take it out of your pantry immediately. For some foods, you may be able to get rid of them and salvage your food supply.
If you find bugs or pests in beans or rice, wash and soak for a few minutes. The insects will then float to the top. Rinse the beans or rice grains several times and repeat until you no longer see bugs.
Note that you can’t wash cereal or flour if you find bugs in the container.
Check other packages to see if the infestation has spread. After confirming that the other items are pest-free, remove the rest of the items.
Carefully wipe everything down and make sure you thoroughly clean all the nooks and crannies.
Change the packaging and make sure every opened item is in an airtight jar or a plastic Ziplock bag when you are done cleaning. To prevent further infestation, you may need to clean the rest of your kitchen.
Don’t let your money and hard work go to waste. Before SHTF, follow the tips below to keep bugs and other pests out of your kitchen and survival stockpile:
Clean up messes
Many pests enter homes to search for food, but if you don’t feed them, they will go away.
Always clean up crumbs and spills on counters, tables, floors and the pantry. Keep the sink free of dirty dishes.
If you have pets, pick up their food bowls when they aren’t eating.
Take the trash out regularly to keep pests out of your kitchen.
Eliminate moisture
Keeping your home as dry as possible can also help get rid of pests.
Examine and replace leaking pipes or faucets. Make sure drains aren’t clogged and are working properly.
Change the water in your pet’s bowl regularly. This can also help avoid attracting bugs.
Seal all cracks and gaps
Bugs are persistent. If they can find a way inside your home or storeroom, they will try to get into your food supply.
Check the interior and exterior of your home for any cracks or holes. Examine areas near doors and windows.
Check spots where utility lines or pipes enter your home. Seal all holes with caulk or steel wool and repair or replace damaged window and door screens.
Regularly clean cabinets
Your cabinets should also be cleaned regularly to deter pests.
Set aside time to empty them and wipe down the shelves. Examine all items for signs of pests, including holes, dents or scratches on the packaging.
While cleaning cabinets, remove any expired items.
Use the right containers
One of the best ways to avoid pantry pests is to store items properly.
This means transferring all dried food items, including cereal, dried fruit, flour, nuts and rice into sealed containers. Use a sturdy container with a tight-fitting lid.
Keep produce in the fridge to prevent fruit flies. If you keep fruit and vegetables out, such as on the kitchen counter, make sure they don’t spoil.
Clean your kitchen and storeroom regularly and check for signs of infestations to prevent pests from getting into your survival food stockpile.

https://food.news/2023-04-03-food-safety-warning-contaminated-baronet-cheese-listeria.html,Food safety watchdogs issue warning over contaminated cheese; Brit dies amid listeria outbreak,"Advertisement
Reports have confirmed that one British consumer died from listeria amid an outbreak linked to contaminated Baronet cheese.
Food safety watchdogs recently issued a warning over the potential risk posed by certain Baronet semi-soft cheeses, which they said contained “exceptionally high levels” of the bacteria.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) advised consumers not to eat the affected products, all of which are made by Wiltshire-based firm The Old Cheese Room.

Baronet is a pasteurized semi-soft cheese with a pinkish-orange rind and pungent aroma. The cheese is sold in both small individual rounds and in one-kilogram wheels that can be cut down to order.
The cheeses can also be served sliced from a deli counter.
According to reports, one recall is for the one-kg Baronet, priced at £32 ($39.50) and with best-before dates of March 21, March 22, April 11, April 12, April 16 and April 18, 2023.
The other two recalls are for the 270-gram Mini Baronet, costing £9 ($11.11) and the 200-g Baby Baronet.
The Mini Baronet is also being recalled for three batches: March 22, April 10 and April 18, 2023. The Baby Baronet is being recalled for the following batches: March 22, April 4, April 10 and April 16, 2023.
British shoppers who think they may have bought one of the affected Baronet items have been urged not to consume the product and to contact their retailer. Additionally, shoppers were warmed to thoroughly clean any surfaces they may have touched to prevent cross-contamination with other foods.
In the announcement, the FSA and UKHSA warned that they had found three listeria cases “potentially linked to an outbreak” and that one individual had died.
The agencies did not provide any further details of the recorded death. (Related: CDC: Listeria outbreak linked to deli meat and cheese kills 1, infects 16.)
According to data, all infected patients had a closely genetically-related strain of listeria that was also found in samples of Baronet cheese. But that does mean that all the reported cases linked to the outbreak contracted listeriosis after consuming Baronet cheese.
Listeriosis is a foodborne disease caused by Listeria monocytogenes. People develop an infection called listeriosis after eating food containing listeria.
Listeriosis may cause the following symptoms:
Listeriosis can go away on its own, but it can be serious among these groups:
If you suspect that you are experiencing listeriosis symptoms, report your illness to the local authority.
Tina Potter, head of incidents at the FSA, said those with “elderly relatives who may have purchased the recalled items, and who are at particular risk,” should be aware of the recall and observe the advice.
Potter noted that certain foods carry a greater risk of listeria than others, such as pate, soft cheeses, smoked fish, chilled sliced meats and other chilled ready-to-eat products.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that at least 1,600 individuals get listeriosis annually.
The Old Cheese Room claimed that the product recall was only a “precautionary measure” despite the confirmed death. The company also told shoppers to contact them “for a full refund (with or without a receipt).”
The cheesemaker also announced that it has stopped making Baronet cheese until they “have found the source of the issue.”
You can get listeriosis from eating contaminated foods.
The listeriosis incubation period, or the time when you first get infected and when you first experience symptoms, may vary. Usually, it takes one to two weeks, but it can be as short as several days or as long as three months.
The following foods may contain listeria:
These foods have the highest risk of L. monocytogenes contamination, but listeriosis can affect almost any improperly handled or prepared foods.
L. monocytogenes is unique from other foodborne illnesses since it survives and even multiplies in low temperatures, including refrigerators and freezers.
Food that has spoiled breaks down and develops an unpleasant odor, taste or change in texture. But when L. monocytogenes bacteria contaminate food, the smell, taste and texture remain the same.
Follow the tips below to reduce your risk of getting listeriosis:
Prepare food properly and avoid products that have been linked to listeria outbreaks to avoid listeriosis.

https://food.news/2023-04-03-fruit-from-invasive-weed-prevents-skin-aging.html,STUDY: Fruit from invasive weed found to prevent skin aging,"Advertisement
Gardeners may balk at the sight of weeds in their garden, but researchers have discovered that an invasive weed common in American backyards can help prevent signs of skin aging.
According to one study, cocklebur plant (Xanthium strumarium) fruits can help reduce damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays and hasten up wound healing in lab studies on human cells.
Extracts from cocklebur fruit can also help boost the production of collagen, a protein found in many high-end skincare products that promise to “preserve skin elasticity and prevent wrinkles.”

Cocklebur is a weed native to parts of Asia, Europe and North America. It can be found in moist places such as river banks in agricultural land and other areas.
Cocklebur is commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Native American Medicine to treat different health issues, from minor complaints like a stuffy nose and headaches to arthritis and tuberculosis.
Native Americans used to brew cocklebur leaves to make tea for different conditions, such as kidney diseases, arthritis and tuberculosis. The weed was also used to treat health issues like leprosy, malaria and rabies.
The seeds of cocklebur fruit contain carboxyatractyloside, a potent chemical. It can poison and even kill livestock when consumed.
For humans, eating cocklebur can cause mild symptoms like an unpleasant taste and nausea.
Eating prickly cocklebur can also cause serious symptoms, such as:
Even though ingesting parts of the plant causes mild and severe side effects, cocklebur fruit and leaves are often used in traditional medicine.
According to researchers from Myongji University in South Korea, extracts from cocklebur fruit can be used as an ingredient for topical skin creams and other cosmetics.
Eunsu Song, one of the researchers and a doctoral candidate at Myongji University, explained that “cocklebur fruit has the potential to protect the skin and help enhance production of collagen.” Song added that the fruit may have a synergistic effect when combined with other effective compounds, such as hyaluronic acid or retinoic acid, against aging. (Related: Top 6 anti-aging superfoods you can add to your diet.)
For the study, the researchers analyzed the molecular properties of cocklebur fruit extracts and isolated compounds that may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
They also conducted experiments using cells and a 3D tissue model with properties similar to human skin to learn more about how these compounds affect collagen production, wound healing and damage from UVB radiation, particularly the type that causes skin aging, sunburns and skin cancers.
According to the study findings, cocklebur fruits grown in South Korea have slightly more potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and greater wound-healing activity compared to fruits grown in China.
Cocklebur shows promise as a cosmetic agent by increasing collagen synthesis. The researchers added that cocklebur showed negative results with higher concentrations.
While cocklebur fruit isn’t recommended for human consumption, there are superfoods that you can eat to promote skin health. Here are some great anti-aging superfoods to add to your diet:
Avocado
Avocados are a good source of inflammation-fighting fatty acids that can help keep your skin smooth and supple.
Avocados also contain essential nutrients that may prevent skin aging, such as potassium, B vitamins and vitamins A, C, E and K.
Avocados are rich in vitamin A that can help you shed dead skin cells, which leaves you with healthy, glowing skin.
Carotenoids in avocados can also help block toxins and damage from the sun’s rays, at the same time offering protection against skin cancers.
To eat more avocadoes, add them to a salad or your morning smoothie.
Blueberries
Sweet and tangy blueberries are full of vitamins A and C, along with anthocyanins, which are age-defying antioxidants. Anthocyanins give blueberries their beautiful blue color.
These powerful antioxidants may help protect your skin from damage caused by sun exposure, stress and pollution by moderating the inflammatory response and preventing collagen loss.
Blueberries are a low-sugar fruit that you can add to your breakfast smoothie or fruit bowl.
Red bell pepper
Red bell peppers are full of beneficial anti-aging antioxidants.
They are rich in vitamin C, which is good for collagen production, and powerful antioxidants called carotenoids.
Carotenoids have many anti-inflammatory properties and may help protect your skin from sun damage, pollution and environmental toxins.
Slice bell peppers and dip them in hummus as a healthy snack. You can also add bell peppers to a raw salad, or you can add them to a veggie stir-fry.
Papaya
Papaya is full of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals that may help improve skin elasticity and minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Papaya contains:
The antioxidants in papaya can help protect against free radical damage and may delay signs of aging.
Papaya also contains papain, an enzyme that offers additional anti-aging benefits by working as one of nature’s best anti-inflammatory agents. Papain is also found in many exfoliating products.
Drizzle fresh lime juice over a plate of papaya as part of a healthy breakfast.
Watercress
Watercress is full of the following vitamins and minerals:
Watercress acts as an internal skin antiseptic. It helps boost blood circulation and the delivery of minerals to cells, which can boost oxygenation of the skin.
Watercress is full of vitamins A and C, which can neutralize harmful free radicals and help prevent fine lines and wrinkles.
Add watercress to your salad for glowing skin and better overall health.

https://food.news/2023-04-03-food-supply-best-beans-long-term-storage.html,Food supply 101: The best beans for long-term storage,"Advertisement
Preppers know that beans are a must-have for your survival stockpile because they are affordable, versatile and filling ingredients.
But did you know that certain kinds of beans have a longer shelf life compared to others? (h/t to PrimalSurvivor.net)
White beans, such as butter beans and navy beans, are the best for long-term storage. White beans take only 45 minutes of simmering to cook, compared to 60 minutes or longer for other kinds of beans.
The shorter cooking time of white beans is essential in emergencies where fuel conservation matters, especially if your water supply is also running low.

While white beans rank number one in the list of the best beans for long-term storage in your stockpile, all beans are good for long-term storage. In fact, when stored properly most beans can last for as long as 25 years or even longer.
Ideally, you should store different types of beans so you have a variety of foods to eat when dealing with a long-term survival scenario.
Beans are considered a good survival food because they have a very long shelf life. However, dry beans take a longer time to cook.
If you plan on stocking up on beans, especially dry beans, you should also stock up on water, along with an emergency stove and extra fuel.
When choosing which beans to stockpile, you must consider other factors like cooking time.
Even pre-soaked beans take a long time to cook. This might not be a problem if you have a wood stove, but you will still need a lot of fuel if you have to cook beans during a power outage.
When cooking beans, you should also measure your ingredients so you don’t have to worry about leftovers.
When it comes to cooking time, white beans are your best choice. Red and yellow lentils are also good options since they also cook rather quickly. (Related: Prepping essentials: 11 Forever foods for your food storage pantry.)
Listed below is the simmer time (minutes) of different kinds of beans:
You should also consider the fat content of beans if you want to stock up on them before SHTF. Even when stored in sealed containers with oxygen absorbers, fat will still go rancid over time, especially if you live in a state with hot temperatures.
Fortunately, most beans are very low in fat. However, some beans, like chickpeas and soybeans, have higher amounts of fat.
If you live in a hot climate, you might want to choose other beans for your survival supply.
Here are two healthy beans and legumes to stock up on before disaster strikes:
Garbanzo beans/chickpeas
Garbanzo beans, also called chickpeas, are full of dietary fiber and protein.
One cup (164 grams) of cooked chickpeas contains 269 calories, 14.5 grams of protein, 4.25 grams of fat, 12.5 grams of fiber, and 45 grams of carbohydrates.
The same serving also contains:
Research has found that beans and legumes, such as chickpeas, and hummus, a dish primarily made from chickpeas, offers many health benefits. Chickpeas can help reduce post-meal blood sugar and increase insulin sensitivity.
A small study found that eating a low-sugar snack with hummus led to a five percent decrease in afternoon blood sugar levels compared with eating granola bars which have a higher sugar content.
Eating hummus was also associated with a reduced appetite and decreased snacking on desserts later in the day.
Because chickpeas and other legumes are full of dietary fiber and beneficial plant compounds, eating them regularly may also help improve the composition of your gut bacteria.
Lentils
Lentils are rich in vegetarian protein and can be a good addition to soups and stews.
One cup (198 grams) of cooked lentils contains 230 calories, 17.9 grams of protein, 0.752 grams of fat, 39.8 grams of carbs and 15.6 grams of fiber.
The same serving also offers:
Lentils are one of the best sources of iron. Iron is a trace mineral that your body needs to make hemoglobin, a protein in your blood that transfers oxygen.
Adding lentils to meals can help boost iron intake, which may be beneficial for vegans and vegetarians since they may be at risk of iron deficiency anemia.
Additionally, lentils can help reduce blood sugar.
In a study that involved 48 healthy adult volunteers, replacing half of the carbs from rice or potatoes with carbs from cooked lentils resulted in significant decreases in post-meal blood sugar levels.
In another study that included more than 3,000 participants, researchers reported that people with the highest intake of lentils and other legumes had the lowest rates of diabetes.
Lentil sprouts may also help heart health by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL or “bad”) cholesterol and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL or “good” cholesterol.
If you are on a tight prepping budget, stock up on dry beans since they are often very cheap. To save money, choose the cheapest beans.
As of writing, these are the cheapest beans and lentils:
Lastly, when choosing which beans to stockpile for emergencies, consider how you will use them.
Beans are a versatile ingredient. White beans are usually considered the most versatile and you can use them to make dips, spreads and sauces. White beans can also be used to make traditional bean recipes like casseroles.
Soybeans are another versatile bean and you can use them to make soymilk and tofu.
When gathering supplies for your stockpile, make sure you don’t waste your money by buying emergency foods you don’t like or eat in your daily life.

https://food.news/2023-04-03-food-dyes-damage-dna-structure-cause-cancer.html,Research shows food dyes can damage DNA structure and cause cancer,"Advertisement
According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), common food dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5 are made from petroleum and pose many health risks.
The health risks linked to these artificial colors in food include hyperactivity in children, allergic reactions and cancer.
Back in 2008, the CSPI petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the use of harmful food dyes.
The British government and the European Union took action to help end the use of dyes throughout Europe. Unfortunately, at least 15 million pounds of food color additives are still sold annually in the United States.

These food dyes are used to make food more appealing and increase sales as a result. Adding to the issue of harmful food dyes is the mindset of consumers preferring food that they think looks “fresh and attractive.” Sadly, this food misconception is held by many shoppers in the country. (Related: Candy carcinogens: Petroleum-based additives are being used in popular children’s candy.)
Several food dyes have already been banned because of the health problems associated with them. But some are still permitted by the FDA.
According to research, some of these food dyes, like Red No. 3, can damage DNA in human liver cells and disrupt the function of the thyroid.
Parents should also think twice when buying groceries because children who consume food with Red No. 3 are at greater risk for a lifetime of health problems. Additionally, children’s foods often have the most dyes in them.
Michael F. Jacobson, CSPI’s executive director, warned that food dyes are synthetic chemicals that do not improve the nutritional quality or safety of foods. Instead, these dyes only “trigger behavior problems in children and, possibly, cancer in anybody.”
The FDA has not done much to eliminate Red No. 3 from the food supply. The agency recognized its potential to cause cancer as early as 1985, and banned it from any products that go on the skin. However, food dyes are still being used in foods and many of Big Pharma’s medications.
In September 2012, the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported that Red Dye No. 3 causes cancer in animals, which suggests that the same thing could happen to humans. Data also suggests that some dyes consumers are often exposed to are carcinogenic. Yet, pressure from the food additive industry keeps the FDA from banning these dyes altogether.
Data from the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology revealed that certain consumable dyes can harm the pituitary gland and sperm in humans. This means food dyes can harm your mental and physical health, as well as your reproductive health.
Red No. 3 (erythrosine) is a cherry-red coloring that is often used in candy, popsicles and cake-decorating gels.
Meanwhile, Red No. 40 (Allura Red) is a dark red dye that is used in candy, cereals, condiments and sports drinks. It is made from petroleum and is approved by the FDA for use in foods and drinks.
According to research, artificial food dyes are linked to hyperactivity, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some studies have also suggested a connection between the consumption of products with food dyes and increased ADHD or hyperactivity in children.
Foods that contain red food dye
Red dye 40 is one of the most popular color additives. Most food products that come in a package are processed and often contain food dyes such as red dye 40.
When buying groceries, check the ingredients list for red dye 40, which can also be listed as:
You should also keep in mind that ingredients are listed on food labels by weight.
Foods that commonly use red dye 40 include:
To avoid dyes, you should take note of the foods that you are purchasing that have dye in them, then try a healthy alternative.
If your kids love cereal that contains food dye, find one that doesn’t. Then explain to your family why you made the switch. You should also tell teach your family to read labels to avoid food dyes.
It can be hard to determine the exact cause of certain side effects because red dye is commonly used with other food additives that may also lead to symptoms.
Potential side effects of the food dye may include:
Additionally, red dye 40 contains benzene, a known cancer-causing substance.
If you suspect that your child has a red dye allergy, screen for red dye 40 intolerance at home.
First, try eliminating all foods with red dye 40 for one or two weeks. This can result in an improvement in behavior.
However, it might be hard to confirm how the dye affects your children until you reintroduce foods containing the dyes and observe their reactions.
Remember that medication for children, like chewable tablets or liquid cough syrups, can also contain food dyes. To avoid the dyes, opt for dye-free versions.
These dangerous food dyes are in too many products that both children and adults consume, yet most consumers don’t think twice about consuming or using them. Take action now and protect your loved ones from the health problems linked to food dyes like cancer before it’s too late.

As a prepper, it’s important to get your preps ready for different survival scenarios. This means even if you have a bug-out bag, you should take the time to learn how to forage for wild edible plants.
If SHTF and you lose your gear or run out of supplies, knowing how to conduct the universal edibility test can help you find wild herbs and plants that are safe to eat. (h/t to TruePrepper.com)
The universal edibility test will guide you through a detailed process to determine which plants or plant parts are safe to eat.
While the test may seem tedious, doing each of these steps properly ensures that you can stay safe and avoid poisonous plants while trying new plants.

Through the test, you will gradually expose yourself to the plant in a controlled manner. It will also help you monitor any symptoms that may develop between exposure.
This wilderness survival skill will be useful both in the wild and in your own backyard after dealing with a long-term scenario where your food supply may run out.
If you are planning to do the universal edibility test, focus on a plant that you can harvest a lot of.
The universal edibility test is a thorough and lengthy process, and the last thing you want to do when your supplies are running out is to waste time doing it if you don’t have plenty of the plant you are testing.
Start by putting all the plant parts into separate piles for testing:
Make sure you try each part of the plant separately since some components could be toxic while others are edible. One example is rhubarb, where the plant stalks are edible but the leaves are toxic.
You should also check the plant you forage. It must be in good shape, not rotting and doesn’t have any insects in this step. (Related: Prepper foraging tips: 6 Wild lettuce lookalikes to avoid.)
Picking a part of the plant that you can harvest a lot will help make sure that the time you spend on the test is worth it.
If the plant you select has an unpleasant odor, do not eat that part of the plant. Strong or acidic smells should be avoided.
Avoid any plant or part that smells like almonds since that is an indicator of a toxic compound.
Touch a piece of the plant to your wrist for 15 minutes. If you experience itching, burning or numbness, do not eat that plant part.
Wait for eight hours until moving on to the next step to check for the development of rashes or other reactions. Do not eat anything during this step.
If you want, you can cook the pieces of the plant for this. Prepare it as you would eat other vegetables.
Cooking plants is preferred because some plants are toxic when eaten raw, but not when cooked.
Once the plant part is prepared, touch it gently to your lips to test for any burning, itching or numbness. If you experience any of these side effects in the next three minutes, do not eat that part of the plant.
Once you confirm that you can safely touch the plant to your skin, try placing a small portion of the plant in your mouth.
Place the plant on your tongue for 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, chew the plant and then hold it in your mouth for another 15 minutes without swallowing.
If the plant tastes soapy or bitter, spit it out. Do not eat that part of the plant.
Swallow the plant part. Wait for at least eight hours for any adverse reactions.
If you don’t notice any negative side effects, prepare at least 1/3 cup of that plant part and eat it.
If you have no reaction after waiting another eight hours, then that part of the plant is edible.
Keep in mind that you need to repeat this entire process for all of the parts of the plant. In some cases, the entire plant could be edible, but some plants may have select parts that are edible.
Here are more tips that can help you forage for wild edibles safely when SHTF:
Do your research
When foraging for plants, make sure you can identify a plant properly before touching or consuming it.
Improve your foraging skills by attending plant walks with an expert, studying basic botany, cross-referencing different illustrated and updated guidebooks, or using educational websites.
Familiarize yourself with the area
Study up on the area you plan to forage. Read up on poisonous or endangered plants that grow there, and find out what edibles are abundant.
Avoid locations near factories, golf courses, roads, or places where the water and soil could be contaminated. Look for off-trail areas away from human activity, which are usually safer.
Harvest responsibly
Check local land management guidelines for any harvesting or foraging limits. Forage only in areas and amounts that are permitted so you don’t get in trouble.
Take only what you need and leave enough for the wildlife and for regrowth. This means taking no more than five percent of one species in a certain area.
Look for edible weeds
When foraging, look for weedy patches where edible species grow in abundance. Look for edible weeds like dandelion and nettle.
Walk lightly
Be mindful of your impact when venturing off the trail while foraging.
Leave no trace and walk on durable surfaces like logs and rocks. Avoid trampling other flora as you explore an area.
Read up on poisonous plants and mushrooms
Once you learn how to recognize edible plants, take the time to also learn how to identify poisonous plants.
Some poisonous plants can give you a rash, but others could kill you if you consume enough of them. Learn how to recognize the traits of toxic species, especially those that look similar to edible and medicinal plants.
If you want to save time, buy and review an illustrated edible plant guide.
Remember that the universal edibility test does not work for mushrooms or other types of fungus. If you want to forage for mushrooms, get a mushroom guide.
Learning about local plants using a guide may be easier, but knowing how to test a plant’s edibility is a useful skill for any prepper.

Hershey’s CFO Steve Voskiul has announced that the company will be removing the toxic heavy metals found in their chocolate.
This announcement comes after Consumer Reports tested Hershey’s chocolate and discovered traces of lead and cadmium in the chocolate. Studies have revealed that these heavy metals can cause cancer and reproductive health problems when ingested.
Consumer Reports revealed last year that “dark chocolate bars contain cadmium and lead – two heavy metals linked to a host of health problems in children and adults.” Consumer Reports conducted a test on 28 different chocolate brands to find out which ones contained these heavy metals.

The shocking results revealed that all chocolates contained heavy metals, but Hershey’s dark chocolate bar contained the most amount of lead – 265 percent more than California’s maximum allowable dose level.
Lily’s, another chocolate brand from Hershey’s, was rated “high in lead” and “high in both lead and cadmium.”‘ Lily’s “Extra Dark Chocolate” bar tested for 144 percent in lead and their “Extremely Dark Chocolate” bar tested at 143 percent lead and 101 percent more cadmium than the allowable dose level.
Consumer Reports warned that “heavy metal poses particular concerns and no amount of it is considered safe.” (Related: Dr. Bryan Ardis says compound from licorice root may stop hyperclotting caused by venom peptides.)
Voskiul insisted that cadmium and lead are found in Hershey’s products because the metals are naturally occurring minerals in agriculture that get transferred into the product via cocoa beans. Still, the fact remains that out of the 28 brands tested, Hershey’s had some of the highest levels of lead and cadmium.
Consumer Reports focused on the dark chocolate bars made by Hershey’s at the end of 2022. The organization cautioned that they “contained possibly harmful levels of lead, cadmium or both for people who eat more than one ounce per day.” The three bars mentioned weigh in at 1.45 ounces and 2.8 ounces.
This announcement has led to a class action lawsuit against the Hershey company for its “deceptive and misleading business practices.”
The plaintiffs argued that Hershey’s didn’t disclose on the products’ packaging that the chocolates contained lead and cadmium.
Lead is a dangerous metal, especially when consumed by pregnant women and children. Researchers also warned that there is no level of lead that is safe.
Tunde Akinleye, the CR food safety researcher who led the testing project, explained that consistent, long-term exposure to small amounts of heavy metals can result in many health problems.
The danger is greatest for pregnant women and young children because heavy metals can cause developmental problems, affect brain development and result in lower IQ.
There are also health risks for people of any age. For example, frequent exposure to lead in adults may cause hypertension (high blood pressure), immune system suppression, kidney damage, nervous system problems and reproductive issues.
According to the lawsuit, children, specifically those younger than six, are prone to lead poisoning that can lead to developmental and health problems.
Cadmium is also mentioned as a product that is used in various materials like batteries, pigments, metal coatings and plastics. The metal is also found in cigarette smoke and is known as carcinogenic to humans.
With the news about Hershey’s chocolate containing toxic heavy metals, it’s better to make changes to your snacking habits.
The cacao bean that’s used to make chocolate is full of heart-healthy flavonols and antioxidants. According to a study, people with hypertension who consumed chocolate bars with at least 70 percent cacao showed improved blood vessel flexibility.
Follow the tips below to make sure that the chocolates you eat are actually good for you:
Check the ingredients list
When buying chocolate, read the ingredients list. Like other food products, fewer ingredients are usually better.
Keep in mind that true chocolate is made with only cacao beans, cocoa solids and sugar.
Buy products that are at least 70 percent cocoa or cacao
The higher the percentage of cocoa or cacao, the less sugar the chocolate contains.
A bar that is 70 percent cocoa or cacao (the terms are often used interchangeably on labels) will have 30 percent sugar. A bar with 85 percent cocoa or cacao will contain only about 15 percent sugar.
Dark chocolate contains at least 50 percent cacao, has a more pronounced chocolate flavor and is a good source of heart-healthy flavanols and antioxidants from the cacao.
Milk chocolate, or chocolate products with 49 percent or less cacao, also contains milk solids and additional sugar, resulting in a sweeter taste. Despite the name, white chocolate does not contain any cacao, only sugar, milk solids and cocoa butter.
If a bar is not labeled with a percentage, this means it’s probably full of sugar. Avoid chocolate with ingredients like artificial colors or flavors and high-fructose corn syrup.
Research has found that a chocolate bar with 70 percent cacao offers health benefits, and that 85 percent dark chocolate can help boost your mood.
Read up on good and bad additional ingredients
Additional ingredients like nuts, which contain healthy fats, can add more nutritional benefits to chocolate.
On the other hand, flavors like caramel only add extra sugar and have no nutritional value.
Choose chocolates with lower sugar
Try looking for chocolates with only eight grams or less per ounce.
Bars sweetened with agave, coconut sugar, dates or honey are fine, but those sweeteners still contain calories that will elevate your blood sugar.
If you have diabetes, look for products made with sugar alternatives such as stevia.
Follow recommended serving sizes
While dark chocolates are considered a healthy treat, read the nutrition facts and know the recommended serving.
Try to stick to one to two ounces of chocolate per day.

https://food.news/2023-03-27-nutrient-therapy-helps-with-mental-health-issues.html,Brain food: Nutrient therapy can help address mental health issues,"Advertisement
Health experts have made significant advances in researching and treating mental health problems. But despite the development of new medications to control various mental health issues, mental illness is still a persistent issue in America.
It is common knowledge that following a balanced diet is key to maintaining overall health and well-being. Researchers have found that nutrient therapy may offer benefits for those with mental health issues.
In 2019, the Pan American Health Organization reported that mental health issues “are the single largest cause of disabilities in the world.” These pertain to disorders such as anxiety, depression, dementia and alcohol abuse.

Fortunately, research into the root causes of mental health issues points to promising solutions. For example, the Walsh Research Institute has made significant breakthroughs in terms of understanding the biochemistry behind anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia.
While mental illness remains a significant issue, health experts are hopeful because of promising research into nutrient-based therapy protocols and other alternative solutions that may one day revolutionize mental health care. (Related: Food for the brain: Review examines the link between diet and mental health.)
According to the Walsh Research Institute, most mental health diseases are associated with the balance of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin.
People diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, schizophrenia and other behavior disorders have a chemical imbalance.
While chemical imbalance may not cause your mental illness and may be a concurrent result of other factors or arise due to mental distress, they can be used as a potential avenue for treatment.
In modern medicine, medications designed to increase serotonin levels in the brain are based on the assumption that an imbalance is causing depression. Unfortunately, these drug interventions have produced very limited success and an alarming list of potential adverse effects.
If you have mental health issues and are looking to avoid the side effects of pharmaceuticals like antidepressants, you should consider nutritional interventions, which are generally much safer.
Addressing specific nutrient needs can help alleviate many health conditions since these deficiencies can cause systemic issues. At the same time, the nutritional basis for treatment is different from current pharmaceutical interventions.
Advanced nutrient therapy was founded by Dr. William Walsh of the Walsh Research Institute and is based on research data on more than 20,000 patients with various mental health issues. These patients have all undergone biochemical mapping.
Nutrient therapy is purely nutrition-based and helps give people a deeper understanding of their struggles.
Research in the field of nutrient therapy has helped experts develop new, nutrient-based therapy protocols and other alternative solutions that expand beyond the realm of medication and psychotherapy.
As the science behind biochemical mapping continues to improve, researchers are one step closer to learning how to dial in specific nutritive solutions for mental health issues that suit each person’s specific needs without relying on medications.
But many mental health issues aren’t only based on nutrient deficiencies or biochemical issues. Some patients may develop depression and anxiety due to significant changes in their social environment and daily lives.
This means treating mental illnesses also involves addressing social issues.
Nutritional interventions are a relatively safe treatment for mental health issues, but they also come with potential side effects. Excessive storage of certain nutrients in the body could be more damaging and cause severe physical and mental health issues.
One such nutrient is copper. Research has found that elevated copper levels can drastically affect dopamine and norepinephrine production, resulting in hormone imbalance.
Several mental and behavioral health issues, such as ADHD, anxiety, autism, depression, poor concentration and learning difficulty, may be linked to high copper levels.
When prescribing nutrient-based treatment, health experts often avoid “enriched” foods that might contain copper and those that contain it naturally, such as organ meats.
For the last few years, researchers have found that earlier studies are behind over-generalizations in medicine, diet, nutrition and medication recommendations.
Through a growing understanding of epigenetics and biochemistry, scientists have discovered that all individuals have a unique biochemical makeup and highly personalized nutritional needs.
And when those needs aren’t met, your physical and mental health may suffer in various ways.
Because of the stark genetic differences in how different bodies process foods, following the traditional “food pyramid” or sticking to a generalized diet may cause a deficiency in much-needed nutrients or an overflow in others.
Even if you don’t have mental health issues, these tips can help improve your physical and mental well-being:

https://food.news/2023-03-16-can-you-eat-processed-foods-anticancer-diet.html,Health and nutrition: Can you eat processed foods while following a diet to reduce cancer risk?,"Advertisement
Following a balanced diet and eating a variety of nutritious foods is key to maintaining your overall health.
But can you eat processed foods while following a diet to reduce cancer risk?
Karen Collins, a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), takes a closer look at the role of processed foods when following a diet to reduce cancer risk.
Almost all food is processed in some way. This even includes cooking and chopping “whole” foods.

But when you’re talking about processed foods, the real debate involves products called commercially processed foods, especially items that are more highly processed or items referred to as “ultra-processed” foods.
Studies use this system to differentiate between processed foods:
Minimally processed foods
These foods contain no added fats, salt, sugar or other additives. They include the “natural edible food parts of plants and animals.”
Examples:
Processed foods
Processed foods contain fat, salt, sugar or additional starch ingredients added to a minimally processed food. They are usually not eaten on their own but are used to prepare minimally processed foods.
Examples:
Ultra-processed foods
Ultra-processed foods are made with industrial equipment and ingredients that break down whole foods like fruits and vegetables and combine them with other ingredients, usually ingredients not found in your kitchen.
This processing produces foods with an extended shelf life that are ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat.
Unfortunately, some “hyper-palatable” foods are made with fine-tuned combinations of fat, salt and sugar that trigger your brain’s reward system in ways that make you want to eat more. (Related: Study: Ultra-processed foods linked to increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease.)
Examples:
The list shows how the category of ultra-processed foods covers a wide range of products. This is one of the reasons that making sense of research on ultra-processed foods and cancer risk gets complicated.
There are many studies about possible adverse effects of ultra-processed foods on people’s health.
Weight
Consuming a lot of ultra-processed food as a whole category is linked to a greater likelihood of weight gain, increased waist size and greater risk of being overweight and obese.
One research, which involves cross-sectional studies, can’t establish whether eating more ultra-processed food actually caused weight gain. But the link is observed in prospective studies that show changes in someone’s weight, waist and body mass index (BMI) over time.
Compared to those who consume the least ultra-processed foods, people who ate the most are more likely to become overweight or obese. If they are already overweight, they are more likely to develop obesity.
Cancer and heart disease
Ultra-processed foods that increase obesity risk can also inherently increase the risk of developing chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease that are linked to health issues like obesity.
Additionally, ultra-processed foods could raise health risks independent of weight gain. This means some may influence factors like your blood pressure, blood sugar spikes, insulin levels and the gut microbiome.
However, after adjusting for weight, evidence from human studies is inconsistent regarding the link between ultra-processed food consumption and chronic disease. This is due to how hard it is to separate the influence of ultra-processed foods from the quality of the overall dietary pattern.
The high consumption of ultra-processed foods may also affect lifestyle and socioeconomic factors that are linked to the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases.
For reduced cancer risk, the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) recommendation to limit processed foods focuses on foods that promote weight gain.
Analysis for AICR’s Third Expert Report found that foods high in fats, added sugars or refined grains promote weight gain when consumed frequently or in large portions.
Follow the AICR’s recommendations below to improve your eating habits:
As a dietitian trying to provide advice about healthy eating, Collins is worried about messaging that wraps up a wide range of foods under one umbrella term of processed foods. These foods are not all the same and she recommends limiting your intake of processed foods high in sodium.
While you don’t have to completely give up refined grains like Italian bread or juice, you have to make sure you don’t let processed foods with reduced fiber and nutrient content make up the bulk of your diet.
When processing removes valuable nutrients or most of the fiber in food, choose the ones that you enjoy the most in moderation. Balance this by giving less-processed foods like fruits and vegetables the largest part of your plate.
If budget or time and food prep is an issue, choose processed foods that can make healthy eating easier and more attainable.
Healthy eating doesn’t mean eating only whole foods. It means choosing the foods and portions that help you create overall eating patterns that promote overall wellness.
If you want to follow a diet to reduce cancer risk, don’t let sensational headlines distract you from the overall picture of what research shows about how healthy eating patterns can reduce cancer risk.

https://food.news/2023-03-15-food-safety-6-ways-avoid-bacterial-infection.html,Food safety tips: 6 Ways to avoid bacterial infection at home,"Advertisement
Avoiding bacterial contamination is important when handling and cooking food. You need to make sure everything is hygienic, and that things like food are protected from possible bacteria, to prevent the spread of illness and infections.
Avoiding bacterial contamination is even more important when you are dealing with a survival scenario, where you will likely have fewer resources if something goes wrong.
Bacterial contamination is the contamination of food via bacteria.
Contamination occurs when bacteria multiply within the food, causing it to go bad. If you eat food that has been contaminated, you will get sick. For example, food poisoning is caused by bacterial contamination.

Preventing bacterial contamination is important, especially in a post-SHTF world where you have limited resources and limited access to medical services. Handling food carefully ensures that you can avoid bacterial contamination as much as possible.
Most establishments and services that sell food to the general public are required by law to abide by many health and safety guidelines designed to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination in food.
But in your everyday life, especially at home, you must be careful and take the right steps to lower the chances of you contaminating your food, and becoming ill from it. (Related: Abbott Nutrition’s infant formula was recalled after claims of bacterial contamination, infant deaths.)
These factors can affect just how sick you get because of a bacterial infection:
Prevent food poisoning by following these six tips to avoid bacterial contamination:
Wash your hands thoroughly
Your hands touch different things and surfaces throughout the day, and some of these things have also been touched by other people. Unfortunately, even if you practice proper hygiene, you can’t say the same for others.
Bacteria is everywhere, from your smartphone to door handles. Always wash your hands before and after preparing and cooking food so any bacteria you might be carrying doesn’t transfer onto the food that you are going to eat.
Washing your hands is also important if you’re dealing with raw food. Use antibacterial soap in your kitchen and wash your hands often.
Be careful when handling and preparing raw food
Raw food contains different bacteria, and some of them can be bad and cause food poisoning. This is one reason why most foods need to be cooked since your body won’t be able to process the number of bacteria on raw food.
Store raw food separately from the rest of the food when buying groceries. If possible, place raw food into a different shopping bag from the rest of your items.
When preparing raw food, wash your hands and the surfaces. This ensures that no other food comes into contact with the liquids of the raw food.
Avoid dirt
Dirt can contain many harmful substances and bacteria that might contaminate the food you touch.
Even if you’re not dealing with food, if you get dirty or touch dirt, you should wash your hands. Otherwise, you risk transferring that dirt onto your skin, or to sensitive areas such as your mouth or eyes, which can then cause bacteria to infect you.
Wash your hands regularly and keep your hands and face free from dirt.
Maintain proper hygiene in bacteria-prone environments
Bacteria will thrive and spread quickly in certain environments.
Be careful of bacteria-prone environments and avoid storing food in them to prevent contamination.
For example, bacteria reproduce a lot faster at room temperature and in places that have high levels of moisture and in which mold can grow. You should store food either in the refrigerator or in a dark and dry cupboard where it won’t be exposed to moisture.
Always follow the directions on labels and packaging to make sure you are storing food correctly. This helps prevent food spoilage.
Lastly, never eat something that has gone out of date.
Avoid cross contamination
Cooking can be stressful and chaotic, and if you’re not experienced, it can become overwhelming. This is one of the reasons why cross contamination happens often: It is easy to accidentally forget and reuse the same surface.
Cross contamination occurs when you mix cooked food with raw food or place something cooked on a surface that was used for cutting raw meat, like raw chicken. When this happens, the bacteria from the raw food will spread to the cooked food.
This can happen accidentally, like when you are using the same cutting board to cut raw meat then chopping vegetables with a dirty knife. Stay calm and organized while preparing food, especially raw meat, to prevent cross contamination.
Avoid cross contamination by always using a clean cutting board. If possible, have separate cutting boards for fresh produce and another one for raw meat, poultry and seafood.
Once cutting boards become excessively worn or develop hard-to-clean grooves, replace them.
Don’t wash chicken and other raw meat
Don’t place raw chicken under running water to wash it. This is unnecessary since you’re going to cook the chicken, so the bacteria will die.
Washing raw meat is also discouraged because this just leaves traces of the raw chicken all over the sink. Small bits of the chicken can also splash onto other surfaces around the kitchen, which can then cause bacterial contamination.
Maintain proper hygiene and be careful when handling raw meat to prevent bacterial contamination.

https://food.news/2023-03-15-consistent-intermittent-fasting-remission-patients-with-diabetes.html,Study: Consistent intermittent fasting can cause remission in over 50% of patients with Type 2 diabetes,"Advertisement
According to a study, intermittent fasting may offer significant health benefits for those with Type 2 diabetes.
Researchers who conducted the study found that the dietary intervention resulted in complete remission for more than half of the study volunteers.
Details of the study were published in the AAA Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.
Intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating is an eating plan that involves consuming calories only during a specific “window” of time, which is often for periods of eight to 10 hours.

Fasting means your body naturally gets fewer overall calories.
The fasting state also causes:
These changes in your hormones are also linked to an increase in your metabolic rate. These factors of intermittent fasting can also help with weight loss.
There are several ways to do intermittent fasting, such as skipping meals and eating only during a certain time. You can also restrict your calorie intake on certain days of the week and eat normally on other days.
The most common intermittent fasting diets include a 16-hour daily fast, a 24-hour fast on alternate days, or a two-day-a-week fast on nonconsecutive days.
For the study, researchers observed volunteers with Type 2 diabetes who followed an intermittent fasting routine for three months. The patients experienced significant improvements in their condition.
Scientists revealed that an impressive 90 percent of the 36 patients were able to reduce their prescribed treatments, such as insulin and blood sugar-lowering medications.
At least 55 percent of the participants experienced total remission. They remained free of Type 2 diabetes for at least one year after discontinuing their medications.
Remission is defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels under 6.5. HbA1c is a measure of blood sugar control over time.
Dongbo Liu, the study’s lead author, thinks the study results can offer significant benefits for the more than 537 million adults across the globe with Type 2 diabetes.
“Type 2 diabetes is not necessarily a permanent, lifelong disease,” explained Liu. (Related: Intermittent fasting helps reduce inflammation, scientists find.)
But how did intermittent fasting help the participants with diabetes?
Researchers found that fasting was beneficial due to the body’s sleep-wake cycle or circadian rhythms.
They suggested that following a “consistent daily short window of feeding” can improve someone’s well-being by helping to align the circadian rhythms of multiple organs. This then helps the body with the coordination of different processes and helps to manage diseases.
They also warned that chronic circadian rhythm disruption, which shift workers often go through, may compromise the immune system. The disruption also increases the risk for chronic metabolic diseases by triggering various health issues like weight gain, glucose intolerance and fatty liver disease.
The study on intermittent fasting and Type 2 diabetes built on earlier research that looked into the benefits of intermittent fasting. According to data, intermittent fasting can also help reduce body weight, even though volunteers are not usually instructed to consciously reduce caloric intake.
Recent human studies also suggest that time-restricted eating can help reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes.
Experts also think that intermittent fasting can help improve glucose sensitivity, lower high blood pressure, reduce inflammation and decrease unhealthy cholesterol levels.
According to an animal study published in the journal Cell Metabolism, time-restricted eating influences gene expression in a way that can help manage diseases.
Results of the animal study revealed that at least 40 percent of the genes in the animals’ adrenal glands, hypothalamus and pancreas were affected, which is promising because these organs have an important role in hormonal regulation.
Intermittent fasting offers benefits for people with Type 2 diabetes, but the researchers highlighted that “maintaining a consistent, long overnight fast can significantly reduce the risk of chronic disease.”
Individual recommendations vary, but the eating window that is often between eight and 12 hours long should not “open” until at least one hour has passed after waking. The eating window must also “close” at least three hours before the onset of an eight-hour sleep cycle.
The scientists emphasized that consistency is important and that those with Type 2 diabetes should maintain the same schedule on workdays and weekends.
If you have Type 2 diabetes, consult your physician before starting intermittent fasting.
The following foods should be part of a balanced diet if you have Type 2 diabetes:
The following lifestyle habits are also key for diabetes prevention and management:
Lui advised that diabetes remission is possible if those with the disease try to lose weight by changing their diet and exercise habits. If you have diabetes, trying intermittent fasting can help you manage your condition and improve your overall health.
If you have diabetes, here are some things to do before trying intermittent fasting:
Consult your doctor
Talk to your physician before starting intermittent fasting. This is important because this will help you finalize a safe approach and adjust any of your medication doses as needed.
You should be twice as careful if you are on insulin because if you’re on it and restrict your eating, you may be at a greater risk of low blood sugar. This is bad because it can result in dizziness and confusion, along with life-threatening symptoms such as seizures, or loss of consciousness.
If left untreated in people with diabetes, low blood sugar or hypoglycemia can be fatal, warned the American Diabetes Association.
Devise a plan that works for you
Intermittent fasting plans vary depending on various factors. Some people may restrict calories two or three days a week or limit eating to certain periods of the day.
There are also stricter plans that include fasting for up to 36 hours at a time for seven or 14 days, but the latter isn’t ideal if you have Type 2 diabetes.
Whatever your IF plan is, you need to find one that you can stick with long-term because consistency is key for your future health.
Prepare for side effects
Intermittent fasting may cause uncomfortable side effects like cramps, constipation, diarrhea or headaches, especially if you are not used to the time-restricted eating plan.
You should also listen to your body. If you don’t feel fine, stop fasting. Intermittent fasting can make you hungry, but you shouldn’t be lethargic or start throwing up after you change your eating habits.
Eat nutritious foods
You may be eating less food, but you still need to follow a balanced diet that includes whole, unprocessed foods, such as non-starchy vegetables, protein and healthy fats.
You should also take a multivitamin and drink lots of water to prevent dehydration and headaches. Following a balanced diet will help you lose or manage your weight and keep your blood sugar steady as you fast.
Keep your expectations in check
While intermittent fasting offers many health benefits, it doesn’t work for everybody and your medical team may not recommend it if you aren’t well enough to try it.
Always consult your doctor before trying intermittent fasting because going for long periods without eating if you have Type 2 diabetes can be dangerous. In some cases, it might not offer benefits for you.
Get support
Once you confirm that you can safely try intermittent fasting, you can follow the plan with your family or a friend. You can also join an online community or social support network so you can motivate each other to stick with it.

Microgreens are used as gourmet ingredients in upscale restaurants, but dishes from these places are often more expensive compared to meals made with common ingredients. To save money, gardeners and home cooks have learned how to grow microgreens at home.
But despite their “superfood” label, the levels of healthful compounds like phytonutrients in most varieties of microgreens are unknown. To address this, scientists conducted a study about these small but nutrient-rich superfoods.

Their findings show that kale and broccoli microgreens grown on either windowsills or under commercial growing conditions are full of phytonutrients, but the levels of some compounds may vary “considerably” between the two different environments.
Details of the study were published in the journal ACS Food Science & Technology.
Many health enthusiasts have started growing different microgreens on their windowsills.
Some of the most commonly planted varieties of these small seedlings are from the Brassica family, which includes vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, kale and mustard.
The mature, fully-grown versions of these vegetables are full of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals. According to the study, environmental conditions can impact the plants’ nutritional contents. (Related: Grow microgreens in your own home with these simple steps.)
However, not much is known about the levels of these compounds in young microgreens.
In a previous study, Pei Chen, Thomas Wang and colleagues discovered that red cabbage microgreens had higher amounts of phytonutrients that have antioxidant and anticancer properties compared to full-grown vegetables.
But similar assessments haven’t been done on other Brassica seedlings.
In a recent study, scientists set out to measure the levels of polyphenols and glucosinolates in broccoli and kale microgreens. They then compared data from those grown on windowsills to those grown in commercial growth chambers.
To observe the differences, scientists placed trays of newly planted broccoli and kale seeds either on a windowsill in natural sunlight or inside a temperature- and humidity-controlled, refrigerator-like growth chamber with artificial sunlight for 12 hours a day.
Following 10 full days after seeding, the researchers harvested the plants and measured the phytonutrient content using a liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry system. The data showed that the broccoli and kale microgreens were rich in polyphenols and glucosinolates regardless of how they were grown.
The research team also found that there was considerable variability in the amounts of individual compounds when comparing the two growth environments. To illustrate, three flavanol compounds that contribute to the plant’s dark color and bitter taste were higher in windowsill-grown microgreens.
On the other hand, chamber-grown plants had higher levels of two glucosinolates, which are antioxidant- and anticancer-related compounds.
The researchers found that, overall, the growth environment for kale and broccoli microgreens affects the abundance of individual phytonutrients and this could affect their flavor and potential health benefits.
Whether you buy microgreens from the nearest health food store or grow them in your own kitchen, here are some healthy ways to use them for everyday meals:

If you’re trying to avoid the adverse effects of over-the-counter medication for the common cold and the flu, consider using fernleaf biscuitroot (Lomatium dissectum)
This natural anti-viral herb can be used to help treat symptoms of colds and flu caused by viral infections. It is often administered in tincture form and is a powerful microbial. (h/t to ReadyNutrition.com)

Fernleaf biscuitroot is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial used to address the symptoms of viral infections. It is a species of flowering plant in the carrot family.
The herb is also known by the common name fernleaf biscuitroot.
The plant is native to much of western North America and it grows in different habitats. The perennial herb can reach up to 1.4 meters tall and it grows from a thick taproot.
Fernleaf biscuitroot is a medicinal plant commonly used in Native American cultures. The potent antiviral plant was used by Native Americans during the 1918 influenza epidemic. According to a report from the University of California, the herb “may prove to be a strong modern-day cold and flu remedy.” (Related: Prepper medicine: How to use chokecherry, a versatile medicinal plant.)
In an article about fernleaf biscuitroot, experts reported that the Native Americans called the medicinal root of this plant “the Dortza” or “heap powerful medicine.”
The natural medicine is extracted from the hard root and turned into a tincture.
The Washoe Indians collected fernleaf biscuitroot in the months of September and October, which was when the richest supply of oils was concentrated in the large underground root. According to data, the aromatic root contains at least five or six gums, oils and oleoresins.
After collecting the plant’s root, slice longitudinally to expose the volatile oils to the oxidizing (polymerization) effects of the air. This then converts the oils to a stabilized resin.
Here are some of the culinary uses of fernleaf biscuitroot:
The plant’s antiviral action is derived from the volatile oils in the root. These oils can help clear respiratory issues that are present in viral infections because of inflammation like cough, sore throat and a stuffy and runny nose.
Fernleaf biscuitroot was used to address the secondary infections caused by many strains of influenza.
To use fernleaf biscuitroot as an antiviral treatment for cold or flu symptoms, take one-fourth teaspoon of the tincture every three to four hours for five days in one cup of hot water. Make sure you keep track of your usage on a dosing chart.
If you can’t grow fernleaf biscuitroot in your home garden or forage for it, you can also buy tinctures to treat cold or flu symptoms if you are sick.

Olive oil is a superfood powerhouse and scientific data proves that it is worth all the hype. This cooking oil is flavorful and full of healthy fats.
When incorporated into a balanced diet, olive oil can offer many benefits, such as supporting gut health and protecting against heart disease.
Olive oil is a type of fat that comes from olives. There are different types of olive oil, but all of them are made through a process that involves washing, crushing, milling and pitting olives to extract their oil.
The finished product contains a combination of beneficial compounds such as fatty acids, polyphenols and vitamin E, all of which can help boost your overall well-being.

Olive oil is a main component of the Mediterranean diet, a healthy eating plan traditionally followed by people who live in countries along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Countries that follow the diet include Greece, Italy, Spain, North Africa and parts of the Middle East. (Related: Regular olive oil consumption found to reduce mortality risk.)
Balanced diets incorporating olive oil have been shown to support health in different ways. Various studies have also identified special compounds in olive oil that have beneficial protective effects on the body.
Here are eight of the most impressive science-backed health benefits of olive oil.
Olive oil contains various compounds that help regulate inflammation in the body such as the polyphenols hydroxytyrosol (HT) and hydroxytyrosol acetate (HT-ac).
These compounds help inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways and reduce the upregulation of inflammatory enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
Data from a 2015 review of 30 studies published in the journal Nutrients revealed that using olive oil daily in doses ranging from one milligram to 50 mg significantly decreased levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 compared to control treatments.
Olive oil naturally contains anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds like polyphenols that help fight against atherosclerosis or the buildup of plaque in the arteries.
Olive oil compounds help minimize oxidative stress and improve blood vessel function. Additionally, olive oil helps decrease the production of inflammatory molecules like adhesion molecules2, which has a large role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.
According to a 2021 article published in the journal Stroke, those with heart disease who followed an olive oil-rich Mediterranean diet for seven years had decreased atherosclerosis progression compared to people on a low-fat diet.
Data suggests that diets rich in olive oil can also help boost high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lower high blood pressure. This is why olive oil intake is often associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.
Data from a 2021 study in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology revealed that U.S. adults who consumed more than seven grams of a one-half tablespoon of olive oil per day had a 14 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to those who didn’t consume olive oil.
Olive oil is mostly composed of monounsaturated fatty acids. It is also low in saturated fats, so it remains liquid at room temperature.
While olive oil’s high content of unsaturated fats means it can support heart health, following a balanced diet is key to disease prevention.
Maintaining a healthy balance of bacteria in your digestive tract is crucial for your well-being.
According to research, using olive oil may help reduce disease-causing bacteria and stimulate the growth of protective bacteria. Olive oil can also help boost the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).
SCFAs are a byproduct of the bacterial fermentation of fiber. SCFAs fuel intestinal cells and strengthen the gut lining. These fatty acids also help fight against inflammation.
Data from human studies revealed that diets rich in olive oil can help boost levels of beneficial lactic acid bacteria (LAB). On the other hand, animal studies have shown that olive oil consumption may help shift the gut-bacteria ratio in a way that prevents colon cancer.
According to a 2022 study published in the journal Nutrients, those people with mild cognitive impairment who were supplemented with 30 mL of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) per day for six months experienced significant improvements in behavioral and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores.
Scientists who conducted the study reported that the EVOO also helped boost the function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a barrier between the blood vessels of the brain and the brain tissue that prevents harmful substances from reaching the brain.
The breakdown and dysfunction of the BBB have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.
Research has also found that the use of olive oil may reduce the accumulation of amyloid plaques linked to the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s.
Olive oil’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties make it an ideal choice for people with Type 2 diabetes.
Diets rich in olive oil can help reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes and olive oil supplementation may help improve certain health parameters in individuals with the condition.
A 2017 review in the journal Nutrition and Diabetes revealed that people with the highest intake of olive oil have a 16 percent reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to people with the lowest intake.
The 2017 review also revealed that olive oil supplementation significantly reduced the long-term blood sugar control marker hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood sugar in those with Type 2 diabetes compared to those in the control groups.
Vitamin E is a fat-soluble nutrient that acts as an antioxidant in the body and helps protect cells against oxidative damage. The vitamin also have crucial roles in immune function and cellular communication.
However, many people’s diets don’t include enough of this essential nutrient. According to research, at least 90 percent of men and 96 of women in America have insufficient intake of vitamin E.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one tablespoon of olive oil provides around 20 percent of the recommended intake for vitamin E.
But studies show that the vitamin E content of olive oil varies significantly depending on factors like the type of olive the oil was derived, the ripeness of the fruit and the climate where it was grown. This is why you need to use high-quality olive oil.
A 2022 article from the International Journal of Trichology showed that olive oil can help nourish hair by providing protection from sun damage, moisturizing the hair cuticle and soothing the scalp.
Olive oil may also help heal small wounds and burns. The oil also has occlusive properties, meaning it can help seal water on the skin. Note that the oil itself is not moisturizing.
Unlike other cooking oils, olive oil is safe to use every day. Research has found that those who regularly consume olive oil have a lower risk of health conditions like heart disease and obesity.
If you’re not sure how to choose high-quality olive oil, experts recommend buying organic, cold-pressed extra virgin olive oils.
Here are some healthy ways to incorporate olive oil into a balanced diet:
Store olive oil in a cool, dark place like your pantry. Heat and sunlight can make the oil degrade and this can result in unpleasant changes in its taste and aroma.

https://food.news/2023-03-06-how-to-ensure-drinking-water-is-safe.html,Hydration and health: How to ensure that your drinking water is safe,"Advertisement
Drinking enough water every day is important because this will help you stay hydrated. But how can you tell when water from the tap is safe to drink?
If you are worried about your family’s health and the water quality in your area, read on to learn how to make sure that your drinking water is safe.
With recent catastrophic events like the Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and its effects on the environment, many people are wondering if their water is safe to use and drink.
Detailed below are tips that will help you avoid common sources of water contamination and how to keep drinking water safe.

Public water systems or municipal systems in the U.S. provide water that is considered one of the safest in the world. The quality is regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.
Succeeding laws set the drinking water standards for chemicals known to be in some municipal water systems. (Related: Scientists challenge WHO draft guidelines for PFAS in drinking water.)
Unfortunately, municipal water contamination is more common in systems serving fewer than a thousand people. A lot of older municipal systems also have lea?d-?containing pipes. These pipes should be replaced with non-lead alternatives as soon as possible.
If you’re worried about the quality of your local water system, check with your municipality about the system’s construction. You can also call your local public health department to check.
Private wells aren’t federally regulated. If you have a well on your homestead, you need to regularly test the water for coliform bacteria, nitrates and other environmental toxins like aluminum, arsenic or uranium.
Consult local, state and tribal authorities because they can provide testing guidelines. If you want to test your well water, public health departments will sometimes test well water for free.
Keep in mind that both municipal water systems and private wells are vulnerable to contamination.
Some water contaminants to watch out for include:
Local water companies are required to give annual reports about what is in the water.
Remember the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Information Hotline (1-800-426-4791) and Emergency Response Hotline (1-800-424-8802). Call these numbers if you have any questions about the water in your area or if you need to report an oil or chemical spill.
Homesteaders or preppers with private wells should have well water tested for coliform bacteria and nitrates yearly. Testing for other contaminants should be done after at least every three years.
Some private wells may require reverse-osmosis filtering systems.
If your well has been contaminated, contact an expert in well construction and repair.
If you are concerned about the quality of your plumbing, run the faucet for three to five minutes each morning before using the water for cooking or drinking. This helps flush the pipes and lessens the probability of contaminants being present in the water that you use.
Contact the local water department to see if the standpipe from the water main to your house contains lead. If it does, make sure it is replaced immediately.
Clean your faucet’s screen or aerator regularly. Debris, lead and sediment can build up in the aerator and contaminate the water.
If you think your drinking water has been contaminated with bacteria and other germs, boil it for at least one minute, then set it aside to cool. However, boiling does not remove toxic chemicals and may even concentrate some chemicals.
If your water has an off-taste or odor, get a point-of-use filter made with activated carbon or other absorbent material to help address these issues. Alternatively, you can use filters that will help remove some harmful chemicals in the water.
Using cold water for cooking and drinking will help prevent exposure to contaminants that can build up in hot water heaters.
If you have babies at home, test well water for nitrates before giving it to infants.
When dealing with an emergency and you don’t have access to clean drinking water, you can buy bottled water.
But if you don’t have bottled water in your pantry or stockpile, you can boil water, use chlorine bleach, or use iodine to treat non-potable water to make it safer to drink.
Boiling water
The most common method of treating water is to boil it. Boiling water for a sufficient time will kill microbes. This method can also help get rid of some toxic chemical contaminants.
Use a stovetop burner or electric kettle to boil water.
Place the non-potable water in a pot. Place the pot on a burner or electric kettle and heat the water to a rolling boil.
Keep the water at a rolling boil for at least one minute. Set the water aside and let it cool down before pouring it into a clean container for use.
Chlorine bleach
Unscented household bleach can help kill bacteria in the water if boiling water isn’t an option.
Bleach contains chlorine, the chemical used to make municipal water supplies potable. The water this produces is called chlorinated water.
If the water is cloudy, filter it through a cloth before treating it.
Add 1/8 teaspoon (eight drops) of unscented household bleach to one gallon (16 cups) of water. Mix the water and bleach well.
Set the water aside for at least 30 minutes before drinking it or cooking with it.
You can also use bleach to sanitize the containers that you will use to store water.
Make a sanitizing solution of one teaspoon of bleach in one quart (four cups) of water. Pour the solution into the container or wipe it inside the container to coat it.
Let the sanitizing solution sit for 30 seconds, then pour it out. Allow the container to air dry, or rinse it with treated water.
If the water is contaminated with a chemical, disinfectants will not make it safe to drink.
Iodine
Iodine solution, crystals or tablets are often used by hikers who need to treat water in their water bottles while on the trail.
Iodine can kill viruses and bacteria and is easy to use. However, it is not effective against more resistant organisms such as Cryptosporidium.
One downside of iodine is that it gives water a noticeable aftertaste.
If you have iodine, follow the directions provided on the product. The amount used will vary for iodine solutions, crystals and tablets. Use warm water whenever possible.
Add the iodine to the correct amount of water in your container. Mix the iodine well with the water.
Make sure some of the solution also coats the lid and threads if you are storing the treated water in a screw cap bottle.
Set the water aside for 30 minutes after the iodine has fully dissolved before using it. If the water is cold (below 40 F), wait for at least one hour before using it.
Using bottled water
Use bottled water as a last resort, such as when there is known contamination of the source.
Bottled water is expensive and it generates a lot of plastic waste, which is another environmental contaminant.
Depending on the brand, bottled water may be tap water that has been carbon filtered. Some bottled water manufacturers promote their brands as being UV-filtered, to assure consumers that bacteria has been removed.
Some manufacturers may also say that bottled water has been through water distillation or the reverse osmosis process.
Before drinking bottled water, check the container for any signs it has been previously opened and refilled. Check the expiration date if it has one and check the bottle carefully for cracks.
If you are not sure about the safety of the water, boil or treat bottled water before drinking it.

https://food.news/2023-03-03-turn-trash-can-into-a-root-cellar.html,Food storage tips: How to turn a trash can into a root cellar,"Advertisement
Root cellars are ideal if you need an effective method for long-term food storage and preservation. It will help keep food fresh and protect your stockpile from spoilage, pests and other common threats.
If you have the budget, you can build a large root cellar on your property to maximize storage space.
But if space or money is an issue, you can build a simple root cellar with a new trash can and some dirt. (h/t to AskAPrepper.com)
Follow the steps below if you want to make a root cellar using a trash can. (Related: Prepping skills: 15 Food storage and preservation methods to learn before SHTF.)

You will need:
Steps:
Choose the site for your root cellar
Try to locate a spot that never gets direct sun. If you decide on an area with soft ground, it will be easier to dig the hole quickly.
Avoid a low-lying area because heavy rain could cause a temporary dam or large puddle that will submerge your drum and ruin the food inside.
Turn the can upside down and use the power drill to carefully make several ventilation holes in the bottom of the trash can.
Place the trash can or steel drum
Mark the outermost circumference of the drum and clean any weeds in the area for approximately one foot in width. Start digging the hole.
Make sure the trash can’s top six to 12 inches is above the soil line. You will create a shoulder so the trash can be entirely isolated, but raising the lid will ensure that the trash can does not become submerged.
Measure the depth you need to gain on the shovel’s handle. This can help you keep track as you continued to set up the trash can root cellar.
Cover the trash can in plastic sheeting then place it put in the hole
You can use an old paint drop sheet as a protective “tube” for the can or drum. Place the covered trash can inside the hole.
Cover the entire top of the drum so none of the dirt ends up inside the drum.
Cover the trash can to protect against water damage
Once the trash can is secured, cover it with corrugated sheeting and old shade netting to keep the water away and hide it from looters.
Shade net is a lightweight knitted polyethylene fabric that helps protect plants from the sun. Its material is rot- and mildew-resistant and it doesn’t become brittle.
Shade net is water permeable and it offers superior ventilation, making it a great addition to your trash can root cellar.
You also need to make sure that the trash can root cellar is hidden well so others won’t be able to find it when supplies become scarce.
Root cellars are a great way to store and preserve food on your homestead. The underground room will provide a dark environment that helps maintain the freshness and nutritional value of the food in your stockpile.
Once you learn how to control the temperature and humidity in a root cellar, you can slow down or stop food perishability altogether. This makes even a small trash can root cellar one of the best ways to stockpile food for long-term storage and emergency preparedness.
The darkness in the root cellar will also help protect the food from sunlight, which can accelerate the breakdown of food nutrients.
Typical items stored in a root cellar include:
You can also use a root cellar to store other food items like butter, cheese, eggs, beer and wine. Plan ahead and rotate your supply regularly to keep food and items in the root cellar fresh.
If you have a backup power source on your homestead, you can also store food in a fridge.
If you store fresh produce that has not been dried, moisture inside the trash can or steel drum may cause issues.
Generally, a root cellar needs proper ventilation to maintain a proper temperature and humidity level.
Good air circulation helps prevent mold, mildew and other organisms that cause spoilage from developing on stored food. Without proper ventilation, the air in a root cellar can become stale, which creates a hospitable environment for these organisms.
Proper ventilation can help prevent root vegetables like potatoes and onions from sprouting in the root cellar. If you build a root cellar in an extra room on your property, you can achieve proper ventilation by using a fan to move air in and out.
For a garbage can root cellar, you can install a small vent or drill holes at the top of the root cellar or at the bottom of the garbage can.
If you cannot provide any ventilation for the trash can root cellar, take additional steps to dry the air inside it. Do this by adding completely dry wood shavings or newspaper inside a root cellar to wick up moisture and dry the air.
Alternatively, you can use straw or hay. Wood shavings can absorb moisture, making it easier to maintain the desired humidity levels.
Use newspapers to line surfaces or shelves inside the root cellar. The newspaper will help absorb water.
Both materials are inexpensive, so they are ideal for building a root cellar on a budget.
Once you install the trash can root cellar, keep these tips in mind to extend the shelf life of food that you will store in it:
Shake off loose dirt from vegetables instead of washing it off. Many root-cellar vegetables store better this way, but leaving them wet can encourage rot.
Carrots and beets are easy to store. Brush off any loose dirt, clip foliage back to about an inch above the root and store the vegetables in boxes of moist sand or peat moss.
Handle vegetables carefully. Even slightly rough treatment can cause invisible bruising, which makes the produce start decomposing.
Stock a root cellar as late in the season as possible. If possible, chill the produce in the fridge before putting it in the trash can root cellar.
Several vegetables like onions, potatoes, pumpkins and winter squash must be “cured” for several days in warm temperatures before going into storage.
Most fruit “breathes,” but others like apples and pears must be wrapped in paper to slow the release of ethylene gas. This gas can cause spoilage in other produce in the root cellar.
Check your vegetables regularly. Remove vegetables with any signs of rot to ensure that the rest of the produce in the root cellar isn’t also going bad.

https://food.news/2023-03-01-healthy-blood-sugar-sweet-potato-pumpkin-soup.html,Support healthy blood sugar levels with this delicious sweet potato and pumpkin soup,"Advertisement
Blood sugar isn’t just something people with diabetes monitor. Your blood sugar levels are also important if you are pregnant or want to maintain your overall well-being.
Blood sugar balance is linked to other factors like your energy levels and mood. There are many ways to maintain healthy blood sugar levels, like staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, doing regular exercise and following a balanced diet.
There is no specific diet that supports healthy blood sugar, but preparing meals that feature a balancing trio of protein, fats and fiber-rich carbohydrates can help slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream.

One way to do this is by making a comforting and delicious sweet potato and pumpkin soup with peanuts.
The recipe below is inspired by a West African peanut soup.
This soup is made with fiber-rich vegetables, plant-based protein and good fats that help support heart health. (Related: Craving a sweet potato-based dinner? Try these 5 easy and nutritious recipes.)
Ingredients for 8-10 servings:
Preparation:
If you have diabetes, you can eat a balanced, healthy diet without giving up your favorite foods. If you want to achieve an effective diabetes diet, you must focus on moderation and make careful food choices to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.
For example, eating carbohydrates makes your body release insulin. This hormone helps your body use and store these carbohydrates, lowering blood sugar levels.
But if you have diabetes, your body doesn’t release or use insulin as it should. In turn, this makes your blood sugar levels remain high.
If you have diabetes, talk to your doctor or dietitian before making any significant dietary changes.
Eat non-starchy vegetables
Non-starchy vegetables should be part of a balanced diet, especially if you have diabetes.
There are two main types of vegetables: starchy and non-starchy. Starchy vegetables are full of carbs, which can raise your blood sugar levels.
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends eating at least three to five servings of vegetables each day. One serving is defined as half a cup of cooked vegetables or one cup of uncooked vegetables.
Here are some non-starchy vegetables to add to your diet:
Most vegetables are sold fresh, canned or frozen. If you are consuming raw vegetables, it is easy to roast and steam them.
You can also cook vegetables in moderate amounts of olive oil to get more healthy fats into your diet.
Eat whole-grain foods
Whole grains are a healthy alternative to highly processed or refined grains because they contain the endosperm, bran and germ of a grain. Refined grains only contain the endosperm and they offer less nutritional benefits.
Whole grains also contain more dietary fiber while refined grains only include the starchy part of the grain. Eating the starchy endosperm alone may cause your blood sugar levels to rise rapidly.
Look for products with 100 percent whole-grain ingredients.
Include these whole grains into your diet:
Incorporate whole grain products into meals or snacks to help manage your blood sugar levels.
Eat fatty fish
Fatty fish like herring, mackerel and salmon are full of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.
The high protein content is particularly healthy if you have diabetes since it has a low impact on your blood sugar. It is filling and provides essential nutrients to help your body grow and repair.
Eating foods rich in omega-3s may also help reduce your risk of heart failure and support cognitive function. If you have diabetes, try adding fatty fish to your diet twice per week.
When preparing fatty fish, avoid using sugary marinades and grill or steam the fish instead of frying it.
Follow a balanced diet and eat nutritious food to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

https://food.news/2023-02-28-seafood-omega-3s-help-prevent-kidney-disease.html,Eating seafood high in omega-3s helps protect against kidney disease,"Advertisement
Not sure what to make for lunch? Try featuring seafood in your main dish.
According to new research conducted by an international team of scientists, eating seafood and oily fish full of omega-3 fatty acids may help lower the risk of developing kidney disease.
While plant-based foods also contain omega-3s, consuming seafood regularly was also found to help slow down declines in kidney function.
Details of the study were published in The BMJ.
According to data, at least 700 million people worldwide have chronic kidney disease (CKD), a condition that increased the risk of kidney failure and death.

The results of animal studies have linked omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) to maintaining kidney function. However, the data from human studies remain unclear.
Unlike animals, whose diets are strictly monitored, human diets differ from person to person. Additionally, there may be some human error when it comes to over- or underestimating how much of one food someone eats.
But despite limited human evidence, current nutritional guidelines recommend the consumption of a healthy amount of seafood and fatty fish.
To learn more about the link between human health, seafood consumption and omega-3s, the study authors reviewed 19 studies from 12 countries that measured n-3 PUFA biomarkers in adults and their risk of CKD.
The biomarkers included:
EPA, DHA and DPA come from seafood but ALA is found in plants like leafy green vegetables, nuts and seeds. (Related: Curcumin found to slow chronic kidney disease progression.)
The researchers assessed the risk of chronic kidney disease by estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which shows how well the kidneys eliminate waste and excess fluid from the blood. A normal eGFR is 90 to 120 ml/min/1.73 m2.
Upon examining data from 19 studies, the researchers discovered that 4,944 volunteers (19 percent) developed chronic kidney disease during an 11-year observation period.
After excluding other factors like age, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking and other health conditions, the findings revealed that seafood helped reduce the risk of kidney disease by at least eight percent.
On the other hand, omega-3s in plant-based foods were not linked to a lower risk of chronic kidney disease.
According to the scientists, the study results are only observational and they can’t directly link omega-3s in seafood to better kidney health. They added that there may be other factors connected to kidney disease that they did not consider.
“Although our findings do not prove a causal relation between seafood n-3 PUFAs and CKD risk, they are supportive and consistent with current clinical guidelines that recommend adequate intake of seafood as part of healthy dietary patterns, especially when seafood replaces the intake of less healthy foods,” concluded the study authors in a media release.
The researchers said confirming the benefits seafood offers in preventing chronic kidney disease will require more randomized clinical trials.
If you already have kidney disease, you need to watch what you eat and drink because your kidneys cannot remove waste products as they normally should.
A kidney-friendly eating plan can help you stay healthier and slow down damage to your kidneys. These tips are for people who have Stages 1 to 4 of chronic kidney disease and are not on dialysis.
Different people will have different nutrition needs. If you are not sure where to start, consult a dietitian to create a kidney-friendly eating plan that suits your dietary needs.
A kidney-friendly eating plan can help protect your kidneys from more damage. This diet will also include foods that are easy on your kidneys and limit other foods and beverages so certain minerals in those foods, like potassium, don’t build up to high levels in your body.
Your kidney-friendly eating plan may change over time, but it will always give you the right amount of these three essential nutrients:
Make sure you get the right amount and the right types of protein
Not getting enough protein can result in weak skin, hair and nails.
On the other hand, consuming too much protein can make your kidneys work harder, which can cause more damage. This happens because when the body uses protein, it produces waste products that your kidneys have to filter.
To ensure your overall health, you may need to adjust how much protein you eat.
The amount of protein you need depends on your activity level, body size and health. Check with your doctor or dietitian to see if you need to limit protein or change the type of protein you eat.
Choose the right types of fat
Fat gives you energy and helps you utilize some of the vitamins you get from your food. Fat from food is also essential for your well-being.
However, too much fat can cause weight gain and heart disease. Limit fat in your meal plan and choose healthier fats like olive oil when cooking.
Choose whole grain carbohydrates
Eating too many carbs may also cause weight gain.
When you have kidney disease, it’s better to eat whole grains and healthy carbs like fruits and vegetables. Unhealthy carbs include hard candies, honey, sugar, soda and other sugary beverages.
Eat the right amount of calories
Your body needs calories for energy. Calories come from the carbs, fat and protein in the foods you eat.
How many calories you need depends on your age, size, gender and activity level. If you need to lose weight, you may need to adjust how many calories you eat.
Some people will need to limit the calories they eat while others may need to have more calories.
Choose and prepare foods with less salt
Sodium (salt) is a mineral found in almost all foods and it has crucial roles in various bodily functions.
The amount of sodium found naturally in foods is enough to keep a healthy level in your body, but eating packaged foods and adding salt to your meals can lead to eating too much sodium.
Too much sodium can make you thirsty and make your body hold onto water, which then results in swelling and an increase in your blood pressure.
Too much sodium can cause more damage to your kidneys and make your heart work harder. If you have kidney disease, you may benefit from limiting your sodium intake.
Generally, you should consume less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day.
You can limit sodium by avoiding salt and using more herbs and spices to season dishes while cooking. If possible, use fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned vegetables.
If all you have is canned vegetables, drain and rinse them to remove extra salt. When eating out, ask your server to tell the chef not to add any salt to your meal.
Follow a balanced diet and eat seafood rich in nutrients like omega-3s to boost your kidney health.

According to a 2021 survey from food safety and nutrition nonprofit International Food Information Council (IFIC), at least two-thirds of Americans prefer foods made with “clean ingredients.”

But aside from fresh produce and other raw foods, the term clean ingredients are open to broad interpretation, particularly since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t have a formal definition for the use of “natural” on food labels.
The IFIC survey also revealed that many consumers are paying more attention to ingredient lists. They are also choosing clean ingredients and avoiding chemical-sounding ingredients.
“When these respondents were asked how they define clean ingredients, ‘not artificial or synthetic’ was the top choice,” reported IFIC.
Dietitian Anna Rosales, senior director of government affairs and nutrition at the Institute of Food Technologists, a food science group, said understanding food ingredients can help consumers make better food choices.
However, what seems like a simple task can become confusing because various products list scientific names on ingredient labels “as required by regulations.”
While any listed ingredient is FDA-approved or classified “generally regarded as safe,” the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups have expressed concerns about the agency’s approval processes and effects on children’s health.
Experts are also worried about the different chemicals used in extracting food ingredients from natural sources.
In a 2022 IFIC survey, over 80 percent of American consumers reported that they regularly have shelf-stable, canned or other packaged foods on hand in their pantries. Even if you are meticulous about following clean-label diets, it’s difficult to avoid all unfamiliar food additives in certain products.
Read on to learn more about common food additives and their potential side effects.
Acidulants are common acids used in food to enhance flavor and preserve flavors.
Common acidulants include:
All acidulants are naturally occurring, but they are often chemically synthesized for use in food products.
Benzoic acid and other acids preserve food by making food and drink more acidic, in turn making them a hostile environment for unwanted organisms.
All acids can be sourced from either plants or human-made. While acids are widely viewed as safe, some ingredients like benzoic acid may cause allergic reactions.
Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) are synthetic antioxidants used to prevent rancidity. According to the FDA, these chemicals are safe in food in low doses.
However, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) gives an “avoid” rating to BHA and TBHQ and “caution” to BHT due to cancer risks.
Dietary fiber has a crucial role in digestion and gut health.
But according to data, almost all Americans don’t get enough dietary fiber. Fiber is isolated from fruits, vegetables, grains and other plants, but some forms can be synthesized and added to food.
Fibers can also help thicken, emulsify, gel or change the texture of food.
The FDA has only recently recognized some types of fiber as sources of dietary fiber that were all already recognized as safe. This is why more “prebiotic” products containing inulin and other fibers are being sold.
Depending on the person, some fibers may be more likely to cause side effects like gas and bloating than others.
Common sources of fiber added to foods that are often derived from plants include:
While less common, these fibers are often plant-sourced and still regarded as safe:
The CSPI warned consumers to “cut back” on polydextrose and the FDA requires a label over a potential laxative effect if more than 15 grams per serving are present.
Nitrites and nitrates are naturally occurring in the environment and in some foods. They are often used to preserve meats and enhance their color.
According to the National Cancer Institute, a high intake of nitrites or nitrates can increase the risk of cancer.
Potassium benzoate naturally occurs in cranberries and is commonly added to sodas.
Combining potassium benzoate with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and heat or light produces the carcinogen benzene. But as a preservative, potassium benzoate doesn’t carry proven health risks beyond possible allergic reactions when consumed sparingly.
Potassium sorbate is one of the most common chemical preservatives and it helps prevent spoilage without changing other qualities in food.
Aside from other than rare allergic reactions, studies have not identified health hazards for humans when less than 25 milligrams of potassium sorbate per kilogram of body weight are consumed. (Related: Toxic ingredients in oral care products linked to health issues.)
Processed foods may include naturally sourced or synthetically produced preservatives to prevent the growth of mold, bacteria and other microorganisms.
Some brands claim that their products are “preservative-free” or “‘nitrate-free” to ease concerns that consuming too much of any of these ingredients may have adverse side effects. Other products may list the origin of their preservatives.
To avoid preservatives, you can look for products that are pasteurized, canned or frozen.
Sodium or calcium propionate is often used in baked goods to prevent mold.
It has been considered safe even at relatively high levels, but a Harvard University study linked propionate to increased risk of obesity and diabetes. In 2018, McDonald’s removed propionate from its buns.
Sulfur dioxide is used to prevent discoloration in dried fruit or prevent bacterial growth in wine.
The use of sulfites such as sulfur dioxide, to preserve fresh fruits and vegetables has been banned by the FDA for over 35 years. Sulfites also cannot be used on foods that contain vitamin B1.
While sulfur dioxide is regarded as safe for most people, you should avoid it if you have asthma or sulfite allergies.
These ingredients have also been linked to adverse health effects and allergies in some people.
Carrageenan is derived from red seaweed and it acts as a thickener, emulsifier and preservative in various food products.
Common sources of carrageenan include almond milk, coffee creamers, cottage cheese, ice cream and dairy-free products like vegan cheese.
According to an animal study, exposure to carrageenan increased levels of fasting blood sugar and glucose intolerance, especially when combined with a high-fat diet.
Test-tube and animal studies have also revealed that carrageenan can trigger inflammation.
Data suggests that carrageenan can negatively impact digestive health. It may also be linked to the formation of intestinal ulcers and growths.
One small study showed that when people in remission from ulcerative colitis took a supplement containing carrageenan, they experienced an early relapse than participants given a placebo.
Mono- and diglycerides are emulsifiers commonly used found in bake mixes, margarine and other foods.
While the FDA and other organizations have not linked these ingredients to negative health outcomes, they can contain trace amounts of trans fats.
Data suggests that trans fats can increase bad cholesterol and reduce good cholesterol.
Propylene glycol has different uses. It can modify flavors and textures and retain moisture.
The FDA limits the amount of propylene glycol that can be added to food because toxicity can occur at high levels. When consumed in small amounts, studies have not found health effects for those who are not allergic to the ingredient.
Review food labels to avoid harmful ingredients like nitrates and propionate.

https://food.news/2023-02-27-intermittent-fasting-key-to-addressing-diabetes-pandemic.html,Study: Intermittent fasting is key to addressing diabetes pandemic,"Advertisement
Health authorities have been warning since 2017 that Type 2 diabetes has achieved pandemic status.
Diabetes has spread from affluent industrialized nations to emerging economies such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. Experts have also warned that worldwide cases of the disease can reach 642 million by 2045.
Fortunately, one study has found that intermittent fasting may be key to addressing the diabetes pandemic.
Researchers have discovered that intermittent fasting led to complete remission for more than half of the study volunteers.

Details of the promising study were published in the Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.
Intermittent fasting, also called time-restricted eating or Chinese Medical Nutrition Therapy (CMNT), involves consuming calories only during a specific “window” of time, usually eight to 10 hours.
In the small study, researchers found that volunteers with Type 2 diabetes who followed an intermittent fasting routine for three months saw “dramatic improvements in their condition.”
The scientists reported that 90 percent of the 36 patients were able to reduce their prescribed treatments, including insulin and blood sugar-lowering medications. (Related: Intermittent fasting helps reduce inflammation, scientists find.)
Additionally, 55 percent of the study volunteers experienced total remission. They remained free of Type 2 diabetes for at least one year after discontinuing their medications.
For the study, remission is defined as HbA1c levels under 6.5. HbA1c is a measure of blood sugar control over time.
Dongbo Liu, the study’s lead author, is hopeful that the results can help benefit more than 537 million adults worldwide who have Type 2 diabetes.
“Type 2 diabetes is not necessarily a permanent, lifelong disease,” explained Liu.
But how did intermittent fasting benefit the study participants?
According to the researchers, the method’s success is linked to the body’s circadian rhythms or sleep-wake cycle.
They concluded that following a consistent daily short window of feeding can promote health by helping to align the circadian rhythms of multiple organs. In turn, this helps the body coordinate different processes and aids in the management of diseases.
They also warned against chronic circadian rhythm disruption, similar to what shift workers go through, because it compromises the immune system and increases the risk for chronic metabolic diseases by triggering adverse effects such as fatty liver disease, glucose intolerance and weight gain.
The new study supports earlier research that emphasized the benefits of intermittent fasting.
Research has found that the diet helped reduce body weight even though study participants aren’t normally advised to consciously reduce their caloric intake.
Recent human studies have produced promising results on time-restricted eating and its ability to reduce the risk of health issues such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
Experts think intermittent fasting can also help:
In a different animal study published in the journal Cell Metabolism, scientists reported that time-restricted eating changes gene expression and may offer benefits for managing diseases.
Based on the results, almost 40 percent of the genes in the animals’ adrenal glands, hypothalamus and pancreas were affected. This is important because these organs are crucial for hormonal regulation.
Intermittent fasting is based on the theory that maintaining a consistent, long overnight fast can significantly help reduce the risk of chronic disease.
While individual recommendations vary, the eating window, which is normally between eight and twelve hours long, shouldn’t begin until at least one hour has passed after waking. The eating window should then end at least three hours before the onset of an eight-hour sleep cycle.
The study authors advised that consistency is key when practicing intermittent fasting. This means if you start the diet, you should try to maintain the same schedule on both workdays and weekends.
If you haven’t tried intermittent fasting yet, check with your physician if it is safe for your condition before starting. If you are taking prescribed medications for diabetes, do not stop taking them unless your doctor explicitly recommends it.
While the study suggests that intermittent fasting offers impressive benefits for reversing Type 2 diabetes, the diet may also present some risks for people with the condition.
If you use insulin or medications and suddenly eat much less than you normally do, you may experience hypoglycemia, a condition where your blood sugar can drop too low.
According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), hypoglycemia can cause the following symptoms:
If you have diabetes, intermittent fasting can also increase your risk of developing hyperglycemia or high blood sugar.
Hyperglycemia can happen if you eat more than you normally do, which can happen if you’re very hungry after intermittent fasting.
High blood sugar levels can increase the risk of these diabetes complications:
Before starting intermittent fasting or other weight loss plans, check in with a member of your diabetes care team, such as a dietitian or a physician, to make sure it’s safe for you.
When done safely, intermittent fasting may offer some benefits if you have diabetes.
If you are diabetic and the diet helps you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, you may eventually be able to reduce the amount of diabetes medication you take.
Other potential benefits of intermittent fasting for diabetes include:
If you already have Type 2 diabetes, experts recommend managing your condition by eating these nutritious foods:
If you want to prevent Type 2 diabetes before it starts, follow a balanced diet and avoid fried foods along with sugary and heavily processed foods and beverages. Getting enough sleep and exercising regularly can also help protect against diabetes.
“Diabetes remission is possible if patients lose weight by changing their diet and exercise habits,” advised Liu.
While these recommendations are commonly given regardless of your disease, trying intermittent fasting can help you reach your health goals.

https://food.news/2023-02-22-storing-white-brown-sugar-for-long-term.html,Stockpiling tips: How to store white and brown sugar for the long term,"Advertisement
Sugar is a staple ingredient for any survival stockpile. Knowing how to store it properly ensures that white sugar and brown sugar will last as long as possible in your stockpile if you’re prepping for a long-term survival scenario. (h/t to AmericanPreppersOnline.com)
Check out the tips below if you want to learn how to store sugar long-term.
You can store sugar indefinitely if you do it correctly. Doing this ensures that when SHTF, you have access to a versatile ingredient in your emergency food shortage stockpile.

Sugar has an almost unlimited shelf life. It doesn’t support microbial growth as long as it’s not exposed to other elements.
Keeping sugar dry ensures that it won’t go bad even if you don’t use it for a long time.
Remember these tips when storing sugar long-term:
If you decant sugar from its original container, write the expiry date from the original packet and the date that you transferred it to another container. This will make it easier to track your supplies and decide which container of sugar needs to be used up first.
While you can refrigerate or freeze sugar, it’s not recommended unless you have a pest problem getting into your supply.
Because there are different kinds of sugar, you need to know how to store them correctly.
White sugar is a popular option if you want to buy sugar in bulk. It’s cheaper than other types of sugar and more widely available in larger quantities.
The amount of white sugar you buy will depend on the amount of storage that you have. If you buy white sugar in larger quantities, such as two kilograms or more, you can decant them into other containers for long-term storage.
One option is to portion them into smaller containers or resealable plastic bags so it’s easier to divide them into different places like a bug-out bag or emergency food stockpile. (Related: Prepper essentials: 50 Emergency items to stock up on before disaster strikes.)
Keep in mind that decanting sugar exposes it to the air and possibly moisture. Before you decant sugar, make sure new containers are sterilized and completely dry before transferring the sugar.
If you want to keep white sugar in the original paper bag that it comes in, you need to store this paper bag in an airtight container to keep it away from moisture.
There are different grades of brown sugar, but this article will focus on light brown sugar since it’s the most popular among preppers. Like white sugar, light brown sugar can be bought in bulk and stored in your emergency stockpile.
Light brown sugar is cheaper than dark brown sugar. It also has a similar texture to white sugar so you can store it in similar ways.
Here are the main ways to store light brown sugar:
If you need another alternative to sugar, you can also stock up on honey. Since honey has a very long shelf life, it’s easy to store.
Honey’s shelf life can be indefinite if you store it in ideal conditions. Keep honey in its original container and store it in a cool location away from direct sunlight.
If you want to decant honey, you can use a clean glass jar or an airtight container. Avoid storing honey in metal containers because it can oxidize and spoil.
Use a dry spoon when decanting honey to avoid starting off the fermentation process, which may happen if you use a wet spoon. Honey can be refrigerated, but it’s not ideal because it will harden in cold temperatures.
When prepping for a survival scenario, store white and brown sugar properly to make it last a long time in your stockpile. It’s best to use glass and plastic containers when storing brown and white sugar long term.

According to experts, by 2050 the world could have more people than food. They also warned that a worldwide food crisis “is imminent and approaching fast.”
The leading solution suggested by Professor Julian Cribb and other experts in the field is a global switch to vegetarianism, but this alternative comes with its own challenges. Experts think that 10 billion is the max cutoff point for the population and supporting more people than that is almost impossible.
This means that even if everyone agrees to avoid eating meat, issues related to soil, climate, land and access should still be considered.

If you are worried about a food shortage, protect your family by starting useful prepping practices like home gardening and food preservation. (h/t to AskAPrepper.com)
Dwindling food access is a bigger concern than running out of food. Several factors contribute to food access, and getting food from the farm to the table is a complicated process that has already seen some issues in recent years.
Before SHTF, protect yourself against a food shortage with the practices detailed below:
Foraging refers to the act of gathering food from the wilderness. This is a great option if you are looking for a way to supplement your diet without spending money.
Foraging food gives you access to a seasonal “supermarket” beyond your homestead. It’s also a great way to save money or make ends meet.
If you plan to forage, here are some things to keep in mind:
If you’re serious about foraging, invest in these essential tools:
What to forage
There are many edible plants to forage and with some knowledge and experience, you can gather a substantial amount of food for personal use or for selling.
However, what you forage will depend on where you live.
Blackberries and raspberries
Blackberries and raspberries can be found growing throughout the world. Blackberries are most abundant in autumn and are easy to identify.
Pick berries and freeze them as a quick treat or preserve them to use throughout the year. Berries can also be used for jams or pies.
Chestnuts
There are many wild nuts to forage and one of the most popular is the sweet chestnut.
Sweet chestnuts can be used to make pesto. You can also add it to holiday stuffing.
Chestnuts can also be roasted and enjoyed on their own. They can be found throughout the United States.
Dandelion
Dandelions are considered an annoying weed by most homeowners, but when SHTF, this edible plant is a godsend.
Dandelion is easy to identify and can be safely consumed after washing thoroughly. You can eat dandelion raw or use it in your cooking.
While all parts of the plant are edible, they are a little bitter.
Elderberries and elderflowers
Forage for elderberries and elderflowers from late May to early July.
Elderflowers are often used to make cordial, a delicious, liqueur-like beverage. The flowers can also be used to make jams, sorbet, or yogurt.
Nettles
Stinging nettles are a wild green and they are easy to identify, but you will need a pair of thick gloves.
Stinging nettle grows abundantly throughout North America and the plant thrives in damp soil.
The plant is often harvested for food and it can grow up to six feet tall in some locations. Look for stinging nettles growing along the roadside in dense patches.
Wild garlic
You can find wild garlic along the banks of streams and rivers since it thrives in damp ground. Wild garlic is a versatile ingredient and can be foraged from late March onwards.
When foraging for wild garlic, look out for its strong, pungent aroma that is reminiscent of garlic.
Be careful when foraging for wild garlic in Canada and the United States. Lily of the valley is a wild garlic look-a-like, but the flowers, leaves and fruits of the lily of the valley plant are poisonous.
Compared to foraging, home gardening is a more reliable way of protecting yourself against a food shortage. Whether you live on a homestead in the countryside or in a small apartment in the city, you can grow your own food outdoors or indoors. (Related: Home gardening tips: How to grow onions from seed.)
Growing crops indoors
If you live in an apartment, you can still grow vegetables indoors and in a small space. Use pots and planters to grow your favorite herbs and vegetables.
Here are some foods you can grow indoors:
You will need basic tools and supplies for your indoor garden. Not all these things are mandatory, but they can help increase your chance of success.
Growing food in an outdoor or indoor garden could save your life during a food shortage so start planting today.
If you have a garden, learning how to preserve can help make the excess food you grow last longer.
Learning to safely store food and preserve it long-term will help you overcome a food crisis. If things go well, you can also earn extra money with this skill.
You can store and maintain foods using a root cellar or cold storage. Store crops like beets, carrots and garlic in a root cellar.
You can also preserve food by drying or dehydrating it. You can either get a food dehydrator or use alternative methods like an oven or sun drying.
Another option is to learn canning. Invest in a professional canner and other canning equipment. If you want to save money, use a method called a water bath.
In water bath canning, you need a large stock pot to seal jars and preserve the contents. Canning food can make it last for weeks, months and even years.
The meat industry relies on processing and transportation to get food to consumers. But issues in production will take their toll and can hinder your ability to access meat and dairy.
If you are willing to put in the work, you can also raise livestock on your homestead. This practice is ideal if you also want to eat eggs, dairy and meat with vegetables from your garden.
Depending on where you live, you can raise large animals like cows or smaller ones like chickens or small animals on your property.
Chickens will provide you with eggs and poultry. Meanwhile, cows can give both milk and meat.
Before you raise livestock, check the laws in your state to ensure that you can house, raise and slaughter animals on your homestead.
If a food shortage hits the U.S., life will be challenging for preppers and non-preppers alike.
Find ways to become more self-sufficient so you can provide for your family when SHTF.

Food shortages, soaring gas prices and an unreliable supply chain can make people reconsider their priorities. And if you’re a prepper who lives in a crowded city, it might be a good idea to start homesteading after moving to a rural area.
If you want to become self-reliant or try a new hobby, you can look into raising animals on your property for meat or dairy. (h/t to Survivopedia.com)
While chickens are the first choice for many homesteaders, animal husbandry goes beyond chickens. Here are some animals that you can raise on your homestead for food:

When deciding between grazing animals, you can keep either a cow or sheep. What you choose will depend on what you need the animal for.
If you want milk, get some sheep. Sheep will also produce wool that you can use to make your own clothes, which you can also use for textile production as a source of income.
Keep in mind that if you get a lot of sheep, you will have to make sure that you have enough space to accommodate all the grazing animals.
You can also get lamb or mutton from sheep, but not everyone will like the taste of mutton. If you don’t like mutton, it might be better to raise cows since they will produce more meat.
Depending on the breed, your cows can also be a source of both milk and meat.
If you have a small homestead, one or two grazing animals may be enough for your family. However, if you want to raise livestock for profit, you will need more space for your animals.
Cows
Cows are the best choice for your homestead if your goal is to have a source of food. Before buying a cow, do your research to decide which breed is best for your budget, meat preference and location.
The most popular beef cattle are Angus, Hereford and Texas Longhorn.
If money is an issue, the number of cows you keep will impact your homesteading budget since feed costs will go up, depending on the number of animals you have. Cows will also need enough pasture. (Related: Chickens, cows and more: Things to consider before choosing livestock for your homestead.)
Sheep
Get sheep as starters or training animals since their feed costs and maintenance are pretty low.
Unlike cattle, sheep don’t require heavy-duty fencing and this helps significantly reduce your costs. Sheep also don’t require feeders or waterers as they can survive on grass alone.
Sheep are prey animals and they tend to live in social communities to provide extra security and protection from predators. Sheep live in a group called a flock and if one is separated from its flock, it can become anxious, nervous and depressed since it will feel vulnerable to danger.
Give your sheep peace of mind by always trying to keep it with other sheep or at least other livestock animals like goats.
If you are going to purchase sheep, plan on purchasing several to provide a flock environment. Ideally, your flock should have at least four to five sheep to provide a secure flock setting.
One downside to keeping sheep is they are more susceptible to parasites and worms compared to cattle. An infestation could do real damage to sheep before you can control it.
Ducks are also great layers. Like chickens, ducks are all-around birds that will provide you with meat and eggs.
If you’re not sure what breed to get, look up Muscovy ducks. Technically not a duck, Muscovy ducks have geese descendants.
These ducks haven’t been hybridized and are wilder than the average duck, but this makes them more self-reliant. They are great foragers, but they may take to the sky if you don’t clip their wings.
A Muscovy duck can grow up to 15 pounds and provide double the meat of an ordinary duck. They are not as productive as chickens, but the eggs ducks lay are more nutritious.
A miniature dairy goat is a great choice for many homestead beginners since they are low maintenance and provide milk.
Miniature dairy goats are obtained by breeding Nigerian dwarf goats with purebred American goats. There are many breeds to choose from, but the Nigerian Dwarf breed is ideal for newbies.
You will need a buck and a doe since the does will produce milk to feed their young. They will lactate for up to eight months after giving birth, and they don’t mind sharing their milk.
Nigerian dwarf goats are an all-around breed and they are highly productive even though they are small. Each doe will produce at least two quarts of milk per day.
With one buck and two does, you will get more kids as the does give birth. If you want to limit the breeding, separate the buck from the does. When the buck is isolated, it will get depressed, stop eating and may even die, so a separate pen nearby is often best.
You can keep the goats together if you have a wether (castrated buck). Wethers are less aggressive, are less prone to separation anxiety and they live longer. Wethers can keep either the does or bucks company, and can be used for meat.
If you want to raise pigs, keep in mind that they are harder to raise than other animals.
Make your life easier by getting Kunekune pigs, which originate from New Zealand. These medium-sized pigs have a more pleasant temperament compared to American pigs.
Kunekune pigs are fat and round. The females grow between 100 and 180 pounds and the males grow between 200 and 250 pounds.
These pigs have short snouts and they won’t challenge fences.
Kunekune pigs are grass-based and they love to forage for food. They don’t depend on grains like other breeds, and if you have a pasture for the cows or sheep, Kunekune pigs are an ideal choice.
Meat rabbits are an ideal choice for a small homestead since they don’t require much space if they are housed in cages or hutches.
They also cohabitate well with other animals, especially fowl, so you can build a large chicken or duck coop and house both your chickens and rabbits in it.
A rabbit farm can be highly productive because rabbits breed a lot and they provide ample meat. Should you end up with too many bunnies, you can sell the offspring to earn some money.
If you also have a home garden, use rabbit poop as a natural fertilizer with high nitrogen content.
It’s easy to place a bucket or trough under your hutches or to hang rabbit cages above a mulch pile to catch the poo. Just be sure to have drainage holes so the urine flows out. Doing so means the poop will compost with the mulch and help get rid of the smell.
Once you get animals for your homestead, you need to feed them properly to keep them healthy.

While raising animals on your homestead isn’t too complicated, it requires some trial and error, patience and a lot of hard work. Do your research and consider what you need on your homestead so you can choose the right animal(s) for you.

https://food.news/2023-02-21-nanoparticles-food-coloring-may-harm-gut-health.html,Study: Nanoparticles in common food coloring and anti-caking agents may harm gut health,"Advertisement
Many processed foods and beverages like cereal and sports drinks contain food coloring and anti-caking agents.
According to a study conducted by scientists from Binghamton University and Cornell University, these ingredients and additives may damage your gut health.
The study revealed that metal oxide particles in particular could be disrupting the health of your intestines. Details of the study were published in the journal Antioxidants.
Elad Tako, senior author and associate professor of food science at Cornell, warned that people are consuming nanoparticles from food coloring and anti-caking agents on a daily basis.

He cautioned that they still don’t know how much people consume and there is no definitive data on the long-term effects of this consumption. Through the study, Tako and his colleagues were able to demonstrate some of these effects.
Tako added that the study findings could be used to learn more about gastrointestinal health and development.
In earlier studies, Binghamton researchers led in vitro cellular assessments and screened different nanoparticles used frequently in food and pharmaceutical industries.” The research team then narrowed its focus to specific metal oxide nanoparticles to confirm proper testing dosages that are suitable for human consumption.
For the collaborative study, experts from Binghamton and Cornell used human-appropriate doses of titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide in the laboratory’s in vivo system.
The model helped the researchers monitor the display of a health response comparable to that of real humans, and they injected the nanoparticles into chicken eggs.
After the eggs hatched, the scientists observed changes in the functional, structural and microbial markers within their blood, the duodenum or upper intestine, and the cecum or pouch that connects the small and large intestines.
Results revealed that titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide, two nanoparticles commonly used in food, “may negatively affect intestinal functionality.” Specifically, the nanoparticles have a negative effect on “key digestive and absorptive proteins.” (Related: These 3 foods can boost your heart and gut health.)
The research team also studied zinc oxide, a micronutrient, and iron oxide, an iron fortification supplement, to see how they function. Their findings revealed that zinc oxide nanoparticles help support the intestines and may help them compensate after suffering damage.
On the other hand, iron oxide nanoparticles seemed to negatively alter intestinal function and overall health.
This means that while iron oxide may serve as a viable option for iron fortification, it is not the best option for maintaining gut integrity. Researchers reported that zinc oxide would be the best choice.
While these findings about currently available food-grade nanoparticles aren’t all positive, the research team doesn’t think their use should be banned completely without further research to back up that decision.
They also recommended that more feasible developments would have to be made to introduce “healthier, more cost-effective and sustainable alternatives.”
Dyes are used in foods to make processed food look more attractive, but they have no nutritional benefit.
Protect your gut health by following the tips below to avoid food dyes:
Choose organic foods
Look for organic foods with the green-and-white United States Department of Agriculture-certified organic label. Remember that some foods labeled “made with organic ingredients” may still contain synthetic dyes.
The best way to remove artificial food dyes from your diet is to prepare meals using whole, unprocessed foods that are full of various nutrients.
These foods are naturally dye-free:
Watch out for the term “artificial”
The terms “artificial color,” “artificial color added” or “color added” mean that nature-derived pigments were used and that synthetic dyes must be listed by their names.
Avoid numbers in ingredient lists
You can pick out man-made food dyes that appear in ingredient lists if there is a name of a color with a number following it, like Blue 1 and 2, Citrus Red 2, Green 3, Red 40 or Yellow 5 and 6. Avoid these products to steer clear of food dyes.
Seek out natural colorants

When you’re hungry and craving a quick snack, it’s tempting to make some instant noodles or reheat leftover pizza instead of cooking something healthy. However, enjoying these processed foods regularly may have a negative effect on your overall health.
Data reveals that at least two-thirds of American adults are either overweight or obese. At the same time, millions of people eat fast food every day.
According to a large-scale population study conducted by researchers from the University of Sydney (USYD), eating highly-processed (ultra-processed) snacks can promote overeating, contribute to unwanted weight gain and even increase your risk of developing chronic disease.

The study was published in the journal Obesity.
For the study, researchers examined data from more than 9,000 volunteers obtained by the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding nutrition and physical activity.
After analyzing the data, scientists found that highly-processed and refined foods cause protein hunger, a condition that triggers overeating and contributes to obesity. The researchers said that the findings help to confirm the “Protein Leverage Hypothesis” or the theory that people overeat fats and carbohydrates because their body craves protein more than other nutrients.
Worth noting is the fact that the food consumed in Western diets contains lower amounts of protein, something highly lacking in processed foods. Additionally, processed foods continue to make up larger proportions of many people’s daily diets.
Dr. Amanda Grech, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Sydney‘s Charles Perkins Center, explained that as people consume more junk foods or highly-processed and refined foods, they continue to “dilute their dietary protein and increase their risk of being overweight and obese.”
David Raubenheimer, study co-author, a professor and the Leonard Ullmann Chair in Nutritional Ecology at USYD, confirms the negative effects of improper nutrition. “Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease – they’re all driven by diet, cautioned Raubenheimer.
The research team discovered that participants who consumed lower amounts of protein in their first meal of the day increased their overall food intake throughout the day, which could be due to an attempt to compensate by consuming more calories.
The participants who also lacked protein consumed higher amounts of discretionary foods or high-calorie foods that are also full of saturated fats, trans fats, salt, sugars, chemical sweeteners or alcohol. Additionally, they consumed vegetables, fruits, fewer grains, dairy products and meats.
Meanwhile, the participants who ate foods with a higher proportion of protein at their first meal tended to eat less fat and carbohydrates throughout the day.
Other factors like physical activity levels, eating patterns and sleep routines can also contribute to obesity, but Raubenheimer concluded that protein hunger due to eating processed foods is a major cause.
He believes that the concept of protein mechanism in appetite is a “revolutionary insight” with significant implications for global health.
The USYD study isn’t the first to highlight the adverse effects of poor eating habits, weight gain and disease risk.
In a 2012 review also published in the journal Obesity, researchers identified three major contributing factors to obesity in Western populations.
This “triple whammy” includes:
Obesity isn’t the only adverse outcome.
Having poor eating habits can also increase the risk of potentially life-threatening degenerative diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.
In a 2019 study of 100,000 adults published in The BMJ, scientists reported that a 10 percent increase in ultra-processed food intake was linked to a corresponding 10 percent increase in heart disease risk.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines processed food as any raw agricultural product that has been:
Eating whole foods is good for you, but it’s also fine to eat food that has had some degree of light processing. Just make sure you limit your intake of or avoid ultra-processed foods like cakes, cookies, chips, frozen meals, instant soups and soda because they are bad for you.
If you love processed foods but want to improve your eating habits, try some of the tips below:
Make healthy snacks
If you want something sweet, pair Greek yogurt with raspberries. You can also eat apple chunks with almond butter.
If you like cheese and fruits, mix a small amount of raw, unpasteurized cheese with fresh papaya.
If you want a savory snack, eat hummus with carrot sticks and cucumber. You can also eat cherry tomatoes with cashew cheese drizzled with a bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
Instead of eating junk food with empty calories, choose healthy snacks like fruits, vegetables and nuts that are more satisfying. They also contain antioxidants, dietary fiber, healthy fats, essential vitamins, important minerals and higher amounts of protein than most commercial snack products. (Related: Cut down on processed food intake with these simple steps.)
Boost your protein intake
Increase your daily intake of protein, which your body needs for the repair and production of cells, by eating grass-fed beef, pasture-raised poultry, eggs or wild-caught fish.
If you are vegetarian, choose plant-based protein sources like beans, legumes, quinoa, soy and wheat germ. Try to buy organic products to avoid pesticides in fruits and vegetables.
Eat more fruits and vegetables
Fruits and vegetables are rich in various nutrients. They contain dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and plant compounds that help fight inflammation and prevent cell damage.
Many large observational studies have found a link between high fruit and vegetable intake to a reduced risk of health problems like cancer and heart disease.
If possible, eat fresh vegetables and fruits since most of them can be consumed raw immediately after picking and washing.
Here are some tips on how to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your regular diet:
Drink more water
Water is the most natural beverage you can drink: It is free from harmful additives, sugars, artificial sweeteners or other unhealthy ingredients.
You also need to drink enough water every day to prevent dehydration. Staying hydrated may also help you achieve a moderate weight.
Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and store-bought fruit juices that have been linked to diseases like Type 2 diabetes and obesity.
If you are not sensitive to caffeine, unsweetened coffee and tea are also good choices. These beverages offer several health benefits.
If you don’t like drinking plain water, add sliced fruit or the juice of a lemon or lime to naturally add flavor to a glass of water.
Avoid processed foods like cookies and potato chips and prepare healthy snacks like veggie sticks with homemade dip to prevent overeating and avoid unhealthy weight gain.

https://food.news/2023-02-16-cherries-promote-weight-loss-boost-heart-health.html,"Study shows cherries can promote weight loss, boost heart health and treat gout","Advertisement
Cherries are a delicious fruit, and studies found that they also offer several health benefits.
According to studies, cherries can promote weight loss and even protect against gout.
Cherries come in both sweet and sour (tart) varieties. The fruit is full of a potent and beneficial antioxidant called anthocyanin.
Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments that, depending on their pH, make certain foods black, blue, purple or red.
Cherries are also rich in vitamin C, a nutrient you need for immune health. They are also a great source of dietary fiber (Related: Study: Cherries can help fight heart disease, diabetes and other inflammatory diseases.)

One cup of sweet, raw cherries without pits offers the following nutrients:
Fresh sour cherries are more difficult to find compared to sweet cherries. One cup of fresh cherries without pits contains:
If you’re trying to lose weight, you can enjoy cherries as a healthy snack. Cherries are low in calories and full of dietary fiber and they can help you feel full faster so you eat less.
In a 2009 study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food, researchers observed rats split into two groups. Both were given a high-fat diet for 90 days.
One group of animal subjects received whole tart cherry powder and the other did not.
The research team found that the animals who received the cherry powder did not gain as much weight or build as much body fat. Additionally, their blood showed much lower levels of inflammation compared to the rats who did not get cherry powder.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. At least 697,000 people died from heart disease in 2020, which accounted for one in five deaths.
Heart disease costs America a whopping $229 billion annually, which includes the cost of healthcare services, medicines and lost productivity due to premature death.
Key risk factors for heart disease include diabetes, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure (hypertension), obesity, smoking, having an unhealthy diet, not getting enough exercise and the excessive use of alcohol.
If you are worried about your heart health, you can switch to a healthy diet to help lower your risk of developing heart disease.
Research suggests that the anthocyanins, flavonols, vitamins and dietary fiber in cherries and other berries can help lower your risk of developing cardiovascular disease and improve heart health.
Data from clinical studies in healthy humans; those with health issues like diabetes, dyslipidemia (an excess of cholesterol or fats in the blood), high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome; and those who smoke show a significant decrease in cardiovascular disease risk factors after they ate berries.
The same study also suggests that the anthocyanins in cherries can help boost heart health by reducing metabolic risk factors, improving low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, improving glucose metabolism and reducing fat and cholesterol levels in the blood.
In a 2013 study published in the journal Current Pharmaceutical Design, scientists reported that sour cherry seed extract had a cardioprotective effect in rabbits with high cholesterol.
Researchers who conducted the study also discovered that the rabbits who were given sour cherry seed extract had significantly improved cardiac function and a decrease in atherosclerotic plaque formation and infarct size.
An infarct is a small, localized area of dead tissue that forms due to a lack of blood supply.
Gout or hyperuricemia is a form of arthritis that causes symptoms such as inflammation, redness and severe pain. It occurs when you have too much uric acid in the blood and it crystallizes in your joints.
Gout usually affects the small bones in the feet, particularly the big toe. Gout is very common and it affects over nine million people in America or at least 3.9 percent of the adult population.
You can develop gout when your body produces too much uric acid or your kidneys do not filter enough out. Additionally, foods high in purines can trigger an attack of gout because your body breaks down purines and turns them into uric acid.
Avoid these foods since they can trigger gout because of their high purine content:
Cherries have long been used as a remedy for gout because they can help cleanse the blood and prevent inflammation.
In another study published in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatism, scientists observed 633 volunteers with gout to find out if cherry extract could decrease the number of gout attack sufferers experienced.
The participants who were given cherry extract had a 35 percent lower risk of gout attacks compared to the people in the control group.
After adding allopurinol, a medication used to lower uric acid levels in the blood of people with gout and certain types of kidney stones, to the cherry extract group, the risk of gout attacks was reduced by as much as 75 percent.
Cherries naturally contain melatonin, the hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles. Other foods that naturally contain melatonin are bananas, eggs, fatty fish, goji berries, milk, nuts and pistachios.
Melatonin has many important functions in the human body. It supports regular sleep cycles and circadian rhythm and it has been shown to improve immune system function.
The sleep hormone also has neuroprotective effects and helps slow processes linked to aging.
Some fruits and vegetables are particularly susceptible to the accumulation of pesticides, and cherries are especially prone to these buildups.
According to the consumer advocacy group the Environmental Working Group (EWG), commercially grown cherries are on their top 12 list of fruits and vegetables with the highest levels of pesticide residues.
According to the EWG’s 2022 Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce, 90 percent of cherries tested had residues of two or more pesticides. To reap the health benefits of cherries and avoid harmful pesticides, buy only organic cherries.
Here are some healthy ways to enjoy organic cherries:

https://food.news/2023-02-16-6-superfoods-that-can-help-ease-anxiety.html,Healing with whole foods: 6 Superfoods that can help ease anxiety,"Advertisement
Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread and uneasiness. It can be triggered by stressful situations, like feeling under pressure from work or family life. An estimated 40 percent of Americans suffer from anxiety.
Cutting out caffeine, exercising regularly and getting eight hours of sleep every night can help relieve anxiety. But if you are still feeling anxious, making some changes to your eating habits can help.
Studies suggest gut and anxiety are closely linked and that a lack of some vitamins and nutrients may trigger feelings of worry and concern. Anxiety is also linked to inflammation in your body. Fortunately, certain superfoods can help counteract this and reduce damage to your cells.

Fight anxiety with these superfoods:
Blueberries are a superfood powerhouse and researchers have found that the benefits of blueberries may also help reduce anxiety.
According to research, blueberries can help reverse cognitive decline, protect against dementia and lower heart disease risk. The berries are also full of vitamin C and scientists think this can help prevent anxiety.
Vitamin C helps reduce the amount of cortisol or the stress hormone that is released in response to a stressful event, meaning the vitamin can help reduce feelings of anxiety.
Small-scale studies also suggest a link between eating blueberries and lower levels of anxiety. In a 2020 study, 64 adolescents were given a daily supplement of blueberries for four weeks.
At the end of the study, the young participants were all reporting fewer symptoms of depression.
Additionally, blueberries are full of antioxidants, which can help reduce cell damage caused by stress.
Health authorities recommend that women should get about 75 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C a day while men should get 90 mg. One cup of blueberries contains about 25 percent of the daily requirement for vitamin C.
Dark chocolate contains flavonols, or plant compounds that are antioxidants. These compounds can help reduce damage to the body caused by stress.
Studies also suggest that dark chocolate can boost blood flow to the brain, which can boost alertness and help you adjust better to stressful situations.
Eggs are a controversial food, with some saying they are linked to high cholesterol and others claiming they should be part of a balanced diet.
Like other superfoods, when consumed in moderation, eggs offer many benefits. Eggs are one of the few foods full of vitamin D, which your body uses to produce and release serotonin, the “feel-good” hormone.
Data from earlier studies have found that boosting your vitamin D intake can help raise serotonin levels. This then helps boost your mood. (Related: Study: 5-HTP can boost serotonin levels and promote healthy eating habits.)
Papers have also suggested a link between vitamin D deficiency and anxiety.
Adults need about 400 to 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day. One large egg contains about 44 IUs of vitamin D or 10 percent of your daily needs.
Estimates suggest that one in two Americans is deficient in vitamin D, which is more prevalent among people in the black ethnic group. Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency include fatigue, poor sleep quality and feelings of depression or sadness.
Some say eating hummus can help combat anxiety. Hummus is a Middle Eastern dip made from chickpeas and it is full of tryptophan.
The body uses tryptophan to make melatonin, the sleep hormone, and serotonin. More serotonin can help improve your mood and fight feelings of anxiety.
Research also suggests that melatonin can help you get a good night’s sleep. Getting enough sleep may help to lower feelings of anxiety.
If you have trouble falling asleep, try taking melatonin shortly before your bedtime.
Small-scale studies have suggested that getting more tryptophan can lower anxiety. The data is also backed up by large-scale studies.
In one study, 15 adults were exposed to a stressful environment twice: Once when they had normal tryptophan levels in their blood and when they had lower levels.
Results revealed that anxiety, tensions and feelings of nervousness were higher when the participants had lower tryptophan levels. This suggests that the amount of tryptophan in the body may contribute to anxiety levels.
Additionally, tryptophan may help improve memory and learning. It can also help you get a good night’s sleep.
If you follow a balanced diet, you should be able to get enough tryptophan.
Experts suggest that you need about 250 to 425 mg of tryptophan a day, but estimates suggest that most individuals are already consuming more than 900 mg every day.
Experts often recommend the Mediterranean diet because it can help you live longer and make you less likely to develop dementia.
Researchers also suggest that eating salmon, a key ingredient of the Mediterranean diet, may also help lower levels of anxiety. Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which previous studies have suggested can reduce inflammation in the body and lower anxiety.
According to previous large-scale studies, a diet rich in omega-3s is associated with lower levels of anxiety.
In a 2020 meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials involving 2,240 participants, researchers observed an improvement in anxiety symptoms when the participants consumed more foods containing omega-3s.
Small-scale papers also detected a link. In a paper from 2014, men who ate salmon three times a week for five months reported lower anxiety levels than other participants eating a similar amount of beef, chicken, or pork every week.
Omega-3 fatty acids can also help lower the risk of heart disease or stroke and reduce symptoms of eczema and some types of arthritis.
The American Heart Association recommends that adults get from 500 to 1,000 mg of omega-3s per day.
Yogurt is full of good bacteria, which can contribute to building and maintaining a healthy gut microbiome.
A healthy gut microbiome can help reduce the risk of one of the symptoms of anxiety, an upset stomach. This is often caused by stress hormones interfering with the digestive system.
In one study involving 66 postmenopausal women, scientists reported that eating probiotic yogurt once a day for six weeks was associated with lower levels of reported anxiety.
The best types of yogurt for combating anxiety are probiotic yogurts like Greek yogurt and kefir.
If you are still feeling anxious after trying some of the superfoods above, the culprit may be one of the trigger foods detailed below:
Alcohol
Drinking alcohol can make you feel more relaxed, but this good mood is often temporary.
In the long run, alcohol is a depressant. Drink alcohol in moderation and drink lots of water to stay hydrated.
Candy and sweets
Many people have a sweet tooth, but desserts only give you a temporary high.
Sugar is absorbed quickly into the bloodstream and the absorption causes an initial high or surge of energy. Eventually, that surge wears off as your body increases its insulin production to remove the sugar from your bloodstream. After eating sweets, you will just feel tired and low.
Processed foods
According to a study, processed foods like hot dogs, sausage and cakes may cause anxiety after eating since a diet of processed and fatty foods increases the risk for depression.
In the study, the participants who mainly ate high-fat dairy products, fried food, processed meat and sweetened desserts had a 58 percent higher risk of depression than those who ate “whole” foods, like fish and vegetables.
Boost your mood naturally by eating superfoods like berries, hummus and salmon.

https://food.news/2023-02-15-2-cups-coffee-daily-healthy-blood-pressure.html,Study: Drinking at least 2 cups of coffee a day helps maintain healthy blood pressure,"Advertisement
If you start each morning with a cup (or two) of coffee, here’s something that might cheer you up: According to a study, those who drink at least two or three cups of coffee per day have lower blood pressure than people who consume less.
The study was published in the journal Nutrients.
Coffee is an integral part of the culture in Italy and the beverage also has many fans worldwide. In 2020 and 2021, estimates revealed that the world consumed a whopping 10 million tons of coffee.

While experts don’t always agree on coffee’s health implications, data from recent studies suggest that drinking coffee can help lower the risk of several conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and neurodegenerative and liver diseases.
But what causes these benefits remains a mystery.
Arrigo Cicero, the study’s first author and a professor at the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences at the University of Bologna, explained that caffeine is only one of several coffee components and that it’s not the only component with an active role.
Cicero added that positive effects on human health have also been recorded in people who choose to drink decaffeinated coffee. While data has shown that caffeine can increase blood pressure, other bioactive components in coffee “seem to counterbalance this effect with a positive end result on blood pressure levels.” (Related: 5 Caffeine FACTS and 5 caffeine MYTHS.)
To learn more about the heart benefits of coffee, researchers analyzed a sample of 720 men and 783 women from the Brisighella Heart Study.
The research team compared blood pressure levels, coffee consumption habits and other clinical data points for each participant. The results revealed that peripheral blood pressure was significantly lower in the people who drank one to three cups of coffee a day compared to the non-coffee drinkers.
Peripheral blood pressure describes blood pressure measured from the upper arm.
Thanks to the study, researchers were also able to confirm these effects “with regard to the central aortic pressure, the one close to the heart,” where experts observe an almost identical phenomenon “with entirely similar values for habitual coffee drinkers compared to non-coffee drinkers.”
High blood pressure is closely linked to heart disease because of the high force of blood consistently pushing against the walls of your blood vessels. This forces the heart to work harder so it can pump blood.
The findings from the  University of Bologna study are valuable because they offer another potential nutritional avenue for naturally lowering blood pressure and protecting against heart disease.
Professor Claudio Borghi, who led the study, explained that it is the first study to observe this association in the Italian population. The findings also confirm the positive effect of coffee consumption on cardiovascular risk.
Hypertension (high blood pressure) affects one-third of all adults in the U.S., and only less than 50 percent of them have the condition under control.
This is bad because high blood pressure can cause serious health problems without showing any warning signs. When your blood pressure is too high for too long, it puts you at risk for conditions like heart disease, kidney damage, stroke or an aneurysm formation.
Fortunately, making good lifestyle changes can help you naturally lower your blood pressure.
Exercise regularly
Regular physical activity is crucial for your overall well-being. Exercise helps control high blood pressure and it can also help you manage a healthy weight, strengthen your heart and lower stress levels.
If you are fit enough, aim for at least 150 minutes of exercise per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, like brisk walking.
While any type of aerobic activity like dancing, jogging or walking offers benefits for your heart health, try to find activities you enjoy doing so it will be easier to commit to a regular routine.
Increase your potassium intake
Potassium offers many benefits. It can help regulate heart rate and it can also reduce the effects of sodium in the body.
The nutrient helps your body eliminate sodium and also eases tension in your blood vessel walls, both of which help to lower blood pressure.
The most effective way to increase your potassium intake is by adjusting your diet and eating potassium-rich foods such as:
Incorporating these superfoods into your diet can help boost your heart health, but if you’re not sure check with your doctor about the potassium level that’s right for you.
If you have significant kidney disease, avoid consuming too much potassium because your kidneys may not be able to eliminate it.
Reduce your salt intake
Most people consume too much salt without even realizing it. The American Heart Association estimates that the average American consumes a whopping 3,400 mg of sodium a day.
The recommended daily intake is only 2,300 mg, with an ideal limit of less than 1,500 mg per day, especially for people who have high blood pressure.
Making a small reduction in your sodium intake can still help improve your heart health. It can also reduce your blood pressure if you have high blood pressure.
Follow these tips to decrease sodium in your diet:
Moderate your alcohol consumption
According to some studies, drinking alcohol in moderation can benefit your heart. But drinking too much alcohol can trigger a sudden spike in your blood pressure.
If you do drink, the American Heart Association recommends that men limit their alcohol consumption to two drinks per day. Women should limit their alcohol intake to one drink per day.
A drink is considered one 4 oz. of wine, 12 oz. beer, 1.5 oz. of 80-proof spirits, or 1 oz. of 100-proof spirits.
If you’re currently taking medication to treat high blood pressure, closely monitor your alcohol intake since it can reduce the effectiveness of blood pressure medications.
Manage your stress levels
Stress is a common part of your daily life and when a stressful situation is resolved, your heart rate and blood pressure usually returns to normal. But be wary of chronic stress because it may put you at risk for many long-term health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.
Stress can also increase your blood pressure levels if your coping mechanisms involve snacking on junk food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
It’s impossible to eliminate all stressors from your life, but learning to cope with them in a healthier way can benefit your overall health and wellness. This can then help lower your blood pressure.
Avoid stress triggers and try to avoid putting yourself in unnecessary stressful situations. If the commute to work means you often get stuck in rush-hour traffic, try leaving for work a few minutes early.
You should also take time to relax and enjoy. Spend a couple of hours on the weekend doing things that make you happy. It can be as simple as preparing a healthy and delicious meal, reading or enjoying a cup of coffee with your best friend.
Follow a balanced diet, maintain a healthy weight and drink two to three cups of coffee a day to help reduce your blood pressure.

https://food.news/2023-02-15-natural-healing-6-superfoods-help-relieve-headaches.html,Natural healing: 6 Superfoods that can help relieve headaches,"Advertisement
People of all ages suffer from headaches, whether it’s a low-grade tension headache or a debilitating migraine. If you suffer from chronic headaches and are hesitant to take over-the-counter medications that often cause negative side effects, try natural remedies and superfoods like ginger or yogurt.
Headaches have many causes. Factors like colds and other seasonal illnesses, changes in sleep patterns, insomnia, stress, travel and interrupted routines can cause one.
Some headaches like debilitating migraines can also be hereditary.

Headaches can also be triggered by eating certain foods. But some foods and drinks can help relieve and reduce the occurrence of headaches.
Caffeine is considered a valuable and safe option for relieving headaches.
In a 2012 study published in The Journal of Headache and Pain, researchers reported that a mix of 1,000 mg of paracetamol and 130 mg of caffeine was as effective and as safe as 50 mg of oral sumatriptan when treating headaches.
In a different study published in the journal Nature in July 2020, results showed that caffeine is safe and effective when treating acute migraine and pairing it with painkillers.
But scientists warn that drinking too much coffee may lead to chronic migraine and sudden caffeine withdrawal may cause migraine attacks. If you suffer from migraines, closely monitor your caffeine intake and avoid exceeding 200 mg per day.
Studies on the link between diet and headaches revealed that increasing daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids benefits headaches and may even help prevent migraines.
Seafood is a traditional dietary source of omega-3 fatty acids. But if you are vegan, you can try flaxseed as a plant-based source of omega-3s.
Flaxseed is one of the best plant sources of omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid. If you suffer from constant headaches, try flaxseed to improve your symptoms.
If you haven’t tried flaxseed yet, keep in mind that it is not for everyone.
Flaxseed has anticoagulant properties so avoid it if you are:
Ginger has been used as an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine for 2,000 years. It is also a common medicinal ingredient in Indian and Arabic medicine.
In a 2018 study by the International Headache Society published by Sage Journals, scientists discovered that adding ginger extract to routine treatment of acute migraine can “significantly reduce pain more effectively than conventional therapy alone.”
In another 2014 study published in the journal Phytotherapy Research, findings showed that the benefits of ginger powder are similar to the common migraine drug sumatriptan. However, ginger had fewer side effects.
In a 2019 study published in the International Journal of Preventive Medicine, researchers reported that more than 70 percent of patients experienced headache relief after using nasal drops of oil with a concentration of 1.5 percent peppermint.
Additionally, 42 percent of the patients felt a significant reduction in headaches. Almost 50 percent of the participants reported that their headaches subsided within five minutes of using the peppermint nasal drops.
In a 2012 study published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice, findings showed that applying a 10 percent menthol solution to the forehead and temples could effectively relieve pain and nausea. The study also revealed that the menthol solution was a safe and effective treatment option for migraine. (Related: 10 Possible triggers of an afternoon headache.)
Plain yogurt is full of vitamin B2 or riboflavin which helps reduce the number of migraine attacks in patients. Riboflavin is an essential nutrient that assists mitochondria in human cells to generate energy.
In a randomized controlled trial, volunteers who were given 400 mg of riboflavin, 600 mg of magnesium, 150 mg of coenzyme Q10 and multivitamins for three months reported that their migraine symptoms improved.
Several journals identified links between magnesium deficiency and mild to moderate tension headaches and migraines.
According to double-blind random placebo control trials, magnesium can effectively help relieve headaches. In several countries, medical guidelines recommend oral magnesium when treating headaches.
Magnesium also has a role in neuromuscular function and neurotransmission. The nutrient helps prevent neurons from overreacting, and balancing neurons may help prevent migraines.
Green leafy vegetables are also rich in magnesium, especially spinach. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 100g of cooked spinach contains 87 mg of magnesium.
If you’ve ruled out other causes like a cold or insomnia, here are seven other reasons you might have a headache:
Alcohol intake
Any kind of alcohol can trigger headaches. It is a common cause of cluster headaches and migraines. Some people often get headaches after drinking only a couple of ounces of red wine.
Experts have yet to find out if the alcohol itself is causing headaches or if another component in the drink causes the problem.
Caffeine withdrawal
If you normally consume caffeine in beverages like coffee or tea, going cold turkey may trigger a migraine.
This may be because caffeine makes blood vessels constrict. Without consuming caffeine, your blood vessels widen and bulge out with each heartbeat, which can cause the pounding pain of migraines.
Diet
Hunger can trigger a migraine or tension headache.
On the other hand, eating certain foods may trigger migraines. For some people, eating just one type of food, like beans or nuts, can cause migraines.
For others, many foods like avocados, bananas, cheese, chocolate, citrus, herring, dairy products and onions can cause migraines. According to experts, processed foods with monosodium glutamate, nitrates, nitrites, or yellow food dyes can be “especially problematic.”
Environment
Cluster headaches seem to be seasonal and people often experience them in the spring or fall.
According to researchers, something in the environment triggers cluster headaches but they have yet to figure out the exact cause. Environmental factors such as bright light, cold weather, humidity, intense scents, or smoke are linked to migraines.
Hormones
Changes in estrogen levels are linked to migraines in women and women suffer from migraines more often than men.
Menstrual cycles may be linked to migraines in younger women. Varying estrogen levels during perimenopause can sometimes trigger migraines in women who never experienced them before.
Estrogen therapy may also be a migraine trigger. Fortunately, menopause seems to end migraines in most women.
Lack of sleep
Not getting enough sleep can also cause migraines and tension headaches.
Experts don’t know why, but they think getting enough sleep can help relieve pain caused by headaches. Some people report feeling better after taking a nap.
Stress
Stress can cause tight muscles in your shoulders and neck, which can then cause tension headaches. It may start in your muscles, suggests experts.
If you often get tension headaches, the pain in your shoulder and neck muscles is interpreted by your brain as pain in your head. Stress is also a common migraine trigger.
If you suffer from frequent headaches, try drinking ginger tea or eating some pumpkin seeds to relieve your symptoms.

https://food.news/2023-02-14-drinking-oolong-tea-can-help-reverse-aging.html,Study: Drinking oolong tea can help reverse aging,"Advertisement
According to a study published in the journal Aging, drinking oolong tea regularly can help improve longevity.
For the 2021 study, researchers conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial of 43 healthy adult men. The volunteers were between the ages of 50 and 72.
Results of the study suggest that making evidence-based lifestyle changes could help reduce biological age.
The test group took part in an eight-week treatment program that included guidance on health-related factors like:

Those in the control group received no intervention. After eight weeks, the research team took saliva samples to measure the participants’ health.
Upon examining data from the volunteers, the researchers discovered that the people in the group that made changes to their diet and lifestyle habits had healthier DNA. Data suggested that those in the treatment group appeared to reverse their own aging by as much as three years.
If the study findings are correct and can be duplicated in a longer experiment with both male and female volunteers, adopting some of the healthy habits of the treatment group can also help boost your longevity.
For example, drinking three cups of oolong tea was one of the health practices given to the volunteers in the treatment group. (Related: 6 Primary types of tea and their science-backed health benefits.)
In an article, Dr. Kara Fitzgerald, one of the co-authors of the study, explained that oolong tea contains a plant compound called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Research has shown that EGCG can help protect against Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, insulin resistance and obesity.
Other studies also suggest that drinking oolong tea daily offers several health benefits.
In a review article published in May 2022 in the peer-reviewed journal Food Science and Human Wellness, scientists reported that oolong tea has “antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-biotic, and anti-obesity properties.”
Additionally, oolong tea was found to improve the gut microbiome and protect the heart and liver.
“In spite of its popularity in Asian countries, studies on health promoting effects of oolong tea and its characteristic compounds … have attracted limited attention as compared to the knowledge of preventative and therapeutic effects of green and black teas,” said the study authors.
Most of the studies compiled in the review were controlled laboratory experiments on rodents, but the broad benefits of oolong tea on human health have also been observed in other studies.
Experts believe that these health benefits could be due to theasinensins, a spectrum of important compounds in tea. Theasinensin A is a natural compound found in oolong tea.
In a 2015 study conducted on the chemistry and health benefits of oolong tea and theasinensins, scientists found that the different processing methods for the tea plant Camellia sinensis change these molecules in various ways. Using certain methods produces different biochemical effects in different tea types like black, green and oolong tea.
Theasinesins help stabilize your blood sugar, which is an anti-diabetic effect. The compounds may also help athletes recover more quickly from vigorous exercise.
Oolong tea also contains gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), another beneficial compound, along with theanine. Both substances complement the caffeine tea so when you drink oolong you feel calm, clear-headed alertness instead of the jittery energy that comes with drinking coffee.
With data that confirmed the benefits of GABA and after finding a market for GABA-enriched foods in Asia, researchers discovered a way to multiply the amount of GABA in tea by letting it ferment in nitrogen gas. The process helps keep oxygen out.
GABA-enriched teas are produced in Japan and Taiwan and these products are popular in both countries.
In a 2019 study, scientists looked into the effects of GABA-enriched oolong on heart health and stress levels. They monitored participants’ hearts with EKGs.
The participants were also asked about their current feeling of stress and given tests of mental arithmetic as a stressor.
After drinking one cup of oolong tea, with half GABA-enriched and half regular, the perceived stress levels of the volunteers were significantly lower after consuming GABA-enriched tea,
Their heart rate variability was also lower and this is significant since it is an important metric of heart health and fitness, especially in response to stress.
Oolong means “black dragon” in Chinese and the tea comes from China. It is especially popular in Taiwan.
Most teas are made from the plant Camellia sinensis and depending on how the plant is processed, it can become black, green, oolong, pu-erh, white or yellow tea.
Green, white and yellow teas are processed with sundrying and heating. These processes don’t oxidize the tea leaves.
However, black tea is fully oxidized and the oxidation process happens before the tea leaves are processed.
On the other hand, oolong tea is only partially oxidized by at least 10 to 70 percent. The partial oxidation gives oolong tea a softer, woodier flavor.
Some oolongs are so lightly oxidized that they may taste like green tea but a little more mellow. Other oolongs that are mostly oxidized have a warm, muted flavor.
While each variety is different, several oolong teas contain less caffeine than black teas.
Like other superfoods, oolong tea must be consumed in moderation.
It’s also best not to drink oolong on an empty stomach because it can make you feel hungry and dizzy, an unpleasant state that Chinese people call “tea drunk.”
If you want a good night’s sleep, don’t drink oolong tea within three or four hours of your bedtime. Even if oolong tea has calming effects, it still contains caffeine that can make you jittery and make it harder to fall asleep.
Drink oolong tea while it’s still warm for the most delicious tea-drinking experience.
To make oolong tea, use clean-tasting water.
Oolongs thrive with full-boiling or just-off boiling water. Brew the tea for short amounts of time.
Savor oolong teas in a series of small infusions to appreciate their changing character as you drink. This means using at least a minimum of five grams of tea per 100 milliliters of water.
For darker oolongs, you can use as many as eight to 10 grams for that same volume, then steep them in a series of short 30-second infusions. Adjust as you make your tea.
Maintain healthy habits like exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet and drinking oolong tea daily to boost your overall well-being.

https://food.news/2023-02-13-adding-milk-to-coffee-helps-fight-inflammation.html,"Adding milk to coffee can help fight inflammation, suggests study","Advertisement
Coffee is one of the most popular beverages around the world. And while some people like drinking it with other ingredients like creamer, sugar or flavored syrups, others prefer drinking black coffee.
But according to a study, drinking coffee with milk can help protect against inflammation.
In a preliminary study of isolated cells, researchers found that the specific combination of coffee and milk may have inflammation-fighting properties.
The study was conducted by scientists from the University of Copenhagen who set out to determine how polyphenols, the compounds commonly found in plant foods like coffee that are known to fight inflammation, bind to milk proteins and boost their anti-inflammatory effects.

The research team caused artificial inflammation in immune cells and then treated those cells with either polyphenols alone or polyphenols that had reacted with proteins in milk.
Upon examining data from their experiments, the researchers found that the immune cells that received the polyphenols-milk protein combination were twice as effective at fighting inflammation.
This suggests that enjoying your breakfast with a combination of the polyphenols found in coffee and milk proteins may help protect your body against inflammation.
The researchers specifically tested coffee drinks with milk to confirm if the phenomenon occurred.
Professor Marianne N. Lund, one of the lead authors of the study, explained that the results showed that the reaction between polyphenols and proteins also occurred in some of the coffee drinks with milk that they studied. (Related: Study: Cherries can help fight heart disease, diabetes and other inflammatory diseases.)
Lund also thinks that the polyphenol-protein anti-inflammatory benefit can also occur in other food or beverage pairings. She suggested that something similar could happen in a meat dish with vegetables or a smoothie made with some protein like milk or yogurt.
Since this is a preliminary study on isolated cells, the research team plans to continue studying this phenomenon in animals and then humans to learn more about it on a more practical level.
“It is clearly imaginable that this cocktail could also have a beneficial effect on inflammation in humans. We will now investigate further, initially in animals. After that, we hope to receive research funding, which will allow us to study the effect on humans,” concluded Lund.
While scientists continue to examine the potential health benefits of coffee and milk, here are other polyphenol-rich foods that can help prevent inflammation:
Eat more foods full of polyphenols
According to data, there are over 100 foods that are known to be rich in polyphenols.
Here are some polyphenol-rich superfoods that you can add to your regular diet:
Aside from milk, you can add some superfoods from this list to your morning coffee like cocoa powder, dark chocolate or flaxseed.
Try using a collagen supplement
If you also want to boost your bone and skin health, try adding collagen powder to your coffee.
A high-quality collagen supplement that contains proteins and antioxidants can support your immune system along with your bone and skin health.
Stick to plain coffee
While the study suggests that drinking coffee with milk may help fight against inflammation, that doesn’t mean you should start every day with a sugary iced coffee.
Many coffee drinks with different add-ons have more sugar than a can of soda. This is bad for your health, especially if you drink a lot of syrupy sweet iced coffee, because sugar is known to trigger inflammation.
Preliminary research suggests that the polyphenols in coffee and the proteins in milk react to help boost your cells’ inflammation-fighting powers. While more research can help scientists understand this impressive health benefit, follow a balanced diet and eat fruits and vegetables full of compounds like polyphenols to protect against inflammation.
Aside from adding milk, here are other ways to make your cup of joe healthy:
Choose a quality brand of organic coffee
The quality of your coffee will depend on the processing method and how the coffee beans were grown.
Coffee beans are often sprayed with synthetic pesticides and other chemicals that are bad for your health. If you are worried about the pesticide content of your coffee, try buying organic coffee beans.
Organic coffee beans should contain much lower amounts of synthetic pesticides.
Add a bit of cinnamon
Cinnamon is a flavorful spice and it also pairs nicely with the flavor of coffee.
According to research, cinnamon can help lower blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides in people with diabetes. If you need some flavor, but are watching your sugar intake, add a dash of cinnamon to your cup of joe.
To lower the risk of potential adverse effects, buy Ceylon cinnamon instead of the more common Cassia cinnamon.
Add some cocoa
Cocoa is a superfood full of beneficial antioxidants. It is also linked to several health benefits, such as a lower risk of heart disease.
The next time you’re making coffee, add a dash of cocoa powder for some added flavor.
Many coffee shops serve caffe mocha, a chocolate-flavored version of caffe latte. However, caffè mocha is usually sugar-sweetened, which can be bad for your health if you need to monitor your sugar consumption.
Instead, check recipes online and make caffe mocha at home, but skip the added sugar.
Don’t add too much sugar
Coffee by itself is healthy, but adding too many ingredients like sugar and flavored syrups can turn it into something harmful.
Keep in mind that added sugar is probably one of the worst ingredients in the modern diet. Sugar, mainly due to its high amount of fructose, is linked to many health issues such as obesity and diabetes.
If you can’t drink black coffee, try a natural sweetener like stevia or add a bit of cinnamon or cocoa to your cup of joe.
Avoid low-fat and artificial creamers
If you love coffee, but are watching your weight, using ingredients like low-fat and artificial creamers may seem like a good idea. But products like commercial low-fat and artificial creamers are usually highly processed and may contain ingredients with adverse effects.
Also, there isn’t much research on how non-dairy coffee creamers affect human health. While their contents vary by brand, some may be healthier than others.
However, in general, it is better to use whole, natural foods. Instead of a non-dairy creamer, try adding some full-fat cream in your coffee, preferably from grass-fed cows.
According to research, milk products contain some important nutrients. Dairy is a great source of calcium and it may help reduce the risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures.
Grass-fed cow’s milk contains some vitamin K, which can also help boost bone health.

https://food.news/2023-02-10-increase-daily-intake-fruits-vegetables-live-longer.html,"Increasing your daily intake of fruits and vegetables can truly help you live longer, reveals study","Advertisement
Research has proven that following a nutritious diet is key to maintaining your overall health. According to a study, eating more fruits and vegetables can help you live longer.
Fruits and vegetables contain carbohydrates, dietary fiber and protein. Research shows that they also offer vitamins, minerals, carotenoids and polyphenols that can help protect against chronic diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease.
The study was published in The Journal of Nutrition.

The research team was led by Atsushi Goto, a professor at Yokohama City University, and Hitoshi Nakagama, president of the National Cancer Center Japan. The researchers conducted a 20-year research survey on the link between eating fruits and vegetables and all-cause mortality.
Upon examining data from volunteers, they discovered that those who ate more vegetables and fruits had a seven to eight percent lower risk of death over 20 years, compared to those who consumed fewer vegetables and fruits.
According to Goto, earlier European and American studies had confirmed that “eating more fruits and vegetables can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and the risk of all-cause mortality effectively.”
But the heredity, lifestyle and diet of westerners are different from Asians.
For the Japanese study, scientists selected 95,000 male and female volunteers aged 40 to 69. The volunteers resided in 11 Japanese prefectures and cities between 1990 and 1993.
After excluding people with cancer, cardiovascular disease and liver disorders, the remaining volunteers were chosen for a long-term questionnaire survey. The researchers gathered the results of the questionnaire, then they compiled statistics on the daily fruit and vegetable intake of the participants.
The participants were divided into five groups based on the amount of intake, from highest to lowest. The group with the lowest fruit and vegetable intake was the control group and they were compared to the other groups for subsequent risk of death from all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
In 2018, 20 years after the study began, the follow-up results revealed that the risk of all-cause death was reduced by at least eight to nine percent in the high fruits and vegetables intake group. Meanwhile, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced by nine percent.
The analysis of fruit intake found that the risk of all-cause death was reduced by eight percent in the highest intake group while the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced by 13 percent. It was particularly noticeable in the female participants. (Related: Improve your well-being and boost longevity with the Blue Zones diet.)
After reviewing the volunteers’ vegetable intake, the researchers found that the group that consumed the most vegetables had a seven percent lower risk of death than the group that consumed the least.
And when mortality was analyzed separately for the male and female participants, results revealed that higher fruit intake in men was linked to lower respiratory mortality. The same in women was linked to lower cardiovascular mortality.
After studying the result of the analysis, the scientists concluded that fruits and vegetables full of vitamins and dietary fiber have a crucial role in people’s health. They recommended the intake of more than 300 grams (10.5 ounces) of vegetables and more than 140 grams (five ounces) of fruits daily.
“I hope this research result can provide data as a basic reference to the general public about the daily intake of fruits and vegetables,” concluded Goto.
In another study, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and other institutions examined data from at least 1.9 million people worldwide.
Their findings also showed that consuming an appropriate amount of fruit and vegetable daily can help extend life expectancy. The research results were published in the journal Circulation.
The researchers reported that not all vegetables and fruits can reduce the risk of mortality. Specifically, starchy vegetables like corn, peas and potatoes and some fruit juices aren’t associated with lowering the risk of death from all-cause or certain chronic diseases.
The research team advised that eating green leafy vegetables like kale, lettuce and spinach, berries, citrus fruits and carrots, which are full of beta-carotene and vitamin C, have all shown benefits in reducing the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
Eating healthy requires a lot of discipline. If you need help increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables, check out the tips below:
Stock up on healthy snacks
In a 2018 study, scientists compared the food choices people made when given three options:
The results suggest that getting rid of the less healthy options was more likely to result in healthy choices than any other scenario.
While it’s good to eat more fruits and vegetables, eliminating junk food alternatives will also help improve your eating habits.
Start your day with a fruit smoothie
If you don’t like the taste of kale or spinach, you can “hide” the taste by making a fruit smoothie for breakfast.
Add fruits and vegetables to your favorite dishes
If you cook at home, you can increase your intake of fruits and vegetables by adding them to your favorite foods.
For breakfast, you can add fruit to cereal or yogurt. You can also add blueberries or strawberries to pancakes.
Another option is to stuff an omelet with extra vegetables like mushrooms, bell peppers and chopped carrots.
Add more vegetables to a sandwich and add vegetable toppings if you’re having some pizza. When making pasta or your favorite casserole, add leafy greens like spinach or kale.
Do more meal prep
If you’re busy, save time on meal prep by chopping up vegetables in advance and storing them in your fridge. This makes it easier to add more veggies to your meals.
Make a list of your favorite plant-based recipes
You can also save time on meal prep by making a list of your favorite recipes for plant-based dishes.
Before you buy groceries, check your recipes so you can easily buy the missing ingredients. Choose three or four to buy every week.
Prepare vegetarian dishes
Try to make vegetarian dishes at least once a week and prepare a new vegetarian recipe for dinner.
Once you get used to eating meatless dishes, try to prepare vegetarian dishes several times a week.
Enjoy healthy snacks
Instead of gorging on candy and junk food with no nutritional value, enjoy healthy snacks like a piece of fresh or dried fruit. Make sure you buy products without added sugar.
If you prefer something savory, prepare carrot and celery sticks with a low-fat dip or make baked chips with fresh salsa.
Buy canned and frozen produce
If you don’t have access to fresh produce, you can opt for canned and frozen fruits and vegetables, which are just as nutritious as fresh produce. You can also save a bit of money since canned and frozen products are usually more cost-efficient.
Remember to check labels because some canned options can have lots of added sodium or sugar.
Shop seasonally
To make the most of your shopping, buy fruits and vegetables in season. Save money by visiting a farmers market and taking note of which products are in season.
Follow a balanced diet and eat more fruits and vegetables to improve your longevity.

https://food.news/2023-02-07-high-fat-diet-junk-food-rewires-brain.html,High-fat diet and junk food rewire the brain and regulate appetite,"Advertisement
Eating fatty foods and junk food like burgers and fried chicken can make you overweight, but in a way that affects your brain health.
According to a study, eating junk food and following a high-fat diet rewires your brain. This can reduce your ability to “regulate appetite and regulate calorie consumption.”
The researchers hope that their findings can one day be used to develop an anti-obesity pill that targets neurons in the brain. Details of the study were published in The Journal of Physiology.

According to data from animal studies, cells called astrocytes control a chemical pathway to the gut. But the new study shows that continuously consuming fatty and sugary foods disrupts this crucial link.
Dr. Kirsteen Browning, the study’s lead author from Penn State College of Medicine, explained that calorie intake seems to be regulated in the short term by astrocytes.
Following a high-fat or high-calorie diet for at least three to five days has the greatest effect on astrocytes and triggers the normal signaling pathway to control the stomach. Eventually, astrocytes seem to desensitize to high-fat food.
Browning added that after following a high-fat or high-calorie diet for 10 to 14 days, astrocytes fail to react and the brain’s ability to regulate calorie intake is lost. This then disrupts the signaling to the stomach and delays how it empties. (Related: Consuming too much fast food can cause irreversible brain damage, warn health experts.)
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 40 percent of U.S. adults are obese. This increases their risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes.
Experts believe that learning more about the brain’s role and the complex mechanisms that lead to gluttony can be used to develop therapies for treating weight gain.
Astrocytes initially react when you eat junk food, which then releases gliotransmitters.
Gliotransmitters are chemicals that stimulate neurons that ensure the stomach “contracts correctly to fill and empty in response to food passing through the digestive system.”
When something inhibits astrocytes, it disrupts the cascade. The decrease in signaling chemicals results in a delay in digestion because the stomach doesn’t fill and empty appropriately.
For the study, researchers used behavioral observation to monitor food intake in more than 200 lab rodents fed either a normal or high-fat diet for one, three, five or 14 days.
The behavioral observation was combined with pharmacological and specialist genetic techniques to target distinct neural circuits. This allowed the scientists to specifically inhibit astrocytes in a particular region of the brainstem – the posterior part that is connected to the spinal cord.
The scientists then studied how individual neurons behaved when the animal subjects were awake. They reported that if the same mechanism occurs in humans, medication could be used to safely target the mechanism if the treatment doesn’t affect other neural pathways.
According to Browning, more research is needed to confirm “whether the loss of astrocyte activity and the signaling mechanism is the cause of overeating or that it occurs in response to the overeating.”
She added that the research team wants to find out whether it is possible to reactivate the brain’s apparent lost ability to regulate calorie intake. If this is the case, the research could be used to develop interventions that can help restore calorie regulation in humans.
If you eat a lot of junk food and are worried about your health, make lifestyle changes to lower your risk of developing many health issues like obesity, diabetes and heart problems.

https://food.news/2023-02-03-artificial-sweeteners-weight-loss-increase-diabetes-risk.html,"Using artificial sweeteners for weight loss can increase diabetes risk, warn researchers","Advertisement
Maintaining a healthy weight is necessary for your overall well-being. Some people are using artificial sweeteners thinking it will help them lose weight.
But according to a review, using artificial sweeteners for weight loss can increase your risk of developing diabetes. Using artificial sweeteners to reduce your calorie intake can also affect your gut health, warned health experts.
In a review published in the journal Endocrine Practice, researchers analyzed studies that focused on the long-term and neurohormonal effects of artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin and sucralose.

According to the review findings, acute and chronic users of artificial sweeteners experienced changes in their gut microbiome, pointing to an inflammatory pattern of gut microbiota.
The older study published in the journal Nature also had similar and alarming conclusions.
Data showed that even non-caloric sweeteners can still damage gut health. In some cases, the use of sweeteners also caused glucose intolerance in mice and some people.
The research team reported that these observed changes were nearly identical to the gut changes previously associated with health issues like diabetes and obesity in humans.
While conducting the Nature study, scientists discovered that the animal subjects that received a 10 percent solution of one of three commonly used artificial sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin or sucralose) had elevated glucose levels in their blood after 11 weeks compared to the mice that were given plain water or even a 10 percent glucose solution.
Elevated glucose or hyperglycemia is linked to health issues like insulin resistance, diabetes, early heart disease and other serious health complications. Hyperglycemia has also been associated with a higher incidence of mortality.
Data revealed that saccharin had the most pronounced effects on gut health out of the three artificial sweeteners used. However, all three affected the microbiome and, eventually, glucose levels.
In follow-up experiments, the animal subjects were given a high-fat diet and a 10 percent saccharin solution.
The resulting changes in glucose metabolism reproduced the results found when the mice were fed a regular diet and a much higher saccharin dose. This suggests that higher fat consumption could worsen saccharin’s metabolic impact.
Results of metagenomic sequencing showed that animal subjects that received saccharin had a different gut bacteria profile compared to the mice that received water or a glucose solution. The researchers were then able to identify a specific microbe-mediated mechanism that let the artificial sweeteners affect glucose metabolism among the test subjects. (Related: Not so sweet: Study links artificial sweeteners to liver damage.)
The researchers also observed a similar metabolic response and change in gut bacteria in humans.
The research team observed 381 non-diabetic volunteers who answered questions about their eating habits. The volunteers who reported that they used artificial sweeteners also had higher fasting glucose levels.
The same volunteers also exhibited poorer glucose tolerance and altered gut microbe profiles compared to the people who did not use artificial sweeteners.
These differences were more noticeable when people consumed higher amounts of artificial sweeteners. The differences also persisted even when the results were corrected for body mass index (BMI).
The results of the animal studies and human trials confirm that using artificial sweeteners that are allegedly safe can cause health issues like diabetes and obesity instead of helping you prevent these conditions.
The connection was hinted at in previous studies, but the Weizmann experiments are crucial because they provided concrete evidence on how exactly these sweeteners alter the population of intestinal bacteria.
Having a healthy gut bacteria profile is crucial because these microbes direct metabolism and convert the food you eat into energy for your body or as stored fuel for later use.
Despite the adverse effects linked to artificial sweeteners, these food additives are some of the most widely used worldwide. People who are unable to tolerate sugar and others who are trying to lose weight often consume products containing these alternative sweeteners.
If you have diabetes, it can be a struggle if you want to follow a balanced diet but enjoy the occasional dessert.
Instead of depriving yourself of your favorite foods and binge eating, improve your eating habits and be disciplined so you can have a bit of cake and eat it too.
Get smaller portions
If you have diabetes, you can still have desserts, but in moderation. This means you can get some cake, but ask for a smaller slice or share it with somebody.
If you are eating at home, cut baked goods into smaller pieces so you don’t overeat.
Swap carbs
If you want to have some dessert, skip a starchy vegetable or other carbohydrates at mealtime.
Skipping a carbohydrate serving during your main meal can help you avoid spiking your blood sugar levels when you eat dessert later.
Keep in mind that this is only something you should do occasionally since most starches in your main meal, like a serving of potatoes, are probably going to be more nutritious than dessert.
Prepare homemade desserts
By making desserts at home, you can control the ingredients that you use to make the dessert. This means you can substitute ingredients, like whole-grain flour instead of all-purpose flour, to make the dessert fit into your diet plan.
Making desserts at home also helps you avoid buying packaged sweets and desserts that usually contain many harmful additives.
Eat dark chocolate
Dark chocolate with no added sugar may offer benefit if you have Type 2 diabetes.
Chocolate offers several potential health benefits, such as helping control blood sugar levels. According to a study paper published in 2017, chocolate could have some benefits for managing Type 2 diabetes.
But researchers also warned that many manufacturers add a lot of sugar to their products, which can be bad if you have diabetes.
If you’re craving something sweet, eat dark chocolate in moderation. Dark chocolate is also very rich, making it easy to satisfy your craving without eating too much chocolate.
Snack on fruit and fruit salads
Fruits are high in sugar, but they also contain many nutrients like vitamins and fiber.
According to the American Diabetes Association, you can eat fruit or fruit salads as a way to satisfy cravings for sweets.
If you have diabetes, make sure you choose fresh, frozen or fruit canned in water instead of fruit salads canned in sugary syrups.
Avoid the harmful side effects of artificial sweeteners to reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Instead, improve your eating habits and snack on fresh fruits.

Supplements can help you get the nutrients you need, but it’s also important to follow a balanced diet and eat a variety of nutritious foods like green foods, which provide your body with essential nutrients.
Green foods like barley grass contain beneficial enzymes that provide your body with vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in the most natural and readily available way.
If you’re still on the fence about adding barley grass to your diet, read on to find out why you should try it.

Barley grass is worth trying because it offers several health benefits.
Data suggests that barley grass can support a healthy gut microbiota. It can also help your body eliminate accumulated toxins by relieving inflammation in the gut. (Related: These 3 foods can boost your heart and gut health.)
Incorporating barley grass into your diet helps boost your immune system, promotes optimal acid-alkali balance and naturally cleanses and detoxifies your body. Barley grass contains potent antioxidants that can protect against radiation and cell damage by helping regenerate damaged issues.
Barley grass can also help prevent the development of several diseases linked to oxidative stress. It works with vitamin E and beta carotene and functions as a supplier of the critical enzyme superoxide dismutase.
Data suggests that barley grass can be used to prevent and treat cancer thanks to superoxide dismutase. This enzyme helps neutralize the effects of oxygen-free radicals produced during energy metabolism.
The enzymes in barley grass help suppress the rapid growth of cancer cells by decomposing and counteracting the effects of toxic hydrogen peroxide, which is generated during respiration.
Barley grass can also help you maintain healthy skin and bones and promote agility. It can even help the body deal with stress and keep cholesterol levels in check.
When paired with a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet, barley grass can help purify the blood. The vitamin E in barley grass helps regulate optimal hormone balance.
Barley grass also contains vitamin K, which has a crucial role in assuring normal bone metabolism.
Barley grass also helps boost concentration and reduces the effects of learning disorders.
Barley grass leaves are full of vitamins and minerals such as:
Barley grass contains at least 30 times more vitamin B1 and 11 times the amount of calcium in cow’s milk.
Compared to spinach, barley grass contains nearly five times more iron. It also contains at least seven times the vitamin C in oranges, four times the vitamin B1 in whole wheat flour and 80 micrograms of vitamin B12 per 100 grams of dried barley plant juice.
To add barley grass to your regular diet, consume it as a juice extract from cereal grass sprouts. You can also buy it as a green powder and use it to make juices or smoothies.

If you want to avoid harmful ingredients in food like added chemicals and other dangerous ingredients, you can learn how to preserve food using methods like freeze-drying or dehydration. (h/t to AllNewsPipeline.com)
Consumers are often dealing with food shortages and increasing food prices. If you want to secure more supplies for your stockpile before SHTF, invest in appliances that you can use to preserve food like a freeze-dryer or a dehydrator. You can also start a home garden to grow fresh, organic food for your whole family. (Related: Food preservation tips: How to salt meat for your stockpile.)

Freeze-drying machines are the more expensive option, with used machines being sold for at least $1,000. New freeze-drying machines can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000.
To save money, you can also opt to freeze-dry food at home using alternative methods.
The home freezer method
Freeze-drying food may seem overwhelming, but you can also do it with a home freezer. However, since you don’t have a freeze-dryer this method will take longer.
To freeze-dry food using your freezer, you will need the following items.
Preparation:
The dry ice method
The dry ice method doesn’t require special machinery.
You will need the following items:
Since dry ice lets all moisture from food evaporate very quickly, this method is much faster than using a home freezer, unless it is incredibly humid in your area.
Ideally, you should start the freeze-drying process when the humidity level is low if not zero. This is because the more moisture in the air, the longer the freeze-drying process will take.
Preparation:
If you prefer a faster method, learn how to make dehydrated food. Knowing how to dehydrate food can also help prevent food waste since you can preserve items to be used later before they go bad.
There are two ways to store dehydrated food for long-term storage: Using a canning jar sealer and using Mylar bags and oxygen absorbers.
To dehydrate foods like fruits and vegetables, you will need a dehydrator and vacuum-sealed bags to store food. You can also store dehydrated food in clean canning jars, airtight food containers or freezer bags.
Vegetables
Vegetables must be dehydrated at 125 to 135 F for eight to 12 hours.
Generally, when dehydrating food that you eat raw you don’t need to pre-cook it before drying.
However, vegetables like broccoli, celery and corn should be blanched before dehydrating. Blanching means cooking the food item in boiling water and submerging it in cold water.
Blanching denatures enzymes that may affect the shelf-life and quality of the vegetables.
To cut this step out, you can dehydrate frozen vegetables since they are already pre-cooked/blanched and ready to dehydrate.
Fruit
Fruit needs to be dried at 135 to 145 F for eight to 15 hours.
Before dehydrating, some fruits like apples and bananas need to be treated with a citrus wash to delay browning. If you want to dehydrate other fruits, check food-specific recipes for the best results.
After drying, the fruit’s moisture content should be around 20 percent. Even if you’re extra careful, the fruit will dry unevenly. Fruit also requires an extra step before storing.
After the fruit cools completely, store it in plastic bags or glass jars for seven to 10 days. Shake the jars daily.
Once done, store the fruit as is or ground it up into a powder. During this time, condensation should not develop. If it does, it means there is too much moisture in the fruit, so process it again in your dehydrator.
Jerky
Jerky should be dried at 160 F for four to eight hours.
When processing meat to make jerky, follow recipes properly to avoid the risk of harmful bacteria.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Jerky and Food Safety Fact Sheet, bacteria in meat can survive the temperatures of a dehydrator (150 to 160 F) when cooked at a warm temperature for a long time.
To minimize the risk of food born illnesses from E. coli and salmonella, meat and chicken need to be pre-cooked at 160 F and 165 F, respectively, before dehydrating. Doing this helps destroy harmful bacteria that would survive under a dehydrator’s temperature setting.
Note that the shelf life of homemade jerky is one to two months. Meanwhile, store-bought jerky can last from eight months to one year.
Here are different foods that you can dehydrate at home:
Fruits:
Vegetables:
Herbs:
Here are other methods to try if you don’t want to spend money on a dehydrator:
Sun drying
Sun drying is one of the oldest and simplest methods used to dehydrate foods. With this method, you need to lay fruits like figs or mangos on a mesh screen or tray made with wooden dowels.
Next, cover the food with a second screen to protect it from pests and insects. You can use this method if you are in a sunny area with low humidity and a minimum temperature of 86 F.
When using this method, avoid screens made with hardware cloth because they may oxidize and leave residue on your food. Note that sundrying fruits may take several days to fully dry.
Air drying
Air drying is another simple dehydration method that doesn’t require any special equipment. Like sun drying, air drying places food in the shade instead of the sun.
This helps protect foods from the sun’s powerful rays and it’s a great method for dehydrating herbal teas, leafy greens and spices.
Solar drying
Solar dehydrators are powered by the sun and they can be used to dehydrate food even without electricity.
Some solar dehydrators look like a tabletop greenhouse. You can buy one or make it at home using materials that you can get from the local hardware store.
Oven drying
An oven that reaches a temperature of at least 140 F can also be used to dehydrate food. While oven drying can take at least six to 10 hours depending on the specific food, this method is ideal if you don’t want to buy a dehydrator.
Make sure your oven can be set to a temperature of 140 F or less since higher temperatures will cook food instead of drying it. Prop the door open while dehydrating foods so extra moisture can escape during the drying process.
Secure supplies for your survival stockpile by learning how to properly freeze-dry or dehydrate food like fruits and vegetables. These food preservation methods can also help you save money and avoid food waste.

https://food.news/2023-01-27-research-curcumin-turmeric-helps-with-ibd-symptoms.html,Research suggests curcumin from turmeric can help with IBD symptoms,"Advertisement
Digestive issues like bloating and cramping are common, but if you have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), your symptoms are more severe. IBD symptoms can even be life-threatening.
There is no mainstream cure for IBD, and treatment options range from pharmaceuticals like steroids and immunosuppressants. Following specialized diets and taking herbal nutraceuticals can help if you have IBD.
According to data presented at a Crohn’s & Colitis conference, curcumin, the active anti-inflammatory compound in turmeric, also offer benefits for people with IBD.

The latest study findings presented at the 2023 Crohn’s & Colitis Congress included these three new developments in treatment options for IBD:
Treating Crohn’s disease in oxygen chambers
A meta-review of the use of hyperbaric oxygen revealed that this therapy was effective at reducing inflammation. Data showed that the treatment helped improve symptoms among study participants.
Predicting IBD flares with an Apple Watch
Experts found that the nervous symptom markers measurable on wearable devices like the Apple Watch can help predict IBD flares. The ability to predict these flares can help patients start their treatments earlier, which makes them more effective. (Related: Study: Ultra-processed foods linked to increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease.)
Plant-based therapy against ulcerative colitis
A combination treatment of two herbal compounds, curcumin and Qing Dai, an herbal formula popular in Chinese medicine, was found to be “significantly more effective at reducing symptoms” compared to a placebo in people with active ulcerative colitis.
Alternative, herbal and plant therapies have been taken seriously and studied for more than a decade as treatment options for those living with IBD. These new findings can also be used to bolster modern medicine’s approach to disease in general.
Studies, like those presented at the 2023 Crohn’s & Colitis Congress, also highlight how beneficial additional options and complementary therapies can be.
Even if you don’t have inflammatory bowel disease, using herbal compounds like curcumin offers some health benefits.
Consuming curcumin from turmeric can also provide joint comfort and support the immune system. The compound can also help boost your digestive health.
Note that turmeric has low bioavailability, which means using the spice while cooking may fall short if you want to enjoy its therapeutic benefits.
To boost your overall health, it is recommended to take a supplement specifically formulated for your needs. Always use quality supplements that are recommended by experts.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the term for two conditions, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Prolonged inflammation causes damage to the GI tract.
Here are the common symptoms of IBD:
The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but the condition is often the result of a weakened immune system. One possible cause of IBD is when your immune system responds incorrectly to environmental triggers like a virus or bacteria, which will then lead to the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD might also have a genetic component. If you have a family history of IBD, you are more likely to develop the condition.
IBD is diagnosed by:
While it remains to be seen what the optimal dose of curcumin is, consuming turmeric through your regular diet may still offer some benefit. According to data, combining turmeric with black pepper can significantly enhance absorption.
Piperine, black pepper’s signature compound, helps boost the absorption of turmeric by an impressive 2,000 percent.
Add more turmeric to your diet and use it in foods like:
No specific diet has been shown to prevent or treat inflammatory bowel disease, but some diet strategies can help you manage IBD symptoms.
To identify problem foods, keep a detailed record of what you eat. Take note of when symptoms worsen to help you identify patterns that indicate which are your problem foods.
There are different approaches to diet during flares and in the absence of flares. Regardless of your health issues, it’s best not to overly restrict your diet.
Focus on avoiding problems foods and eating nutritious foods.
Avoid foods that may increase stool output like fresh fruits and vegetables, prunes and caffeinated beverages. Decrease your alcohol consumption or avoid it completely.
Limit or avoid concentrated sweets in your diet like candy, juices and soda. This will help decrease the amounts of water pulled into your intestine, which may cause watery stools.
Incorporate more omega-3 fatty acids in your diet. Omega-3s have an anti-inflammatory effect and you can get them from fatty fish like herring, mackerel, salmon and sardines.
Some patients reported that smaller, more frequent meals are better tolerated. Improving your eating habits can also help increase the amount of nutrition you receive every day.
If you have a poor appetite and trouble tolerating solid foods, consider taking nutritional supplements.
If you have strictures, avoid beans, kernels, nuts and seeds. You should also avoid foods that may increase stool output like fruits and vegetables, prunes and caffeinated beverages.
Eating cold foods may help reduce diarrhea.
If you are lactose intolerant, follow a lactose-free diet. Lactose intolerance causes symptoms like bloating, cramping, gas and diarrhea 30 to 90 minutes after eating milk, ice cream or large amounts of dairy. Take a breath hydrogen test if you think you have lactose intolerance.
If your stools are oily and foul-smelling, fat malabsorption could be the culprit. Treat fat malabsorption by following a low-fat diet. Discuss your symptoms with your doctor or a nutritionist.
Take smaller, more frequent meals because they are better tolerated and can help maximize your nutritional intake.
If your appetite is decreased and you have trouble keeping solid foods down, you might benefit from taking nutritional supplements.
Follow a balanced diet, avoid problem foods and incorporate turmeric into your diet to boost your digestive health and overall well-being.

Cold and the flu are common during winter. You may need a home remedy to improve your symptoms so you can get some work done.
If you’re looking for natural remedies for colds and the flu, try growing medicinal herbs like elderberry and ginger to boost your respiratory health. (h/t to TheOrganicPrepper.com)
Before the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), people wouldn’t always feel the need to go to the doctor’s clinic if they are experiencing respiratory ailments. Many respiratory illnesses are viral, and a doctor would often send a patient home with the advice to rest, drink plenty of fluids, take some medication and a large medical bill.

If you have the winter sniffles, here are some herbal alternatives to consider if you prefer natural remedies.
You can grow echinacea, specifically Echinacea angustifolia and E. purpurea, if you want to have access to an herbal medicine that can help with certain health issues.
According to Cat Ellis book “Prepper’s Natural Medicine,” cold and flu aren’t the best use of this herb. However, Ellis recommends echinacea in her elderberry and echinacea elixir, which is effective against rhinovirus. (Related: Study shows compounds in ancient herbal medicine can help increase longevity.)
Elderberry syrup is easy to make and it can help with colds and the flu.
Elderberry is an antiviral herb, meaning it attacks and destroys invading virus cells. If you take elderberry syrup within 48 hours of contracting the flu, it can help shorten the duration of your sickness. The herb is also a natural immune booster.
Elderberries are full of beneficial flavonoids, especially anthocyanins which are responsible for their deep purple, almost black, color. These powerful antioxidants help boost your immune health.
Anthocyanins clear your body of free radicals that damage cells at the DNA level. These compounds also have antiviral properties that may prevent or reduce the severity of certain common infections.
Keep in mind that if you want to make elderberry syrup, you should only use the fruits and berries because the rest of the plant is toxic.
If you want to grow elderberry, note that the plant is a large bush. If you are going to grow elderberry in a container, you should use a container that’s at least 24 inches across and 20 inches deep.
You might need two compatible plants since elderberry requires cross-pollination. Also, elderberry might take over your garden so keep it contained in a large pot or bucket.
Another option is to forage for elderberries to make syrup.
Try the recipe below to make elderberry syrup at home:
Ingredients:

Dose recommendations:
You can grow some ginger at home by placing a fresh rhizome about two inches long in sandy soil and water.
Moisten the ginger occasionally with a spray bottle of water. After about five weeks, you should have enough ginger to break a piece off of as needed. Care for the plant so it will continue to grow.
Here is a recipe for a homemade ginger honey lemon tonic:

https://food.news/2023-01-26-how-to-salt-meat-for-your-stockpile.html,Food preservation tips: How to salt meat for your stockpile,"Advertisement
When you’re building a stockpile of emergency food and supplies, meat is one item that should be part of your list. Learn how to preserve meat through salting and curing if you want to save money on groceries.
Dry salting or using a salt brine are meat preservation methods that you can use even without electricity, so it’s worth learning how to cure meat if you are worried about long-term power outages in your area. (h/t to ModernSurvivalBlog.com)
Salt is used to cure and preserve meat because it inhibits the growth of microorganisms, including those found in meat. Salt preserves meat by drawing out water from the microbial cell by osmosis due to the high concentration of salt outside the cell.

The cell loses water until it reaches a state where it cannot grow and is unable to survive.
When stored properly, salt will also last a long time in your stockpile. To save time on moving salt to bigger containers, you can buy salt sold in 10-pound pails.
You can also buy special salt specifically used to cure meat. While you can use almost any kind of food-grade salt for curing meat, some people recommend kosher salt (a coarse grind).
Here are some tips and recipes that you can use to salt and cure meat.
Salt beef
Salt beef is also called corned beef and the use of the term “corned” stems from the fact that the Middle English word corn could refer to grains of salt and cereal grains.
You can salt meat by adding dry salt or using brine.
Try the recipe below to make salt beef at home.
Ingredients for 8-10 servings:
Preparation:
Dry salting
Dry salting or corning is a food preservation method that uses coarse “corns” or pellets of salt to dry-cure meat.
Irish corned beef is made from beef brisket, but any cut of meat can be corned.
Salt brine curing
Salt brine curing uses brine made with salt to preserve meat. In the past, people added salt to the brine until they can float an egg in the liquid.
However, it is more accurate to use a hydrometer. You can also keep things simple by following a reliable recipe.
Once the brine is mixed and placed into your preferred container, submerge the meat you want to preserve in the salt brine.
Note that brine curing usually produces an end product that is less salty compared to food preserved with dry curing. You can also inject brine into the meat to speed up the curing process.
The salting meat process for preservation is rather straightforward.
First, you must rinse the fresh meat in cool water. Pour a thin layer of salt, such as kosher salt, all over the meat and rub it in.
Hang or set the meat out in a cool environment that is under 50 F but not below freezing for several weeks to dry it out. Before cooking the meat, rinse off the salt with water. (Related: 12 Food preservation and food storage techniques you can use when SHTF.)
If you’re only using salt with no other preservative method, it’s best to use a 20 percent salt concentration on the surface of the meat to effectively kill off most types of microbes and fungi that can spoil the food.
Learn how to preserve meat using salt before SHTF so you can stock up on meat for your emergency food supply.

https://food.news/2023-01-17-study-fast-food-consumption-fatty-liver-disease.html,Study links fast food consumption to fatty liver disease,"Advertisement
A study has determined that eating fast food increases your risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) even if you follow a healthy diet. NAFLD causes fat buildup in your liver and can be fatal.
Researchers from the University of Southern California found that people who are obese or have diabetes and get more than 20 percent of their daily calories from fast food have “severely elevated” fat levels in their livers compared to those who consume less or no fast food.
Results of the study also showed that among the general population, “if more than a fifth of a person’s diet consists of fast food, it will increase fat levels in their liver.”

Details of the study were published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology.
Dr. Ani Kardashian, a hepatologist with Keck Medicine and lead author of the study, explained that healthy livers contain a small amount of fat, usually less than five percent.
However, even a moderate increase in fat can result in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Kardashian added that the “severe rise in liver fat in those with obesity or diabetes” is alarming. She noted that this may be because these conditions increase your risk of having fat build up in the liver.
This isn’t the first study to suggest a link between fast food consumption and obesity and diabetes. However, it is one of the first projects to highlight the negative impact of fast food on liver health, specifically. The study results also showed that consuming modest amounts of high-carb, high-fat fast food can harm liver health.
Kardashian said if you only eat one meal a day at a fast food restaurant, you might think it isn’t bad for your health. But if that one meal makes up at least one-fifth of your daily calories, you are putting your liver at risk. (Related: Glutathione helps fight fatty liver disease, reveals study.)
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or liver steatosis, can cause cirrhosis or scarring of the liver. In some cases, cirrhosis may eventually cause liver cancer or failure. More than 30 percent of the U.S. population has liver steatosis.
For the study, researchers analyzed the most recent available data from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Doing this helped researchers find out the impact of fast food consumption on liver steatosis.
For the study, the scientists characterized fast food as meals like pizza from either a drive-through restaurant or an eatery without a wait staff.
The researchers evaluated the fatty liver measurements of at least 4,000 adult participants and then compared their responses regarding fast food habits.
Among the survey participants, 52 percent reported eating some fast food. Within that group, 29 percent consumed one-fifth or more of their daily calories from fast food. Notably, only that 29 percent experienced an increase in liver fat levels.
The association was intact for both the general population and those with obesity or diabetes even after researchers accounted for additional factors like age, sex, race, ethnicity, alcohol use and physical activity levels.
The results are worrying since fast-food consumption has increased within the last 50 years, regardless of socioeconomic status, said Kardashian.
She added that they also observed a “substantial surge in fast-food dining during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is probably related to the decline in full-service restaurant dining and rising rates of food insecurity.” The researchers are worried that the number of those with fatty livers has continued to increase since the time of the survey.
The study authors hope that the results of their research can help encourage more doctors and healthcare providers to educate their patients when it comes to nutrition, particularly about the dangers of eating too much fast food.
Keep in mind that the only way to treat liver steatosis is by switching to a balanced diet. Since the first line of treatment for NAFLD is weight loss, you can reduce your calorie intake, improve your eating habits and exercise regularly.
The diet for fatty liver disease includes:
Additionally, the amount of weight that you should lose to treat NAFLD will depend on the amount of excess body fat that you have. Consult a physician to determine an appropriate weight loss goal based on your overall health.
Health experts recommend a nutrient-dense, whole-food-based diet full of foods rich in fiber, protein and unsaturated fats for those with NAFLD.
These superfoods should be part of a healthy liver diet:
Leafy greens
Compounds found in leafy greens like spinach may help fight fatty liver disease.
The results of a 2021 study revealed that eating spinach specifically lowered the risk of NAFLD, possibly because the vegetable contains nitrate and distinct polyphenols.
For the study, researchers focused on raw spinach since cooked spinach did not have the same strong results. This could be because cooking spinach and other leafy green vegetables may result in lower polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity.
Fatty fish
Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, trout and tuna are full of omega-3 fatty acids. Studies suggest that supplementing with omega-3s may benefit those with NAFLD by reducing liver fat, boosting protective HDL cholesterol and lowering triglyceride levels.
Oatmeal
Oatmeal and other whole-grain, fiber-rich foods may help reduce your risk of developing NAFLD-related diseases.
According to research, a nutritious diet that includes fiber-rich foods like oats is effective for those with NAFLD. It can also help reduce triglyceride levels.
If you have fatty liver disease, you may benefit from avoiding certain foods or reducing your intake.
The foods below often contribute to weight gain and can increase blood sugar:

https://food.news/2023-01-16-tea-reduces-dementia-risk-improves-cognitive-function.html,Regular consumption of tea found to reduce risk of dementia and improve cognitive function,"Advertisement
Dementia is characterized by symptoms like memory loss and impaired judgment. Once considered a disease primarily affecting the elderly, many people under the age of 65 are now getting diagnosed with dementia.
Fortunately, a study has found that there’s an easy way to improve cognitive function.
According to researchers, consuming tea can help inhibit or slow down the aging of the brain and improve cognitive function. Details of the study were published in the journal Translational Psychiatry.

A team that includes neurology researchers from Fudan University-affiliated Huashan Hospital and the Department of Neurology of Qingdao University-affiliated Qingdao Municipal Hospital conducted a survey in the U.K. from 2006 to 2010.
The results of the survey revealed that people who consumed tea drinks had a 16 percent lower overall risk of dementia than non-tea drinkers. (Related: Study: Drinking black tea helps increase longevity.)
During that four-year period, the researchers selected 377,592 volunteers from 22 regions in the United Kingdom. The participants had an average age of 58.49 and 54.3 percent were women.
The scientists divided the study participants into six groups:
Data from proportional hazard regression models indicated a significant link between tea consumption and reduced risk of dementia.
Specifically, the volunteers who consumed one to two cups of tea every day had their risk of dementia reduced by 17.7 percent. Those who drank three to four cups of tea reduced dementia risk by 20.8 percent and those who consumed five to six experienced a 19.7 percent risk reduction.
The researchers added that among those who drank more than six cups per day, the risk of dementia was no different than that of non-tea drinkers.
Further analysis into dementia types revealed that compared with the volunteers who did not drink tea at all, the people who consumed one to four cups a day had a 16.3 to 19.1 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. However, there was no significant difference after consuming over five cups of tea a day.
In an analysis concerning vascular dementia, drinking one to six cups of tea daily was found to reduce the incidence rate by 25 to 29.2 percent.
The scientists followed the volunteers for more than nine years and recorded a total of 5,122 cases of dementia. According to the researchers, tea consumption has been associated with protective benefits against several diseases.
Tea leaves contain different biomacromolecules, the most notable among them being polyphenols in green tea. Polyphenols are linked to many cellular antioxidant and nerve rescue activities that prevent memory deficits.
Biomacromolecules also have anti-inflammatory effects, which can help prevent cognitive decline.
Experts believe dementia and Alzheimer’s disease are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors such as diet and nutrition. Health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and obesity may also contribute to cognitive decline and these issues are usually affected by your diet.
Following a healthy diet and eating a wide variety of nutritious foods is shown to help reduce the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease as you age.
Aside from tea, these superfoods can help prevent cognitive decline and help you stay healthy as you age:
Berries
Fruits like blackberries, blueberries, cherries and raspberries are rich in anthocyanin. This flavonoid helps halt the progression of brain damage caused by harmful free radicals.
These fruits and other berries are also great sources of beneficial antioxidants and vitamins that can help reduce inflammation and improve brain health.
Cruciferous vegetables
Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower are full of B vitamins and carotenoids that are found to reduce levels of homocysteine, an amino acid linked to cognitive decline, brain atrophy and dementia.
You can eat more cruciferous vegetables by sauteing them in garlic and olive oil or using these superfoods to make soups or smoothies.
Leafy greens
Leafy greens such as collard greens, kale, spinach and Swiss chard are rich in essential B vitamins like folate and vitamin B9 that can help reduce depression. These nutrients can also help boost cognitive health.
Add more leafy greens to your diet by eating salads and adding them to chilis, soups and stews. You can also puree leafy greens and add them to hummus, sauces and pesto.
Nuts
Nuts like almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans and walnuts are full of healthy fats, magnesium, vitamin E and B vitamins that can all help boost cognitive health and stave off signs of dementia.
According to a study, women older than 70 who eat at least five servings of nuts per week are shown to have significantly better brain health compared to other women in the same age group who don’t consume nuts.
Results from another study revealed that the anti-inflammatory phytochemicals in English walnuts can help reduce inflammation of brain cells to maintain optimal brain health throughout the aging process.
Omega-3s
Foods like flaxseed, olive oil and fatty fish like mackerel, salmon and tuna are full of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids with DHA that boost brain health.
Many studies have shown that omega-3s are effective at fighting and preventing dementia. Experts suggest taking 200 mg of DHA daily to achieve good brain health.
However, the average daily intake of DHA in the U.S. is estimated to be only about 80 mg. Boost your brain health by consuming foods rich in omega-3s or taking quality DHA supplements.

If you truly want to be prepared for a long-term survival scenario, consider setting up a one-year food supply before SHTF.
Since this can be time-consuming and expensive, work your way up to a one-year supply by starting with a more manageable goal, like a three-day supply of food for the whole family. (h/t to SurvivalSullivan.com)
If you already have enough food supplies for one to two weeks, you’re one step closer to having enough food for one year.
But if you are a prepping beginner or have only recently started stockpiling food supplies for emergencies, trying to stock up enough food for one year will seem very daunting.

Start simple with a three-day supply of food, then move on to a one-week supply. As you get used to stockpiling food, add more supplies until you have enough for one month. Eventually, you should have enough for one year or so. (Related: Food supply 101: Tips for preparing a healthy food stockpile.)
To find out how much food you need per day, start by figuring out how to determine your calorie targets.
Multiply the number of people in your group or family by the number of days that you are planning for your stockpile. On average, one person needs 2,200 calories per day.
Here are some sample equations:
2,200 cal x 4 people x 3 days = 26,400 calories in storage
2,200 cal x 4 people x 30 days = 264,000 calories in storage
2,200 cal x 4 people X 365 days = 3,212,000 calories in storage
While a group of four people will require a lot of calories for one year, you can meet this need by scaling up when acquiring the food.
The three-day supply is the gold standard for basic preparation. Common SHTF events that may last for three days or so include power outages.
Your food choices are generally up to you, but you should consider stocking up on items that have a long shelf life and are easy to prepare. Make sure you buy things that you and your family don’t mind eating a lot of for three days.
After you stock up on enough food for at least three days, aim for a one-week supply. This should be enough to get you through the aftermath of a serious localized disaster, like a long-term power outage.
Keep things simple by duplicating your three-day supply and adding other new items so you have a variety of foods to make up the difference.
A one-month supply of food on hand and in storage can help you and your family get through a significant regional disaster or other events that completely disrupt supply lines and your usual routine.
Add more items to the list above, and make sure you store food properly so items stay fresh in your stockpile even after one month. You should also rotate supplies that don’t have a long shelf life to prevent spoilage.
If storage space is an issue, consider setting up a separate room or building a secure shed for food storage.
Items to add to your stockpile:
A three-month supply of food can sustain a family or group of people through calamitous events like civil conflict or famine. Like with the one-month supply, you have to regularly rotate and inspect items to prevent spoilage.
To stock up on this much food, duplicate your one-month food plan twice.
Items to add to your stockpile:
A six-month supply of food requires a significant investment of time and money that can help secure your survival when SHTF.
However, the average home cannot hold a six-month supply of food without sacrificing most of the living and storage space. If space is an issue, invest in supplementary storage.
To expand your stockpile into a six-month supply, duplicate your three-month purchase plan.
Items to add to your stockpile:
A one-year supply of food will prepare you and your family for almost any survival scenario, like the total collapse of an economy or civil war.
Again, storage space will be an issue since you will have a lot more items in your stockpile. But if you have the room, this is achievable if you are dedicated to constantly expanding your supply over time.
To build a one-year supply of food for your family, duplicate your six-month supply and add more items to prevent food boredom.
Make sure your one-year supply of food lasts by storing items properly. Keep your storage location cool, preferably between 50 to 60 F (10 to 15 C) and under 75 F (24 C) if possible.
Note that warmer temperatures accelerate spoilage, while cooler temperatures preserve food longer. Store food away from light, be it artificial light or sunlight, since it can promote decay.
This amount of food is vulnerable to pests like rodents and insects, so make sure your stockroom is secured to keep out various pests. Pests like rats can still get into plastic containers.
If possible, use air-tight metal containers for food storage.
Before SHTF, make it a goal to have a one-year food stockpile so you can keep your family fed during a long-term survival scenario.

If you want to be more self-sufficient as a prepper, you can learn how to build a modern root cellar.
Modern root cellars can be used to store local food and produce from your home garden. It can also be used as storage for canned goods throughout the winter. (h/t to PreparednessAdvice.com)
A root cellar is a structure usually constructed below ground to store fruits, vegetables and dairy products.
Here are several benefits of having a modern root cellar on your homestead:

Read on to learn about tips that can help you build a modern root cellar on your homestead.
Root cellars are often used to store fresh fruits, vegetables and dairy products.
When considering your root cellar design, here are some factors you should take into account:
Light
Root cellars should be dark to prevent the growth of mold and mildew.
Light can make food spoil quickly, which is why the area needs to be dark most of the time.
Temperature
The ideal temperature for storing fruits and vegetables in a root cellar is between 32 to 40 F.
Below those temperatures, the cold air can make the food frozen. Above those temperatures, the heat may cause food spoilage.
Humidity
The ideal humidity level for storing fruits and vegetables is between 80 to 85 percent.
Vegetables and fruit lose moisture over time, which is why the humidity level needs to be high. Note that if the humidity level is too high, it will cause mold and mildew to grow.
Ventilation
Root cellars must be well-ventilated to prevent the build-up of mold and mildew.
Fresh vegetables and fruit create ethylene gas over time and the gas can increase spoilage over time. Setting up a good ventilation system will help prevent the ethylene gas from building up and causing food spoilage in the root cellar.
The best location for a root cellar is in an area with cool temperatures and good drainage. While you can build a root cellar above ground, they are more commonly built below ground.
When choosing a location for your root cellar, always consider the type of foundation you have, like dirt, concrete or stone. You must also factor in the size of space available and the climate in the area.
A root cellar must also be kept cool so the root crops are kept cool enough to preserve them for several weeks or months. (Related: Prepping skills: 15 Food storage and preservation methods to learn before SHTF.)
If you live in an urban or suburban setting, you may have to build a modern root cellar in a room of your house.
When choosing a room, opt for one that you can keep at cool temperatures to ensure that the food stays fresh. This cold room will also give you easy access to your root crops and other food items.
However, one disadvantage of having a root cellar in a room in your house is that the temperature and humidity levels may not be ideal for the long-term storage of certain fruits and vegetables.
To keep the food cool and remove ethylene gas buildup in the room, you may need to install ventilation pipes and a proper ventilation system to have fresh air, especially during warmer temperatures. Additionally, you may need to insulate the interior walls to keep the room temperature consistent.
If you have a home with a basement, you may want to use it to create a root cellar.
Unlike an aboveground room, a basement root cellar has the advantage of being cooler and having better drainage.
However, one disadvantage is that humidity levels in a basement can be high, which can cause the growth of mold and mildew linked to food spoilage.
If you have a wine cellar that you don’t use, you may be able to repurpose it into a basement root cellar. Most of the time, a wine cellar is set up for a humidity level that is too low for cold storage.
Fortunately, you can adjust it by adding pails of water for evaporative cooling in your root cellar.
Before SHTF, build a modern root cellar on your homestead and use it as additional food storage for your survival stockpile.

https://food.news/2023-01-03-plant-cucumbers-early-avoid-downy-mildew-study.html,"Planting cucumbers early can help farmers avoid downy mildew, reveals study","Advertisement
Farmers who grow cucumbers in South Carolina experience huge crop losses every year due to a plant disease called downy mildew. Fortunately, researchers from Clemson University have discovered that planting cucumbers early can reduce growers’ losses from downy mildew to almost zero.
Downy mildew is an oomycete or water mold that destroys plant foliage. The disease is common in cucurbits, a plant family that includes cucumbers, gourds, squashes and various melons.

Pseudoperonospora cubensis, a pathogen similar to a fungus, causes cucurbit downy mildew. Infected plants develop angular, yellow or brown spots on their leaves.
Cucurbit plants with downy mildew may die. Those that survive will have reduced or non-existent yields, and this can happen within a couple of weeks from the start of infection.
It is important to catch a downy mildew infection early and take steps to prevent it.
The study was conducted by Tony Keinath, a professor of plant pathology and Research and Extension vegetable pathologist at Clemson’s Coastal Research and Education Center (REC) in Charleston, and Felipe Silva, an assistant professor of agricultural economics in Clemson’s Department of Agricultural Sciences agribusiness program.
Their findings revealed that growers can avoid downy mildew issues by planting cucumbers early.
According to Keinath, downy mildew is the number one disease of cucumber plants in South Carolina. In their study, at least 72 percent of the crop planted late was lost to the disease, while there was no loss incurred for cucumbers that were planted early.
Planting early can help crops mature before downy mildew can spread, said Keinath. This can help growers save money often spent on fungicides and labor.
Based on the study findings, growers must plant cucumbers closer to the beginning of the planting period before temperatures get warm.
Downy mildew outbreaks usually occur in mild, wet weather when rainwater washes spores out of the air and onto leaves. After the disease infects a plant, it will continue to spread even in dry weather if temperatures stay above 60 F.
Keinath explained that planting earlier will help ensure that farmers can harvest their crops before downy mildew sets in.
Early planting offers benefits for both conventional growers and organic growers.
Most conventional growers use fungicides like Ranman, alternated with a protectant such as chlorothalonil or mancozeb before symptoms appear. Conventional growers can apply Gavel after symptoms appear to control downy mildew.
Keinath added that organic growers can apply copper sprays to control the mold.
Additionally, planting early can result in higher yields. The study revealed that cucumbers planted on March 24 yielded 1,648 cartons per acre, while cucumbers planted on May 12 yielded only 930 cartons per acre.
P. cubensis does not overwinter in South Carolina but spreads from more southern states through windblown spores. The water mold can travel up to 1,000 miles in two days. (Related: Collapse in population of mammals and birds is now impairing the ability of plants to migrate via seed dispersal.)

In a survival scenario, you may have an easier time harvesting insects than trying to hunt animals for meat. Read up on how to forage for and cook something slower and easier to catch: slugs and snails.
Slugs and snails might be the last thing you want for dinner, but you can’t afford to be picky when your supplies are running out in a post-SHTF world. (h/t to PreppersWill.com)
People in countries like France, Portugal and Spain consider escargot, or cooked snails, as a delicacy, but the average American might have second thoughts about this unusual dish.

Escargot is French for snail and this snail dish is often served exclusively at French restaurants. Depending on how you cook them, snails are fairly nutritious since they are high in protein and low in fat.
Escargot is usually served as an appetizer or main entree. Traditionally, French-style cooked snails are served with parsley and garlic butter. The snails are then served hot and you get them out of their shell before eating.
Shelled gastropod mollusks live in the oceans, in freshwater and on land. Those that have lost their gills and breathe air are the easiest to identify.
Snails and slugs (or a snail without a shell) are high in nutrients, particularly protein and numerous minerals. Mollusks are relatively easy to find if the environment is damp, making them an accessible food source.
Slugs and snails are nocturnal, meaning it’s best to hunt them at night. (Related: Food supply 101: Fish, a cheap and easy survival food.)
Slugs are gastropod mollusks with no shells. Many slug species are generally regarded as being shell-less, but they actually have a reduced internal shell.
The two common slug groups are round backs and keeled slugs. Slugs in the round back group have dome-shaped bodies, like the common garden slug.
Keeled slugs have a ridge, or keel, running along their back. The keeled slugs are the larger slug and they can reach up to seven or nine inches in length when fully stretched out.
Slugs use the retractable tentacles on their head to smell and detect food up to several meters away. Slugs are black, rubbery-like creatures covered in sticky mucus and live mainly in leaf litter.
Slugs have a rasp-like radula or tongue and chitinized jaw that they use to eat succulent plants. They can also eat carrion and fungi.
Snails are slugs with shells that are made from calcium and form a spiral column in which the snail lives. Unlike the sausage-shaped slug, the snail’s body has a bag-like structure.
The visible part of a snail is the foot, with the head at one end identified by the two retractable tentacles. Like slugs, snails secrete mucus that is used to lubricate the surface over which it is moving.
When dry, the mucus forms silver-colored lines that you can often see in the morning.
Snails also have a rasping radula tongue that they use to eat tender young plants. While essentially vegetarian, some snails are carnivorous and can feed on earthworms and other snails.
To catch slugs and snails, look in damp areas or dew-laden grass early in the morning.
Both slugs and snails avoid dry, hot areas and are usually more active during the evening. To be safe, only collect slugs and snails which are alive.
Generally, snails are nocturnal and sleep during the day. The mucus they secrete seals their shell, preventing the snail from drying out.
You can also eat hibernating snails, but you have to check if the seal around the shell entrance is intact and not receding. If you collect snails with receding seals, you have to discard them because they are either dead or on their last day of life.
Only collect slugs and snails in areas free of poisonous plants or fungi. Snails, especially slugs, can process the toxins ingested from eating poisonous plants and fungi for their own benefit.
Depending on the plant, cooking the slugs and snails won’t always break down the toxins to make them safe to eat. This is why you have to properly purge their stomachs for at least 24 hours before cooking.
Since slugs are more prone to eating poisonous plants or fungi than snails, people tend to avoid them in favor of snails.
Purging
Purging helps remove body waste and the remains of toxic plants from the stomach so the slugs or snails are safe to eat.
To purge slugs or snails, soak them in salty water for at least 24 hours. If you don’t have salt, place them in a container with harmless plants or vegetables. As they eat the plants, they will excrete what’s in their stomach.
If you can forage for something like wild garlic or another strong herb feed them this. Garlic or herbs will also infuse into the slug or snail’s flesh and help improve their taste.
Alternatively, you can feed them breadcrumbs or bran as these will help absorb any toxin present, which is then excreted. Never eat slugs or snails raw.
Traditionally, snails are boiled, but you can also cook them in the embers of a fire. Another option is to fry them in garlic butter.
Cook snails for about eight minutes. If you are boiling them, don’t place too many in the pot at the same time. As snails get hotter, the water will begin to froth because of the slime released from the body.
Enhance the taste by adding a spice or strong herbs, like wild garlic or mint, to the water. While the foot itself may be a little rubbery, the rest of the snail should be soft and tender.
You can also cook snails by wrapping them in edible leaves with a few herbs and a drop of water. Cover the leaf with wet mud and cook in the fire’s coals for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how many snails you have and how big they are.
Because the snails will cook in their own juices, they don’t lose the “meaty” taste you lose with boiling. You can also try this method by cooking them in aluminum foil.
Snails you forage in the wilderness will be smaller than the large white snail (Helix pomatia) often eaten in France.
When SHTF and you run out of food, forage for slugs and snails. Clean and prepare them properly if you need nutritious survival food.

https://food.news/2022-12-22-is-coffee-bad-for-probiotics-in-gut.html,A cup of joe and gut health: Is coffee bad for the probiotics in your gut?,"Advertisement
When you take a probiotic supplement, it’s normal to want to maximize its benefits on your body. But does that mean you have to stop drinking coffee every morning?
Here are some things to consider if you need a cup of joe every morning but are also worried about your gut health.
Dr. Lea Ann Chen, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine and pharmacology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, defines probiotics as “living microbes that confer beneficial effects on their host.”

This means probiotics are “bacteria that support your gut health and function.” You can find probiotics in different things, from fermented foods to dietary supplements.
Probiotics can be important in various settings to help maintain a balanced gut microbiome. (Related: Study: People who drink coffee have lower risk of early death.)
Like other aspects of your health, lifestyle factors like your eating habits, stress reduction, good sleep habits, exercise habits and other factors can affect the composition of your gut microbiome. In turn, this can influence your well-being.
If you eat a lot of junk food or don’t get enough sleep, you may experience issues with the good probiotics in your gut.
To keep your gut health in check, eat a “diverse and healthy diet” that is plant-based and full of dietary fiber. You can also improve your gut health by avoiding overly processed foods full of added sugar and fat.
But is coffee bad for your gut health? The answer depends.
Dr. Zhaoping Li, a nutrition researcher, professor of medicine, and chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that drinking black coffee moderately may offer benefits for your gut health.
In a small study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, researchers examined the gut microbiome samples taken during routine colonoscopies. The results revealed that those who consumed two or more cups of coffee daily throughout the previous year had better gut microbiome profiles than people who had less or no coffee.
Experts think that the chlorogenic acid in coffee may help increase the diversity in the gut microbiome. This may be one of the mechanisms “by which it can impact metabolism and provide health benefits.”
However, consuming too much coffee with a lot of added sugar and fat could be bad for your gut health. If you drink one or two cups of coffee regularly, make sure your beverage is low in sugar or has no sugar at all to maintain gut health.
As for coffee directly affecting the probiotics you consume, experts say it’s unlikely to cause an issue and that there is no sufficient data to suggest that coffee can harm the prebiotics in your gut.
Fortunately, there are several ways to support a healthy gut. One of the best ways to have long-term sustainable equilibrium in your gut microbiome is to incorporate some important key lifestyle factors for your gut health program.
This includes following a diverse diet full of plant-based foods. Your intestines are home to hundreds of species of bacteria, each of which has a specific role in health and requires different nutrients for growth.
A diverse microbiome is generally considered a healthy one because the more species of bacteria you have, the more health benefits you may be able to contribute. If you eat different food types, you can help cultivate a more diverse microbiome.
But the typical Western diet is not very diverse and is full of fat and sugar. Data suggests that at least 75 percent of the world’s food is produced from only 12 plants and five animal species.
Yet, diets in certain rural regions are usually more diverse and richer in the different plant sources. Because of this, some studies have found that gut microbiome diversity is much greater in people who live in rural regions of Africa and South America compared to those from urban areas in Europe or America.
Eating a lot of fruits and vegetables is also good for your gut health since produce is the best source of nutrients for a healthy microbiome.
Fruits and vegetables are full of dietary fiber, which your body can’t digest. But certain bacteria in your gut can digest fiber, and this stimulates their growth.
Beans and legumes are also full of fiber.
Here are some fiber-rich foods that are good for your gut bacteria:
According to a study, following a diet rich in fruits and vegetables prevented the growth of some disease-causing bacteria.
Research also suggests that superfoods like almonds, apples, artichokes, blueberries and pistachios can all help increase Bifidobacteria in humans. This is good because Bifidobacteria are considered beneficial bacteria and they can help prevent intestinal inflammation and boost your gut health.
Fermented foods have undergone fermentation, a process wherein the sugars they contain are broken down by yeast or bacteria.
Healthy fermented foods include:
Many of these foods are full of lactobacilli, a type of bacteria that offers health benefits.
According to studies, people who eat a lot of yogurt seem to have more lactobacilli in their intestines. They also have fewer Enterobacteriaceae, which is a type of bacteria linked to inflammation and some chronic conditions.
Data also suggests that yogurt may help enhance the function and composition of the microbiome.
But like with coffee, many yogurts, especially flavored yogurts, are full of added sugar. To keep your gut healthy, choose plain, unsweetened yogurt or flavored yogurt with minimal added sugar and is made only of milk and bacteria mixtures or “starter cultures.”
When buying yogurt, look for products with a label that reads “contains live active cultures.”
You can also consume fermented soybean milk, which experts think may promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, while also decreasing quantities of other harmful strains of bacteria. Eating kimchi may also benefit your gut flora.
Aside from following a plant-based and diverse diet, you can also improve your gut health by avoiding processed foods. You should also exercise regularly and try to manage your stress levels.
Drinking coffee without added sugar and fat shouldn’t interfere with the probiotics in your gut.
The most important thing you can do to take care of your gut bacteria is to eat well. Experts also recommend taking a probiotic supplement to support and encourage a healthy gut microbiome.

Food waste is still a huge problem in the United States. But according to a U.K. study, this can be solved by making a change to your food storage habits.
The study has found that refrigerating fruits and vegetables instead of keeping them in a fruit bowl on the kitchen counter can help extend their shelf life.
The food charity Waste and Resources Action Program (WRAP) reported that different fruits and vegetables can be eaten up to 10 weeks after their “best before” dates if they are refrigerated.
Researchers found that loose apples last longer when refrigerated at 7.2 F (4 C), almost 70 days longer compared to ambient conditions.

For the study, the organization observed the effects of storing various fruits and vegetables at ambient conditions or in the fridge. Data showed that storing cucumber and broccoli at an optimal fridge temperature of 7.2 F gave significantly more life (15 days) compared to a sub-optimal fridge temperature of 16.2 F (9 C).
Experts advised that maintaining a fridge temperature below 9 F and storing more fresh produce in the fridge can help fruits and vegetables stay fresher for longer. This also helps prevent food waste because consumers would have a much longer timeframe to consume what they purchase.
Additionally, WRAP is urging U.K. retailers to sell fresh, uncut fruit and vegetables without best-before dates or plastic packaging.
During the 18-month study, scientists experimented with five commonly wasted items:
The produce was stored both in the original packaging and loose at varying temperatures.
WRAP reported that selling these five fruits and vegetables loose and getting rid of best before dates could amount to a combined yearly saving of:
Many supermarkets already sell some items loose, but the study presented compelling evidence for continuing the beneficial practice with many other fresh fruits and vegetables.
According to WRAP, it shared its findings and recommendations with the U.K.’s largest food retailers. However, the food charity also acknowledged that implementing them would take time.
Marcus Gover, WRAP’s chief executive, said the study findings “could be a game-changer in the fight against food waste and plastic pollution.” He added that the study helped demystify the link between food waste, plastic packaging, date labels and food storage.
Preventing food waste isn’t just good for the environment. It can also help you save money on groceries and make the most of the food you buy.
Follow these tips to reduce food waste at home:
As reported in the study, refrigerate apples to make them last longer.
While tomatoes should be stored on the counter, most fruits and vegetables should be refrigerated so they last longer.
Before you run to the grocery store, check all nooks and crannies in your fridge. If you still have half a jar of pasta sauce that’s still good to eat, use it up before buying a new jar of sauce.
Make the most of your groceries by planning meals weekly and making a list so you know exactly what to buy.
If possible, use coupons and wait for sales to save more money.
Starting a home garden takes some time and effort, but it’s worth it if you want to feed your family fresh, organic fruits and vegetables.
If space is an issue or if you don’t have enough time to manage a full garden, opt for a container or window herb garden. With some practice, you can grow flavorful and nutritious herbs and microgreens for soups and salads.
If you need other things you can’t grow at home, buy them at farmer’s markets. This is a better option because fruits and vegetables from a farmer are usually fresher than those from the supermarket.
Save carrot tops and make pesto and use up old fruit and bread to make bread pudding.
Wilted vegetables can be used to make vegetable stock. If you have stale bread, store it in another bag for bread pudding or croutons.
If you still have food waste that’s no longer edible, use it to make compost for your garden.

Some of the best foods for heart health can also help boost your gut health.
According to Dr. William Davis, a cardiologist and New York Times bestselling author, there is a lot of crossover between the two categories.
Davis said doctors “should be experts in nutrition and the microbiome” because the gut microbiome can affect various bodily functions like immunity, brain function and heart health.
He also talked about three foods that help boost both heart and gut health.
Research suggests that a plant-based diet can boost heart health since limiting meat intake and eating more vegetables can help maintain healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

According to a study in the Journal of the American Heart Association, people who followed a more plant-based diet enhanced their cardiovascular health by 16 percent.
However, Davis said grass-fed, sustainably sourced meat can be a part of a heart-healthy food pyramid, especially organ meats.
While divisive on the palate, organ meats like tongue, liver and kidney are full of essential vitamins and nutrients such as:
But if you are too squeamish about eating organ meats, Davis recommends eating grass-fed meat bone-in and skin-on.
For example, chicken skin contains collagen and hyaluronic acid while the bone and bone marrow contain various nutrients. Discarding chicken skin, bones and bone marrow means you’re also throwing away the gut- and heart-healthy benefits of the meat.
Make the most of grass-fed meat and chicken by purchasing the highest-quality meat you can. Save the bones and fat and use recipes that make stews and soups out of it. (Related: Maintaining heart health may be the key to diabetes prevention.)
Legumes are full of dietary fiber, which enhances heart health by decreasing and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or bad cholesterol, as well as total cholesterol levels.
Your gut microbiome also feeds on plant-based fiber such as prebiotic fiber that promotes the growth of a good gut bacteria called Akkermansia muciniphila. When these bacteria are deprived of fiber, they will consume human mucus.
This is bad because mucus is the protective layer of your GI tract. Once this gut bacteria turn to mucus, it can affect your gut health over time.
Because your gut health is linked to many processes, it can also affect your heart, brain and skin health as well.
To keep your heart and gut healthy, Davis suggests prioritizing your fiber intake by getting a healthy serving of legumes regularly. He also warned that people on “strict, low-carb diets and don’t pay attention to the intake of those sources of fiber may pay a long-term health price.”
Essential oils are commonly used in aromatherapy, and Davis said food-grade oils may offer benefits for your gut and heart health. In a gut health setting, he noted that terpenes from essential oils “are very effective.”
Study suggests that the ingestion of certain essential oils can offer benefits during moments of digestive distress. To illustrate, peppermint essential oil has been shown to promote gut comfort.
Bitter orange oil, meanwhile, has been studied for its effectiveness in gastric health.
Davis recommends using essential oils in a “very specific way” since the oils shouldn’t be taken directly.
Essential oils are very caustic and they can burn so they need to be diluted properly to avoid adverse effects.
Below are some essential oils you should never ingest:

Vitamin C or L-ascorbic acid is a water-soluble vitamin that’s an important part of a balanced diet. This essential vitamin has many bodily functions.
For starters, vitamin C helps with collagen production and boosts your immune system.
Many people think oranges are the best dietary source of vitamin C, but some fruits and vegetables are actually better sources of this essential mineral.
Here is how much vitamin C is in orange.
According to nutrient analysis data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one medium orange contains approximately 68 milligrams of vitamin C. (Related: Avoid sun damage with superfoods that offer photoprotective benefits for your skin.)

Surprisingly, a 3/4-cup serving of orange juice contains a little more vitamin C than an actual orange. Orange juice has a concentrated dose of around 93 mg of vitamin C.
However, if you’re after more fiber, a whole orange delivers more dietary fiber, especially if you can stomach the white, spongy pith.
Here’s a breakdown of other superfoods that either top the orange’s vitamin C capacity or come close, according to data from the USDA:
You can also boost your vitamin C intake by preparing this eye-catching and nutritious salad with green beans and pomegranate.

Preparation:
The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin C varies based on factors like your age and gender.
Jessica Cording, a health coach and registered dietitian, said these are general recommendations. But it can vary in terms of what’s considered the optimal amount for you.
You may have higher needs during different times in your life, but at a minimum, you should aim for the RDA.
Data suggests that at least 42 percent of U.S. adults are deficient in vitamin C based on blood test results. At least 118 million American adults are also failing to consume adequate amounts of vitamin C daily from their diets.
If you’re taking in more vitamin C than you need, you will urinate the excess since your body will get rid of it, said Dr. Zhaoping Li, the director of the Center for Human Nutrition and chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
If you have a “megadose” of vitamin C, you may experience negative side effects, warned Li.
According to the National Academies, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of vitamin C is 2,000 mg per day. The UL is defined as “the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population.”
Emily Achey, a registered dietitian nutritionist, said that vitamin C has a role in many important functions in the body. These include the following:
Vitamin C is your body’s primary water-soluble antioxidant and it has a major role in neutralizing harmful free radicals and fighting reactive oxidative species (ROS) throughout the body. The vitamin can also help regenerate other antioxidants in your body, like vitamin E and glutathione.
These nutrients work with vitamin C to protect different cells and tissues throughout the body.
According to studies, getting sufficient levels of vitamin C helps support memory and cognitive function.
Not everyone needs to supplement with vitamin C, especially if you get enough of it with a balanced diet.
If you’re not sure, examine your diet to see if supplementation can offer benefits. What specific needs are you covering with food?
Are there gaps in your diet? If you’re falling short of the ideal vitamin C intake from food, health experts recommend taking a vitamin C supplement.
If you are having issues with immune system function, you should also consider taking additional vitamin C.
Aside from the gap-filling approach, the science of vitamin C also offers potential benefits for higher potency dosing, such as increasing your dose from 500 mg to 1,000 mg, depending on your health goals.
If you want to optimize your immune response or for the reduction of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory biomarker, and promote cardiometabolic health (e.g., blood pressure), data suggests that high-potency C dosing may be beneficial.
Fresh oranges and orange juice are good sources of vitamin C, but there are other food sources of the essential vitamin. You can also supplement with vitamin C to boost your intake and support immune health.

A healthy gut is key to your well-being. According to ancient medical systems, all health outcomes begin in the gut.
This may seem like an oversimplification, but many studies suggest that there is some truth to the belief that gut health is crucial for your overall health.
If you want to achieve optimal gut health, eat nutritious foods and incorporate gut health-boosting spices like fennel and turmeric into your regular diet.
Cloves are a spice with potent, powerful anti-inflammatory effects, thanks to the beneficial compound eugenol.

Cloves contain fiber, vitamins and minerals. Using whole or ground cloves to give various dishes and beverages a flavor boost can also increase your intake of essential important nutrients.
One teaspoon (two grams) of ground cloves contains six calories, one gram of carbs and one gram of fiber. The same serving also contains 55 percent of the Daily Value (DV) of manganese and two percent of the DV for vitamin K.
According to studies, manganese is an essential mineral for maintaining brain function and building strong bones.
Cloves are also a great source of antioxidants. These compounds help reduce oxidative stress, which is linked to the development of chronic disease.
The eugenol in cloves acts as a natural antioxidant. According to a test-tube study, eugenol curbed oxidative damage caused by free radicals five times more effective than vitamin E, another powerful antioxidant.
Cumin can help digestive enzyme production and bile secretion, which helps the body better digest fatty foods.
Most recipes using lentils also add cumin to help boost their digestibility.
Cumin is rich in vitamins and minerals like:
Some studies suggest that cumin can help stimulate the production of pancreatic enzymes and help digestion.
Research also evaluated the antioxidant content of cumin and results showed that it was more effective than other common antioxidants, such as vitamin C. Data also suggests that cumin can potentially be used to protect against cancer.
Fennel seeds are powerhouses that can help improve digestion by supporting digestive enzyme production. It is also believed that fennel can help cool the digestive tract.
Fennel stimulates the production of gastric juices. It also has carminative properties, meaning it can help relieve flatulence or gas.
Additionally, fennel is used as an after-dinner digestive aid. It also has antispasmodic properties.
If you are looking for a spice full of dietary fiber, use fennel seeds. It also contains metabolically inert, insoluble fiber that increases the bulk of the food you eat as it goes through your digestive system. Insoluble fiber helps ease constipation and protects the colon.
Fennel also contains various antioxidants like quercetin, which can help protect against aging and diseases such as cancer.
If you suffer from gut issues, steep some fennel seeds in warm water and drink it as a soothing herbal tea to help support your gut health. (Related: Agave fiber promotes gut health and weight loss, reveals study.)
Turmeric is a popular spice because it has impressive anti-inflammatory properties that can help support healthy inflammatory pathways in the gut. The spice can also help support the gut lining.
When using turmeric, add a bit of black pepper to help boost the bioavailability of the curcumin in turmeric.
These recipes include the spices mentioned above and other superfoods that can promote gut health.

https://food.news/2022-12-15-reverse-juicing-trick-boost-antioxidant-intake-berries.html,Try this “reverse juicing” trick to boost your antioxidant intake from berries,"Advertisement
Nutrition experts recommend berries as part of a balanced diet because these tart, juicy fruits are full of beneficial antioxidants like polyphenols.
Polyphenols offer several health benefits and one expert has a unique tip to help you get the most antioxidants when juicing berries.
Polyphenols are a subgroup of antioxidants. These potent phytonutrients, or plant-based nutrients, are linked to many health benefits, such as supporting heart health, glowing skin and improved longevity.

Dr. Steven Gundry, a respected cardiologist, shares one hack called “reverse juicing” that will help you extract even more polyphenols from nutritious berries. (Related: Top 8 tasty and nutritious vegetables for juicing.)
If you have a juicer, use it like you normally would. Slice your fruits and vegetables to the correct size, then slowly insert them one after the other into the machine.
Once activated, the juicer will press each piece into a nutrient-dense liquid. Most juicers will have an outlet that collects all the pulp so you can easily compost or save it for future recipes.
If you’re using a blender to make fruit juice, you have to strain the pulp before drinking your beverage. Gundry recommends saving the pulp instead of throwing it away because it’s actually the best part of the juicing method.
Here are the three steps to reverse juice your berries and fruits:
Berries are a great source of polyphenols, and using this hack means you get more bang for your buck. Blueberries contain polyphenol pigments called anthocyanins that are needed to maintain brain health and for healthy aging.
Other fruits like pomegranates contain ellagic acid, another polyphenol and powerful antioxidant that can support healthy skin and increase skin’s resilience against UVB rays.
Instead of throwing away the pulp from your juicer, set it aside and add it to yogurt and smoothies for an antioxidant boost.
If you don’t have a juicer, you can also take a supplement that includes pomegranate extract to get similar results. Look for a high-quality 100 percent pomegranate whole fruit extract with a concentrated dose (at least 60 percent) of total polyphenols.
These supplements can help enhance photoprotection and promote healthy skin aging. Try beauty supplements with pomegranate extract to boost your skin health.
When buying supplements, choose a product that contains only 100 percent pomegranate whole fruit extract (Punica granatum L.) that includes a relevant dose of at least 100 milligrams. Lastly, the supplement should include a verifiable botanical concentration of polyphenols. Brands will usually quantify the polyphenol amount.
Strawberries contain high amounts of antioxidant polyphenols. This delicious snack made with fresh strawberries can help protect healthy cells from free radical damage.
Homemade strawberry oatmeal bars
These strawberry oatmeal bars are also great if you need a quick breakfast or snack.
Ingredients for 16 servings of the crust and crumble:

Notes:
If you love fruit juice, use your juicer and save the nutrient-rich pulp from berries. Add the fruit pulp to sweet desserts and breakfasts for a quick antioxidant boost.

https://food.news/2022-12-15-improve-health-boost-longevity-blue-zones-diet.html,Improve your well-being and boost longevity with the Blue Zones diet,"Advertisement
Health-conscious people constantly aim to improve their overall well-being and longevity. According to an expert, one diet may be key to this goal: the Blue Zones diet.
This diet, founded by longevity expert Dan Buettner, has been linked to populations with better cardiovascular, metabolic and overall health outcomes.
According to Buettner, the Blue Zone regions are the world’s “longevity hotspots.”
There are five Blue Zones in the world: Loma Linda, California; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece; Sardinia, Italy; and Okinawa, Japan. These five regions have a high concentration of people who live to be over 100 years old.

After researching these regions, Buettner found that the diets and lifestyle practices of people from different countries shared some unique similarities.
Loma Linda
Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda are “extremely religious and follow a mostly vegan diet.” They avoid dairy, spices, shellfish and all meats.
Nicoya
Nicoya is a Costa Rican region that includes more starches and grains such as beans, corn and squash compared to other Blue Zones.
People in this area consume a lot of vegetables like carrots, peppers and tomatoes and some fruits that are local to where they live like bananas, oranges and papaya. People from the area have an earlier, smaller dinner.
They also treat grains like corn with lime, which boosts the bioavailability of the nutrients.
Ikaria
In Ikaria, people follow a more plant-based version of the Mediterranean diet. They eat more legumes and heart-healthy fats.
They also drink alcohol, but only in moderation.
Sardinia
In Sardinia, the typical diet includes a lot of beans, vegetables, fruits and whole grains.
The local diet includes heart-healthy monounsaturated fats from olive oil and a very small amount of meat. They also consume dairy like goat and sheep milk, which are usually easier to digest.
Okinawa
Okinawa is a region in Ryukyu Islands in southern part of Japan. The Okinawa diet has more fish, soy and vegetables compared to the diets of the other Blue Zones.
In this area, people focus on starches low on the glycemic index, like rice and sweet potato, which make up 67 percent of their diet. They eat pork, but only for rare ceremonial occasions and in small amounts.
Okinawans also follow a principle called ikigai or “purpose,” which gives them reasons to wake up in the morning.
The Blue Zones Diet is based on the eating patterns followed in the Blue Zones.
Regardless of the region each Blue Zone is in, they include the following in their diet:
Plants
People in the Blue Zones follow a mostly plant-based diet that includes lots of fruits, vegetables, fiber-rich whole grains, nuts, beans and seeds. While not totally plant-based, at least 95 percent of the foods in these diets come from a plant or a plant product. (Related: Health and nutrition: Study links eating a plant-based diet to lower risk of diabetes.)
Healthy fats
Those in Blue Zones consume healthy fats like olive oil, nuts and seeds. Many people eat a handful or two of nuts almost every day.
Dark leafy greens
Dark, leafy greens like kale, spinach and Swiss chard are also an important part of the Blue Zones diet.
Beans
Data has revealed that people from Blue Zones consume at least one cup of beans daily.
Fish
Fish is part of the Blue Zones diet but people usually consume no more than three ounces of fish daily.
Data suggests that, on average, fish is on the menu only two to three times a week.
Eggs
Eggs are also eaten in the diets of all five Blue Zones, but they are only consumed an average of two to four times every week.
Dairy
Cow’s milk, dairy and yogurt aren’t as popular. Instead, people consume goat’s and sheep’s milk products, especially in the Ikarian and Sardinian Blue Zones.
Whole grains
Bread is a staple in Blue Zone regions and it is eaten almost daily.
But instead of processed bread, those in the five zones favor whole grain or sourdough varieties. They also eat other whole grains for most meals, like barley, brown rice or oats.
Limited meat intake
Meat is part of the Blue Zones diet but only two ounces of chicken, pork and other meats are eaten about five times per month.
No processed foods
The Blue Zone diet focuses on a lot of whole foods that are minimally processed. This means people eat mostly foods found in nature, and nothing processed in a factory.
Minimal added sugar
Sweets are usually only eaten during celebrations, and they otherwise don’t consume a lot of added sugar on a daily basis.
Moderate alcohol intake
Alcohol is part of the diet, but people usually limit themselves to one to two glasses of red wine per day.
Experts think alcohol offers certain benefits that may come from resveratrol, an antioxidant found in red wine. Other superfoods like berries, cocoa, grapes and peanuts also contain resveratrol.
Like other balanced diets, the Blue Zones diet offers many benefits. People in these regions focus on more whole, natural foods instead of processed items often eaten in Western diets.
The Blue Zones also prioritize other factors that contribute to a healthy lifestyle, like strong relationships, quality sleep and physical activity.
Shifting to a Blue Zone diet may offer these benefits:
Longevity
Research suggests that people who follow the diet and stick to it live long, healthy lives up to their 90s and even 100s.
Improved heart and brain health
A study on the Blue Zone diet has shown that people who follow it, as opposed to the Standard American diet, found that they “experienced better cardiovascular health outcomes and cognitive function.”
Boosts mental health
Your physical health is often linked to your mental health and overall mood.
Data also suggests that eating more high-quality whole foods is better for your mental state.
Promotes healthy weight management
The Blue Zones diet is ideal for anyone who wants to maintain a healthy weight because it encourages people to eat only until they are 80 percent full, which can help discourage overeating and unhealthy snacking.
Increases nutrient intake
If you’re tired of feeling sluggish because of all the processed foods that you eat, try the Blue Zone Diet to boost your intake of vitamins and minerals.
While the Blue Zones diet is considered beneficial, one major critique is that many people think it means they have to be mostly vegetarian to be healthy.
While the diet includes a lot of plant-based foods, it also includes a bit of high-quality fish, poultry and meat.
Here are other critiques of the Blue Zone diet:
It’s not recommended if you are sensitive to carbs
The diet includes beans, legumes and whole grains, which are carbs.
If you are glucose-sensitive, too many carbs could be bad for your hormones and blood sugar levels.
It can be hard to maintain if you don’t cook all your meals
If you eat out, you risk eating items that aren’t part of the diet.
The Blue Zones diet isn’t sustainable if you don’t cook all your meals.
It can be hard to get all your proteins from plants
Going strictly vegan means you may have trouble getting all your proteins from plant-based foods.
And while you can get all your protein from plants, United States Department of Agriculture guidelines suggest 0.8 grams of protein for one pound of body weight.
Unless you’re being very intentional about your proteins, such as consuming more beans and legumes and fewer starches, you might not be getting enough. If this is an issue, you can address it by being more intentional when choosing your meals.
If you want to improve your lifestyle habits and boost your longevity, start shifting to the Blue Zones diet.
And if you can’t give up on meat completely, making changes to your current diet by eating more whole foods, limiting your meat intake and avoiding processed foods can help you live longer.

Studies show that following a balanced diet, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight are key to reducing your risk of developing some common cancers and improving the well-being of cancer survivors.
These good habits can also protect against other chronic diseases like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. However, making changes can be difficult if you are used to an unhealthy lifestyle.
If you’re struggling to maintain your habits, experts recommend starting small and working your way up to other health goals.

A team of experts in the field of cancer prevention and survivorship from the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) suggests taking one action “to start lowering the risk of cancer and/or live healthier as a survivor.”
Sheena Patel, the AICR’s Director of Nutrition Programs, recommends downloading the AICR’s Healthy Living Calendar.
This calendar features a helpful 30-day checklist that will help improve your eating habits and encourage you to exercise more. This guide can also help you make healthy choices to reduce your cancer risk.
The checklist includes suggestions like how to incorporate a healthy habit into your current routine, like cooking meals with a new vegetable or going for a bike ride.
If you have a lot of unhealthy habits, the calendar can motivate you to accomplish different goals for each day of the month. These consistent reminders will help foster good habits that will promote long-lasting behavior changes.
You can also join AICR’s Healthy10 Challenge, a 10-week interactive program that focuses on diet, nutrition and physical activity to reduce cancer risk and other chronic diseases.
Justin C. Brown, an AICR grantee and director of the Cancer Metabolism Program at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, recommends focusing on small sustainable changes instead of large and dramatic but short-lived changes.
If you drink too much soda than you think is healthy, try to reduce your intake by one less drink a day.
If you are overweight, focus on preventing additional weight gain instead of trying to lose 10 pounds in one week. Small and steady weight loss is crucial for your well-being.
Alice Bender, an AICR Nutrition Consultant, says AICR’s Cancer Prevention Recommendations can help you find goals that are good for you.
Instead of going vegan when you love red meat, start by adding one serving of vegetables to your lunch every other day of the week and limiting your intake of meat. (Related: Study shows apigenin, a compound in parsley, offers cancer-fighting benefits.)
Karen Collins, a Nutrition Advisor at the AICR, suggests increasing your intake of dietary fiber.
If you love fiber-rich superfoods like beans, make it a larger part of the plate and make another food smaller. Alternatively, you can choose a food with fiber like whole grains to replace a food with little or no fiber, like refined grains.
If you have a limited range of fiber-rich foods in your usual eating habits, check out recipes on the AICR website recipes or other print or online cookbooks for tips on how other cultures make vegetables, whole grains and legumes as main ingredients for various dishes.
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for cancer prevention. If you find yourself struggling to lose weight, weighing yourself daily can help give you a mental reminder to reduce unhealthy snacking between meals.
Regular weight checks is one of the most powerful tools used by people who successfully lose weight, said Wendy Demark-Wahnefried, an AICR grantee.
AICR Vice President of Research Nigel Brockton advocates regular physical activity. If you prefer social activities, play basketball with your friends.
If you enjoy solo activities, try cycling. Whatever your preferences, any activity is good for you as long as it gets you off of the couch and sweating.
If you hate going to the gym and lifting weights, look for an activity that you enjoy so you can motivate yourself to work out.
AICR grantee Kathryn Schmitz said exercise offers benefits not just for cancer, but for many common chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease and obesity.
Once you find fun activities that encourage you to work out, try to exercise for at least 150 minutes a week.
You can reach your goal by taking a walk for 30 minutes a day and planning exercise sessions. Use a pedometer or other electronic trackers to reach 10,000 steps per day.
A SMART goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-based, said Angela Hummel, a consulting dietitian with AICR.
When starting a new activity, make a SMART Goal and specify the number of minutes or steps for your fitness goal.
With the SMART Goal, you can continue to improve by increasing the number of minutes or steps each week. When starting a workout regimen, start by walking for at least 15 minutes three days a week.
The next week, try to increase the number of days or number of minutes. As you get used to exercising, gradually increase the minutes or steps to meet your goals.

https://food.news/2022-12-13-good-habits-how-to-support-healthy-digestion.html,Good habits for better health: How to support healthy digestion,"Advertisement
Having a healthy digestive system contributes to your overall well-being. Generally, your body takes between 10 hours to three days to move food through your entire digestive system.
However, if you’re feeling more tired than usual or are dealing with gastrointestinal (GI) issues, things have likely “slowed down.”
If you often experience symptoms like bloating, stomach issues and feeling fuller than usual after eating small meals, you may have issues with your gut health.
If that’s the case, here are lifestyle changes that can help boost your digestion:

Regular physical activity can help get things moving inside your digestive tract.
According to a study published in the journal Gut, daily moderate exercise, which includes activities like cycling and jogging, may help reduce gut transit time by as much as 30 percent.
If you prefer other activities or are older and want to try gentler workouts, here are some suggestions:
Go for a walk
Basic movement like walking can speed up your digestion by stimulating the muscles in your stomach and small intestine and helping move things along.
Walking any time of the day offers health benefits, but research suggests that going for a walk after eating may be better for you. Studies suggest that taking a 15-minute leisurely walk after eating can help move food through your stomach much faster.
Remember that this applies to a leisurely walk because going too hard can have the opposite effect. If you want to keep up the pace, walk briskly before eating instead.
Pilates
Pilates is a great choice if you prefer gentle workouts that are easier on the joints.
Pilates has some similarities with yoga, but the former is generally considered more focused on the anatomical movements and less on the spiritual element linked to yoga.
Pilates is focused on things that may benefit someone with a weaker body, like balance, flexibility, better posture and strength. These are all crucial for healthy aging, especially if you are over 50.
Pilates doesn’t include high-impact movements. Rather, the activity focuses on simple, controlled movements.
Swimming
Swimming is one of the best cardiovascular exercises that put less stress on the joints. The water you’re swimming in takes a lot of the weight, making it the perfect choice if you want to exercise but have bad knees and hips or other health issues.
And even if you’re a senior, swimming is a suitable activity for overall health and fitness. It can even help tone your body.
Tai chi
Tai chi is an ancient Chinese exercise that involves “slow, flowing movements.” This gentle martial art connects both your mind and body to perform these movements.
Tai chi is gentle, but it can still get you moving. Try this activity if you also want to improve core skills like balance, coordination and core strength.
Try a yoga flow
Many yoga poses, like dandasana, janu sirsasana and savasana can help speed up your digestion.
If you are new to yoga, start with a simple 10-minute sequence daily to physically support digestive processes and encourage regular elimination.
According to Lee Holmes, a ?registered yoga teacher and gut expert, yoga involves twisting postures that can help enhance your digestion and “encourage the liver and kidneys’ detoxification processes.” Additionally, yoga can help with bloating by increasing the amount of oxygen in the area.
Yoga can also get your digestion going by promoting relaxation. When you’re relaxed, the nervous system is in a parasympathetic state. This calming state, or “rest and digest” state, is important for proper digestion.
Certain foods like sugar or refined carbohydrates and fried food can interfere with proper digestion.
Fortunately, other healthy foods can get your digestion moving as it should. (Related: Improving digestion: 11 gut-friendly foods.)
Probiotic foods
Probiotic-rich foods like fermented foods are full of beneficial bacteria that can support your gut health.
A study published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology found that yogurt, a popular probiotic food, helps speed up digestion. Yogurt can also support the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), the part of the immune system that lives in your gut.
If you can’t consume dairy, you can try other probiotic-rich foods like:
Two tablespoons of raw sauerkraut contain at least one million colony-forming units (CFUs) of good bacteria, so try adding it to your favorite sandwiches.
Probiotic supplements
Aside from eating foods that can support your gut health, you can also take probiotic supplements to speed up your digestion.
Certain probiotic strains can support gut health and help maintain the healthy functions of the digestive system. These strains can also help reduce gas and bloating and improve total digestion time (or gut transit time), which is key to maintaining bowel regularity.
Fiber-rich foods
Fiber is also crucial for healthy digestion. There are two main types of dietary fiber: soluble and insoluble.
Both types are important for your well-being, but insoluble fiber plays a bigger role in your digestive health.
Your body is unable to digest insoluble fiber or absorb it into the bloodstream. But this type of fiber is crucial because it makes up the weight and bulk of stools in your body.
In other words, insoluble fiber acts as a “broom” thanks to its laxative effect that helps pull water into the stool and pushes things out.
You also need prebiotic fiber. This type of fiber comes from superfoods like:
Prebiotic fiber acts as a food source for probiotics, the beneficial bacteria in your gut.
Chewing is also crucial for your digestive health. If you eat in a rush and don’t chew your food properly, this will “cause more work for your stomach, which further impedes the digestive process down the line—it’s a negative ripple effect,” warned Dr. Frank Lipman, a functional medicine doctor.
Try to chew until your food is liquefied, or chew at least 20 to 30 times.
Consuming enough fluids is key to digestive health. If you don’t drink enough water, you may have a hard time with your bowels.
Keep in mind that you should avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee and sugary beverages like soda.
Stay hydrated by consuming these beneficial liquids:
Bone broth
Bone broth offers two benefits for your digestion: It helps keep your gut hydrated and it also contains gelatin and gut-supporting minerals, electrolytes and bioactives such as calcium, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, magnesium and phosphorus.
Herbal tea
Apart from plain water, you can try herbal teas.
Herbal teas can help with your gut health, and certain teas offer other benefits. For example, dandelion tea can help stimulate muscle contractions and help push food through the digestive system. Fennel and senna teas have a stronger laxative effect.
Water
If possible, drink water regularly and limit your intake of sugar and other harmful additives.
Water is important because it helps you digest your food and absorb nutrients. It also helps push the waste through and out of your digestive system. Experts recommend drinking nine cups of water a day for women and 12.5 cups for men.
It’s best to limit your intake of coffee because it’s not recommended for proper hydration. If you need a cup of joe every morning, drink an extra cup of water for every cup you consume.
Sluggish digestion may cause discomfort. If you are having gut issues, exercise regularly, eat more fermented and fiber-rich foods and stay hydrated to boost your digestion.

Juicing is big among health enthusiasts, but others prefer smoothies.
After all, smoothies are more filling. And unlike juicing, making a healthy smoothie at home means you get to enjoy the benefits of nutritious ingredients that are full of dietary fiber, like apples.
When you make your own smoothies, you are also free to add healthful herbs and spices, as well as other ingredients that can boost the nutritional content of your beverage.
If you’re a fan of delicious and healthy smoothies, try making an apple pie smoothie.

An apple pie smoothie is loaded with dietary fiber from the pulp of apples and their bioflavonoid-rich skin.
Fiber and bioflavonoids can help keep your uric acid in check. Uric acid is a natural waste product generated by the digestion of foods that contain purines, such as beer, organ meats, red meat and sardines. Your body also forms and breaks down purine.
Normally, your body filters out uric acid through the kidneys and via urination. However, if you consume too much purine or if your body is unable to eliminate this by-product fast enough, uric acid can build up in your blood.
A normal uric acid level is under 6.8 mg/dL; blood levels above that can cause hyperuricemia, a condition that can lead to gout. Gout causes painful joints, courtesy of accumulated urate crystals. Hyperuricemia can also make your blood and urine too acidic.
This healthy apple pie smoothie boasts anti-inflammatory and glucose-controlling benefits, thanks to spices like cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. It is also a great source of “good” fat from Greek yogurt, raw almond butter and almond milk.
Ingredients for 2 servings:
Preparation:
This recipe is based on the classic snack pairing of apples and peanut butter.
Ingredients for 1 serving:
Preparation:
Did you know that there are 7,000 different cultivars of apples? They are also the most widely consumed fruit worldwide. (Related: Researchers explore the properties of Apple of Sodom (Dead Sea Apple) that make it a staple in traditional Kenyan medicine.)
Sweet, juicy apples are often used in recipes for desserts like cookies and pies. Apples are also used to make jams, muffins, oatmeal, salads or smoothies. While apples can be enjoyed on their own, you can eat apples wedged and with a bit of nut butter.
Apples have several scientifically-proven health benefits. The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating two cups of fruit daily for a 2,000-calorie diet, emphasizing whole fruits such as apples.
One medium seven-ounce (200-grams) apple contains these nutrients:
The same serving also provides two to five percent of the DV for vitamins B1, B6 and E.
Vitamin B1, or thiamine, is crucial for normal growth and development. You need vitamin B6 for protein metabolism, while vitamin E acts as a fat-soluble antioxidant.
Apples are also full of polyphenols, an important group of antioxidants. These compounds help prevent free radical damage that is often linked to the development of chronic conditions such as cancer and heart disease.
Experts believe antioxidants like polyphenols are behind the health benefits of apples. To get the most out of apples, eat them with their skin on. Apple peel contains half of the fiber and most of the polyphenols in apples.
Here are some of the benefits of eating apples:
Helps protect your brain
The quercetin in apples may protect your brain from damage caused by oxidative stress.
In one animal study, researchers reported that quercetin helped protect the brain and nerves of rats from oxidative damage. The compound also helped prevent injuries that can result in degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.
Additionally, high intakes of flavonoids like quercetin has been linked to a lower risk of stroke. According to one study, for every 1/5 cup (25 grams) of apple slices you consume per day, your risk of stroke can decrease by as much as nine percent.
Good for your heart
Research suggests that apples help lower the risk of heart disease. Experts attribute this to their high soluble fiber content, which helps lower blood cholesterol levels.
Meanwhile, flavonoids like epicatechin in apples help lower blood pressure and reduce LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol oxidation. They also help prevent atherosclerosis, or the harmful buildup of plaque in the arteries.
Helps improve gut health
Apples contain pectin, a type of fiber that functions as a prebiotic. Prebiotics feed your gut microbiota, or the “good” bacteria in your gut.
The state of your gut microbiota is crucial to your overall health because a healthy gut can help strengthen your defenses against diseases.
Since your body can’t digest dietary fiber, pectin from apples reaches your colon intact and promotes the growth of good bacteria. Pectin helps improve the ratio of Bacteriodetes to Firmicutes. These are the two main types of bacteria in your gut.
According to research, apples can beneficially alter your gut microbiota and offer protective benefits against chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, obesity and Type 2 diabetes.
Helps support weight loss goals
Apples are high in fiber and water, which makes them a filling snack.
Eating healthy foods like apples can make you feel full for longer, which can help you achieve your weight loss goals. When you feel full, you can avoid unhealthy snacking between meals. This can then help reduce your energy intake.
One study showed that eating whole apples increased feelings of fullness for up to four hours compared to consuming an equal amount of apple puree or juice.  Researchers found that this was possible because apples can reduce gastric emptying, or the rate at which the stomach empties its contents.
According to studies, eating apples can also help reduce your body mass index (BMI), a weight-related risk factor for heart disease. Data also suggest that apple polyphenols may have anti-obesity effects.
Maintain a healthy weight by following a balanced diet and eating nutritious apples.

Enjoying a warm loaf of artisan bread for breakfast is a great way to start your day, but the costs can add up if you buy bread too often.
To save money, learn how to make delicious no-knead artisan bread at home. The recipe below only takes about five minutes a day and only requires five ingredients you may already have at home.
The final product is a loaf of bread with a soft and fluffy inside with a crunchy crust. (Related: 8 Survival bread recipes for preppers.)
These tools aren’t required, but having them will make it easier to bake the bread at home.

The whole family will love this freshly baked bread, which is best used to make garlic bread, various sandwiches, or torn and dipped into a hearty soup. Fresh bread is also a great snack with a dollop of butter.
Ideally, if you want to bake bread you should already have this dough sitting in the refrigerator. This helps save time instead of gathering ingredients to bake a fresh loaf of bread or having to let your dough rise to room temperature first.
This dough works best straight from the fridge, but if this is your first time baking this bread, you will need to make the “master dough.”
You need the following ingredients to make the master dough:
Flour
You can use whole wheat or fresh ground flour, but reduce the flour to five and a half cups and increase only if the dough is too wet and won’t hold its shape.
Avoid measuring errors by spooning the flour into a measuring cup and leveling it with the edge of a dull knife.
Salt
You can use sea salt, but if you don’t have it table salt will do.
Vinegar
The recipe requires apple cider vinegar. You can also use other kinds of vinegar to help create a better texture in no-knead bread recipes.
Water
The master dough needs water that is warm enough to activate yeast, but not so hot that it kills it.
If using a thermometer, the water must be 115 F or warm to the inside of your wrist. Use water that is free from chlorine or other contaminants because this can affect baking.
Yeast
Use active dry yeast or instant yeast. Store the yeast in the fridge to help prolong its shelf life.
Follow this recipe to make artisan bread at home.
Preparation:
Try these baking tips the next time you want to bake bread:
Banneton bowl alternatives
If you don’t have a proofing bowl, use a clean bowl that is made of ceramic, glass or stainless steel instead. You can also use a small wicker basket or a colander.
Expect the dough to be very wet
Remember that the dough will be wet. Since the recipe is for a wet dough, don’t keep adding flour to make the loaf form.
This “free-form” loaf of bread is no-knead and it needs to be wet for the gluten to form properly.
Use flour for easy baking
Keep the wet dough from sticking to your hands, tools and work surface by sprinkling flour before you get started.
You don’t need to use too much dough, but a well-coated surface will make it easier to work the dough.
Use a cookie sheet if you don’t have a Dutch oven
If you don’t own a Dutch oven, use a cookie sheet for the bread. Cover the sheet with parchment paper.
Place a metal broiling pan in the oven on the lowest rack and preheat it and the cookie sheet to 450 F. Place the loaf in the oven and quickly pour a cup of hot water into the broiler pan. Shut the oven and bake for 45 minutes.
Wait before you slice
It can be tempting to slice the bread the minute you take it out of the oven, but waiting is worth it.
Wait at least 20 minutes before slicing into the loaf because slicing into a hot loaf means you will end up with a gummy center that will seem underbaked.
Use butter for a softer crust
If you don’t like bread with a crunchy crust, immediately brush the loaf with butter the second it comes out of the oven.
The butter helps soften the crust just a bit so it’s not too crunchy.
Use linens bags to keep bread fresh longer
If you have leftover artisan bread, store it in a linen bread bag.
You can also use plastic wrap or a Ziploc bag, but using a linen bread bag helps homemade bread last for up to six days before drying out. By day four, the bread will be a bit drier, but it’s still easy to slice and soft on the inside.
Linen bread bags can also be used to store dinner rolls, homemade biscuits and English muffins. Note that if you have softer, crusted bread, like sandwich bread or homemade rolls, it will dry out after one or two days.
Linen is better than cotton for bread storage because the former is stronger than cotton so it will last longer in your kitchen.

Familiarizing yourself with home gardening basics means improving your skill set so you can eventually start crops that are beyond those that beginners are planting.
If you’re not sure where to start, try learning how to start tomatoes from seed.
Starting tomato plants from seed offers several benefits. First, it gives you an early start to enable a longer harvest. It can also help prevent diseases, which means you make the most of your plants in the garden.
Knowing how to start tomatoes from seed can help you save on groceries, especially since prices are steadily increasing store prices. If you know how to start tomatoes from seed, you no longer have to spend money on garden shop tomato plants. (Related: Home gardening 101: 5 Secrets for growing great tomatoes.)

The most important step is to get the right seeds for starting.
Ideally, you should have a steady supply of tomato seeds from previous harvests. If you are new to seed starting, try new varieties.
Here are some options to consider:
Tomatoes that are beginner-friendly
If this is your first time growing tomatoes, you may want to grow a variety that’s large, delicious and produces a large harvest.
Tomatoes for fresh eating
Cherry tomatoes are an ideal choice if you like eating fresh tomatoes. They can also be used to make sauces with a hint of sweetness.
Low-acid or yellow tomatoes
If you do not eat raw tomatoes, you should consider low-acid or yellow tomatoes.
For example, Lemon Boy tomatoes grow quite large. They also ripen early and are great for tomato sauce.
Amana Orange grows larger than Lemon Boy tomatoes. As an heirloom variety, you can save Amana Orange seeds to plant by next spring.
Sweet tomatoes
Sweet tomatoes are perfect if your priority is taste.
Some large varieties are also rather sweet, such as:
Tomatoes for sauces
If your family loves pasta, choose tomatoes that are suited for pasta sauces like:
Sunrise Sauce is an orange, low-acid paste tomato. It is very productive and has a long shelf life. You can store it on your counter from September to November without it going bad.
Oxheart tomatoes are also great for sauces and they grow very big. These barely have any seeds and are so satisfying to grow for pasta sauces.
If you want to try paste tomatoes, experiment with San Marzano Gigante. Note that if you are in an area with a shorter season, you may experience some drawbacks.
The days to harvest San Marzano varieties is 90. If you consider the frost-free days in your area you might have trouble growing them.
But if you have a microclimate with temperatures that are at least 20 degrees warmer, you might be able to grow San Marzano tomatoes.
To start, calculate 90 days from the normal transplanting date of June. You will end up with Sept. 1, meaning you don’t have a lot of time to bring in a crop.
If this is an issue, choose a smaller San Marzano variety that matures at least two to three weeks sooner.
If you want bigger San Marzano tomatoes, you can try extending the harvest by starting your seeds early. This means starting tomato seeds six to eight weeks before you transplant them into your garden.
Based on the calculated dates, you should start the seeds from April 1 to 15.
For large, leafy plants with well-developed roots, you should start the tomato seeds as early as Feb. 1 to 15.
To start tomato seeds, use peat pellets. These pellets hold the right amount of water, which can ensure that your starters do well.
If you don’t have peat pellets or a special seed starting mix from the garden shop, you can stick with sterilized soil from your garden. Always pasteurize pots before planting to avoid introducing diseases to plants that are already established in your home garden.
Before finalizing how many seeds you want to start, add some extras if you want to give away plants to family and friends or if you plan to sell them for extra money.
Remember that tomatoes germinate best at temperatures of 70 to 80 F, which is warmer than most people keep their homes in winter. If you’re worried, check which areas of your house have a warm spot for starting seeds.
Gardeners often keep germinating seeds in warm areas like the top of the refrigerator. If this isn’t applicable to you, keep your starter seeds on the mantle above a wood stove insert if you have one.
If you can’t find a warm place for germinating seeds indoors, you may need a heat mat for seedlings.
Take notes so you don’t miss the timing for your seeds. The first set of leaves usually emerges after seven to 10 days.
True leaves will start developing several days later. By then, the seedlings will need to be placed under grow lights or in a very sunny window in your home.
If your windows don’t get enough sun in the winter for growing, use LED grow lights.
Try to keep the plants about two inches under the lights for maximum light coverage and some heat from the lights. Keep the lights on for 12 to 16 hours daily and water as needed.
When the plants grow two sets of true leaves, transplant them into a larger container. You can use milk cartons or washed pint-sized sour cream containers for the first transplanting. Get quart-sized yogurt containers for the second transplanting.
Try not to touch the main stem of tomato seedlings since they have juicy tissues that are easily bruised. Bruises in the stems will act as entry points for fungi that cause seedlings to rot.
The main stem can also be damaged if a seedling falls over, which can happen if you have a weak-stemmed tomato seedling that develops into a top-heavy seedling with new leaves. Prevent this by sprinkling additional seed starting mix around the base of leggy seedlings, then press it in.
Add support for the seedlings until you can repot them by propping up leaners with toothpicks or a wooden skewer.
When transplanting, try to use taller containers instead of wider ones so you can send the roots deep. Whenever you transplant, add a shallow layer of soil on the bottom to cushion the roots.
For the first transplanting, remove the first leaves (cotyledons) carefully. Do not strip the leaf down the stem and avoid taking some of the stem with it.
Tomatoes are unique because their stems have little hairs emanating from the stem that can develop into roots.
Set the tomato seedling on top of the thin layer of soil and carefully fill the soil around it. Water seedlings well and fertilize lightly weekly. You can repeat this step several times before the tomatoes are eventually planted in your garden.
Your tomatoes should also be hardened against strong winds. Like all plants, tomatoes need the wind to develop strong stalks. You can do this by gently brushing your hand over the tops of the tomato plants several times a day.
Follow all of these stops to produce large, lush tomato plants that cost less compared to buying them. Starting tomatoes from seeds means you will have plants that are healthier and free from diseases or pests.

Not many people love Brussels sprouts – they are an acquired taste, even for some adults.
But this vegetable offers many health benefits. And if you want to encourage your family to eat more veggies, try making delicious roasted Brussels sprouts.
Brussels sprouts belong to the cabbage family. They have many layers, with the outside layer acting as a shell.
The outer layer may be green, which is the most common color, or purple. Brussels sprouts can be cooked and served in a variety of ways.

To encourage your kids to eat more greens, cook Brussels sprouts fresh because they will have both a sweet and nutty taste.
Brussels sprouts contain no cholesterol. Half a cup (78 g) of cooked Brussels sprouts contains many vitamins and minerals, such as:
Brussels sprouts are low-calorie, but they’re a great source of dietary fiber. (Related: 5 Reasons to eat Brussels sprouts, a fiber-rich veggie.)
The vitamin C in Brussels sprouts can help boost your immune health. Foods like Brussels sprouts are also rich in beneficial antioxidants that can help prevent many health issues such as diabetes, certain cancers and heart disease.
Vitamin C is an antioxidant that promotes iron absorption. The vitamin also has a role in tissue repair and immune function.
Brussels sprouts are chock-full of dietary fiber that helps support regularity and gut health. According to research, dietary fiber can help treat constipation by increasing stool frequency and softening stool consistency to ease bowel movements.
Increased fiber intake is also linked to other health benefits, like a reduced risk of heart disease. Current guidelines suggest consuming 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories that you eat each day.
This means if you need 2,000 calories a day, you should consume at least 28 grams of fiber.
Brussels sprouts can also boost your blood health because it contains vitamin K. You need vitamin K for blood clotting and bone health.

Being frugal is an important prepper skill, especially if you want to be more self-sufficient and save money on rising food prices.
Starting a home garden can help if you want to cut food costs. But if you don’t have enough space for a garden, you can still feed your family nutritious food by growing greens and microgreens indoors.
With the right techniques and tools, you can grow and harvest greens and microgreens even in winter.
Growing salad greens is easier compared to growing microgreens. If you have a home garden or an indoor garden, you may already have the equipment you need.

The ideal location for indoor greens is a bright, south-facing window. If you live in a colder area, it might be better to use grow lights.
Note that the winter sun’s light is usually weaker than during summertime because of the Earth’s rotation and tilt of its axis. When planting greens in winter, when the tilt puts your windows further from the sun, the light coming through them is weaker.
The winter cold will also affect plants by a window so you can help your greens by using grow lights and a heat mat.
If you’re using grow lights, place them in an upstairs bedroom since heat rises.
If you don’t have grow lights, you can use cheap fluorescent shop lights instead. Suspend fluorescent lights on chains and S-hooks from the ceiling of the designated spot.
You don’t need the very intense lighting systems that hydroponic growers use. Unlike hydroponically grown plants, vegetable and herb seedlings live indoors for only several weeks and regular fluorescent lights will meet their needs.
After the seedlings are up and growing, you can gradually expose them to more sunlight in a window to prepare them for life in the garden. (Related: Sprouts vs. microgreens: Is one healthier than the other?)
Make sure the light for your indoor greens is less than two inches from the tops of plants. Some seedlings grow faster than others so raise any of the slower growers by placing them on top of boxes so they can get closer to the light they need to grow.
Get trays or pots with proper drainage, potting soil or other growing media. Fill the containers with a mixture of half soilless sterile potting soil suitable for seeds and half compost. If you want to save time, you can also use an all-purpose potting mix.
Push the potting mix into corners to fill the containers. Well-filled trays mean more soil for the roots to explore, and this is key for stronger plants.
Shake and tap the container to level and settle the potting mix after the trays are filled.
Lastly, get the seeds for your preferred greens. Once the seeds are planted, water them and make sure they get 12 to 14 hours of light every day. Within 30 to 60 days, your salad greens should be ready for harvesting.
Not sure what greens to plant? Here are some nutritious vegetables to choose from:
Asian greens, arugula and mustard
Mizuna is an Asian green that’s best for salads since it has a contrasting feathery texture, a mild peppery tang and various nutrients. Mizuna is great in stir-fries.
Arugula is a delicious leafy green if you prefer something peppery.
Mustard has a complementary warming flavor with colorful leaves for eye-catching salads.
Iceberg lettuce
Iceberg or crisphead lettuce forms a dense head of lettuce that looks like cabbage. Iceberg is the most popular variety of lettuce bought from the market and it has a refreshing crunchy texture with a sweet, mild flavor.
Leaf lettuce
Leaf lettuce comes in either green or red varieties that are often used for sandwiches, salads and wraps.
Mache
Mache, also called corn salad or lamb’s lettuce, is another mild leaf that’s very prolific. Once you grow mache, you can enjoy lots of leaves for winter salads.
Mesclun
If you want seeds for winter planting, try a fast-growing mesclun or braising mixes (stir-fry mixes).
Scatter the seeds thickly across the soil surface, cover them with a bit of compost and water them well.
Pea shoots
Hardy varieties of pea shoots produce leaves with a sweet and fresh pea taste. Pea shoots are best for salads, but you can also use them as a garnish on soups.
Once the shoots are eight to 10 inches tall, harvest the top few inches so you can keep harvesting.
Romaine lettuce
Romaine lettuce is known for its long, broad leaves around compact hearts. This lettuce is sweet with a crisp texture.
The outer leaves of romaine lettuce are often used as wraps instead of bread.
Winter lettuce
Oak-leaf lettuce and various leaf lettuces are a great base for salads.
Winter lettuce is also a great choice if you want to continue harvesting as you remove a few leaves every week and extend production over a longer period.
Winter purslane
Winter purslane or miner’s lettuce of Claytonia is a very hardy winter green with lush, almost juicy leaves with a smooth, mild taste.
Don’t let their size fool you. Microgreens are very tiny but they are packed with nutrients. If you know how to grow them, you’ll have fresh greens for soups and salads year-round.
A microgreen is the cotyledon and first true leaves of a plant. They’re usually cut at 1″ to 1 1/2″ high and you won’t be able to save the seed from them.
Microgreens are different from sprouts, which are germinated seeds that are produced almost entirely in water. You can add sprouts to your diet and like microgreens, are a great way to use up old seeds.
Microgreens are full of beneficial antioxidants. They also contain nutrients like carbohydrates, fiber, protein and various vitamins and minerals like magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc and vitamins B and C.
You need soil or peat moss, coco coir or seed mats to grow microgreens. You don’t need a deep space like a nursery pot because microgreens won’t develop deep roots. Instead, get a shallow tray that drains well.
To save money, wash food containers instead of buying trays for your microgreens. If using a food container, carefully add drainage holes. Drainage helps prevent mold from developing.
First, prepare the nursery flats or trays, soak the seeds and seed them. Water the seeds, give them plenty of light and keep them warm.
Seed them heavily so you have more greens. Crowding won’t be an issue since you will harvest the greens long before then.
Covering the seeds with plastic or a humidity tent can speed up germination. Uncover the seeds the moment they break the soil.
You don’t have to grow microgreens to maturity and the greens can be ready to eat within 14 days.
If you consume a lot of microgreens, try succession planting by planting one flat every week so you can harvest fresh greens one week at a time.
A variety of seeds can be used to grow microgreens, such as:
If you plan on using old excess seeds for this purpose, make sure you only use untreated seeds. Many seeds intended for garden use are treated with fungicides to inhibit damping-off disease and these aren’t good for growing microgreens.
When growing microgreens, you will need more seeds than what you would get in a standard garden seed packet. For example, you may need five grams or more of seeds to seed a flat of micro-greens.
To save money, buy microgreen seed packets or untreated extra seeds. Unless you have a lot of old seeds, buy seeds specific for growing microgreens instead of using garden seeds.
You should also avoid bird or wild animal seed partly because of how it has been packed and treated.
When growing microgreens follow the steps properly to avoid contamination risks, such as E. coli.
Some seed varieties are more susceptible than others and the risk increases the longer you store uneaten greens. There are several ways to prevent contamination when growing microgreens.
You can use commercial chlorinated packets or rinse the plants frequently as they grow. Another option is to spray chlorinated water from the tap before eating.
Note that the shelf life of microgreens is 10 to 14 days after harvest. If several days have passed and your microgreens are starting to look rather unusual, don’t eat them so you don’t get sick.
Once you start producing greens or microgreens, use them to make tasty salads, soups or sandwiches.

https://food.news/2022-12-06-heres-what-happens-go-on-keto-diet.html,Here’s what happens when you go on a keto diet for a week,"Advertisement
Dieting can be hard, especially if you are used to drinking sugary beverages and eating a lot of junk food. But trying something like the keto diet offers many health benefits, from helping promote weight loss to boosting your overall health.
If you have a busy schedule but are interested in going keto, the tips detailed below can help.
“Going keto” means regularly putting your body into a state of ketosis, where your liver produces ketone bodies from fat and burns those ketones for fuel.

Ketosis happens when the body doesn’t have the insulin supply to convert carbs into energy. Instead, it uses ketones.
Ketones are produced during a process called ketogenesis, which occurs when your body breaks fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids into ketones.
You can trigger ketosis by limiting your carbohydrate intake and fasting intermittently. Both methods work well together, but if you need a little help going keto, you can also try using ketone ester powder.
A ketone ester powder will help raise ketone levels in your blood to help put the body into a state of ketosis.
But once you’re on the diet, don’t get discouraged if you don’t see results right away. The diet affects people differently and what works for others might not always work for you. (Related: 5 Tips for a successful keto diet.)
The most popular choice for intermittent fasting is known as 16:8 fasting, which involves 16 hours of fasting with an eight-hour eating window. You can also try a 12-hour eating window if that works better for you.
You may encounter some issues, like not finding certain meals satiating or having trouble when dining out. The best way to avoid these issues is to plan ahead. Using ketone ester powder also ensures that your body gets its daily ketosis boost.
To avoid feeling deprived, look up tasty keto recipes that will help you feel full. If you love burgers, look for a keto-friendly alternative and try the recipe.
Start with a healthy breakfast, make a keto-friendly lunch and end the day with a nice dinner.
If you crave a midnight snack, eat some dark chocolate, a hard-boiled egg or half an avocado.
You can also start your day with a refreshing keto smoothie made with fatty ingredients like full-fat coconut milk, almond butter and avocado.
Within your preferred eating window, indulge in high-fat snacks like cottage cheese and raw nuts.
To reap all the benefits of ketosis, make sure you also use ketone ester powder. According to studies, ketosis is linked to stable blood sugar levels, lower triglyceride levels and cognitive health.
Add ketone ester powder to a glass of water and the juice of half a lemon to make it easier to drink.
If you are occasionally tempted to indulge in carb-heavy foods like fresh bread or pancakes, don’t get discouraged. Try again the next day and add a second scoop of ketone ester powder to your keto breakfast smoothie to help turn your off days back on.
After going keto for one week, you may experience benefits such as less sporadic energy levels.
Since ketone bodies are a fantastic fuel source for the brain, your focus can also improve.
These recipes may be keto-friendly, but they’re nutritious and flavorful.

https://food.news/2022-12-06-food-allergies-symptoms-allergens-testing-nutrition-tips.html,"Food allergies: Symptoms, allergens, testing and nutrition tips","Advertisement
An allergy occurs when your body reacts to a substance as if it were toxic. To date, experts still don’t know what causes food allergies, or why more people have them now compared to 30 years ago.
If you think you may have food allergies, get tested, learn to recognize symptoms of an allergy and avoid your food triggers.
In America, recognized food allergies affect at least 7.6 percent of children and 10.8 percent of adults. Unfortunately, some people with food allergies either don’t know they have them or haven’t reported them. This means the exact number of people suffering from some degree of allergic reaction to otherwise perfectly safe foods is probably higher.

Allergies aren’t just annoying. In some cases, they can even be potentially life-threatening.
A food allergy is an immune response to a specific protein in food. To qualify as an allergen, the food must be normally harmless for most people.
In short, an allergy occurs when your immune system overreacts and rejects substances that otherwise would not be a problem.
When you eat a food that you are allergic to, your immune system produces antibodies to surround, neutralize, destroy and eliminate the allergen. This reaction is usually a good thing because it helps protect you from a cold or an infection.
The antibodies then travel to cells that release various chemicals that cause allergic symptoms. These symptoms often occur in your nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, stomach lining or skin.
Allergies that may be immediately life-threatening often manifest within minutes of eating your trigger food or allergen.
There are two basic allergy pathways: One that acts quickly involves an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). The non-IgE pathway can take at least several hours or even longer to happen.
Allergies are different from food sensitivities and intolerances. Food sensitivities usually trigger a subtle immune response, like fatigue, joint pain and rashes. Meanwhile, food intolerance tends to be exclusively gastrointestinal in nature.
A major allergic reaction may cause a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis.
In America, at least one in 50 people experience anaphylaxis from food and other causes. Food allergy symptoms usually occur within five to 30 minutes, or sometimes even up to one hour, of coming into contact with the allergen.
Food allergy symptoms can include:
Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency, but it can be treated with an epinephrine autoinjector (e.g., an EpiPen) until you can reach emergency medical care.
Not all allergic reactions are severe. Non-anaphylactic reactions may include:
Food allergies can affect both children and adults, although they are more common in children.
Sometimes, people can outgrow childhood food allergies, like eggs or cow’s milk. However, other food allergies persist through adulthood, such as those triggered by fish, peanut, tree nut and shellfish allergies.
Some adults can also develop new allergies throughout their lives.
Since an allergy is an overreaction of your immune system, almost any kind of food could trigger an allergic response.
These foods are responsible for 90 percent of allergic reactions in the U.S. and the U.K.:
In 2021, American immunologists added a new food to the list of major food allergens. On April 23, 2021, the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act was signed into law. It declared sesame as the ninth major food allergen recognized by the government.
To give food manufacturers time to comply with the new labeling requirements, the change will take effect on January 1, 2023.
If you’ve had an allergic reaction to food or if you think you may have a food allergy, consult an allergist to help confirm your condition. They can help you devise a treatment plan and teach you what to do in case of anaphylaxis. (Related: Got an egg allergy? Iron treatment may help, says research.)
Allergists often start with a skin prick test where they take a small amount of extract made from the suspected allergenic food and place it directly on your skin, like your back or arm. If a raised bump or small hive develops within 20 minutes, you may have a food allergy.
Since a skin prick test often has a high false positive rate, it is mainly used to rule foods out. The results will then be used to form a list of possible allergens to investigate further.
While researchers have yet to fully understand what causes allergies, one popular theory on what causes food allergies is the “hygiene hypothesis.” According to this theory, growing up in very clean and “antibacterial” environments can make it hard for your immune system to find out what’s harmful and what’s not.
Data supports this theory, especially since children growing up in larger households have a lower incidence of allergic disease compared to children from smaller families.
Environmental exposures early in life, like growing up on a farm and living with companion animals, are also linked to a diverse bacterial experience and reduced risk of allergic sensitization. Children who live with pets like cats and dogs when they are infants are also less likely to develop allergies as they get older. (Related: Prevent asthma by cleaning less: Increased exposure to allergens and pet dander actually reduces risk.)
While some people can outgrow food allergies by adulthood, there’s no known cure for food allergies.
Fortunately, if you have food allergies you can make lifestyle changes to diminish their impact on your daily life. The most important one is to avoid the foods you’re allergic to. Even if it’s a healthy food that is usually recommended as part of a balanced diet, look for safer alternatives.
Always check food labels
When buying groceries, you should always read food labels carefully, especially when buying something you have never tried before. Common food allergens like eggs, nuts and soy are very prevalent in the industrialized food supply.
Processed foods are also a common cause of allergies because they contain many food additives. Processed items tend to include hidden proteins from eggs, milk and soybeans to enhance flavor and increase the protein content.
Foods like dips and sauces often contain peanuts or tree nut products for texture and flavor.
Be careful when ordering food at restaurants
While it’s possible to eat out if you have food allergies, you need to be more careful.
Always let the restaurant staff know about your allergies. Ask if the food you want to eat contains food triggers.
Always bring your allergy meds
Even if you’re very careful when buying groceries or dining out, it’s better to always have your allergy meds with you in case of an emergency.
You can also try safer natural alternatives like herbs or a saline spray.
Increase your intake of dietary fiber
If you have food allergies, it’s important to give your immune system its best chance to stay balanced and responsive. You can do this by eating a lot of whole foods and avoiding processed foods.
A fiber-rich plant-based diet can’t cure food allergies, but it may offer some benefits. Not getting enough dietary fiber may play a role in the development of food allergies.
Introducing more fiber in your diet may also help with symptoms of allergic reactions. Research suggests that a high-fiber diet had a significant impact on gut bacteria, immune system cells and allergic reactions to food compared to a low-fiber diet.
Fruits and veggies contain their own type of fiber. Consuming lots of fiber and different kinds of fruits and veggies keeps “good” or beneficial bacteria in your gut healthy, which then helps keep the lining of your gut intact. This can help lower the risk of allergic reactions to food.
Fruits and vegetables also contain beneficial antioxidants that help your microbiome thrive.
Allergic conditions are characterized by inflammation and antioxidants help protect against inflammation triggers. Data from epidemiological studies have found that the greater the amount of antioxidants in the diet, the less frequent and severe the symptoms of allergic reactions.
Choose healthy allergen alternatives
After confirming your food triggers, use healthy alternatives to ensure that you get the nutrients you need to stay healthy.
If you are allergic to tree nuts, try seeds. If dairy products are an issue, eat plant-based alternatives to cheese and milk.
Food allergies can cause minor and severe symptoms so it’s best to confirm your trigger foods. Avoid these allergens and use healthy allergen alternatives to keep your symptoms in check.

If you’re a busy prepper, knowing quick and easy recipes can help you cut down on meal prep time.
Try this recipe for juicy baked chicken breast which goes great with beans or baked potatoes. (h/t to FoodStorageMoms.com)
Chicken, which is naturally lean, is a great protein source that you can use if you’re trying to keep your family healthy by limiting red meat. However, since chicken is lean you need to cook it the right way so it doesn’t turn up dry.

This is why you need a meat thermometer. This tool will help you check if the chicken is cooked properly because it varies in size, from four ounces to a whopping 10 ounces.
With the price of meat these days, you’d want to get the most bang for your buck. It’s best to buy boneless chicken breasts because they are all meat and have no bone.
While the chicken breast is baking, you have enough time to prepare coleslaw, a tossed salad or open a can or two of green beans as a side dish.
You will need:
Ingredients for 6 servings:
Preparation:
Proper baking times for baked chicken breast
You can bake boneless chicken breasts at 400 F (177 C). Note that cooking them at higher temperatures will help seal the juices in the meat.
Times will vary based on the weight of each chicken breast, so using a meat thermometer is highly recommended. The internal temperature of properly baked chicken breast should be 165 F.
Bake chicken breasts at 400 F for 22 to 26 minutes, but this will vary depending on the weight of the chicken breast that you have.
Alternatively, you can cook chicken breasts at 350 F (176 C) for about 25 to 30 minutes, again depending on the weight of the chicken breast.
Food storage and safety tips
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug (FDA) both recommend storing raw chicken breasts, legs, or a whole chicken in the refrigerator for one to two days. This means regardless of the size, you should only store raw chicken for a maximum of one to two days in the fridge.
Cooked chicken should be stored in airtight containers or food storage bags for three to four days, according to the USDA and the FDA.
To extend the shelf life of cooked chicken breasts, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, an airtight container, or a freezer bag. The frozen cooked chicken breast will last for about three to six months in the freezer.
Baked chicken breast goes well with mashed potatoes and gravy, but you should also try healthier side dishes like beans or a tossed salad.
If you have some leftovers, slice the chicken and use the meat to make chicken sandwiches. Serve the chicken sandwiches with some BBQ sauce or other tasty condiments and homemade fries.
Add more greens to your dinner by serving the baked chicken breasts sliced or cubed and added to a fresh salad. Add your favorite salad dressing and let your family enjoy a nutritious and tasty meal. (Related: 6 Easy homemade salad dressing recipes.)
Chicken also goes well with plain rice and your favorite toppings like herbs and various sauces.

Your survival stockpile is a crucial part of your emergency preparedness plans, especially if you want to stock up on enough food, water and other supplies for your family.
Make the most of your basement or a spare room by turning it into a root cellar for food storage. (h/t to ReadyNutrition.com)
A root cellar is a storage location that uses the natural cooling, insulating and humidifying properties of the earth to store food. You can store fruits and vegetables from your home garden or the local farmers’ market in a root cellar, especially if your area frequently experiences power outages.

Before refrigeration, preppers used an underground root cellar to effectively store beets, carrots, onions, parsnips, potatoes, turnips, and other root vegetables that they grew in their gardens.
Now, root cellars are making a comeback among modern preppers because they can prevent food from freezing during the winter. Root cellars can also keep food cool during the summer, which prevents spoilage.
You can also use a root cellar to store jars of canned or pickled vegetables, canned meats and the bulbs or rhizomes of perennial flowers for your garden. Additionally, a root cellar can be used to store wine, beer, or other homemade alcoholic beverages. (Related: Upcycling for preppers: How to turn a broken freezer into a mini root cellar.)
If you want your root cellar to work properly, it must be able to hold a temperature of 32 to 40 F (0 to 4.5 C) and a humidity level of 85 to 95 percent. Unfortunately, this means you may need to look at other options if you are in a warm, southern climate since the root cellar may not work properly.
If you already have a dark underground area on your homestead, your work is almost over. If you don’t, you need to build your root cellar in a location away from places with a high water table or a septic system.
Look for a close and easily accessible location. If your area experiences harsh winters, build your root cellar under a garden shed so you don’t have to remove snow to access it once winter comes.
If you are building the root cellar yourself, the best method is to use the foundation walls on the northeast corner of the site as the two sides of the root cellar. Then, build the other two walls in the basement with stud and board.
You need to insulate the interior walls, ceiling and door along with any pipes or ducts to keep the heat out. The root cellar will also need a ventilation system that allows cool, fresh air from the outside to be brought into the room so stale air can be exhausted. This will help prevent mold and mildew.
If you already have a crawlspace, consider using it for a root cellar. The concrete foundation will provide the “walls” for the structure.
Use what you have and if you don’t have ideal space, dig horizontally into the side of a hill on your homestead.
If you want to dig in your root cellar, do so in an area with good drainage. Sandier soil works better and having an elevated slope helps because the water will run away from the pit as it moves downward.
If your winter temperatures drop below 25 F (-4 C), dig the pit deep enough so that all the crops are under the soil’s surface. Sometimes, this can be too much for produce, especially during the cold winter months.
If you don’t have a basement or extra space on your homestead, you can also use a clean metal garbage can to build a DIY root cellar.
First, buy a metal garbage can at a local hardware store or at a big box store like Home Depot. A metal garbage can with a lid is ideal, as it will help eliminate water and keep your vegetables from getting wet.
Next, dig a hole slightly larger than the diameter of the garbage can. The hole should be deep enough so that the can’s lid will be four inches above the soil level. Backfill dirt around the garbage can.
Add straw inside the can as you place the crops. Cover the lid with straw or mulch and a sheet of plastic to keep everything dry.
Here are other options to consider if you’re looking to build a root cellar on your homestead:
Even if you only have a garbage can root cellar, root vegetables will store well in this environment, even during the coldest weather. Note that some vegetables like onions have to be “cured” before you store them in your root cellar.
Before storing onions in your root cellar, cure them in warmer temperatures.
Before SHTF, find out what kind of root cellar will suit your prepping needs. If you only have space for a small root cellar on your homestead, it’s still worth it to store excess crops from your home garden so you have more food when winter comes.
Watch the video below for tips on how to make a mini root cellar for potatoes out of a broken freezer.

Many preppers who want to be self-sufficient start a home garden so they can grow fresh, organic fruits and vegetables for their family. If you have excess crops, you can also preserve fruits and veggies for your survival stockpile.
But if you want to make the most of your garden crops, think of the gardening calories resulting from your vegetable garden. This means carefully choosing which vegetables to grow and the number of calories that you will get from those vegetables. (h/t to ModernSurvivalBlog.com)

Another option is to plan on gardening to be a significant or exclusive source of calories together with other food sources, like raising other protein foods and livestock.
You need to plan ahead because what you grow in your garden may be the only thing you can eat when SHTF and you can no longer get more supplies at the grocery store.
Before disaster strikes, you need to learn how to maximize your caloric return for your time and effort when you’re growing a vegetable garden to feed your family without other ways to get more supplies.
When it comes to survival, preparedness and self-sufficiency, crops you harvest from your garden will need to produce calories. However, many vegetables are low and very low in calories.
Fortunately, there are some vegetables that contain more calories than others.
All caloric quantities in the vegetable list below have been normalized to 100 grams (3.5 ounces) to compare properly.
Note that some of the foods are not typically consumed in these amounts, but the results will let you know where they are when it comes to calories. Nutrition is not accounted for in this list.
The food calorie data for each item was determined based on the common method of consuming the item, like some vegetables are consumed raw while others are typically boiled or cooked a certain way.
Normalized to 100 grams (3.5 ounces):
Generally, vegetables are not very calorie dense. Some notable exceptions are corn and potatoes.
But if you want to maximize all the effort you put into your survival garden, you should prioritize calories to maximize the garden’s output based on the diversification of nutrition and the things that you like to eat. When SHTF, calories are going to be crucial when the whole family is in “survival mode.”
When disaster strikes, you should plan ahead so you have other food sources aside from your home garden. You can also start growing fruit trees and bushes or shrubs.
If you have the space to do so, raise animals like chickens, goats or pigs.
You also need to account for failure, which is a normal part of prepping. Learn from your mistakes and try to control what you can control.
If you like eating low-calorie but nutritious vegetables like juicy tomatoes, you can still grow them in your home garden.
However, when it’s time to start planting, dedicate most of your time and effort on high-calorie crops that will help you feel full longer, like beans and potatoes.
For example, if you have excess crops of regular potatoes, you can process or home can them or leave them in cool, dry and dark storage. (Related: Food storage tips: How to dehydrate foods for long-term storage.)

https://food.news/2022-12-01-millet-superfood-packed-with-protein-fiber.html,"Here’s why you should eat more millet, a superfood packed with protein and fiber","Advertisement
Millet is technically a seed, but its properties are similar to whole grain.
This ancient grain may not be as popular as oatmeal or quinoa, but this corn-like seed grain is a great source of fiber.
If you’re looking for an alternative to brown rice and oatmeal, try millet.
Millet is a type of cereal grass from the Poaceae family.
While millet is also commonly found in bird food, it is also a nutritious grain for the human diet. In fact, many countries worldwide consider millet a diet staple.

Most of the millet you can find in grocery stores today is grown in countries like China, India and Niger.
Millet is a naturally gluten-free grain that looks similar to a corn kernel. It has a relatively mild flavor with slight notes of a sweet, corn-like flavor. Its texture is fluffy like couscous and a bit denser than quinoa.
Millet doesn’t alter the flavor of most recipes, making it a versatile ingredient that you can easily incorporate into different recipes. It’s also a great option if you’re looking for a more affordable grain to add to your meal plan.
Like other whole grains, millet has an amazing nutritional profile.
One cup of cooked millet contains six grams of protein and two grams of dietary fiber.
Millet is also rich in folate, B vitamins and minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and phosphorus. The combination of fiber and protein promotes healthy digestion since the insoluble fiber content acts as a prebiotic, which feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut microbiome.
In a review published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, scientists observed a link between eating millet and higher levels of hemoglobin, the iron-rich protein that carries oxygen throughout your body. Results showed that regularly eating millet may help reduce iron deficiency anemia, a condition linked to at least 50 percent of anemia cases worldwide.
Unlike other grains, millet is a relatively low-glycemic food. Earlier studies suggest that millet may be a helpful food for supporting healthy blood sugar levels.
And that’s not all. Millet even offers environmental benefits.
Millet is known to have a low carbon footprint because it doesn’t need much water compared to other crops and it grows well even at high temperatures.
Millet and quinoa are both impressive superfoods, but the two have certain differences and similarities.
Quinoa has all nine essential acids, making it a complete protein. Meanwhile, millet has to be paired with another grain or seed like chia or flaxseed to be a complete protein.
As for the pH of these grains, quinoa is acidic and millet is alkaline. This means millet is a better choice if you have a sensitive stomach since it is easier to digest.
Millet and quinoa also have some similarities. Both are naturally gluten-free and are considered whole grains.
Because both quinoa and millet have prebiotic properties, they can help boost your gut health.
Millet is a versatile superfood. Like rice or quinoa, millet is a nutritious carb or grain option to round out your meals.
Millet flour
Millet flour can’t be used as a substitute for all-purpose flour, but it can be a great addition to recipes if you want to boost your fiber and protein intake. To make the flour, grind up millet.
This nutritious, gluten-free flour can be used to make your favorite bread and baked goods.
Using millet
Boiling is the best method if you want to prepare millet on its own.
The common ratio of liquid to millet is 2:1 cups. When hydrated and cooked, millet can triple in size and take on a soft, fluffy texture.
Cooked millet can be added to salads, soups, or chilis. It can also be served as a side dish.
Try these recipes to make millet flour and bread.

https://food.news/2022-11-30-home-gardening-tips-grow-onions-from-seed.html,Home gardening tips: How to grow onions from seed,"Advertisement
Instead of buying onions every time you’re at the grocery, learn how to grow them from seed so you can just harvest onions from your backyard whenever you need them.
If you have excess crops, you can sell them or make preserved onions for your stockpile to consume throughout the year.
Compared to other vegetables and herbs, onions are usually very low-maintenance once planted. If you plant the right varieties, you can store onions for up to 12 months.
When growing onions, especially if you want to grow enough for your family for at least one year, you need to start by choosing the right type of onion for your growing zone.

Narrow your choices down by finding out the types of onions that are good for long-term storage. You can also grow onions that aren’t good for long-term storage, but you should use those onions first.
There are short-day, day-neutral and long-day onions. Onion cultivars are grouped according to the number of daylight hours or day length required to trigger the beginning of bulb development.
Onion varieties you can grow include:
You can try planting either pelleted or regular seeds, but loose seeds may germinate faster than the pelleted variety. While there is nothing wrong with pelleted seeds, you pay more for them per seed and they take longer to germinate.
Onions usually have a lower germination rate than other vegetables you may be seeding starting indoors. When starting onions you may want to over-sow, so you don’t have to wait too long when some of your seeds don’t sprout.
Follow the tips below to start onions indoors to plant in early spring.
Use sterile soil
Using sterile soil may seem counterproductive when you want to have a good variety of microorganisms, but if you are starting seeds it’s better to use sterile soil for two reasons:
Choose the right container
When growing onions, you need a container that’s a bit deeper than what you normally use for other vegetables for proper bulb formation.
Simply repurpose the plastic clamshell containers that lettuce comes in at the grocery store. These plastic containers make a great greenhouse while the seeds are sprouting, and they are deep enough that you don’t need to pot up the onions before it’s time to plant them in the garden.
Plant the seeds
Use your finger and drag it across the soil in a line about 1/4 inch deep and one inch apart.
Densely sow the onion seeds and cover them with just a sprinkling of soil. Thin them out later as needed.
Water the seeds
Use a spray bottle to water the soil until damp. Gently water the seeds so they don’t get moved around. The soil must be damp, not sopping or pooling.
Never let the top of the soil dry out during the germination phase. To prevent this, check the soil throughout the day and keep the seeds damp.
If you’re using a plastic clamshell container, you don’t need a grow light since you can keep the seeds in the kitchen where you can monitor them.
Use a grow light
Once the seeds have germinated or sprouted, move them under a grow light. The onions should start growing taller and they will look like tiny green onions.
When the onion tops grow to about six to eight inches tall, trim them down with scissors to about four inches. The tops will keep growing so continue trimming them.
The onion top trimmings can be used and eaten like green onions.
When it’s time to transplant the onions in the garden, it’s important to harden them off to prepare the plants for colder temperatures.
Onion sets can be planted outdoors about four to six weeks before the last frost date. This allows the bulbs to get about as big as the bulbs on onion sets that you buy from the store so you have extra growing time.
Direct-sowing onions
If you want to skip starting onions indoors, direct sow onion seeds once the soil temperature is 35 F.
Note that if you do this, your onions will take longer to grow than planting onion sets (which is what you will grow indoors). Additionally, your harvest may be closer to a fall harvest rather than an early to mid-summer harvest.
If you want to stock up on onions, learn how to plant, grow and harvest onions from seed.

Proper food prep and storage are crucial for your survival stockpile. These two prepping essentials can help ensure that you and your family have access to enough food and clean water if you have to bug in at home during a long-term survival scenario.
If you want to extend the shelf life of items in your survival stockpile, follow proper food prep techniques and use the right kind of food storage containers. (h/t to FoodStorageMoms.com)
If you live in an area prone to major natural disasters, it’s wise to stock up on food before SHTF and your food supply is disrupted.

If money is tight, try to always have at least a three-day supply of food for your family since it may take several days before your local grocery store can restock. If possible, you can stock up on enough food for at least a week or a month to cover all your bases.
Here are some suggestions on what to stock up on before disaster strikes:
Freeze-dried foods can be pricey, but if you have the budget for them they are great for your stockpile since they have a longer shelf life compared to dehydrated foods.
Here are some of the other benefits of freeze-dried foods:
When SHTF and utilities like water are disrupted, having foods that don’t require cooking, water or refrigeration means you can eat foods without any preparation.
Salty food can make you thirsty, which can be a problem if you don’t have a lot of water in your stockpile or if the water supply in your area is limited because of a disaster.
Having a variety of items that meet each of your family member’s dietary needs is crucial if you have a baby or if there are elderly family members living with you.
Before SHTF, plan ahead and think of different recipes that will use up all the items in your food supply so nothing goes to waste.
When buying food for your stockpile, consider what your family likes to eat and buy those items for storage. Stock up on canned goods like beans, fruits, veggies, meat, tuna and other items.
You should also stock up on healthy foods like grains, nuts and healthy snacks. And while following a balanced diet is important, when SHTF both children and adults will still enjoy occasional treats like candy, chocolate and other snacks that can help boost morale when things are hard.
If you have one or several pets at home like dogs or cats, make sure you also stock up on foods and supplies that they will need like pet food, some treats and water for drinking.
When storing food for your survival stockpile, you have several options. You can save time by buying dehydrated emergency foods stored in big buckets from some big box stores and online.
Alternatively, you can prepare and store your own food. This can help you save some money if you know how to do it properly.
Here are some things to remember when storing food in your survival stockpile:
Ideally, you should keep your food supply in a room that is dark, cool and dry, like a basement or root cellar. The ideal temperature would be between 40 F and 70 F.
If you don’t have a room like this, make the best of the space that is available to you.
Do a routine inspection and record the expiration date of items like dry packages and canned foods. Rotate the items in your stockpile before they expire and always replenish the things you consume so you don’t run out of anything when SHTF.
If there is homegrown food stored in your stockpile, they often have to be used up after a year.
Don’t leave food in its original paper cartons and boxes, especially if you have an insect or rodent problem at home.
If you’re on a tight budget, wrap paper cartons and boxes in sturdy material. Better yet, invest in airtight containers that are also waterproof.
Heat sources like refrigerator exhausts, heater vents, ranges and any other type of heat can make food age and spoil faster.
These chemical products include oil, gasoline and harmful solvents.
Note that certain foods can absorb the smell of these solvents and you don’t want your family members to accidentally eat any tainted food. (Related: Prepping skills: 15 Food storage and preservation methods to learn before SHTF.)
Invest in these sturdy food storage containers to protect your food supply from pests and insects and to extend their shelf life
Airtight containers are usually made from plastic and are available in different sizes.
Airtight containers can be used for storing both dry goods and liquids in your pantry and refrigerator.
Food-grade buckets are great for long-term food storage purposes. Some buckets also come with an oxygen absorber that helps maintain freshness.
Always buy “food grade” buckets and containers to avoid other containers that may contain harmful chemicals that could seep into your food supply.
Glass jars are ideal for either short- or long-term storage. The lids create an airtight seal and they are available in various sizes.
Glass jars can also be reused. However, you need to be careful with glass jars because they may break easily.
Mylar bags are often used for long-term storage because they can block air, moisture, light and odors. The bags are also very durable, so you don’t have to worry about any punctures or tears, especially if you get thicker bags.
Store Mylar bags in sturdy buckets because mice or rodents can chew through them.
A vacuum sealer is a machine primarily used for storing meats or fish, but you can also use one on dry goods and vegetables.
A vacuum sealer removes all the air from the packaging to extend the shelf life of food items. You can use a vacuum sealer on quart and pint jars when storing dry items.
When SHTF, you might lose electricity and it can be hard to cook for your family. Prepare for long-term power outages by making sure you can cook food without having to use electricity.
Stock up on these items so you can prepare and cook food even during a power outage:
Before SHTF you also need to have an emergency water supply.
The recommended amount is one gallon per person per day for at least three days, but if you have the means to do so increase it to four gallons. With four gallons per person, you should have enough clean water for drinking, cooking, doing the laundry and personal hygiene.
If you’re using water from a pond or river, boil, purify or filter it before using. The water should be boiled for one minute but if you are at altitudes above 6,562 feet, it should be boiled for three minutes.
Alternatively, water from a pond can be treated with purification tablets. Follow the instructions on the package.
You need water storage containers so you can stock up on water and keep it clean until you need it. When storing these containers, keep them away from direct sunlight.
Rotate the water every six months if you used unscented bleach to avoid contamination.
You can also collect rainwater in clean containers if you want to get more water for your supply. Get sturdy containers with covers to prevent contamination.
For efficient water storage, invest in 55-gallon plastic drum containers. If space is an issue, you can also store water in smaller five-gallon containers.
When storing water containers, keep them away from concrete by placing 2x4s on the floor or stacking them on pallets. This will protect the water from chemicals leeching from the concrete into the container and the water.
Prepare before disaster strikes and stock up on food and water for the whole family. Store your supplies in sturdy food-safe containers to extend their shelf life.

https://food.news/2022-11-09-7-health-benefits-eating-foods-omega-3s.html,7 Science-backed health benefits of eating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids,"Advertisement
Research suggests that omega-3s offer many health benefits, such as improving your heart health and boosting immunity.
Detailed below are seven amazing benefits of eating superfoods or taking supplements rich in omega-3s.
Omega-3 refers to a group of unsaturated fatty acids with a specific double bond in their chemical structure like alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).
According to Dr. Claire Thomas, a medical doctor and clinical content lead at Evergreen Life, omega-3s are called “essential fatty acids” since the human body is unable to produce them. You can only get omega-3s through your diet.

You can boost your intake of omega-3s by taking dietary supplements and eating animal or food sources, such as:
Animal sources
Plant sources:
Researchers have also been studying the potential health benefits of omega-3.
According to a study published in the journal Nutrients, these nutrients may be the key factor in reducing inflammation levels, a major risk factor for several chronic diseases. Data also suggests that omega-3 could be crucial to your cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems.
Thomas said that some studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3s may also offer benefits for health problems like rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory and degenerative joint conditions, along with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
Here are seven reasons to incorporate foods rich in omega-3s into your regular diet.
Data has found that omega-3s may be essential for the proper functioning of your central nervous system, especially the brain.
The results of a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Science revealed that omega-3s may help prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s.
Experts believe there are several reasons why omega-3s are good for the nervous system.
In an article in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, scientists reported that omega-3s are found in abundance in the brain cell membranes. They added that the compounds may affect how neurons communicate with each other.
In another review published in the journal Nutrients, data showed that DHA is one of the key components of healthy brain and eye development. The fatty acid may also have a crucial role in mental health throughout early childhood.
Data from the article revealed that low intake of omega-3 may increase the risk of developing conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder and depression.
Research suggests that people who regularly consume omega-3 are less likely to experience depression.
Many studies have been conducted to determine the benefits of omega-3s for cardiovascular health and many studies suggest that the compounds offer significant protective effects on the heart.
The results of a major Cochrane systematic review found that omega-3s may significantly reduce the risk of dying from coronary heart disease and cardiac events. It also showed that ALA may help prevent arrhythmia.
Omega-3 can boost your heart health in several ways. The compounds produce hormones that regulate blood clotting, the contraction and relaxation of artery walls and inflammation in the body. This can be beneficial for preventing heart disease as the compounds work to reduce plaque in the heart’s arteries.
Omega-3s may also improve the functioning of the endothelium, the thin membrane that lines the inside of your heart and blood vessels. According to a study from the journal Atherosclerosis, the compounds may help control how much fluid is carried with the blood, and how your blood vessels dilate and constrict.
Findings from research conducted on overweight patients with metabolic syndrome have revealed that the compounds may help balance blood lipids, particularly by reducing levels of LDL cholesterol or “bad” cholesterol.
Studies have also revealed that omega-3s may have another potential benefit: boosting your immune health.
Some studies suggest that omega-3s may affect the composition of your gut microbes. This can then have a positive impact on your gut health.
Because your digestive system is the first line of defense against harmful microbes, omega-3 may have an indirect but wide-ranging effect on your whole immune system.
In a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, researchers reported that omega-3s can stimulate the production of antibodies and regulate the functioning of white blood cells.
Omega-3 is a significant structural component of the retina so it’s no surprise that it also has a crucial role in eye health.
Your retina captures the light that enters your eye and translates it into the images you see. Without omega-3s, you may experience problems with your eyesight.
Omega-3 helps optimize “the variability of photoreceptor membranes, retinal thickness, function and provides a protective role.” Additionally, healthy levels of DHA can help prevent damage from bright light exposure and oxidative stress.
In research published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, scientists reported that omega-3s may help prevent neovascular eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Both conditions may cause blindness and they both lack treatment options that don’t have any negative side effects. (Related: Healthy skin, vision and mood: 3 Lesser-known benefits of taking omega-3 supplements.)
Omega-3s, especially EPA, can help promote healthier skin.
Getting enough EPA helps keep your skin moisturized and also reduces the risk and effects of acne.
As documented in a study published in the journal Clinics in Dermatology, the compounds may help improve skin hydration and balance out its oil production. Omega-3s can also help reduce the risk of premature aging.
Additionally, omega-3s may have a role in the effective management of inflammatory skin diseases.
In another study from the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, scientists discovered that the combined omega-3 and omega-6 supplementation was effective at treating symptoms of skin conditions like acne, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
In a review from the British Journal of Nutrition, researchers found that many studies suggest omega-3s may help improve bone mineral density and several bone turnover markers.
In a meta-analysis published in the journal Climacteric, results showed that omega-3 may specifically affect the levels of osteocalcin in postmenopausal women.
Osteocalcin is a protein hormone with a role in maintaining and regenerating bone tissue. This is crucial because postmenopausal women are at high risk of developing osteoporosis.
Experts also discovered that different sources of omega-3 may have a different effects on bone remodeling processes. Flaxseed oil may be better at improving bone structure and fish oil may help boost bone mineral density.
According to scientific data, the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 can help reduce pain intensity in many of the body’s joints. Research also suggests that the compounds can help improve joint pain in those with rheumatoid arthritis.
Omega-3s also form the support for prostaglandins, which regulate your immune system and protect against joint inflammation.
Lastly, studies have found that omega-3 may have a role in sleep regulation.
In one article published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, data found that those with higher regular intakes of omega-3s seem to need less sleep.
Omega-3s may also help improve sleep in infants since the compounds help organize and mature their sleep-wake routine without affecting total sleep duration or efficiency.
Eat foods rich in omega-3s or take omega-3 supplements to boost your overall well-being and improve heart health.

https://food.news/2022-11-09-12-food-preservation-and-storage-techniques-shtf.html,12 Food preservation and food storage techniques you can use when SHTF,"Advertisement
If you want to prepare for a long-term survival scenario or societal collapse, you have to plan ahead and stock up on survival essentials like food and water for your family.
To make things easier for yourself, you can start growing crops in your home garden. You can also learn different methods of preserving food so you have access to healthy fruits and vegetables even when they are not in season. (h/t to ModernSurvivalonline.com)
Proper food storage and preservation techniques help prolong the shelf life of various foods so you can add more supplies to your stockpile before SHTF.

If you are new to any of these methods, keep in mind that you must learn how to use them properly to avoid mistakes that can cause food poisoning.
Here are 12 food preservation and storage techniques you can use when SHTF:
When stocking up on liquids for your food stockpile, boiling is ideal because it can effectively kill any lurking microorganisms.
Boiling works the same as other heating methods. When you boil something, you push the temperature of various microorganisms like bacteria, parasites and other organisms past the point they can survive. This kills dangerous organisms and they cease to pose a risk to the integrity and safety of the liquid.
When SHTF, you can use a campfire, stove or other heat sources to achieve the sustained temperature required to boil liquids like water or milk. However, this method requires a lot of fuel, which might not be ideal if you want to conserve your resources.
Burying is a primitive but effective food storage method that involves digging a hole and burying food in the ground. This method works best when you use certain foods and certain kinds of soil.
Burying preserves food through a variety of mechanisms, specifically by depriving the bacteria that would eat the food of oxygen. The method also helps lower the ambient temperature, eliminates the light that reaches the food and sometimes lowers the pH level of the environment around the food. Burying food may also help draw moisture out of the food.
Note that the drier and saltier the soil, the more effective it will be. You can also bury containers of food in frozen soil.
Read up on different burying techniques for food preservation to make sure it suits the kind of food you want to bury. For example, root vegetables are perfect for burying because they are naturally resistant to spoilage under such conditions.
Canning is a common food storage method that is often used to preserve fruits and veggies. Canning can also be used to preserve meats and dairy products.
Canning food involves placing cooked or processed food in a sterilized jar that is then sealed. The jar of food is boiled to kill off bacteria that may already be present in the food.
If done properly, the food is stored in an environment where no bacteria can get in. Canning helps significantly extend the shelf life of food, even without refrigeration.
Chilling or cooling food helps decrease the rate of decomposition by slowing down the reproduction, growth and action of different microorganisms and the enzymes they produce that cause food spoilage.
While chilling may not be necessary if you have a large fridge and a freezer at home, this method can be used by those who live in cold climates. If you are one of those preppers, you can cool food by storing things in sturdy boxes to protect against animals.
Another option is to use a root cellar or icebox. When the grid goes down, you can cool food by harvesting ice and using an icebox for preservation even without electricity.
Confit is a method that hails from France and consists of slowly cooking food fully immersed in grease, oil, or syrup at a low temperature.
The food being preserved can also be immersed in its own rendered fat, like if you’re preserving meat. The food is then slowly heated to a relatively low temperature for a long period of time.
Once the food is done, if you’re not going to eat it right away it can be stored in its own cooled and congealed liquid.
Fruits can be turned into confit by cooking them whole or in pieces, especially when preparing larger fruit. Potatoes, tubers and other roots are also suitable for confits.
When meats are cooked in their own rendered fats at a very low temperature, you never go higher than 185 F. Confit-preserved foods can be canned, jarred, or jugged.
Freezing prevents decomposition by turning the moisture in food into ice. This helps stop the growth of almost all species of microorganisms that cause spoilage.
One of the biggest advantages of freezing is that you don’t need additional work or preservatives as long as the food remains frozen.
The food needs to reach a stable temperature of 15 F or lower to completely prevent typical bacteria from growing. This temperature also helps significantly extend the shelf life of food.
For extreme long-term storage, freeze the food at an even lower temperature. Note that this may not be practical if you don’t have access to the necessary refrigeration technology.
It’s best to freeze foods with a modest to low moisture content. These items can then be thawed before food prep with minimal loss of taste and texture.
While foods with a high moisture content or delicate consistency may not taste as good as fresh after freezing, they are still safe to eat.
Heating food helps kill microorganisms that cause spoilage by warming them to a temperature where they can’t survive. Note that after the food has cooled down or heat is no longer applied, bacteria can still continue to grow in the food. (Related: Food preservation 101: A step-by-step guide to air-drying fruits.)
Jellying means preserving food by cooking it with ingredients that solidify into a gel form. Gelatin is often used for jellying, but other common ingredients include agar, arrowroot flour and maize flour.
Animal-derived proteins that you can also use include those derived from eels and certain worms.
Jellying is often used in North America to make fruit preserves, jams and jellies. It is also used to make savory jellying preparations like tomato aspic.
While jellying meat or vegetables can still preserve foods at room temperature, they are often cooled via refrigeration or other chilling techniques for best results.
Lye preservation involves the use of lye and sodium hydroxide to change the pH balance of food. Since lye is extremely alkaline, food treated with lye is rendered too alkaline, preventing bacteria from growing.
This technique is used to make a famous traditional Norwegian dish called lutefisk, which literally translates to “lye fish.”
Similar but less radical methods are used to soften olives, Lye preservation is also used to give bagels and pretzels a glossy, crispy crust while baking.
Pickling is one of the most delicious methods of food storage. It involves preserving food in any liquid which inhibits or kills microbes that cause spoilage. It is used to make pickled cucumbers and pickled eggs.
Pickling is great for preppers because it doesn’t require expensive tools. There are two broad categories of pickling: chemical pickling and fermentation pickling.
Fermentation pickling works by hosting “good” bacteria in the liquid used to preserve the food. The bacteria produce an organic acid that acts as a preservation agent.
Fermentation pickling is used to make popular foods like kimchi and sauerkraut.
Chemical pickling uses an edible liquid agent like alcohol, salty brine, vegetable oils, or vinegar. This method used heating to ensure that the food in the liquid agent becomes completely saturated to help eliminate places bacteria could hide in.
Chemical pickling is used to preserve foods like cucumbers, okra, peppers and corned beef.
Here are other fruits and vegetables that you can use to make pickles at home:
Salting or curing refers to the process used to preserve and flavor meat, fish, or vegetables with salt. Salt helps draw moisture out of the food via osmosis.
Osmosis also increases the amount of salt in the food and simultaneously reduces the potential moisture that it can contain. This makes it hard for microscopic organisms to grow in cured food.
Variations in curing are achieved with the addition of dehydration, smoking, sugaring, nitrates and other processes.
Curing is also a great method for preppers because you can master it with a bit of research and some practice. Use curing to preserve meats and vegetables for your food stockpile.
Like salting or curing, sugaring also draws water from food as it dehydrates and kills microorganisms.
When sugaring, the food is dehydrated first and then packed or surrounded with pure sugar, either in crystal form or in a liquid or syrup form.
Sugaring is often used to preserve fruit, which is ideal for this food preservation method because fruits often have high sugar content. You can also use this method to preserve vegetables, like root vegetables.
One downside to sugaring is you may run out of sugar in a post-SHTF world if you are trying to process a lot of fruits. Additionally, sugar, especially crystalline sugar, attracts moisture. Yeast blooms may occur when moisture levels are sufficient, which can cause fermentation.
Uncontrolled fermentation can cause food spoilage in your stockpile, so use sugaring with caution and store food properly to avoid it.

It can be daunting to plan your own garden, especially if you’re a beginner. If you need some help, we’re sharing some tips that can help you design a bountiful home garden. (h/t to ReadyNutrition.com)
When planning a vegetable garden, start by outlining your goals for the coming growing season. If you’ve already started gardening, take note of some mistakes that you made in the previous season so you can avoid them as you restart your garden.
Here are five tips that can help you become a better gardener.


Before you start planting seeds, formulate a realistic plan of action. Begin each year by making a list of plants that you want to grow. Creating this list will help you map out how much food you plan on growing for your family.
Study which plants can be planted in close proximity – such as bunching onions, lettuce, and spinach – and which ones need lots of space – like melons and pumpkins. Next, research which vegetables and fruits are suitable for intercropping or interplanting.
Intercropping means “planting two vegetables in the same space,” especially crops that can share space amicably. Try to plant early crops that will be removed from the garden next to late-season crops. Intercropping also combines plants to save space.
Choose ideal pairs from the lists below.
Fast growers:
Slow to fill out:
After you’ve done your research, start drawing out how your garden will look. Having an actual plan will help you stay on target for the space you will allot when you start planting in your garden.
If you wish to create biodiversity in your future garden, start with the soil. You can make homemade fertilizers using items that are normally thrown out, like banana peels, egg shells, and used coffee grounds. These organic materials can produce a “nutrient-rich, full spectrum fertilizer” that will slowly release the nutrients to the soil in your garden. (Related: A beginner’s guide to gardening: 10 Expert tips everyone must consider.)
Alternatively, you can help your crops grow by adding a compost bin to your garden. Composting will put brown and green items to good use since they are full of nitrogen and carbon-rich materials.
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are anything grown in a laboratory using modern techniques, like gene splicing. GMO seeds produce vegetables that may contain allergens or toxins, which you don’t want in your food.
If you’re buying seeds for long-term sustainability, you need non-hybrid and heirloom quality seeds. Non-GMO seeds will produce fertile seeds that can be stored for future harvests. Grow non-hybrid seeds using only organic fertilizers so your vegetables have access to the best nutrients that nature can provide.
If you want to save money, start early by growing your own seeds. Check the optimum growing time for your location, then start around that time.
Another way to get a head start is by making your own seed starting mix. This will save you money, and it can also give your plants the best chance at growing hearty roots. To make a healthy seed starting mix, use light, well-screened materials that promote root growth. These materials will also ensure that the mix doesn’t compact in small seed starting cells or containers.
Other factors to consider are good moisture retention and drainage. Soil that is too moist may result in damping off, which can make pathogens grow. Damp soil can also kill or weaken seeds or seedlings before or after they germinate.
Seeds need optimum growing conditions to grow healthy.
After you choose your seeds, the early stages of your gardening process will involve starting your seeds. If the weather is dreary, get a head start on your future garden by starting the seeds indoors.
Seeds started indoors can produce earlier and longer harvests. This gardening method doesn’t require special equipment – all you need is moist soil, comfortable temperatures, and a bit of hard work.
Longer growing varieties such as broccoli, cauliflower, and onions will benefit the most from indoor growing methods. Doing this also allows you to control their growing environment.
These tips should help you get your home garden started. In time, you will have access to nutritious and organically grown vegetables even after SHTF.",Zoey Sky,03/24/2019
https://food.news/2019-03-23-acrylamide-health-risks-associated-with-french-fries.html,Say no to acrylamide: The 4 health risks associated with french fries,"Advertisement
A burger isn’t complete without a plate of salty, greasy French fries. But did you know that fries contain a carcinogen called acrylamide?
If you just can’t get enough of French fries, it’s time to read up on the four health risks of eating this popular fast food.
French fries are full of fats that can make you gain unwanted weight. A single serving of French fries has 24 g of fat, but your daily diet shouldn’t include more than 65 g.
According to a study conducted by the Diabetes and Obesity Center of Excellence at the University of Washington, a diet high in fats can damage the brain’s nerve cells that control body weight.


French fries also contain high amounts of saturated and trans fats. The American Heart Association warns that these kinds of fat can increase blood cholesterol, which can then increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and Type 2 diabetes.
The excess salt (sodium chloride) in fries can also cause water retention in your body, which results in weight gain.
French fries are seasoned with a lot of salt. Anything salty consumed regularly may increase your blood pressure, which can cause heart and kidney ailments and even a stroke.
According to the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), formerly called the Institute of Medicine, you should only consume 1,500 to 2,000 mg (or half a teaspoon) of salt daily. However, the average American consumes around two teaspoons of salt per day.
A serving of French fries has at least one-third of the recommended daily intake (RDA) of salt or more than 600 mg.
French fries are full of carbohydrates and “bad” fats. A serving of fries has 63 g of carbohydrates.
When consumed in moderation, carbohydrates are beneficial and they give your body energy. Fiber is also a type of carb that promotes proper digestion and restricts the excess release of insulin. However, the potatoes used to make French fries are peeled, which strips them of fiber.
Eating a lot of fries also increases your salt and starch intake along with fats from the oil used to fry them.
All these factors combined can increase your risk of developing health problems like cancer, heart disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.
Pregnant women should avoid consuming French fries altogether because it contains acrylamide, a carcinogenic and neurotoxic agent. Acrylamide is found in foods fried at higher temperatures of more than 365 F. Fetuses and newborns are more susceptible to the effects of acrylamide since their blood-brain barrier still isn’t fully developed.
According to a study published in the Plant Biotechnology Journal, baking, frying, or roasting starchy foods at higher temperatures produces acrylamide. To limit your intake of acrylamide, avoid frying food for a long time, reusing oil, or heating it excessively. (Related: Eating fried food just twice per week increases your chance of early death.)
If you want to lower your risk of cancer, heart disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes, limit your consumption of French fries. You can try making healthier homemade fries by baking potatoes in olive oil instead.

https://food.news/2019-03-20-not-all-decorative-food-glitters-are-safe-to-eat.html,"Not all decorative food glitters are safe to eat, warn health officials","Advertisement
Kids love shiny things, and edible glitter seems like the best way to make a birthday cake prettier and more fun to eat. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that not all kinds of decorative food glitter and dust are safe for consumption.
On December 2018, the FDA warned consumers that while manufacturers claim that their decorative glitter and dust can be safely used to decorate food, the products may actually contain ingredients that shouldn’t be eaten.
According to the FDA, edible glitters and dust products are required by law to list their ingredients. These edible ingredients will often include:


The FDA reported that edible glitter also contains color additives specifically approved for food use, like mica-based pearlescent pigments.
The maltodextrin in food glitter is a white powder made from corn, potato starch, rice, or wheat. However, while maltodextrin is made from natural ingredients, the final product is highly processed. After the starches are cooked, acids or enzymes like heat-stable bacterial alpha-amylase are added to break it down further. The resulting white powder is water-soluble and has a neutral taste.
Take note that maltodextrin is high on the glycemic index (GI). This means that it can cause a spike in your blood sugar very quickly, especially when consumed in large amounts. Avoid foods that contain this additive, especially if you have diabetes.
Maltodextrin is also linked to weight gain because it is a sweetener and a carbohydrate with no nutritional value. The levels of sugar in maltodextrin can lead to weight gain. Since maltodextrin is often used as a cheap thickener or filler, it is usually made from genetically modified (GMO) corn.
The FDA also warned that consumers must pay attention to labels on food products. Most edible glitters and dusts will say “edible” on the label. But products labeled “non-toxic” and without an ingredients list, like non-toxic craft glitter, should never be eaten, added the FDA. (Related: Are You Giving Your Child a Daily Dose of Toxins?)
If you use non-edible products as food decor, always remove these decorations before serving and eating the food, advised the FDA.
Dr. Zhaoping Li, professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) suggested that even though the sparkly product is safe to eat, it is better to exercise caution when it comes to consuming items made with edible glitter. She concluded, “Our body can only take care of it if we only consume things like glitter foods once a while…in small amounts.”
If you wish to use safer and non-toxic alternatives to edible glitter, consider using edible flowers as food decor. Edible flowers aren’t just beautiful, they also taste delicious.
Do take note that you should only use organic flowers that haven’t been sprayed with pesticides or other chemicals. Purchase edible flowers from your local produce store or from reputable online sources.
Before cooking with or serving edible flowers, clean them by gently washing the flowers in a large bowl of cold water. Let the flowers air-dry on a paper towel, then use them immediately or store them in the refrigerator for at least one week in an airtight container lined with a damp paper towel.
Below is a list of beautiful and tasty edible flowers that you can use as garnish.
Avoid using edible glitter to limit your exposure to toxic ingredients. Use safer and natural alternatives like edible flowers as food decor instead.",Zoey Sky,03/20/2019

The boysenberry is a superfood that has many health benefits. According to several studies, boysenberries are linked to improved brain and lung health. The fruit can also help boost your digestion and immunity.
Listed below are the six health benefits of boysenberries.
Boysenberries can boost brain health because they contain anthocyanin, a flavonoid with antioxidant effects that can help boost memory. Anthocyanins can also prevent oxidative damage. Additionally, they can lower your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline.
Boysenberries are anti-inflammatory and can help boost your immunity and prevent different types of cancer, such as malignant esophageal and colorectal tumors. The berries also have vitamin C that can help fight off infections and eliminate cancer-causing free radicals.


Boysenberries can improve heart health since they have the antioxidant vitamin C. The berries also have a good potassium-sodium ratio.
A cup of boysenberries contains 183 milligrams (mg) of potassium, which can help balance out the negative effects of salt. This then helps reduce the risk of high blood pressure.
According to a 2014 study published in the Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology, the polyphenolic compounds of boysenberry juice can help reduce nitric oxide concentration through the “aortic endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation in hypertensive rats.” In short, boysenberry could be beneficial for heart health, and it may help lower blood pressure. (Related: Japanese study concludes that boysenberries help maintain vascular stability.)
In a separate 2015 study, researchers determined that the polyphenols in boysenberry juice helped inhibit plasma triglyceride absorption levels in rats.
Lung fibrosis can negatively affect the lung function of individuals with chronic asthma. In a 2016 study, scientists determined that eating boysenberries can support the development of fibrolytic lung macrophages with the airway capacity to promote balanced lung repair. The study findings also suggest that regularly consuming boysenberries can help limit lung damage in people with chronic asthma and other pulmonary diseases.
A cup of boysenberries has 0.72 mg of manganese, which provides at least 36 percent of your recommended daily intake. Some studies suggest that individuals who have seizures also have lower manganese levels.
Boysenberries can help digestive issues such as constipation since berries contain fiber that can promote regular bowel movements.
Boysenberries, which are related to blackberries, are bluish purple-colored, juicy berries. The tangy, tart berries can be eaten on their own, but they can also be used to make:
Boysenberries have a unique juicy, rich, sweet, and tart flavor. When buying boysenberries, look for fresh berries that aren’t bruised at farmers markets. Reddish, under-ripe boysenberries are very tart, so look for sweeter darker-colored berries.
Boysenberries are full of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and some protein. These berries contain Vitamins A, C, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, E, and K.
Boysenberries also contain:
The vitamin K in boysenberries can help prevent kidney stones. It can also boost bone strength, which can lower your risk of osteoporosis. Boysenberries contain vitamins A and C that can help address or prevent vision-related disorders.
Add nutrient-rich boysenberries to your regular diet if you want to boost your brain and lung health.",Zoey Sky,03/19/2019
https://food.news/2019-03-18-the-8-health-benefits-of-anti-inflammatory-bok-choy.html,The 8 health benefits of anti-inflammatory bok choy,"Advertisement
Bok choy, a type of Chinese cabbage, is a popular anti-inflammatory food. The vegetable, which is also called pak choi or pok choi, offers many health benefits. Bok choy is good for heart health and it can also lower your cancer risk.
Bok choy contains vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, C, E, and K. It also has betaine, choline, and folate. This cruciferous vegetable also contains fiber and protein.
Bok choy also has the following minerals:


Here are just some of the health benefits of eating bok choy.
The vitamin C in bok choy can strengthen the immune system. The vegetable contains selenium which can stimulate killer T-cell production. This can then prevent illnesses caused by invading viruses and bacteria.
Bok choy can lower your risk of breast, colon, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer. It is also full of beneficial antioxidants like vitamin C and E, indole-3-carbinol, indole, isothiocyanates, lutein, nitrile, sulforaphane, thiocyanates, and zeaxanthin.
The antioxidants indole, nitrile, and sulforaphane help prevent cancer since they can inactivate carcinogens and protect cells from DNA damage. According to several studies, eating multiple servings of cruciferous vegetables weekly can lower your risk of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer.
Bok choy is full of nutrients that are good for bone health:
Bok choy is chock-full of beta-carotene and vitamin A that can both help prevent cataracts, improve low-light vision, and treat dry eyes. Beta-carotene can also help treat macular degeneration, an eye condition that results in vision loss. (Related: Amazing Health Benefits Of Bok Choy.)
Bok choy has vitamin C which can grow collagen, a protein that is crucial for hair and skin health. Collagen can improve your complexion and smooth wrinkles.
Bok choy has vitamin K and omega-3 fatty acids that can lower your risk of inflammation, which is associated with various health conditions. The vegetable also has choline and polyphenols that can minimize inflammation.
Bok choy has calcium, magnesium, and potassium that can help lower your blood pressure naturally. The potassium in bok choy can limit the negative side effects of sodium, which can damage the cardiovascular system.
The vitamin K in bok choy is also needed for blood clotting/coagulation. This process helps prevent excessive bleeding both inside and outside the body.
The human body needs vitamin K to produce the proteins needed for the clotting process. An individual who is vitamin K deficient doesn’t have enough of these proteins and one of the symptoms of a deficiency is bleeding too much.
Additionally, bok choy has folate and vitamin B6 which can both help prevent the accumulation of homocysteine. Experts believe homocysteine is linked to heart problems and damage blood vessels.
Research suggests that cruciferous vegetables like bok choy can help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar levels. Bok choy is very low on the glycemic index, which is a must for any anti-diabetes diet.
Consult a healthcare professional before you increase your intake of bok choy, especially since the vegetable is goitrogenic. This means bok choy has chemicals that interfere with thyroid hormone production. Additionally, bok choy is rich in vitamin K. If you are taking blood-thinners (e.g., warfarin) talk to a medical expert before you add this vegetable to your diet.
Adding bok choy to your diet can help lower your cancer risk and boost your heart health.",Zoey Sky,03/18/2019
https://food.news/2019-03-16-chicken-noodle-soup-is-not-healthy.html,A bowl of lies: Here’s why chicken noodle soup (especially store-bought ones) is not as healthy as you think,"Advertisement
Chicken noodle soup is a comforting dish that’s often eaten on a cold day or if you’re recovering from an illness. However, not all kinds of soup are nutritious. In fact, eating canned chicken noodle soup could be bad for your health.
Unless you’re making your own batch, store-bought chicken noodle soup may contain too much sodium or have unnecessary ingredients.
According to Devin Alexander – celebrity chef and author of the diabetic-friendly cookbook called “You Can Have It!” – chicken noodle soup isn’t always a healthy dish. She warns that if you have high blood pressure, you need to be especially picky about the soup that you consume.


Listed below are the common ingredients used in chicken noodle soup and how it can add or take away from a serving’s nutritional value.
Chicken is full of protein, which can boost the immune system. However, since dark meat is less expensive than white meat, restaurants often use dark meat in their chicken noodle soup.
Alexander notes that white meat is the healthier protein source for your soup. Kate Letten, a registered dietitian based in Riverside, Illinois, adds that diced chicken (or the white meat with the fat cut off) is a high biological value protein. This means diced chicken has all the essential protein that the human body can’t naturally produce.
Letten explained that one cup of diced chicken has 43 g of protein while a cup of Campbell’s Homestyle Chicken soup only has 14 g of protein. Unlike homemade soup, canned chicken noodle soup only have around a third of the protein.
If you make your own chicken noodle soup, you can control what goes into the dish. However, you need to be careful when following recipes that use rotisserie chicken. Alexander warns that rotisserie chicken contains too much fat and salt, so it’s better to follow other healthier recipes. She suggests poaching white meat chicken breast in stock so the meat stays lean.
Noodles are full of carbohydrates that can help you feel full and satisfied. Most of the time, chicken noodle soup is made with white pasta instead of whole grain or whole wheat, unless you’re eating gluten-free soup. But even gluten-free noodles are made from rice instead of higher-fiber options.
If you’re making soup at home, use high-fiber pasta like green lentil pasta, or one that has added protein.
Hearty chicken broth has vitamins, minerals, and some fat. Warm broth can ease upper respiratory tract symptoms by providing hydration and stimulating nasal clearance. Bone broth and homemade broth can be nutritious, but it’s hard to make them without using some salt.
If you want to limit the sodium content of your broth, make your own soup. Instead of salt, use spices like garlic and pepper, along with some fresh herbs.
When you’re eating store-bought soup, check the label for its sodium content. According to the label on one brand of store-bought canned soup, it has “25 percent less sodium chicken noodle soup.” However, it contains 660 milligrams (mg) of sodium in half a cup and 1,220 mg in one cup. This is almost half of the recommended daily allowance of sodium for healthy individuals. (Related: Take a Look at the Chemicals in Processed Foods.)
If you want to make healthy chicken noodle soup, use organic carrots, celery, garlic, and onions. Leave the skin on the carrots because they are full of nutrients.
Carrots, celery, and onions have vitamins A and C, along with other antioxidants that can boost your immune system so you can fight off viruses. They may also help your body recover from illness more quickly.
On the other hand, canned chicken noodle soup has little to no grams of fiber.
Before vegetables like carrots, celery, and onions are added to soup stock, they’re usually sauteed in butter. If you want to make your chicken noodle soup “cleaner” and lighter, replace butter with extra virgin olive oil, which can also boost the flavor of the vegetables.
Chicken noodle soup contains little to no calcium. To remedy this, you can eat fiber-rich apples and cheese as side dishes.
Don’t serve store-bought soups to your family. If you want to help them recover from a cold, serve nutritious, homemade chicken noodle soup instead.",Zoey Sky,03/16/2019
https://food.news/2019-03-16-5-types-of-foods-to-boost-your-bodys-immunity.html,Here are 5 types of foods that boost your body’s immunity,"Advertisement
Following a healthy diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and nuts and seeds can significantly improve your overall well-being. However, if you want to boost your immunity and prevent colds and the flu, consume more of these five types of foods rich in various nutrients.
Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant, and they belong to a class of pigments found naturally in various plants. When you consume these fruits and vegetables, your body converts the carotenoids into vitamin A, which helps regulate your immune system.


These foods are rich in carotenoids:
Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of essential fatty acid that can help reduce inflammation and keep the immune system in check. Studies have yet to determine if omega-3s can help prevent infections (like the common cold), but research suggests that omega-3s can protect against immune system disorders like Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis.
These foods are rich in omega-3s:
Zinc is an essential mineral that is needed for the production of certain immune cells. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), having mildly low levels of zinc can affect your immune function.
Listed below are foods that contain zinc:
Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that also functions as an antioxidant.
Antioxidants help fight free radicals, and these unstable molecules can damage your immune system. Scientific data suggest that vitamin C can significantly strengthen your immune system if you are under major stress.
Boost your vitamin C intake by adding the following foods to your diet:
Vitamin E is another potent antioxidant. Studies suggest that “maintaining ample levels of vitamin E is crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system, especially among older people.” (Related: Quercetin is one of the most potent natural antioxidants on the planet.)
You can boost your vitamin E intake by adding these foods to your diet:
You can also strengthen your immune system by getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and managing stress levels. Other foods that can help boost your immune system include foods rich in probiotics (e.g., kefir and yogurt), garlic, and green tea.
Add these nutritious foods to your diet to keep your immune system strong and prevent illness such as the common cold.",Zoey Sky,03/16/2019
https://food.news/2019-03-14-mediterranean-diet-linked-to-lower-depression-risk.html,"Mediterranean diet linked to lower depression risk, according to study","Advertisement
There are various diets that can promote weight loss or prevent different diseases, but experts still consider the Mediterranean diet to be one of the healthiest. According to a study, this particular diet is also linked to a lower risk of depression.
The study, which was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, was conducted by researchers from Deakin University, University College London (UCL), University Hospital of Montpellier, and the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.


The Mediterranean diet mostly includes plant-based foods, such as:
This diet also uses healthy oils like olive oil. Instead of salt, dieters are encouraged to use herbs and spices to flavor foods. Steaks or other red meat should only be consumed a handful of times every month.
According to the results of this study, “a diet low in saturated fat, sugar, and processed foods can reduce the risk of depression by 24 percent over a 12-year period.” For the study, the researchers did a meta-analysis of over 1.5 million healthy adults.
The findings revealed that following a Mediterranean diet was linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality and overall mortality.
The researchers reviewed studies that used various dietary measures to gauge participant adherence to the Mediterranean diet such as the Dietary Inflammatory Index and the Healthy Eating Index.
The researchers noted that a lower inflammatory index was linked with lower depression incidence in four longitudinal studies. Aside from a lower risk of depression, the Mediterranean diet is also associated with a reduced incidence of cancer, along with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
The study findings also suggest that women on the Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts could also have a lower risk of breast cancer. Because of these health benefits, several major scientific organizations advise healthy adults to have eating habits that mimic the Mediterranean diet.
Dr. Camille Lassale, a research associate at UCL and a member of the research team that conducted the study, said that a plant-based diet that includes anti-inflammatory foods “can help prevent depression.”
The researchers added that individuals who strictly followed a Mediterranean diet had a 33 percent lower risk of developing depression over the next eight to 12 years, unlike those who didn’t follow this diet. (Related: Mediterranean-style diet found to improve quality of life for people who are depressed.)
On the other hand, an unhealthy diet full of processed food, saturated fat, and sugar was linked to a higher risk of developing depression. The researchers also suggested that dietary advice should be part of mental health treatment, especially since an individual’s physical and mental well-being are often intertwined.
Mary Fristad, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, psychology, and nutrition at The Ohio State University, believes the study was “a nicely done systematic review.” She shared that everyone seeks comfort food “on a short-term basis,” and that there is a link between healthy eating habits and depression.
However, Fristad warned that this link isn’t about cause and effect. The link between your diet and mental health is more about “changing the odds to be more in your favor,” especially since following a plant-based diet reduces inflammation in the brain.
Studies suggest that there is a link between inflammation in the brain and depression.
Fristad shared that she uses an educational approach on her patients called SEE, which stands for sleep, eating, and exercise. The professor noted that making positive changes to improve these three areas can improve the patient’s ability to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Fristad also highlighted the importance of avoiding inflammatory foods since inflammation can affect the brain. Inflammation can affect vasculation and increase insulin resistance.
Dr. Lassale concluded that there is also emerging evidence which suggests that the link between the gut and brain could have a crucial role in mental health. This axis is “modulated by gastrointestinal bacteria,” which can be modified by following a healthier diet.",Zoey Sky,03/14/2019

Following a healthy diet can help a person with diabetes manage their blood sugar and lower their risk for cardiovascular diseases. According to a study, a plant-based diet may even help enhance the mood of diabetics.
The meta-analysis, which was published in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care, involved researchers from the University of London.
For the study, the team of researchers conducted a review to determine the best nutritional interventions for individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. The findings suggest that plant-based or fully vegan diets were the best in managing this condition.


According to the International Diabetes Federation, at least 642 million people will have diabetes by 2040. In the U.S., over 30 million people have already been diagnosed with diabetes. About 15 percent of all global deaths are due to diabetes, and the condition claimed the lives of five million people younger than 60 in 2015.
Diabetes is often linked to depression, which then influences how well an individual manages their blood glucose (sugar) levels.
The scientists explained that a plant-based diet was already associated with a reduced risk for Type 2 diabetes. In fact, this diet was also associated with improved biomarkers like cholesterol, which are linked to an individual’s cardiovascular health.
The study authors noted that a plant-based diet is beneficial since it can help prevent diabetes. The foods included in this type of diet also contains antioxidants, fiber, micronutrients and unsaturated fatty acids that have protective factors against the condition. (Related: Following a plant-based or vegan diet can reduce risk factors of Type 2 diabetes, research indicates.)
But prior to this meta-analysis, experts have yet to determine whether these types of diets could be linked to improved mood states in people with Type 2 diabetes, especially since the condition “is often comorbid with depression.”
The researchers mentioned that they didn’t find any systematic reviews in the literature that solely focused on “the psychological and medical outcomes of plant-based diet interventions in adults” that have Type 2 diabetes.
For the meta-analysis, the scientists analyzed over 1,200 articles, which were then reduced to 40 articles. The research team then selected 11 articles that best match the search criteria.
Out of the 11 selected articles, 10 studies were conducted since 2009, while one study was from 1999. The 11 studies observed a total of 433 volunteers, with 219 in the intervention groups and 214 in the control groups. The mean size of the studies was 48 participants, and the average length was about 28 weeks.
After a systematic critical analysis of the results, the researchers determined that both physical and emotional quality of life only improved in the patients who followed a plant-based or vegan diet. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved among the people who belonged to these groups.
According to the study findings, the participants who were on plant-based diets also improved their blood glucose levels and lost more weight compared to those in the control groups. Additionally, those in the plant-based groups reported reduced levels of diabetic nerve pain.
The researchers concluded, “Based on the evidence of the research analysis by this systematic review, it can be concluded that plant-based diets accompanied by educational interventions can significantly improve psychological health, quality of life, HbA1c levels and weight, and therefore the management of diabetes.”
Individuals with diabetes should follow a plant-based diet, especially if they want to lose weight. This diet is beneficial since it lowers your risk of various weight-related health conditions such as heart disease.
If you’re not sure where to start, add more whole, unprocessed plant foods to your diet that are loaded with water and fiber. These kinds of food can help you become “mechanically full” before you become “calorically full.”
If you’re on a plant-based diet, eat more of the following foods:

Your physical and mental health are closely intertwined. If you follow a healthy diet, you can significantly improve your overall well-being. Conversely, if you follow a diet full of processed food and soda, you will increase your likelihood of getting dementia, according to multiple studies.
Consuming a lot of complex carbohydrates, processed foods, and sugar stimulates the production of toxins in the body. These toxins can then cause a buildup of plaque in the brain, which may cause inflammation. Experts believe chronic inflammation is often linked to disorders such as dementia.


Sadly, not many people realize the importance of a healthy diet. When you eat lean meat, nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables, and seeds, you can boost your heart health, lower the risk of conditions like cancer and diabetes, manage blood pressure, and prevent various illnesses.
On the other hand, poor nutrition can negatively affect your memory and increase your risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
According to several studies, which were published in the journals Alzheimer’s & Dementia and Stroke, individuals who often consume sugary beverages tend to have poorer memory. The researchers also warned that these people can also have smaller brain volume and a smaller hippocampus, the an area of the brain that is crucial for learning and memory. (Related: Elevated blood sugar levels have a DIRECT relationship with brain shrinkage.)
Additionally, a follow-up study about diet soda and dementia revealed that individuals who consume diet soda daily were three times more likely to develop stroke and dementia when compared to those who did not.
Dr. Matthew Pase, a neurologist at the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), explained that the excess sugar from these beverages can result in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as heart disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.
Sudha Seshadri, a professor of neurology at BUSM and a faculty member at Boston University’s Alzheimer’s Disease Center, warned that consuming sugary beverages doesn’t have any health benefits. Seshadri added that replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners can also be bad for your mental health.
In a separate study published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia, researchers analyzed data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and cognitive test results conducted on individuals who drank more than two sugary beverages (like fruit juice, soda, and soft drinks) or three servings of soda per week. The findings showed signs of accelerated brain aging that were risk factors for early-stage Alzheimer’s disease.
For another study, which was published in Stroke, researchers worked with participants who suffered a stroke or were diagnosed with dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. The scientists monitored the volunteers based on their beverage intake. Based on the study findings, sugary beverages and stroke or dementia aren’t correlated. However, the researchers advised that individuals who consumed a diet soda per day were three times more likely to develop stroke and dementia.
Aside from diet soda and other sugary beverages, the foods and drinks included in the list below may cause dementia or Alzheimer’s.

https://food.news/2019-03-13-why-sprouts-are-the-ultimate-prepper-food.html,Why sprouts are the ultimate prepper food for cost-effective nutrition,"Advertisement
Like fitness and survival skills, steady food supply is a crucial part of a prepper’s life. When setting up your stockpile, you can stockpile canned food and dry goods, but nothing beats fresh, nutrient-rich superfoods like sprouts.
Sprouts are full of vitamins and minerals. Whether you live in a small apartment or you want to add more greens to your diet, this is a cheap and easy way to add nutrients to your diet throughout the year. (h/t to BeansBulletsBandagesAndYou.com)
Sprouts refer to vegetable seeds that have germinated and turned into very young plants.


You can grow different types of seeds, such as:
Sprouts are often eaten raw, but they can also be lightly cooked before you consume them. Additionally, sprouts are low in calories but they are full of nutrients and beneficial plant compounds. The vitamin and mineral content of sprouts may vary based on the variety.
In general, the sprouting process boosts nutrient levels. Sprouts contain more folate, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, protein, and vitamins C and K compared to un-sprouted plants.
Once you select the seeds that you’re going to grow, soak them in water for the first half day or so. After that, keep the sprouts moist for a week, but don’t put them in standing water.
Spread the seeds in a single layer, then keep them mostly in the dark until the last day.
You can grow sprouts in jars, but the best option is to grow them in sprouting trays that you can buy online or in stores. Look for stackable trays so you can maximize your space. Sprouting trays have holes in the bottom that can drain water, but the holes are also small enough to stop the seeds from falling through.
About one to three days after they’re soaked, you’ll see the first roots emerge from the seeds. The shoots will then grow quickly. The cotyledons, or the first two little leave that were pre-set in the seed, will come out. This is when you put the sprouts in some light, but not direct, strong sunshine, for one day so the leaves can start to turn green.
You can eat sprouts once the first two leaves are out.
Take note that sprouts have a short shelf life once they’re ready for consumption. Ideally, you should only keep sprouts in the fridge for a week, or less if it’s warmer.
If you use sprouting trays, the roots will grow through the holes so you can rub them off after you water the sprouts. This makes it easier to harvest the sprouts as well.
Different plants have different sprout flavors. Alfalfa produces very mild and fine sprouts, and it is “a quick, mild, high producer.”
Both broccoli and radish make medium-thick, almost spicy sprouts. Bean sprouts, the largest and thickest, are the crunchiest. However, they’re not as flavorful as radish sprouts. (Related: Broccoli Sprouts: Nature’s Most Powerful Cancer-Fighting Food.)
If you’re worried about the price of organic seeds used for sprouting, keep in mind that a bag of alfalfa sprouts is cheaper than buying sprouts from a health food store. Always buy organic seeds to ensure that the sprouts you grow are safe to eat and free from harmful chemicals and fungicide.
To save your own seed for sprouting through the winter, let some plants go to seed then leave them until the pods are dry. Put a big bowl beneath your sprouting tray then gently mash the dried pods with your hands. This will make seeds and pod bits fall into the bowl. The seeds will settle in the bottom of the bowl while the chaff will remain on top. Pull off the chaff by hand or blow them away. This method is perfect for medium-sized seeds like broccoli and radish.

Fad diets aside, the ketogenic (keto), Mediterranean, and vegan diets are often considered the best ones for improving heart health.
The vegan diet focuses primarily on vegetables and eliminates all meat and animal products.
Dr. Kim Williams, a cardiologist at Rush University Medical Center, explained that substituting animal protein with plant protein can help reduce mortality and cardiovascular risk factors “over a period of time.”


Earlier research has determined that the risk decreases the most when a person eliminates processed red meat from their diet. Unlike a diet high in meat, a vegan diet will also reduce high blood pressure.
Data also suggest that a plant-based diet also helps reduce levels of C-reactive protein, one of the markers of inflammation in the body.
Despite these benefits, the vegan diet isn’t perfect. Following this diet can result in a vitamin B12 deficiency because the vitamin is found in animal products. Vitamin B12 deficiency is also linked to anemia or reduced red blood cell counts. Anemia can also be caused by iron deficiency.
The Mediterranean diet allows the consumption of animal protein, but fish is preferred over red meat. The diet also involves the heavy use of extra-virgin olive oil, one of the main components of this diet.
A Mediterranean-based diet includes foods like:
Data also suggest that this diet reduces levels of “bad” cholesterol and that it is connected to a lower risk of death due to heart disease.
The keto diet is low in carbohydrates, high in fat, and allows a moderate amount of protein. Dr. Sarah Hallberg, the medical director at Virta Health, advised that the keto diet is a whole food diet and not a processed-food diet.
When following this diet, you can consume some berries, dairy, non-starchy vegetables, nuts, and seeds that contain carbohydrates. However, you need to avoid foods such as grains and potatoes or anything that contains sugar. Dr. Hallberg added that the keto diet may help minimize risk factors for cardiovascular disease. (Related: The keto diet: Tips to make sure that the eating plan is working for you.)
Researchers agree that regardless of which diet you choose to follow, whole foods are much better than processed foods.
Dr. David Katz, a preventive medicine specialist at Yale University’s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, warned that other diets are significantly better than the standard American diet, which is full of fried foods, red meat, and sugary foods.

https://food.news/2019-03-12-research-shows-that-berries-offer-the-best-ways-of-preventing-cancer.html,Research shows that berries are one of the best ways to prevent cancer,"Advertisement
Berries are a delicious and nutritious addition to any meal or beverage. Several studies suggest that these antioxidant-rich fruits also possess potent cancer-fighting properties.
According to scientific research, berries are rich in powerful antioxidants that protect cells from the damage that may cause cancer. Berries have positive effects on genes linked with inflammation in the body. In fact, berries can help reduce inflammation and prevent the growth and spread of cancer.


For over two decades, Dr. Gary Stoner from the Medical College of Wisconsin studied the various ways that berries help prevent cancer. Over the course of his studies, Dr. Stoner found that a diet of freeze-dried strawberries or black raspberries helped inhibit esophageal cancer by at least 70 percent.
Dr. Stoner also noted that berries inhibited colon cancer in the subjects by about 80 percent. Meanwhile, human patients diagnosed at higher risk for colon cancer experienced a 36 percent regression of rectal polyps after consuming black raspberry powder for nine months. (Related: Prevent cancer with proper diet: Compounds in turmeric, red grapes, berries, and apple peels found to shrink prostate tumors.)
The study findings also showed that black raspberries and blueberries helped reduce breast tumor volume in rats by at least 70 percent after being consumed for six months.
In a separate study, which was published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, researchers verified that the following berries had anti-cancer benefits:
The researchers noted that these berries helped inhibit cancer growth and stimulate cancer cell apoptosis in vitro.
Apoptosis is defined as a form of cell death where a programmed sequence of events results in the elimination of cells without releasing harmful substances into the surrounding area. Apoptosis has an important role in developing and maintaining the health of the body because it helps eliminate old cells, unnecessary cells, and unhealthy cells.
The researchers added that “the stronger the berry extract, the more potent it seemed to be in preventing cancer.”
Experts believe that berries help prevent cancer because they contain potent phytochemicals called polyphenols. The two most active types of polyphenols are ellagitannins, a source of ellagic acid, and anthocyanins, the flavonoids that give berries their bright color.
Experts believe that the ellagic acid in berries such as blackberries, cranberries, and strawberries can inhibit estrogen production, and cut off the “fuel supply” of the tumor. Additionally, ellagic acid can help prevent bladder, breast, esophagus, lung, and skin cancer.
Berries are also rich in fiber, manganese, and vitamin C. Various berries are also full of beneficial phenols like ferulic acid and quercetin.
When buying berries, select organic fruits to ensure that they are free from pesticides and toxins. Organic fresh or frozen unsweetened berries also have more potent cancer-fighting abilities because they possess a higher concentration of key nutrients.
Berries are a healthier alternative to a sugary dessert that has many artificial ingredients and preservatives. You can eat one or several types of berries as a simple snack or dessert, especially if you’re craving something sweet.
Make a nutritious breakfast by adding berries and chopped nuts to a serving of cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, or ricotta cheese. Another option is to add berries to salads and other sweet or savory dishes.
Researchers suggest consuming at least four to five servings of different types of berries every week to lower your risk of developing cancer. Studies have determined that consuming only two ounces of berries every day can naturally expel toxins and slow cancer cell growth.",Zoey Sky,03/12/2019
https://food.news/2019-03-11-a-basic-guide-to-fermenting-vegetables.html,A basic guide to fermenting vegetables,"Advertisement
Nutritious cultured or fermented vegetables are good for your gut health. But did you know that instead of buying expensive fermented foods from health stores, you can make them at home?
One jar of fermented vegetables at a local urban provisions shop usually costs at least $10 to $15. But instead of shelling out this much money, which you can use to buy other items, you only need about five minutes of prep time and at least $2 worth of ingredients to make your own fermented vegetables.
The simple three-step process detailed below can be applied to almost any kind of vegetable.


First, decide on the vegetable that you want to ferment. Your options include:
Take note that the finer you chop or shred the vegetables, the faster they will ferment. Finely chopping or shredding the vegetables also ensures that you can pack more of them in one jar.
You can use almost any kind of vegetable when fermenting. Alternatively, you can combine different vegetables to make a healthy fermented side dish. Depending on the vegetable you want to ferment, wash and peel it the same way you would if you were going to eat it raw. (Related: 4 Good reasons why you should give fermented foods a try.)
The salt in fermented foods prevents mold from forming in the final product. Salt also allows beneficial bacteria to grow in the fermented vegetables. Adding salt also helps produce crispy fermented vegetables.
Store the vegetables in a Mason jar or fermentation crock, then cover them with a brine solution made from one tablespoon of salt per cup of water (use natural, non-iodized salt). Add herbs and other seasonings as desired.
For this step, you need to keep the vegetables submerged in the brine. Otherwise, anything exposed to air will rot. When using vegetables that float, use something heavy to weigh them down. You can also use fermentation weights to keep them submerged.
If you’re using a Mason jar, tighten the lid until it is barely snug. Doing this helps prevent oxygen from entering, but lets carbon dioxide escape from the jar. Otherwise, pressure can build up in the jar until it explodes. To avoid this, use a fermentation crock if you have one. Store the Mason jar or fermentation crock in a cool, dark place with a temperature that stays around 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
Fermentation times may vary from three days to three months or more, depending on the vegetable you use, temperature, and other factors. Taste the fermented vegetables to determine if it’s ready for consumption. Once you achieve the desired taste, refrigerate the vegetables to prevent further fermentation.
Experiment with other vegetables to make your own delicious fermented foods and save on grocery money.
If you want to introduce healthy fermented foods to your kids, try this recipe for fermented carrot sticks.
This crunchy and nutritious carrot snack has a fairly mild flavor. You can also add some garlic cloves and peppercorns for an extra kick.

Homesteaders prioritize self-reliance and the cultivation of organic produce, but this doesn’t mean you can’t make your home garden look pretty. If you want to beautify your property, start a practice called edible landscaping. (h/t to RockinWHomestead.com)
Edible landscaping represents a different take on how to design and interact with yards and urban green spaces. The practice prioritizes the cultivation of food-producing plants and native perennials, and it helps home gardeners create green space and provide healthy, fresh food to their family.


Replacing even just a fraction of traditional lawns with edible landscapes designed around locally appropriate plants offers various benefits.
These benefits require little to no irrigation or fertilizer and can increase food production potential in cities, as well as attract pollinators and improve ecological diversity.
Edible flowers are a common feature of edible landscapes. But flowering plants aren’t just pretty, they also attract pollinators that can help your fruit-bearing plants thrive. (Related: Edible Landscaping Ideas For Small Spaces.)
Popular options include daisies, lilacs, pansies, and sunflowers.
Edible flowers can also be used for food decorating and subtle flavoring.
Herbs are another staple in edible landscapes. You can plant the following herbs in your yard:
Another option is to grow herbal tea plants so you have access to ingredients for herbal teas all year long.
Shrubs are a nice addition to your edible landscape because they’re often of medium height. Shrubs can be used to bridge the gap between trees and shorter plants, like edible flowers. Additionally, shrubs can function as wildlife deterrents and windbreaks.
Plan ahead when selecting a shrub, and use a plant that produces something your family likes to eat. You also need to choose the right shrub for a site. Plant something that can thrive in your location so you don’t waste any of your resources.
You can plant the following shrubs in your landscape based on your needs and preferences:
If your yard is spacious enough, you can include fruit or medicinal trees in your edible landscape. Check which fruit tree varieties suit your geographic area.
Your options include:
If you already have a traditional vegetable garden plot but you still want to boost your crop yield, you can grow annual edibles in your regular landscape.
Listed below are vegetables that you can incorporate into your edible landscape:
You can also intermix these edible plants to make your landscape stand out.

Despite its pungent smell and intense taste, apple cider vinegar (ACV) is popular among health food enthusiasts because it’s a superfood that offers many health benefits. In fact, drinking ACV before you go to bed at night can help promote weight loss and prevent indigestion.
Listed below are some of the amazing health benefits of apple cider vinegar, especially when taken before bedtime.
Acid reflux is sometimes caused by hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid). If you have hypochlorhydria, you may have trouble fully digesting foods. Low stomach acid may also affect your body’s ability to eliminate harmful bacteria in your gut, which can lead to an unhealthy overgrowth of bacteria. Some of the acid could also end up in your esophagus.


If you have acid reflux, add one tablespoon of ACV to a large glass of water. Mix well, then drink the ACV water about an hour before you go to bed. The ACV can help restore your stomach’s acidity, eliminate gut bacteria, and strengthen your lower esophageal sphincter. (Related: Apple Cider Vinegar Dosage for Optimum Health Benefits.)
Some experts suggest that the bacteria that causes a sore throat can’t multiply in the acidic environment that ACV creates. ACV also has natural anti-microbial properties.
If you have a sore throat, dilute one teaspoon of ACV in a glass with warm water one hour before you go to bed. After 30 minutes, take another teaspoon.
Dilute the vinegar so you don’t damage your tooth enamel and burn your esophagus. You should start to feel a bit better when you wake up the next morning.
If you constantly suffer from abdominal pain, you may have digestive issues. But instead of taking an over-the-counter (OTC) prescription that could be linked to negative side effects, try a natural ACV remedy.
Health professionals suggest taking some ACV to ease digestive ailments like bloating and nausea. Add a teaspoon of ACV to a glass with water before going to sleep to relieve ingestion.
Studies have determined that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and the higher your body mass index (BMI), the more likely you are to have trouble falling asleep. Consuming ACV before bed can help prevent the accumulation of fat by limiting your body’s ability to break down starchy foods (e.g., pasta and rice) into calories.
ACV can help you lose weight by “promoting satiety and lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.”
ACV lowers blood sugar levels by boosting insulin sensitivity. In a separate placebo-controlled study, researchers examined three groups of adults: those with pre-diabetes, those with Type 2 diabetes, or those with no health issues. The findings revealed that all of the participants had lower blood glucose levels after they consumed a high-carb meal (a white bagel with butter and a glass of orange juice), after taking an ounce of ACV.
The researchers noted that the Type 2 diabetes group improved their blood glucose levels by 25 percent. Meanwhile, the participants with pre-diabetes reduced their blood glucose levels by almost 50 percent.
If you’re not already on medication to manage your blood sugar levels, consider taking two teaspoons of ACV every night, just before you go to sleep. Always consult a healthcare professional before taking ACV, especially if you’re taking prescription drugs for diabetes.
Follow the steps below to make your own ACV remedy.

Consult a healthcare professional before you take any of these remedies and always use organic, unfiltered ACV (which has the most vitamins and acetic acid) if you wish to try these natural cures.",Zoey Sky,03/08/2019
https://food.news/2019-03-07-can-the-mediterranean-diet-help-prevent-colorectal-cancer.html,Can the Mediterranean diet help prevent colorectal cancer?,"Advertisement
Unlike other fad diets, the Mediterranean diet is popular because it promotes the consumption of more plant-based foods and whole grains. Aside from being good for your overall well-being, the diet is even linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. According to a study, following this particular diet can also help lower colorectal cancer risk.
The study was presented at the 2017 ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology) 19th World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer.
Following the Mediterranean diet means an above-average consumption of foods like:


The Mediterranean diet also includes a high ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids. The diet also suggests a low intake of alcohol and red meat.
For the study, the researchers completely eliminated soft drinks from diet of the participants since these beverages are associated with a higher risk of developing cancer.
In the study, researchers worked with 808 volunteers undergoing screening or diagnostic colonoscopies. The participants were also instructed to complete a dietary questionnaire to help the researchers determine the details of their daily meals. The volunteers, who were between 40 to 70 years old, joined a medical and lifestyle interview. None of the volunteers had a high risk of colorectal cancer.
The researchers set out to determine the link between the components of the Mediterranean diet taken separately or in combination, along with the risk of developing advanced colorectal polyps.
The study findings showed that the volunteers who had advanced polyps consumed fewer components of the Mediterranean diet, unlike those who had clear colonoscopies. The researchers explained that eating at least two to three components of the diet also lowered the risk of advanced polyps by 50 percent.
The results also suggest that people should include fruits and fish in their diet and avoid soft drinks to prevent CRC. The researchers noted that consuming more fish and fruits and avoiding soft drinks helped reduce the study participants’ risk of pre-cancerous colorectal lesions by 30 percent, unlike those who didn’t follow the Mediterranean diet. (Related: Mediterranean diet helps prevent cancer, nutrition science study finds.)
The results also revealed that the risk of advanced polyps was reduced when the participants consumed more components of the Mediterranean diet. The researchers said that out of all the participants, those who had all the three healthy choices reduced their cancer risk by at least 86 percent.
The researchers warned that a low-fiber diet full of alcohol, high-calorie foods, and red meat promotes the formation of intestinal polyps that could eventually result in colorectal cancer. These polyps may become malignant based on several factors, like their structure, size, and location.
The Mediterranean diet is considered a “healthful, wholesome, and nutritious” diet for a reason. It can also help you stay fit and lean. This beneficial diet also helps prevent deficiencies since it includes whole foods that contain many essential nutrients.
Additionally, the Mediterranean diet completely eliminates unhealthy foods and beverages from your diet, like processed meats, refined grains, salted and preserved foods, and soft drinks. This diet won’t just help you maintain your weight, it can also lower your risk of heart disease, obesity, stroke, and other lifestyle-related conditions.

A study conducted by scientists from Cancer Research U.K. (CRUK) showed that positive lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking or maintaining a healthy weight, can significantly lower your cancer risk. The study findings were published in the British Journal of Cancer.
In the landmark study by CRUK, researchers analyzed factors in peoples’ lives that cause cancer. They then calculated how many cases in the U.K. were associated with each of these risk factors.


For this study, researchers used all the latest available data and evidence to provide more accurate estimates and update current data.
The results of the study showed that over 135,000 cases of cancer (or four in 10 cases) could be prevented in the U.K. annually by making lifestyle changes. These cancer risk factors have already been confirmed, but the study results highlight the importance of how your daily habits can add up and affect your well-being.
Dr. Katrina Brown, who led the analysis at CRUK, explained that the research team collated data from national surveys that showed how common each risk factor is in the population. The researchers also used data from the U.K. cancer registries showing how many cases of each cancer type there are. They then searched published research for data on how much each risk factor increases cancer risk using only “gold standard epidemiology research.”
To illustrate, these studies compared the number of cancers in individuals who smoke to the number of cancers in non-smokers to get a relative risk of cancer in smokers. Using this information, together with data on how common smoking is in the U.K. and how many cases of smoking-related cancer types exist, the CRUK researchers estimated how many of those cancer cases were due to smoking.
The researchers did this for all the modifiable risk factors. The results showed that in total, over 135,000 cases of cancer could be prevented through lifestyle changes like:
The study findings confirmed that smoking is the biggest cause of cancer. Based on the new calculations, it’s responsible for a whopping 54,300 cases of cancer every year in the U.K.
The new data likewise revealed that being overweight or obese increases the risk of about 13 different types of cancer. The findings suggest that obesity causes at least 22,800 cases of cancer in the U.K. annually, making it the second biggest cause of cancer in the U.K. after smoking. Unfortunately, only 15 percent of individuals are aware of the link between obesity and cancer. National campaigns can help educate the public about this dangerous link.

Both fruits and sweetened beverages — which include soda and sports drinks — have fructose, also known as fruit sugar. However, fruits also contain dietary fiber which helps counterbalance the effects of fructose, something that the latter does not have. In a review published in the journal The BMJ, scientists found that consuming these sugary drinks can increase your risk for Type 2 diabetes.
For the review, Dr. John Sievenpiper and his fellow researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada analyzed data from 155 nutritional studies on 5,086 individuals. The study included people with and without diabetes, measuring how blood glucose levels responded from various food sources of fructose, with the average follow-up ranging from one to 76 weeks.


The findings suggest that fructose from fruit, fruit juices, and other natural sources are less likely to increase risk factors related to Type 2 diabetes, unlike fructose found in sugary beverages. The simple sugar fructose is naturally found in fruits and vegetables. However, it’s also used in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is used to sweeten beverages like sodas. Sievenpiper, the study’s lead author and an endocrinologist at St. Michael’s Hospital, explained that when sugars provide excess calories, they may have negative metabolic effects that can increase your risk for diabetes. He also added that the effect was mostly observed in sugar-sweetened beverages which don’t have any nutritional value.
These sweetened drinks increased both glucose and insulin while also providing excess calories. Since none of the studies included in the review measured Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C, a two- to three-month average of an individual’s blood sugar level), the researchers are unable to determine the effect of excess calories on HbA1C. But the research team warns that the negative side effect calories on glucose and insulin would also have an adverse effect on HbA1C.
Sievenpiper said that even though fruits contained excess calories, they don’t negatively affect glucose or insulin. People with diabetes can consume fruit in moderation, especially if they want to control their blood sugar.
Dr. Osama Hamdy, medical director of the obesity clinical program and director of the inpatient diabetes program at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said that fruit can also help boost the intestine’s microbiota or the microorganisms that live in the gut. Fructose from natural sources like fruit also functions as a soluble fiber, which can help slow the absorption of fructose and reduce “bad”/low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
According to the American Diabetes Association, people should refrain from drinking sugar-sweetened beverages like energy drinks, fruit punch, soda, and sweet tea. Aside from raising blood sugar, sugary drinks can also add hundreds of empty calories to your diet. (Related: Sports and energy drinks are ‘essentially sodas without carbonation,’ state researchers exploring health risks of sugary beverages.)
Empty calories are linked to weight gain, and being overweight is a risk factor for developing diabetes. If you need an energy boost, switch to natural energy-boosting options like:
Sievenpiper warned that even though fruit is beneficial, fruit juice contains excess calories. He noted that you can consume at least half a cup of natural fruit daily if you use to complement a diet full of whole fruits and vegetables.
Dr. Jan Rystrom, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator at the Swedish Medical Center who was not involved in the study, added that fructose’s effect on overall health deserves further analysis. She added that as a food additive, “fructose has a cumulative effect in tissue, particularly in the lens of the eye.”
Several studies suggest this accumulation of fructose in lens tissue is linked to the development of cataracts, a common health complication of diabetes.
If you wish to lower your diabetes risk, Dr. Hamdy suggested that you consume more whole fruit instead of drinking fruit juices. Limit your intake of foods that contain refined sugar, like cake, cookies, and candy.
Always choose natural sources over sweetened beverages, and don’t overconsume whole fruit to stay healthy.",Zoey Sky,03/06/2019

If you’re new to tea culture, the many different varieties, from black to green to white teas, can be overwhelming. But while there is more scientific data on the health benefits of green tea, it shares similar pros and cons with white tea, another beverage that comes from the same tea plant (Camellia sinensis).
Green tea is wilted in shade, then is either steamed or fried in a pan. The taste of green tea will vary depending on several factors, like where the tea leaves were grown, harvested, and processed. Green teas that have been steamed have a bittersweet aftertaste, while other teas are usually sweet.


Most green teas can be divided into two types: Chinese tea (e.g., gunpowder green tea, Long Jing/Dragonwell) or Japanese tea (e.g., matcha green tea, Gyokuro green tea).
They may come from the same plant, but the colors and differences between green and white tea are determined by the degree of withering and oxidation that the teas have withstood. Both tea varieties are full of polyphenols, which are antioxidant plant compounds that offer various health benefits.
White tea, which originated from China, is a very lightly oxidized tea derived from the leaves and buds of the tea plant. It is named after the wispy, white-silver hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant. White tea is neither white nor silver. Instead, it is faint yellow in color with a mild and smooth flavor.
White tea is first dried directly under the sun, then it is dried indoors. The lack of processing allows the tea to retain its whitish color, especially when it is made from tea buds.
White tea is lighter or paler in color compared to green tea. Some types of white tea include Eyebrow White Tea (“Shou Mein”), Silver Needle White Tea (“Bai Hao Yin Zhen”), and White Peony (“Bai Mudan”).
White tea has a lower caffeine content compared to green tea. White teas from Fujian, China, often contain around 15 milligrams (mg) of caffeine in every cup. Meanwhile, green teas have about 20 mg per cup.
Research findings suggest that white teas may be better at cancer prevention compared to green tea. In a 2000 study conducted by the Linus Pauling Institute, researchers tested four different kinds of white tea on rats to determine if it could prevent colon cancer.
The study results revealed that white tea has more polyphenols and that it can minimize damage to DNA. This is crucial because this type of cell damage usually causes cancer. The scientists advised that further study is required to confirm if white tea offers the same benefit in humans.
Additionally, polyphenols in white tea can boost immunity, prevent bad cholesterol from becoming oxidized, and relax blood vessels. These factors can help minimize your risk of heart disease.
Experts suggest that green tea can help prevent the growth of cancer cells in breast, esophageal, prostate, and stomach cancers. Green tea can also help prevent atherosclerosis and the incidence of high cholesterol, which may also reduce your risk of developing heart disease.
Green tea also has fat-burning abilities. In a 2012 report, which was published in the Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology, researchers said that green tea can help minimize the inflammation and bacteria associated with gum disease. (Related: Catechins in green tea found to improve symptoms of metabolic syndrome in obese people.)
Both green and white teas are low in calories, as long as you consume them without added sweeteners or milk. Drink either tea if you want to lose weight naturally.
Since both teas are lightly processed, they are considered “raw” teas. Lightly processed teas may upset your stomach, especially if you drink these beverages when your stomach is empty. To avoid this, drink tea at least 30 minutes after you eat a full meal.
Consider these factors before you decide on what kind of tea you wish to consume. Whether you choose green or white tea, you can rest assured that you will reap health benefits such as cancer prevention and better heart health.",Zoey Sky,03/05/2019

While it’s better to grow your own vegetables, you need to consider some factors, such as space (or a lack of it), to devise a gardening system that works for you. If you don’t have a yard or a home garden, you can still grow herbs or sprouts indoors. Every step counts if you want to minimize your exposure to chemically-treated foods and other products.


Below are some things that you need to consider, along with your own needs and growing zone, before you start growing crops that will survive during winter. (Related: How to prepare your survival garden for winter.)
Will these crops thrive in your growing zone?
Ask fellow home gardeners to learn what kinds of crops can grow in your zone. Make use of the space you have, and only grow what you can consume so you don’t waste time and effort.
What kinds of dried, frozen, or tinned foods are cheaper to buy than cultivate?
If dried beans, grains, and legumes are cheaper to buy, plant something else that can thrive in your zone.
Can you eat or use the whole plant?
You can compost any spent vegetables, but you must prioritize crops that have the most edible parts, even those that take up space for a long time, like:
Before you switch to a diet of fruits, vegetables, and foraged foods, double-check the nutrient profiles of the foods you plan to eat to ensure that they provide you with enough nutrients.

Dried plums, or prunes, are nutritious healing foods that offer many health benefits. According to a study, adults of any age can benefit from prunes since they can improve gut health and lower the risk of colon cancer in adults.
The study, which was published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer, was a collaborative effort between researchers from Texas A&M University and the University of North Carolina.
Earlier studies have determined that a healthy diet is crucial to improving metabolism and colon microbiota composition. This discovery can help researchers develop natural ways of preventing and treating different diseases.


When gut microbiota is disrupted, you can suffer from intestinal inflammation, which may eventually result in colon cancer. Understanding the nature of the digestive system is key to preventing colon cancer, especially since trillions of species of bacteria live within your intestinal tract. To date, experts have only identified over 400 species in the gut.
In 2015, colon cancer caused at least 49,700 deaths in the U.S. According to the American Cancer Society, colon cancer is the third leading cause of death from cancer-related complications in the country.
The study findings can help address this concern, especially since the researchers confirmed that adding dried plums to your regular diet can help improve gut bacteria in your colon. This, in turn, may lower your risk of developing colon cancer. (Related: Here are the healthiest fruits you can eat.)
In the study, the researchers tested the cancer-protective effects of prunes in rat models that had a strain of colon cancer similar to the human variety. While some of the test rats were fed a diet that included dried plums, the other subjects were given a control diet with no plums.
The test results showed that the diet which included dried prunes reduced two primary kinds of bacteria in the colon: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.
The rats that followed the control diet had less optimal levels of gut bacteria. However, the rats that consumed dried plums had lower numbers of aberrant crypts and aberrant crypt foci than the control rats. Experts usually consider aberrant crypt foci, or precancerous lesions, as an indicator of colon cancer.
Prunes have phenolic compounds with various health benefits. These compounds are believed to be responsible for the anti-cancer properties of prunes. Phenolic compounds act as antioxidants that can neutralize free radicals which cause cancer and damage DNA.
Consuming dried plums helps promote the retention of good bacteria and their positive metabolism in the colon, which can significantly help lower cancer risk. Continued research with human subjects will help verify the findings from this study, but the results highlight the fact that adding dried plums to your diet can help boost your colon health.
Prunes contain vitamins A, B2, B3, B6, and K. They also have copper, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and potassium.
Surprisingly enough, prunes contain more vitamin K than plums. The former also contains more B-vitamins and minerals. Additionally, prunes are higher in carbs, calories, and fiber than fresh plums.
Aside from lowering your risk of developing colon cancer, dried plums also offer other benefits.

Avocados are a popular superfood because they’re full of “good” dietary fats. But did you know that this nutritious fruit is also used to make avocado oil?
The avocado (Persea americana) is rich in essential minerals and vitamins. The fruit, also called the “alligator pear,” offers various health benefits, and the same goes for avocado oil.
This cooking oil is unique because while other plant oils are derived from the seed of the plant, avocado oil is extracted from the flesh of the fruit itself. Since avocado oil has an unusually high smoke point of 500 degrees Fahrenheit, the oil won’t break down and produce harmful free radicals, even at a high temperature.
Take note that refined avocado oil has a high smoke point of 500 degrees Fahrenheit, but virgin avocado oil’s smoke point is only 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. This means only the former can be used to bake, barbecue, sear, or saute at high temperatures.
Some people say that avocado oil has a slightly buttery or nutty taste, but in general, it is considered to have a neutral taste. Avocado oil is usually compared to olive oil because both are rich in healthy fats. However, the former scores higher when cooking over high heat due to its smoke point.
Avocado oil has three different kinds of fat:

Here’s why you should replace unhealthy cooking oils with beneficial avocado oil.
It can enhance the absorption of essential nutrients.
Certain nutrients need fat in order to be absorbed by the body. These nutrients include the carotenoid antioxidants or pigments found in various plant foods. However, fruits and vegetables that are rich in carotenoids are often low in fat.
According to a small study, adding avocado oil to a salad with carrots, romaine lettuce, and spinach helped increase the absorption of carotenoids.
It can improve eye health.
Avocado oil has a carotenoid called lutein that is naturally present in the eyes. Lutein functions as an antioxidant that can help boost eye health. Increasing your lutein intake can help lower your risk of developing cataracts and macular degeneration.
It can help relieve arthritis symptoms.
Arthritis is a painful disease characterized by inflammation of the joints. Osteoarthritis, which involves the breakdown of cartilage in joints, is the most common form of this condition.
The results of a 2015 study, published in the journal Cartilage, revealed that extracts from avocado and soybean oil called avocado/soybean unsaponifiables can help alleviate the pain and stiffness found in patients with osteoarthritis. The oil is extra beneficial for individuals with hip and knee osteoarthritis.
It can prevent gum disease.
Studies suggest that a combination of avocado oil and soybean oil extracts can help prevent gum disease. Gum (periodontal) disease is an inflammatory disease that may cause symptoms like swollen, red, and bleeding gums; the deterioration of bone and tissue near teeth; and bad breath (halitosis). It can even cause tooth loss. (Related: 5 Ways Avocado Oil Will Make You Healthier.)
It can prevent inflammation.
The antioxidants in avocado oil can help heal dry, flaky, and inflamed skin due to eczema and psoriasis. If you have a skin condition, perform a skin patch test first to determine if avocado oil can worsen or trigger your symptoms.
Avocado oil is a versatile ingredient, and it can be used when making different savory dishes such as salads, soups, or roasted vegetables. The oil is also suitable for people following the Keto, Paleo, and vegan diets.
Even though avocado oil is a little expensive compared to other cooking oils, it offers many health benefits when used in moderation.",Zoey Sky,02/28/2019

Cayenne peppers (Capsicum annuum) have an impressive nutrient profile and they are often used to flavor various dishes. But did you know that preppers also use cayenne peppers to make an herbal salve that can help keep their feet warm? (h/t to AskAPrepper.com)
Keeping your feet warm is crucial to long-term foot health. But as you get older, the circulation in your feet can decline. To remedy this, preppers use cayenne salve keep their feet warm during cold days.
Instead of buying cayenne salve at your local pharmacy or supermarket, it’s cheaper to make your own. A DIY cayenne salve can be also used to ease back and neck pain. This remedy works by warming the muscles and loosening them up.
Cayenne salve works the same way on your feet. If you don’t have cayenne peppers on hand, you can use other kinds of chili peppers that contain capsaicin.
Do take note that you need to be careful about using peppers that are too high on the Scoville scale because they might burn your skin. Meanwhile, peppers on the low end of the scale might not be hot enough to produce an effective salve.
Alternatively, you can use homemade peppers to make the cayenne salve. Just dry the peppers first on a dehydrator or in the oven to remove all water, then use a grinder to turn them to cayenne powder.
If you don’t want to apply cayenne powder to your feet, you can eat hot peppers to stay warm. Consuming hot peppers helps warm up your whole body because they contain the active ingredient capsaicin.
Capsaicin gives hot peppers their medicinal properties. This active ingredient also gives peppers their hot taste. How hot a cayenne pepper tastes depends on its capsaicin content. The more capsaicin a cayenne pepper contains, the hotter it is.
Additionally, capsaicin makes your blood vessels to dilate, which results in extra blood flow that provides warmth to your hands and feet. While some people feel the effect immediately, others can feel the heat increase over time.
Hot peppers are also nutritious. They contain many anti-inflammatories, antioxidants, and vitamins.
The quickest way to use hot pepper to warm up is to sprinkle a bit of cayenne pepper powder directly on your feet. Alternatively, you can also add some powder into your socks.
You can control the amount of cayenne powder that you spread on your feet by combining the powder with a small amount of cornstarch. Start with 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 1/4 cup of cornstarch or foot powder. Mix it well and add a teaspoon of the mixture into each sock.
Gently move the sock around to evenly distribute the powder. Alternatively, you could also shake the powder evenly onto your feet from a sifter or a shaker jar. Applying powder directly to your feet will help keep your feet warm and dry. Use this method on a cold, wet day, or if you’re working outdoors on a snowy day. (Related: Foot care: An often forgotten practice when SHTF.)
To make your own cayenne pepper salve, you’ll need a crockpot, an eight-ounce Mason jar, and a small heatproof jar. You’ll use these tools to infuse the oil and melt the beeswax.

https://food.news/2019-02-25-naturalness-impacts-the-success-of-new-products-food-market.html,Sign of the times: Consumer behaviorists find that “naturalness” impacts the success of new products to the food market,"Advertisement
According to a study from the ETH (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule) Consumer Behavior group, a product’s success on the food market is primarily defined by whether or not consumers perceive it as natural.
The authenticity of the food we consume significantly affects consumer acceptance and perceptions of quality, and a broad-based review study by ETH Professor for Consumer Behavior Michael Siegrist and his Spanish colleagues arrived at the same conclusion. (Related: All-natural: Does it mean anything?)


Siegrist said, “The importance of naturalness for foodstuffs is of great practical relevance, yet it has never been the subject of in-depth research.” Out of the initial 1,000 scientific articles, the researchers handpicked 72 that were relevant to the research questions and could be correlated with one another.
The definition of naturalness was measured using three main categories: how was the product grown? (e.g. organically or in the local region); how was it processed? (e.g. presence or absence of additives, colorings, flavorings, and hormones. How much processing did a product go through? – according to consumers, “the lower the better”); and lastly: how natural does the final product appear to end consumers? Important things to consider are health and taste, freshness, and ecological focus. “Naturalness” may seem like a cohesive term, but the study reveals that it is in fact highly abstract and evokes extremely varied associations.
Siegrist shared, “It’s notable that all the studies conclude that popularity among a majority of consumers is closely linked to how natural a product is perceived as being. This was true for 85,000 participants from 32 different countries across a period of around 20 years.”
But all of the studies were carried out in relatively wealthy industrialized countries in Europe, Asia, America, and Oceania. In developing and emerging market countries, heavily processed products can be received more positively because they are expensive, which can be associated with social prestige. The same inquiry might well produce the opposite result there: a lower status given to “natural” foodstuffs and a higher one to industrially produced products, suggests Siegrist.
The comparison revealed that older people and women are more concerned with naturalness, unlike younger people and men. Consumers who buy organic products prioritize the naturalness of foodstuffs, which is the same case for people who support “traditional, sustainable, healthy, and organic products when shopping.” This implies that the study links an inclination toward naturalness with negative attitudes toward technological innovations in the food industry.
This point led the researchers to this key conclusion: “companies working with innovative food technologies – keywords: in vitro meat and 3D-printed foodstuffs – need to keep the naturalness factor in mind.” Siegrist explained, “Even though human perception is clearly subject to certain distortions, the key role that authenticity plays in the acceptance of foodstuffs is a fact. This means that products which are perceived as artificial will not be accepted by consumers in [the] future, either.”
To be successful, food producers must try to meet the “sometimes contradictory” demands of consumers.

https://food.news/2019-02-23-color-changes-our-perception-and-taste-of-food.html,Color changes our perception and taste of food,"Advertisement
Certain colors can affect your mood while some kinds of food may evoke your most cherished memories. According to a study, color can also influence the taste of food while personal experiences and expectations can change how you taste food.
The study, which was published in the journal Food Quality and Preference, was conducted by researchers from Penn State University (PSU).
John E. Hayes, associate professor of food science and director of the Sensory Evaluation Center at PSU, explained that the color of a beverage can influence how a person thinks it should taste. To illustrate, yellow is often associated with drinks that are sour like lemonade. Meanwhile, red is associated with drinks that are usually sweet, like sports drinks.


In the study, researchers wanted to find out if people could learn color-taste associations and if they can learn new color-taste associations. The PSU research team also wanted to determine why certain individuals “enjoy the bitter taste in some foods but not others.”
Molly J. Higgins, a doctoral candidate in food sciences, said that even though bitterness may indicate toxicity, there are people who enjoy chocolate, coffee, and IPA-style beers. IPA stands for India Pale Ale, and it is considered one of “the most aggressively hopped beer style.” IPA-style beers have bitter, citrusy, earthy, floral, fruity, and piney flavor notes.
For the study, Hayes and Higgins wanted to determine if there were differences between various bitter compounds. The researchers were also curious if people could taste those nuances.
Finding out if there are different types of bitter tastes could explain why some individuals like the bitterness of coffee but not the bitterness of chocolate. Hayes posited that there may be different kinds of bitterness, even if experts don’t have the language to describe it yet.
In the study, Hayes and Higgins tested if the participants could learn how to associate specific tastes with certain colors. They did this by creating solutions that tasted bitter, savory, sour, or sweet. Each solution was then paired with a unique color, like green for sweet or red for bitter.
The researchers didn’t want to bias their sample so they refrained from using preconceived color-taste pairings, like red for sweet. In the first experiment, the volunteers were instructed to taste the colored liquids over four different sessions.
After the first experiment, the participants were given uncolored solutions that they had to taste. The volunteers were also instructed to choose a color for each solution. (Related: Food scientists use VR to show how our perception of real food is altered by our surroundings.)
The researchers found that the participants matched the correct color and taste 59 percent of the time in the first experiment. The results were noticeably higher than the researchers’ estimate from random chance, which would have been 25 percent.
The scientists were surprised to discover that some volunteers learned how to associate new colors with different tastes after only four exposures.
Inspired by the positive results, the researchers ran a second experiment to see if the participants could distinguish between three different bitter tastes: caffeine, quinine, and Tetralone, a hop extract found in beers.
The researchers repeated the experiment with a new group of study subjects and they also assigned unique colors to each bitter chemical, like green for quinine and yellow for caffeine. But after four lab visits, the volunteers were unable to match the colors to the corresponding bitter compounds better than the researchers’ estimate from random chance.
While the researchers didn’t get the results that they expected, they were fascinated by how quickly some of the volunteers learned new color-taste associations in the first experiment. Higgins concluded that certain individuals could “learn color-taste associations well, while others may be more resistant to changes or new color-taste associations.”

Nuts may be calorie-dense, but they’re a healthy snack that contain fiber and nutrients. According to a study, eating a serving of nuts daily can help with weight loss.
The preliminary study, which was presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2018, was conducted by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). The California Walnut Commission partially funded the study.
In the study, the researchers set out to determine whether consuming nuts can affect long-term weight change. Dr. Xiaoran Liu, a research associate in the nutrition department of HSPH and the study’s first author, noted that most people who are trying to manage their weight often avoid calorie-dense foods like nuts.


During the course of the study, the researchers observed the effect of adding nuts to participants’ diets or trading nuts for other snacks, such as chips, desserts, fries, processed meat, and red meat.
The results showed that both adding and swapping nuts for other kinds of foods offered benefits. Adding a daily serving (around 28 g, or a small handful) was associated with reduced risk of weight gain or becoming obese. Meanwhile, substituting one type of food with a daily serving of nuts was linked to reduced weight gain.
For the study, analysis, Liu et al. worked with three separate study cohorts:
None of the participants had a chronic disease and were not obese when the study began.
To determine the amount of nuts that the volunteers consumed, the scientists used food-frequency questionnaires every four years over the course of each established study group, which went on for an average of 26 years. The findings revealed that walnuts were especially effective.
The study participants were mostly Caucasian, and Liu notes that the results would be consistent across other populations since the link between nut consumption and other health outcomes is “pretty consistent” across populations in the U.S. and Europe.
Registered Dietitian Lori Chong from the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center wasn’t involved in the current study, but she noted that the fiber content of nuts could be responsible for these findings. Chong said that since fiber is crucial for weight control, it might also be linked to a blood sugar response to nuts, unlike other snacks.
Chong explained that anything that spikes blood sugar will spike insulin, which promotes fat storage. Snacking on something that doesn’t cause blood sugar spike doesn’t require insulin. (Related: Health Basics: Weight Loss 101.)
Liu warned that when you enter adulthood, you may have a gradual weight gain of at least one pound a year on average. In 15 years, those extra pounds could be linked to health risks like cancer and Type 2 diabetes.
Chong noted that if you really want to manage your weight, preventing weight gain is more effective than trying to lose weight after. She advised that the best way to do this is by avoiding processed foods, following a balanced diet, and exercising regularly.
The findings revealed that calories aren’t the only marker of a food’s nutritional impact. Nuts are full of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, both of which are heart-healthy, especially when they’re replacing unhealthy saturated and trans fat found in processed snacks.
Additionally, nuts contain fiber that boosts satiety and fullness. Fiber is also good for gut microbial diversity. According to a 2015 article in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, gut bacteria could have a role in immunity, weight, and risk for various diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases.
In addition, nuts contain three macronutrients (carbohydrates, fat, and protein). Nuts also have calcium, phytonutrients, and other minerals that can boost your overall well-being.
When buying nuts, avoid products roasted in oil, with salt, or nuts with added sweeteners. Chong advised that nuts with added spices should also be avoided since they may include chemical flavoring.
Choose some raw or dry-roasted nuts, such as:
If you don’t want to eat plain, raw nuts, roast them at home then add herbs or spices for a boost of flavor. You can also add a tablespoon of nuts to cottage cheese, oatmeal, salad, or yogurt.

It can be difficult to follow a healthy diet, especially if you’re always on the go. Most of the time, people are tempted by the convenience of fast food, which is linked to increased rates of obesity and other health concerns. If you wish to follow a healthier diet, here are some simple ways to add more vegetables to your breakfast, which is the most important meal of the day.
Switching from breakfast muffins and hash browns to these nutritious breakfast recipes can improve your health in the long run. If you’re not fond of vegetables, the suggestions below are still worth trying because they’re both nutrient-rich and delicious.


An omelet is one no-fuss way to add more vegetables to your breakfast. It’s also a good way to reduce food waste because you can use leftover cooked or raw vegetables that you may have in your refrigerator.
You can add some of the vegetables in the list below to your breakfast omelet:
Unlike fast food burritos that are bad for you, this breakfast burrito is a version that you can eat regularly. You’ll need a whole-wheat tortilla, some scrambled eggs or tofu, and beans, peppers, and sauteed onions. Beans are full of protein, while the rest of the ingredients give you a good helping of vegetables.
Start your breakfast salad by filling a large bowl with baby spinach, then add cucumbers and blueberries, mango, peaches, and strawberries or a combination of your favorite fruits. Top the salad with nuts and seeds like almonds, chopped pecans, sunflower seeds, or walnuts, then drizzle a simple balsamic vinaigrette or your dressing of choice.
Oatmeal with fruit is a healthy choice, but you can get creative by adding savory toppings instead. Chop mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, or zucchini, then stir them into a warm bowl of oatmeal. Add a flavorful cheese like hot pepper jack or Parmesan, then stir the savory mixture. (Related: Keeping your oatmeal interesting: Additions that will help keep your commitment to a healthy breakfast.)
If you’re in the mood for a healthy smoothie, add vegetables like cauliflower, kale, or spinach to your beverage. Nutritious smoothie combinations include blueberry and spinach, cauliflower and strawberry, or kale and pineapple. Once you’ve selected a smoothie combination, add organic and fresh fruit juice, milk, or plant beverage, with a bit of natural sweetness from honey or maple syrup, then blend.
For a vegetarian option, scramble tofu with leftover vegetables like kale, onions, peppers, and spinach. Top the scramble with salsa for a southwestern spin.
To save time, make a batch of these crepes several days in advance then store them in aluminum foil at room temperature. To make this breakfast, lay the crepe on a flat surface then add some ricotta cheese, sauteed zucchini or kimchi, and scrambled eggs.

You can also start your day with a refreshing Israeli-style chopped salad made with bell peppers, cucumber, and tomatoes. The recipe below makes four servings and will take only 15 minutes to prepare.

Did you know that people who eat healthily are sometimes the biggest producers of food waste? However, with some careful planning and mindfulness, you can reduce food waste to help save the environment.
Early in 2018, a study funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USA) revealed that American consumers waste at least a pound of food per day or 225 to 290 pounds annually. The average U.S. household throws out around 150,000 tons of food daily.
By making some small changes in your daily life, you can make a big impact and help save the environment.


Reducing food waste
Shop smart. Make a list of things you need before you head to the store. Start meal planning and rotate the food in your pantry to avoid spoilage. (Related: Food waste is costing us all: The environmental and financial cost of spoiled food.)
Familiarize yourself with food packaging terms such as “best before,” “best by,” “expiration date,” “sell by,” and “use by” so you can maximize the shelf life of the food in your kitchen.
Buy in bulk for items that have a long shelf life. Buying in bulk reduces waste from packaging and saves some money, but only if you purchase items that your family frequently uses.
Reuse leftovers. Freeze them, eat them the following day, or add them to your next meal. When cooking a dish that tastes best on the day it is made, make enough, so you don’t have leftovers.
Grow your own food. Plant some herbs in your kitchen and cultivate produce in your backyard. When it’s harvest time, pick what you need then learn how to preserve extra produce.
Preserve food to extend their shelf-life. Learn about useful food preservation techniques such as:
Save vegetable scraps and use them in homemade broths and soup stocks. Clean them properly, then store them in freezer bags until you’re ready to use them. Use the rest to make compost for your garden.
Stop using plastic and get reusable lunch or snack bags and shopping bags instead. Store leftovers in non-toxic reusable containers like food-grade stainless steel containers, glass containers, or Mason jars. Use high-quality insulated mugs, reusable water bottles, and thermoses.
Purchase high-quality kitchenware and appliances. They may be pricey, but these items are worthy investments because you won’t have to replace them every year or so.
Repair items instead of discarding them. Use cloth napkins and towels instead of paper products.
Get rid of unused items at home by donating them to family and friends or local charities. Reduce plastic waste by buying reusable drinking straws for the whole family. Instead of purchasing cleaning towels, cut up old sheets and towels then reuse them for dusting and cleaning.
Live a greener lifestyle by recycling office paper, or switching to a paperless documentation system. You can also recycle aluminum cans and plastic bottles.
Contact your local county or municipality to find out which items can be recycled in your area. Most recycling facilities have their lists of acceptable items, but the majority of them don’t accept the following items:
Rinse food debris from glass, metal, or plastic materials before recycling. On the other hand, paper materials must be empty, clean, and dry. Wet paper or food-soiled paper products may be compostable, so add them to your compost pile.

A diet full of sugary foods and drinks contains bad carbohydrates that can make you gain weight and increase your risk of various health problems. According to a study, bad carbs also promote the growth of cancer cells.
Bad carbs are processed foods and sugary drinks. Various studies have determined that these foods are linked to a significantly higher risk of developing cancer. Meanwhile, good carbs like fresh fruits and vegetables help prevent cancer.
Other foods that are considered bad carbs include:



The body needs good carbohydrates because your cells and tissues turn the glucose in food into usable energy. Healthy carbohydrates fuel important organs and systems like the brain, central nervous system, heart, kidneys, and muscles.
But unlike good carbs, bad carbs flood your body with excess glucose that is stored as fat. When your diet is full of bad carbs, your body becomes more conducive to the growth of cancer cells.
This study, which linked bad carbs with prostate and other cancers, referenced health records that tracked more than 3,000 people since the 1970s. The data organized the foods consumed by the participants by glycemic index and glycemic load, which measures carbohydrate quality based on their impact on a person’s blood sugar levels.
The foods eaten by the participants were then compared with resultant cancer rates. According to the study findings, individuals who consumed the most high glycemic load foods had a whopping 88 percent chance of developing prostate cancer.
The researchers also found that eating foods full of unhealthy carbs “significantly increase the risk of prostate cancer,” the second leading cause of death in men due to cancer-related conditions.
The research findings also revealed that people who consumed sugary drinks, such as sodas and sweetened juices, were three times more likely to develop prostate cancer. Those who consumed a lot of processed foods, such as meat sandwiches, packaged burgers, and pizza, had double the risk of prostate cancer. (Related: Soda Consumption Increases Risk of Prostate Cancer.)
Sugary beverages were confirmed as the worst bad carb foods, and they are now associated with an increased risk of cancer, along with being considered a major cause of the diabetes and obesity epidemics in the U.S.
In the same study, researchers noted that the participants who followed a diet that contained low-glycemic index foods such as fresh fruits, legumes, non-starchy vegetables (except corn and potatoes), and whole grains had a 67 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer. The consumption of legumes were also linked to cancer prevention and a 32 percent reduced risk for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers.

Researchers from Cornell University have revealed that they have finally “analyzed where Northeast supermarkets source the foods they sell to their low-income customers.”
With data from these case studies, policymakers can learn how regional food systems can offer healthier food to low-income people in the Northeast part of the United States.
Miguel Gomez, co-author of the study, says that regional food stores are crucial to “the communities that they serve,” especially within both”very rural and very urban areas.” While they’re not as important in the larger national market when it comes to volume, without regional food stores these areas would experience a “food desert.”


The team of scientists observed 11 independent supermarkets – such as New York state stores in Harlem, Madison County, Syracuse, and Onondaga – and they tracked how food made its way from growers to stores.
The researchers monitored eight items from the 11 supermarkets: apples, bread, canned peaches, cabbage, frozen broccoli, ground beef, milk, and potatoes. Since these items “are grown or could be grown in the Northeast, the team was able to compare regional supply chains with non-regional chains.
Gomez, who is also an associate professor at Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, shares that the studies provided detailed results, and that the researchers established metrics to measure “the value-added economic activity in the supply chain, the transportation efficiency of nonregional versus regional supply chains, and the percentage of each item that stores source from regional producers.” (Related: Experts believe regional foodsheds would reverse obesity epidemic.)
Kristen Park, co-author and an extension associate at Dyson, adds that while the number of items analyzed was very small, the number of different supply chains was “far greater,” and that this gave them insight on the various “supply arrangements and supplier entities.”
The research team learned three lessons:
Even “dollar stores” are expanding, and some of them currently offer frozen and fresh fruits and vegetables aside from canned items. Gomez concludes that dollar stores, which can be found in rural areas that are lacking in stores, are “doing a great job of filling that gap.”

What you eat significantly affects your physical health. If your diet includes a lot of sugary and fatty foods, you are at risk of health problems such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. According to several studies, eating certain kinds of food can also negatively affect your mental health.
Several studies have determined that eating certain kinds of food can affect your mental and emotional health, especially if your diet includes a lot of processed foods and refined sugar.
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that you can safely eat desserts or drink sugary beverages if you use artificial sweeteners. While sugar alternatives like aspartame can lower your calorie intake, studies suggest that they can also drastically worsen symptoms in people who already have depression.


In fact, researchers from the University of Northwestern Ohio were forced to cancel a study of artificial sweeteners because some volunteers developed suicidal thoughts. While the participants who did not have depression were not affected in the same way, evidence hints that artificial sweeteners can lower serotonin levels in the brain significantly.
Research has determined that simple, refined carbohydrates lack nutrients and that they are linked to the growing obesity epidemic in the country.
Columbia University researchers conducted a study to verify if simple carbs are also associated with depression. Using data collated from the Women’s Health Initiative, which tracked over 70,000 women, the results showed that the higher a woman’s blood sugar increased after eating refined grains and sugar, the greater her risk of developing depression.
The study, which was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, also showed that the opposite is true. Women who followed a diet full of whole grains and healthy produce had a lower risk of depression. (Related: Recent study demonstrates how a healthy diet can reduce symptoms of depression.)
Scientists are learning more about the connection between “sugar’s ability to raise levels of inflammation throughout the brain and body to higher incidences of depression.” According to study findings published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, brain inflammation was 30 percent higher in individuals who were clinically depressed.
Findings from a separate study revealed that individuals who took medication to reduce inflammation caused by autoimmune or inflammatory disease had a lower chance of developing symptoms of depression. These results highlight the connection between sugar, which causes inflammation, and an increased incidence of depression.
Avoid eating sugary foods and replace them with these anti-inflammatory foods to improve your mood.
If healthy fats and oils, such as extra virgin olive oil, can lower the risk of various serious health conditions (e.g., depression and heart disease), the opposite is also true.
According to a study, eating a lot of foods that contain unhealthy trans fats may increase your chances of depression by a whopping 48 percent.

Almost all scientific studies analyzing the connection between poor diet and mental illnesses such as depression were focused on a specific food. However, research published in the British Journal of Psychiatry examined the diets of 3,000 people.
The results determined that people who consumed the most processed foods had a much higher rate of depression. On the other hand, people who ate a lot of whole foods had a lower risk of the condition.
The first step to successfully managing your depression is to eliminate processed and sugary foods from your diet. If you already have depression or if you wish to lower your risk, follow a healthy diet that includes fresh fruits, lean meats, and vegetables.",Zoey Sky,02/12/2019

If you already have Type 2 diabetes, you need to learn how to properly manage your condition to avoid kidney damage. Consider the results of a new study, which determined that following a high-fat diet can also negatively affect your kidneys. The study was published in the journal Experimental Psychology.
When a person has diabetes, their body is unable to use insulin properly. You need insulin because it is a crucial hormone for the regulation of your blood glucose levels. If you have diabetes, you may have too much glucose (sugar) in your blood.


When left untreated, high blood glucose levels can cause diabetic kidney disease, a condition wherein waste products are not removed effectively from the body. The kidneys of an individual with this condition become overworked because of all the excess sugar that they are trying to process and eliminate from the blood.
Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the condition, makes up a whopping 90 to 95 percent of all diabetes cases. According to the results of the study, the consumption of junk food and high-fat foods can increase your blood sugar levels just like Type 2 diabetes. (Related: PROVEN: Scientists say a high-fat diet is nutritionally poor and raises the likelihood of disease.)
Together with the other researchers, Dr. Havovi Chichger, the lead study author, discovered that eating too much junk food or foods high in fat “create similar conditions in the body.” Dr. Chichger is a senior lecturer in biomedical science at Anglia Ruskin University in the U.K.
For the study, the researchers used rat models that were fed diets of either chow with 60 percent fat for five weeks, or a junk food diet of cheese, chocolate, and marshmallows for eight weeks. The blood sugar levels of the subjects were assessed, along with the diet’s effects on different kidney glucose transporters. The scientists then compared the results with the findings from the rats with Type 2 diabetes.
The rats with diabetes had high levels of sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLTs), glucose transporters (GLUTs), and the corresponding regulatory proteins. These mechanisms aid the body with glucose reabsorption, a kidney process that filters the blood for glucose. If you have too much glucose in your blood, this process may become ineffective.
The rats that had unhealthy diets showed similar elevated SGLT and GLUT levels as the rats with Type 2 diabetes. Because of this, the researchers posit kidney damage risk is just as high in individuals who follow an unhealthy diet.
The scientists involved in the study hope that the study findings can be used to develop new solutions for safely reducing dangerous blood sugar levels. One such diabetic treatment involves blocking kidney glucose transporters to help lower a person’s overall blood sugar levels.

Based on the results of this study, your diet has an important role in optimal blood sugar levels and your overall well-being. If you already have Type 2 diabetes, or you wish to lower your risk of diabetes and kidney damage, limit your intake of high-fat foods that can negatively affect your health.
To keep your blood glucose levels and kidney health optimal, follow a diet that incorporates the following foods:
Avoid junk food and foods that are full of unhealthy carbohydrates and starches to reduce your risk of Type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease.",Zoey Sky,02/11/2019
https://food.news/2019-02-11-consumption-of-fried-foods-increases-cancer-risk.html,Health warning: Consumption of fried foods increases cancer risk,"Advertisement
If you’re eating fried food right now, you might want to put your fork down. Many health experts warn that the consumption of foods fried in vegetable oil is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, acrylamide is a probable carcinogen. This chemical may form in certain foods that are exposed to high levels of heat during cooking or processing. (Related: Acrylamide in Foods is a Major ‘Human Health Concern’ – International Researchers Report.)


Fried foods that contain acrylamide tend to be full of trans fats as well, but the chemical can also be found in other food products. The chemical was discovered in 2002, but it has been occurring in foods since humans started cooking.
Acrylamide is linked to a process called the Maillard reaction, which occurs when foods are cooked and there is an interaction between carbohydrates and proteins at the chemical level as they are heated. The Maillard reaction makes potato chips crisp, and it gives bread a golden-brown crust. But under certain conditions, this reaction can produce acrylamide.
The Maillard reaction is responsible for the colors and flavors of foods such as:
Out of all fried foods, potato chips have the highest levels of acrylamide. However, while regular potato chips have at least 2,000 ppm (parts per million) of acrylamide, fried sweet potato chips contain about twice that amount.
Avoid these nine foods with high levels of acrylamide:
Studies that have looked in the cancer-causing effects of acrylamide on rat models have revealed that the chemical is a probable carcinogen in animals.
In a separate 2014 major review of acrylamide studies with humans, which was published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer, six out of 26 studies determined that individuals consuming the highest levels of the compound had a higher risk of cancer.
Foods with the highest potential risk for acrylamide content are often made from starchy foods like potatoes and grains that are cooked at high temperatures for long periods of time. Meanwhile, processed foods that may contain higher levels of acrylamide include products like dry cereals and packaged cookies.
Fried foods rich in trans fats are something you should avoid because they are bad for you. Their acrylamide content is also another thing to consider if you want to stay healthy.

The best way to avoid the harmful chemical acrylamide is by following a diet full of simple and natural foods with minimal processing. Acrylamide doesn’t tend to form in cooked meat, dairy, fish, fruits, or low-starch vegetables.
You can also eat more whole, organic, and minimally-processed foods to limit your exposure to acrylamide. Additionally, you can try going raw or using lower-temperature cooking methods such as boiling, sautéing, or steaming.
Instead of buying fried foods, consume more of the healthy food groups listed below.
Fruits
Grains and protein
Vegetables and herbs

https://food.news/2019-02-11-garlic-prevents-prostate-gland-enlargement.html,For the guys: Eat more garlic to prevent prostate gland enlargement,"Advertisement
Men suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) don’t just experience an excessively large prostate. They’re also prone to health problems like urinary leakage or urinary tract infections (UTIs). Thankfully, a study has determined that garlic (Allium sativum) may be used to prevent BPH.
The study, published in Phytotherapy Research, was conducted by researchers who assessed the effectiveness of garlic on rat models.
BPH is a non-cancerous urologic disease that usually affects men older than age 50. The condition affects the prostate, a walnut-shaped gland that is part of the male reproductive system. This gland wraps around the urethra, the tube that urine flows out of. The prostate adds fluid to semen that carries sperm. When a patient develops BPH, the gland can clamp down on the urethra and restrict the flow of urine from the bladder.


BPH is linked to symptoms such as:
While there are conventional treatments for the BPH, most of them are linked to negative side effects.
Because of these side effects, the search goes on for a natural and effective cure for prostate gland enlargement. Researchers are looking into the development of herbal medicines that can be used safely for the long-term to inhibit the progress of the condition.
Earlier research has confirmed garlic’s anti?hyperlipidemic, anti?inflammatory, and cardioprotective properties. But to date, no study has been conducted to see if garlic can be used to treat prostate enlargement. (Related: Things You Should Know About Garlic – Health Benefits, DIY, Recipes, Tips and Tricks.)
In the study, researchers tested garlic to determine its suppressing effects on rat models with induced BPH. The study findings showed that garlic administration helped reduce relative prostate weight ratio. Garlic also helped inhibit the mRNA expression level of AR, DHT serum levels, and the growth of prostatic tissue in the rats with BPH.
Additionally, garlic administration decreased the levels of two inflammatory proteins in prostatic tissue: inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX?2).
The scientists also reported the garlic-induced accumulation of death?inducing signal complex and activation of 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). They also observed a decrease in levels of anti?apoptotic proteins, such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl?2), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl?xL), and survivin, during the course of the study.
According to the researchers, garlic can potentially be used to develop natural remedies that can effectively prevent prostate gland enlargement in male patients.

Below are some natural cures that can help ease some of the symptoms of BPH.

Walnuts (Juglans regia) are popular among vegans because these nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Additionally, walnuts are full of nutrients that can help boost brain and cardiovascular health. But according to a study, walnuts can also help optimize the gut microbiome “to suppress colon cancer cell growth.”
To date, colon cancer is the third most common type of the disease around the globe. The study, which was published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research, involved a collaboration between researchers from the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCONN) and Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine.


For the study, the researchers set out to determine the cancer-preventive effects of walnut consumption in mice.
The researchers observed two groups of  mice that were fed two different diets. The first group of mice (the control group) received a standard lab mouse chow and the second group was given a chow that mimicked the nutritional profile of the typical American diet. Subsets of both groups of mice were given walnuts.
The findings showed that the mice that were fed the American diet fortified with seven to 10.5 percent walnuts had fewer incidents of colon cancer. The researchers noted that the reduction in colon cancer rates was particularly pronounced in male mice, which had at least 2.3 times fewer tumors than the female subjects.
Take note that the human equivalent to the average amount of walnuts given to the mice in the study is an ounce per day, or 14 half-walnut pieces. The study offers very promising results concerning the effects of walnuts against tumor growth.
As the days go by, researchers uncover more proof that walnuts can help fight cancer. Experts posit that walnuts function as a probiotic that can help optimize the gut microbiome. In turn, this helps to promote a healthy colon while also suppressing both cancer cell and tumor growth. (Related: Walnuts inhibit cancer development, slow its growth, and kill cancer cells.)
Walnuts are unique because they are the only with plant-based omega-3s. Walnut phytonutrients and lipid extracts possess multiple healing components that can help target and kill cancer cells. These nuts are also rich in vitamin E, which has been associated with cancer prevention.
They also contain:
Walnuts also have other unique cancer-inhibiting compounds such as the flavonol morin 4, the quinone juglone, and the tannin tellimagrandin.
Aside from their cancer-fighting properties, walnuts can also help prevent various illnesses associated with poor lifestyle and diet choices. The regular consumption of walnuts may help lower your risk of diabetes, heart disease, and neurological disorders. Research also suggests that walnuts can help boost bone health.
Based on the results of this study, it is safe to assume that eating walnuts can help lower your risk of developing colon cancer.
You can add more walnuts to your diet by:
To keep things simple, you can also eat on a handful of walnuts for a savory snack that will help you feel full. Just make sure you eat only one ounce of walnuts a day since consuming more than that may put too much stress on your digestion.
Avoid walnuts if you are allergic to nuts, and supervise children when giving them walnuts because they may choke on larger pieces.
To lower your colon cancer risk, eat walnuts regularly, exercise every day, follow a healthy diet, and make positive lifestyle changes.",Zoey Sky,02/10/2019

Pickling is a handy skill to have, especially when SHTF – and you don’t need expensive equipment or a large work area to start pickling. Pickling can easily extend the shelf life of many perishable food items like fruits or vegetables. (h/t to ApartmentPrepper.com.)
Pickling, one of the oldest methods of food preservation, involves submerging your food of choice in either a salt or vinegar brine to keep it from spoiling.
Here are some of the many benefits of pickling your own food:
Controlled fermentation is encouraged in brine pickling, like when you make kimchi or sauerkraut. This allows beneficial bacteria to grow in the mixture and crowd out any bad bacteria that can make the food spoil. With brine pickling, you may notice that the flavor, look, and texture of the food changes. (Related: How to quickly pickle a variety of veggies.)


When you use vinegar to make pickles, its high acidity prevents most bacteria from growing in the food. Food pickled in vinegar remains preserved as long as it is submerged in the solution.
Kosher pickles are cucumbers preserved in a vinegar solution. Meanwhile, most dill pickles are preserved in brine. Dill pickles may include vinegar, but it is preserved in a mixture that includes dill and other pickling spices and salt.
Did you know that you can also pickle fruit? Fresh fruits ripen quickly and pickling is a good way to preserve excess fruit. Additionally, natural sugars in fruits perfectly complement the salty and sour components that are introduced by the pickling process. Pickled fruits can also be added to salads and cheese plates.
Here are seven unique foods that you can pickle, with a recipe included below for quick-pickled apples.
Pickled fruits pair well with rich foods. When making this recipe for quick-pickled apples, you can use maple syrup instead of sugar to enhance the flavor of the final product. Take note that the apple slices will fade with time, but you can experiment with a redder-skinned apple.
The recipe below produces a pint of quick-pickled apples.
Ingredients:
Steps:
Serve quick-pickled apples with a serving of pork or a pulled pork sandwich. The apples can also be eaten on their own as a snack.

Since the common cold and the flu both have similar symptoms, it’s important to know which is which so you can use the most effective remedies when you’re feeling under the weather. Listed below are several science-backed natural remedies that can protect you from the common cold.
A diet full of different fruits and vegetables can help you get plenty of beneficial antioxidants. Immune-boosting antioxidants, like bioflavonoids; selenium; vitamins A, C, and D; and zinc can be found in brightly colored and green vegetables, such as:


Selenium and zinc can also make your white blood cells more effective at fighting off bacteria and viruses. Ellie Isom, a nutritional therapist, advises that protecting yourself from these invaders can support the normal functioning of your immune system.
In a 2018 review of 83 clinical studies, which was published in the American Journal Of Clinical Nutrition, researchers determined that “high intakes of fruits and vegetables lead to both a reduction in pro-inflammatory biomarkers [which can promote illness] and an enhanced immune cell profile.”
A good night’s sleep helps your body rest and repair itself.
For a study on sleep patterns, which was published the journal Sleep, scientists studied blood samples from 11 pairs of identical twins with different sleep patterns. The results showed that the twin with shorter sleep duration had a depressed immune system, compared to their sibling.
Isom noted that poor sleep can significantly weaken your immune system. If you have trouble falling asleep, set a regular sleep-wake cycle. Increase your intake of calming nutrients like magnesium and theanine to sleep better every night.
Natural sources of magnesium include beans, green leafy vegetables, nuts, pulses, and seeds. But for therapeutic levels, consider taking supplements. Green tea is the best source of theanine. But if the drink keeps you up at night, take theanine supplements instead.
According to a 2017 a report published in the journal Nutrients, vitamin C can prevent and treat respiratory and systemic infections by boosting various immune cell functions at levels of 100 to 200 milligrams (mg) per day.

To shorten the duration of colds and the flu, health experts advise supplementing with high doses of vitamin C (such as 8,000 mg daily) the moment you experience symptoms.
Vitamin C-rich foods include:

In 2017 major global study, published in the British Medical Journal, researchers found that boosting your vitamin D intake can help lower healthcare costs by minimizing the risk of colds, the flu, and other dangerous respiratory infections like bronchitis and pneumonia.
The study findings showed that taking vitamin D supplements daily or weekly strengthened the immunity of all the participants, especially those who: cover themselves to protect against sun damage or for religious reasons; don’t go outside much; have dark skins that absorb less sunlight; or have vitamin D deficiency.
Isom explained that since immune cell function is closely tied to vitamin D metabolism, vitamin D deficiency could be responsible for increased susceptibility to infection. The vitamin boosts the immune system’s ability to recognize pathogens and trigger a response against them, especially viruses that cause the flu and respiratory tract infections. (Related: Protect yourself from flu season with these natural cold remedies.)
About 4000 IU (International Unit) of vitamin D is the safe upper limit, advised the Institute of Medicine (IOM). Do not take more than that without consulting a medical professional.
Fat-soluble vitamin D can be found in foods like dairy, eggs, and oily fish. Vitamin D-rich foods also include zinc, which you can also get from sources like as beans, nuts, pulses, and seeds.
The Global Handwashing Partnership reports that hand washing can help prevent at least 21 percent of colds and upper respiratory tract infections.
Your hands are full of germs. According to the Center For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), individuals touch their face, nose, mouth, and eyes without even realizing it. This is bad because this allows germs to enter your body through these areas and make you sick.
Always wash your hands, especially before and after preparing food; before eating; or after going to the toilet.

Chopping onions can make you cry, but it’s a sacrifice worth making because onions can give a dish an incredible boost of flavor. But did you know that eating red onions offers various health benefits and that they can help you manage your blood sugar?

According to Haley Hooks, a dietetic intern at Tufts University’s Frances Stern Nutrition Center, onions are full of beneficial chemicals such as antioxidants, flavonoids, sulfur compounds, and vitamin C.
Onions are nutritious whether you eat them raw or cooked. However, raw onions have higher levels of sulfur compounds. The sulfur compounds in onions are formed via an enzymatic reaction when they are cut or crushed.
According to studies, these sulfur compounds offer several benefits such as promoting the breakdown of blood clots, which can lower your risk of developing heart disease and stroke. These onion compounds can also reduce the production of unhealthy cholesterol in the body.
To maximize the sulfur content of red onions, it’s better to eat them raw. Cooking onions will significantly decrease the quantity of the compounds that offer various health benefits.
The only downside is, these sulfur compounds are responsible for the pungent odor of onions. The compounds also make you teary-eyed when you’re slicing onions.
If you can stomach the taste of raw red onions, add them to dishes like salads or sandwiches. If you prefer to eat cooked onions, cooking them lightly will still offer many health benefits. Serve grilled or roasted red onions as a side dish, or dice and saute them with some peppers to make a delicious and healthy relish for lean meat or grains.

https://food.news/2019-02-04-sea-salts-are-not-as-sterile-as-previously-thought-mold-contamination.html,Toxic preservative? Sea salts are not as sterile as previously thought; mold contamination could potentially spoil food,"Advertisement
Artisanal products such as sea salts are often prized by food lovers, but a study has determined that sea salts can cause spoilage molds.
Based on the study headed by Kathie Hodge, a mycologist from Cornell University, and doctoral candidate Megan Biango-Daniels, there are varying levels of mold contamination in commercial sea salts. Among those molds were important food spoilage molds like Aspergillus and Penicillium, along with some notorious producers of mycotoxins (allergens).
Biango-Daniels said, “This new finding contradicts the conventional wisdom that salts are sterile ingredients.” The research discussed the importance of knowing the risk that comes with using sea salt during food production.
For the study, the researchers used seven different commercial salts. They then extracted living fungi from the sea salts, which was grown in the lab for identification. The fungi discovered in the salt have the potential to spoil food when used as an ingredient and can introduce mycotoxins when consumed.
For the levels discovered in the study, which is an estimated 1.7 spores per gram, using sea salt on food that you’re going to eat immediately isn’t dangerous to your health. However, there can be dire consequences when sea salts are used at home or industrially for making cured meats, fermented pickles, or brined cheeses. Since these foods mature over time, molds introduced with sea salt can thrive and spoil food, which can make it very toxic.
Hodge, who is also an associate professor in the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section in Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, added “fungi can survive in surprisingly hostile places. They can’t increase or grow in a container of sea salt – nothing can – but spores of some fungi survive quite happily there. Later they can wake up and make trouble in our food.”
Fungi can make their way into sea salts during production from seawater or during storage and packaging. Sea salt production begins when seawater is trapped in outdoor ponds called salterns. Once the seawater evaporates, salt crystals form and are scraped up from the ponds and dried.
Fungi may remain from microbes that live in the salterns, or their spores may come from the air over weeks of evaporation. Once fungi are in the salt, they can grow again once they are stored in a moister environment.
The researchers warned that microbial safety standards for this currently unregulated ingredient are necessary to avoid food spoilage.

Food spoilage is often indicated by a change in appearance different from the food in its fresh form, like a change in color or texture, an unpleasant odor, or a strange taste.
These factors often cause food spoilage:
Because microorganisms can be found everywhere in the environment, there is always a risk of spoilage when foods are exposed to unsuitable conditions. Microbial spoilage is caused by bacteria, molds, and yeast.
Aside from making food unpalatable, some types of spoilage can be caused by pathogenic bacteria, which can have serious health consequences. Clostridium perfringens (causes spoilage in meat and poultry) and Bacillus cereus (causes milk and cream spoilage) are also pathogenic. (Related: Scientists find the moringa leaf to be an effective preservative for meat.)
When exposed to unsuitable storage conditions, such as the Danger Zone (between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit), pathogenic bacteria can multiply rapidly and release dangerous toxins that will make you sick if the food is eaten, even if it’s cooked to a safe internal temperature. Keep food out of the Danger Zone by keeping cold food cold, at or below 40 F (4.4 C), and hot food hot, at or above 140 F (60 C).
Spoilage of food concerns both quality and food safety. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends the Four steps to Food Safety (Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill) to prevent food spoilage and reduce the risk of food-borne illness.

Following a healthy diet offers many benefits, such as improved overall physical and mental well-being. But did you know that eating foods rich in vitamin K can also boost your bone and heart health?
The body needs vitamin K because it helps build and maintain healthy bones. This necessary vitamin is popular because it also has a role in blood clotting (coagulation). It allows the body to make the proteins necessary for the blood clotting process. Clotting is important because it can prevent the body from bleeding too much when you get hurt.


Green leafy vegetables contain the highest amounts of vitamin K, but other natural food sources of this nutrient include blueberries, edamame, and soybeans. The average adult woman needs 90 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin K per day while adult men need 120 mcg.
Do take note that if you use blood thinners like warfarin (Coumadin), your vitamin K intake could affect the dosage of your medication. Always consult your healthcare provider before you increase your intake of vitamin K-rich foods, and talk to a dietitian to determine the proper daily value of the vitamin for your condition.

Cinnamon is a sweet-smelling spice that evokes warmth and comfort, especially during the holidays. But did you know that this aromatic superfood also offers several evidence-backed health benefits?
Cinnamon is a spice that comes from the inner bark of trees that belong to the genus Cinnamomum. In ancient times, cinnamon was rare enough to be presented as gifts for royalty. However, cinnamon is now common and cheap.
You can buy it in supermarkets, and it is often used as an ingredient in various dishes. There are two main types of cinnamon: Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum), or “true” cinnamon, and Cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), or Chinese cassia.


Cassia cinnamon is the more common variety of this spice. Consumers often mean Cassia cinnamon when they say something contains “cinnamon.”
Cinnamon is made by cutting the stems of cinnamon trees. Once the inner bark is extracted, the woody parts are removed. The bark dries and curls into rolls that are called cinnamon sticks.
Sometimes, these sticks are ground to make cinnamon powder. The oily part of the spice, which is rich in a compound called cinnamaldehyde, gives the spice its unique flavor and scent. Experts suggest that cinnamaldehyde is also responsible for cinnamon’s beneficial effects on health and metabolism.
The spice is commonly used in home remedies and for medicinal purposes. While there is only a handful of supported clinical evidence that validates the health benefits of cinnamon, there are a lot of small studies which suggest that using the spice offers some advantages.
One teaspoon of cinnamon only has six calories, making it a guilt-free addition for different drinks and dishes. Cinnamon is used in healthy recipes, and it is also commonly added to desserts. This spice boosts the flavor of any dish without the need for any sugar, and it is also full of antioxidants.
The Cleveland Clinic recommends taking at least 1/4 to a teaspoon of cinnamon per day.
Here are the four health benefits of cinnamon.
Based on the results of a study, which was conducted by researchers from Wheeling Jesuit University, chewing cinnamon gum during a test “improved participants’ scores on tasks related to attentional processes, virtual recognition memory, working memory, and visual-motor response speed.”
This study may be a small one, but you can try chewing on some organic cinnamon-flavored gum so you can concentrate better when you’re studying for an important test or trying to finish a work-related project.
A 2015 review of studies revealed that cinnamon contains bioactive phytochemicals with antibacterial effects that can help clear breakouts.

Several studies imply that cinnamon can help lower blood glucose levels in people with Type 2 diabetes. However, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) reports that the research is “too small and conflicting to state it as fact.” But the ADA added that individuals with Type 2 diabetes can use cinnamon as a beneficial health supplement to manage their condition.
The results of a 2013 study showed that cinnamon extract “significantly promotes type I collagen biosynthesis within dermal fibroblasts.” This means that the spice can help address aging skin and wrinkles. Use a cinnamon face mask regularly to keep your skin supple and radiant.

Experts suggest that the most effective way to lower cancer risk is by making healthy lifestyle changes. To boost your overall well-being, maintain a healthy weight and eat anti-inflammatory foods that can also help lower your risk of developing breast cancer.
According to Alexandra Rothwell, a registered dietitian and a specialist in oncology nutrition, being overweight is one of the main risk factors for breast cancer. Since inflammation is also associated with both breast cancer and being overweight, eating anti-inflammatory foods can help you maintain your blood sugar levels and minimize inflammation.


The foods included in the list below aren’t just nutritious. They can also help reduce inflammation and prevent breast cancer.

Add fish like herring, mackerel, salmon, and sardines to your diet because they are full of omega-3 fatty acids. Rothwell explained that omega-3s can help reduce inflammation in the body. Alternatively, you can also eat seeds and walnuts if you prefer a non-animal source of these fatty acids.
A 2014 study, which was published in Cancer Causes & Control, suggests that consuming more omega-3s is also connected to a reduction in breast density.
Various studies have determined that eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables regularly can help lower your risk of developing breast cancer. Experts posit that there are several reasons why a plant-based diet is good for you.
A 2015 study revealed that fruits and vegetables are rich antioxidants, and the more antioxidants in a diet, “the lower the breast cancer risk may be.”
A separate 2011 study, which was published in the European Journal of Nutrition, showed that the fiber found in fruits and vegetables can help fuel their ability to lower cancer risk. (Related: Reduce your risk of breast cancer by 21% by simply eating one more serving of veggies a day.)
Rothwell recommends eating the following vegetables if you want to naturally lower your risk of developing breast cancer:
However, Rothwell suggests that you should try to stick to low-sugar fruit varieties, such as berries. She added that you need to limit high-sugar fruit, like bananas, mangoes, and pineapples, to keep your blood sugar levels normal.
Considered a healthy fat, olive oil offers many benefits. It can also help reduce breast cancer risk.
Data from a 2015 study revealed that adding four tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to a healthy diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables can help lower breast cancer risk by a whopping 68 percent.
Additionally, olive oil “may come with an additional benefit relating to breast density,” another confirmed risk factor for breast cancer. According to a 2014 study, which involved more than 3,500 female participants, adding an extra 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil to your daily diet is linked to lower breast density.
Turmeric, a spice commonly used in Indian cuisine, contains curcumin. This substance has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Studies have shown that curcumin can help reduce the toxic effects of certain breast cancer cell and that it can potentially prevent the growth of cancer cells.
While there isn’t a scientific consensus on recommended daily dosage, common dosages in studies that offer health benefits range from 200 to 500 milligrams (mg) of curcumin daily.

Foraging is a crucial skill for any prepper. After all, knowing which plants are edible and which ones are poisonous can literally save your life when SHTF and your supplies run out. Keep your prepping skills updated by learning about the 10 poisonous plants included in the list below. (h/t to PreppersWill.com)
Belladonna (Atropa belladonna)
Belladonna, or deadly nightshade, is sometimes mistaken for blueberries. The whole plant is toxic, but its roots are the most dangerous. Belladonna contains a toxin called atropine which can increase your heart rate. Other side effects include dizziness and hallucinations.


Belladonna is bitter and a single leaf is toxic enough to potentially kill you.
Castor beans (Ricinus communis)
This plant produces castor oil, but castor beans are lethal. The beans have a high ricin concentration that can kill the average adult.
Castor beans lose their toxicity after they are heated to a certain temperature to produce castor oil. If you are exposed to castor beans before they are heated, you may suffer from permanent nerve damage.
Doll’s eye (Actaea pachypoda)
Doll’s eye, also called white baneberry, contains different poisons that may cause immediate death once eaten. The whole plant is poisonous, and doll’s eye berries are the most lethal since they have a high concentration of a cardiogenic toxin. The toxin will kill you by slowing the heart muscle until your heart stops beating.
Tell your children to avoid this plant, especially since most reported cases of poisoning involve kids who enjoyed the sweet taste of the poisonous berries.
Hemlock (Conium maculatum)
Hemlock is considered one of the most poisonous plants in North America because it has flowers that look very similar to Queen Anne’s lace flowers or parsnip. These similarities result in numerous poisoning incidents.
Hemlock has cicutoxin, a harmful chemical that can cause central nervous system damage. The symptoms of hemlock may include:
Sometimes, hemlock poisoning can result in death. If you believe you have accidentally consumed hemlock, watch out for symptoms like seizures because they may cause kidney failure, muscle breakdown, and swelling in the brain. These can cause death if the patient doesn’t receive immediate medical attention.
Horsenettle (Solanum carolinense)
Horsenettle is often mistaken for heirloom tomatoes, especially since the former bears attractive fruits that look similar to the latter.
However, horsenettle contains a poisonous substance called alkaloid solanine. Once consumed, this substance may cause significant abdominal pain and circulatory and respiratory issues.
Oleander (Nerium oleander)
The whole oleander plant is poisonous if consumed or burned.
Oleander has a white, sticky sap that contains a toxin called cardenolide glycoside. This toxin is a type of steroid that can cause heart problems. Wash your hands immediately if you touch oleanders.
Pokeberries (Phytolacca americana)
Pokeberries are toxic, so avoid its fruit-bearing pinkish-purple stalks. (Related: Is it edible? 3 easy steps to determine if you’ve found something edible in the wild.)
A handful of pokeberries can kill a child, and eating a bit more can also kill an adult.
Other poisonous berry plants to avoid include:
Rhododendron (Rhododendron ferrugineum)
This bush, which bears clusters of beautiful flowers, is one of the most poisonous plants known to man. The poison is concentrated in rhododendron leaves, but the entire plant is toxic to both humans and animals once consumed.
Avoid rhododendron nectar, which produces a toxic substance called grayanotoxin. This substance may cause side effects like diarrhea, nausea, overall weakness, and vomiting.
Rosary pea (Abrus precatorius)
Rosary pea, also called crab’s eye or jequirity, is used in beading.
The plant contains abrin and this toxin is fatal to both humans and animals. Once ingested, abrin can cause liver failure, nausea, or even death.
Wild cherry (Prunus avium)
While wild cherries are edible, the plant’s leaves and pits (seeds) have toxins. The leaves start producing fairly concentrated cyanide as they wilt and the pits can do the same when they are ground up.
Now that you know about the poisonous plants listed above, here are some edible plants that you can read up on. Learn how to identify these plants properly so you can safely forage for them when SHTF.

https://food.news/2019-01-31-chayotes-can-prevent-and-treat-skin-cancer.html,Chayotes can prevent and treat skin cancer,"Advertisement
Chayote (Sechium edule) is an uncommon vegetable that belongs to the gourd family. Since it has a very mild flavor, it can be used in various dishes and cooked in different ways. According to a study, the versatile chayote can also be used to treat skin cancer.
The study was conducted by biology students from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) in Indonesia. Dr. Budi Setyadi Daryono supervised the study through the Students Creativity Programme UGM 2017.
Lentigo maligna melanoma is a type of severe and malignant skin cancer that spreads rapidly. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are at least 3,300 new melanoma cases reported annually in Indonesia.


Melanoma may appear on normal skin or start from a mole. However, people don’t always notice how a normal mole changes into melanoma, which can result in unreported and undiagnosed cases.
To address this concern, a group of biology students from UGM tried to find a natural cure for lentigo maligna melanoma. For the study, the researchers used chayote to make an ointment that can help treat melanoma.
Dwi Jami Indah explained that they used chayote because it is a common agricultural crop in Indonesia. While the vegetable is often used in various dishes, chayote skin remains underutilized even though it contains latex that is beneficial for the health.
In fact, chayote has flavonoid and saponin compounds. These secondary metabolite compounds can be used to prevent skin cancer.
To determine the anti-cancer compounds in chayote, the students ran qualitative, quantitative, and anti-proliferation tests using the cell line that has the same proliferation character as the cancer cell. The research team used chayote paste as a test sample.
The researchers performed a thin layer chromatography test for the qualitative test. Meanwhile, they ran a spectrophotometric test for the quantitative test. For both tests, they divided chayote into three parameters based on the fruit size. The researchers operated under the assumption that a bigger chayote is older, compared to other samples.
Indah said that testing using the three parameters confirmed that chayote contained saponin and flavonoid compounds. The researchers then processed chayote into an extract, which was then turned into an ointment. According to the results of the antiproliferative test, the chayote extract can help obstruct the growth of skin cancer cells. (Related: Vitamin B3 can reduce skin cancer risk by 23%.)
Using the research data, the UGM students successfully produced Selasih Lalat, a chayote ointment that can be applied on cancerous moles. The students hope that their research can inspire others to use natural materials when developing cures for different conditions.

Lentigo maligna melanoma refers to a type of invasive skin cancer. This condition develops from lentigo maligna or Hutchinson’s melanotic freckle. Lentigo maligna often develops on the outer surface of your skin.
However, when lentigo maligna starts growing beneath the skin’s surface, it develops into lentigo maligna melanoma. The latter is the least common type of melanoma. While lentigo maligna grows slowly and is usually harmless, lentigo maligna melanoma may spread aggressively.
The exact cause of lentigo maligna melanoma remains unknown, but experts posit that sun exposure is the biggest risk factor for developing this type of skin cancer. Individuals with sun-damaged skin and people who spend a lot of time outdoors are at high risk of developing lentigo maligna melanoma.
Other risk factors for developing the condition include:

People rely on energy drinks whenever they want to study for exams, or if they’re getting ready to spend long nights at work. However, experts warn that these sugary caffeinated drinks are also associated with various conditions such as diabetes and heart disorders.
In 2016, the energy drink business was a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. It’s even estimated to reach $61 billion by 2020. Most of these beverages are marketed directly to children and adolescents. If drinks are combined with other drugs and alcohol, their negative side effects can get even worse.


The caffeine in energy drinks significantly affects many of your vital organs, especially the cardiac and nervous systems. Here are some of the health problems that are linked to the regular consumption of energy drinks.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), energy drinks “may pose a danger to public health.” Meanwhile, the American Academy of Pediatrics warns that children shouldn’t be allowed to consume these beverages, which have little to no nutritional value.
Adults also need to consider their risk for heart disease or stroke. Avoid energy drinks if you’re already predisposed to these conditions.

To keep your stamina up, energy drinks contain caffeine, sugar, and additives like taurine. These ingredients, which are detailed below, have no nutritional value. The bad thing is, they’re also full of calories because of their sugar content.

https://food.news/2019-01-30-roasted-jackfruit-seeds-healthier-cappuccino.html,Study finds that roasted jackfruit seeds can be used to make a healthier cappuccino,"Advertisement
Jackfruit is a unique and exotic fruit with a subtle sweet flavor. The results of a study revealed that aside from being a versatile ingredient, jackfruit can also be used as an alternative to cocoa powder used to make cappuccino.
The study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE, was conducted by scientists from the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) at the University of Sao Paulo’s Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ-USP) in Brazil.
According to the researchers, they discovered a way to make a cappuccino mixture using jackfruit. Based on the study results, roasted jackfruit seeds can replace between 50 percent and 75 percent of cocoa blended with milk and coffee to make cappuccino, all without changing the aroma or flavor of the drink.


Fernanda Papa Spada, a food scientist and a recipient of the scholarship, explained that flour made from roasted jackfruit seeds “naturally releases a mild chocolate aroma.” Spada worked with her supervisor Solange Guidolin Canniatti-Brazaca, a professor at FAPESP in the Department of Agroindustry, Food and Nutrition.
The researchers were motivated to look for a natural cocoa substitute because of the increasing international demand for cocoa. Spada noted that this increase is caused by the rising demand for chocolate without a corresponding growth in supply, especially since cocoa-producing countries are unable to boost their output.
The International Cocoa Organization revealed that 4.568 million metric tons (mt) of cocoa beans were processed in the 2017-18 crop year, which was almost the same as the total world production (4.645 million mt). The leading cocoa producer in 2017-18 was the Ivory Coast, which accounted for approximately 40 percent of the total. The country was followed by Ghana, Indonesia, Ecuador, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Brazil.
According to Brazilian law, the formulation of milk chocolate drinks and other chocolate preparations must contain at least 25 percent cocoa powder. With the exception of dark and semi-dark chocolate with 35 percent cocoa powder, premium products usually contain less than 30 percent cocoa powder. Chocolate powder usually has about 30 to 50 percent cocoa powder and cocoa butter while dairy ingredients (e.g., butter, dried milk, flavoring, and sugar) make up the rest.
Canniatti-Brazaca said that the increasing demand for cocoa and stagnant supply are major challenges for the food industry. These problems called for the search for new cocoa substitutes that can be used in chocolate and chocolate products.
Jackfruit seeds were first identified as a chocolate-flavored ingredient during an earlier ESALQ-USP project, which was conducted from 2010 to 2013 by Canniatti-Brazaca’s group and Miriam Coelho de Souza, a researcher at Piracicaba Methodist University (UNIMEP) in Sao Paulo State University.
Canniatti-Brazaca commented that based on study findings, out of all the fruit varieties studied, only the seeds of the hard jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) “released intense chocolate-like aromas.”
The accidental discovery of jackfruit as a cocoa alternative happened during a class led by Souza. Students were working on the development of food products made from on waste left over from fruit processing, and one student baked a loaf of bread made from jackfruit seed flour. Surprisingly, the bread “smelled strongly of chocolate.”
Following the accidental discovery, a handful of studies were performed at ESALQ-USP. The study published in PLOS ONE showed that flour could then be made from roasted dry or fermented seeds of hard jackfruit to produce an aroma similar to the chocolate used in cappuccino.
Cappuccino is currently sold as an instant powder made with coffee, milk, and chocolate. However, the quality and amount of chocolate may vary depending on the manufacturer. Spada noted that while some expensive products use chocolate powder, others include artificial flavoring instead.
Both coffee and chocolate have a unique flavor and aroma because of volatile compounds derived from roasting and fermentation. The researchers were tasked with determining the ideal conditions for roasting and fermenting jackfruit seeds to produce a flour with a chocolate-like aroma of optimal intensity “without impairing or even altering the coffee flavor of cappuccino.”
To achieve this, the researchers studied the chemical composition of jackfruit seed flour, which had no flavor but releases a chocolate aroma after roasting. Spada explained that the flour must be fermented first to release the chocolate aroma.
Through sensory analysis, the researchers determined that dry jackfruit seed flour can be incorporated as an ingredient in cappuccino formulations. Substituting jackfruit flour for chocolate powder at 50 to 75 percent was ideal since it doesn’t alter the acceptability and sensory characteristics of the final product.
Spada commented that according to the test participants, “the aroma of the cappuccino preparations made with dry jackfruit seeds resembled cappuccino, chocolate, cinnamon, and coffee, with cappuccino and chocolate flavors.”
Jackfruit is a large fruit with edible pulp and seeds.

https://food.news/2019-01-30-the-science-behind-comfort-food.html,The science behind comfort food: Why we reach for chocolate or potato chips depending on our mood,"Advertisement
According to research, the concept of “comfort food” isn’t a one-size-fits-all scenario. You may want some chocolate if you’re feeling sad, but another person will reach for a bag of potato chips when they fail a test at school.
Does indulging in sweet or salty foods really give you comfort? Or does a lack of restraint only give you temporary joy that’s immediately followed by guilt because you cheated on your diet? Several studies suggest that while indulging in your guilty pleasures can cheer you up temporarily, your choice of comfort food can also be influenced by your current mood.


Sometimes, people crave comfort food because they’re trying to fill an emotional need instead of an empty stomach.
In a 2015 study, Jordan D. Troisi and a team of researchers looked into the circumstances that resulted in the consumption of comfort food. The study results revealed that “securely attached individuals preferred the taste of comfort food (potato chips for example), after experiencing a belongingness threat.”
In a second study by the same group of researchers, findings showed that securely attached individuals consumed more comfort food to deal with “naturally occurring feelings of isolation.”
The researchers also acknowledged earlier research concerning the phenomenon and a preference for comfort food. For the purpose of the two studies, comfort food was defined as “foods people eat in response to specific circumstances, in order to feel pleasant or psychologically comfortable.”
The scientists explained that a lot of individuals consume comfort food to escape negative emotion even though this form of attempted self-medication doesn’t always resolve the problem. Despite this fact, people want comfort foods because eating them produces feelings of relational connectedness, a result that is very evident in those who have strong social ties.
This suggests that eating comfort food is associated with context, experience, and “relational associations with the food.”
The researchers concluded that their reference material proves what people instinctively know: that sometimes, you want to eat food when you need emotional comfort to self-medicate whenever you are under psychological stress.
Despite the stereotypes about comfort food choices, the researchers said that comfort food doesn’t always mean junk food. This means comfort food is food that “produces a pleasant emotional state.”
According to self-reported definitions of comfort food, people focus more on the consumption experience and context, along with the associations and relational ties to a certain kind of food.
However, for some people comfort food isn’t about the kind of food but their mindset.
In a separate study, titled “Better Moods for Better Eating?: How Mood Influences Food Choice,” Meryl P. Gardner and a team of other researchers examined the connection between food and mood.
The researchers referenced previous studies to verify that individuals often eat to “deal with negative emotions such as frustration, fear, boredom, stress, or anxiety.” These people tend to favor foods that fatty, full of carbohydrates, indulgent, and sweet because these items often give them immediate satisfaction. Comfort foods that meet these criteria may also have psycho-physical benefits. (Related: Six easy ways to get your emotional eating habits under control.)
To find out how positive moods affect food choice compared to negative moods, the researchers conducted four experiments. The results imply that the answer is associated with the pursuit of long-term versus short-term benefits.
Based on the results of the four experiments, a positive mood is linked to long-term goals like health, which then results in healthier food choices. Meanwhile, negative mood makes people crave more immediate mood management that makes someone consume indulgent foods.
Not all comfort foods are bad for you. In fact, there are healthy foods that you can swap for junk food if you want to ease stress and anxiety.
These feel-good food alternatives aren’t just delicious, they’re also nutritious.
When you’re feeling anxious or stressed, don’t binge-eat cookies or chips.
Experts suggest talking to friends or a therapist if you’re struggling to deal with fear, negativity, or situational anxiety. Talking about your feelings can help reduce your desire for temporary sources of comfort like junk food.
The next time you’re craving salty chips or fries, try chatting with a friend to help ease your anxious mind.",Zoey Sky,01/30/2019
https://food.news/2019-01-29-hot-coffee-has-more-antioxidants-than-cold-brew.html,"Hot coffee has more antioxidants than cold brew, new study concludes","Advertisement
There are several ways to prepare coffee, and there are people who prefer a hot cup of joe while others favor cold brew coffee. However, according to the results of a study, hot coffee contains more antioxidants compared to the cold brew kind.
The study, which was published in the journal Scientific Reports, was conducted by researchers from Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University).
The research team included Megan Fuller, Ph.D., assistant professor of chemistry, and Niny Rao, Ph.D., associate professor of chemistry. Fuller and Rao, who are both coffee drinkers, were curious to see if the chemical make-up of cold brew was different from hot coffee.


Based on the study findings, the researchers determined certain “chemical differences between hot and cold brew coffee that may have health impacts.”
The scientists noted that hot-brewed coffee has higher levels of antioxidants, which experts cite as the reason for some of the health benefits of coffee.
The results of the study also revealed that the pH levels of both hot and cold coffee were similar. All coffee samples tested had pH levels that ranged from 4.85 to 5.13.
Cold brew coffee is often promoted by coffee companies and lifestyle blogs as a healthier alternative to hot coffee. Claims state that since cold brew coffee is less acidic than hot coffee, the former is “less likely to cause heartburn or gastrointestinal problems.”
In recent years, the popularity of cold brew coffee has skyrocketed and the U.S. market grew a whopping 580 percent from 2011 to 2016. However, the researchers found only a small number of studies about cold brew, which involves a no-heat and long-steeping method of preparation.
On the other hand, the health benefits of consuming hot-brewed coffee are well-documented, such as a lower risk of certain types of cancer, diabetes, and depression.
Fuller and Rao acknowledged that even if the overall pH levels were similar, the hot-brewed coffee method contained more total titratable acids. The researchers posit that these acids could be responsible for the hot coffee’s higher antioxidant levels. (Related: Coffee is great for your skin, too: Its antioxidants soothe red and inflamed breakouts.)
Fuller shared that coffee is rich in antioxidants and that scientific data have confirmed that drinking caffeine in moderation can boost your overall health.
However, Rao warned that even though hot and cold brews have similar pH levels, coffee drinkers mustn’t treat cold brew as a “silver bullet” for preventing gastrointestinal distress.

Cold brew and hot brew refers to two different methods of preparing coffee.
Cold brew coffee is usually prepared using a French press, Mason jar, or Toddy system. Coffee grounds are mixed with room temperature water, then left to sit from about three to 24 hours, depending on the equipment used, before the solids are filtered out.
Most of the time, cold brew recipes require a higher coffee-to-water ratio: one part coffee to four parts tepid water, which is less compared to the ratio for a hot brew. When the grounds are removed, you are left with a black coffee concentrate that is thinned with either milk or water before it is served.
Hot brew coffee is prepared with equipment like Chemex Coffeemakers, a French press, the moka pot, or a Vietnamese coffee filter. To make hot brew coffee, hot water is poured over a bed of coffee grounds at a general proportion of 1 oz. coffee to 8 oz. hot water. For a more home-friendly version, use two level tablespoons per one cup of water.
This produces coffee that is separated from the grounds. Hot brew coffee is ideally consumed immediately after it has been made.",Zoey Sky,01/29/2019

When you’re eating fruit, it’s second nature to throw away the peel, especially if you’re snacking on bananas or oranges. But did you know that eating certain fruit peels offer many health benefits?
Like the fleshy insides of fruits, the peel or skin is also full of various nutrients. Below is a list of fruit peels that you can eat to boost your overall health.
Apple peels store about one-third of the fruit’s nutrient content. An unpeeled raw apple has at least 332 percent more vitamin K, 142 percent more vitamin A, 115 percent more vitamin C, 20 percent more calcium, and around 19 percent more potassium than a peeled apple.


Additionally, you lose half the apple’s fiber when you remove the peel. Eating a peeled apple only nets you 2.1 grams of fiber, instead of 4.4 grams. According to the Journal of Molecular Structure, apple skin also has antioxidants that can help fight free radicals that destroy cells in the body.
Bananas are full of potassium. The yellow fruit also contains high levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter linked to appetite and mood.
Bananas also contain both soluble and insoluble fiber. This means snacking on an unpeeled banana can help you feel fuller and relieve any minor gastrointestinal problems.
Banana peels are easier to eat if you wait for the fruit to ripen, which will bring out the peels’ underlying sugary taste. You can either eat ripe banana peel on its own to get all its antioxidants, fiber, or nutrients, or you can cook with it. Try pureeing a small portion of sliced peels and add it into desserts, like cake.
Guava is full of vitamins A and C. Guava peel also contains dietary fiber that is good for your digestive health. This nutritious fruit also has antioxidants and potassium.
The dietary fiber in unpeeled guava can help promote healthy bowel movements and prevent constipation. In fact, consuming one guava will provide 12 percent of your recommended daily intake (RDI) of fiber.
Snacking on guavas, which only have only 37 calories per fruit, can also help you lose weight. Eat this fruit if you want to feel full longer.
If the thought of eating an unpeeled kiwi seems unappealing, remove the hairs on the surface of the skin before you consume the fruit. Kiwi skin, which is good for digestion and heart health, is also full of antioxidants and vitamin C.
Kiwi skin is nutrient-dense. The results of a study revealed that eating kiwi skin can triple your fiber intake, compared to eating peeled kiwi. Add whole kiwis to a smoothie and make a nutritious and delicious fruity drink.
Oranges have about 136 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. This vitamin is necessary for the formation of collagen in your skin. A potent antioxidant, vitamin C also helps boost iron absorption in the body.
If you’re not sure how to eat orange peels, brew them with warm water. Let it steep for several minutes so the vitamin dissolves, then drink the orange peel tea. (Related: Nine Good Reasons to Eat Orange Peels.)
Alternatively, you can:
Citrus fruit peels, such as lemons and oranges, also contain vitamins A and B, along with minerals like calcium and selenium.
Orange peels also contain fiber and two flavonoids called nobiletin and tangeretin. These flavonoids may have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.
The next time you’re snacking on these fruits, save the peel and cook with it or eat it right away to enjoy its nutritional benefits.

Digestive issues like bloating or heartburn can be inconvenient and even painful, but knowing what kinds of food to eat can ease the discomfort that they cause. If you often suffer from these conditions, add more easy-to-digest foods to your diet.
Various digestive problems like bloating, Crohn’s disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or indigestion can be treated by consuming foods that require “less digestive effort from your body.”
The foods listed below are nutritious, and most importantly, they are easy on the digestive system.


Some individuals may have trouble digesting nuts and seeds, which contain anti-nutrients. Thankfully, you can deactivate these gut-harming nutrients.
When nuts and seeds are “activated” or soaked, the anti-nutrients in the skins of these foods are broken down and rinsed away.
Soak the following nuts and seeds to make gut-friendly meals or snacks:
Compared to cooked fruits, raw fruits have more enzymes and nutrients. If you have a digestive issue, your body will have trouble breaking down raw fruits.
Cooking fruits give you a head start on digestion by making the food easier to break down. Always select non-citrus fruits because they are less likely to trigger reflux symptoms compared to acidic fruits.
The following cooked fruits are easy to digest:
To improve your digestion, peel and cook these fruits over low to medium heat. High heat can make them boil, which will increase their sugar content. Most fruits can be cooked on low to medium heat for 5-10 minutes, or until they start to break down. Take note that apples must cook longer compared to berries.
Raw vegetables are good for you, but they can cause stomachaches in certain individuals. Raw vegetables have more fiber, unlike cooked produce.
Cooking vegetables helps breaks down fiber, which makes them easier to digest.
Here are some vegetables that can help ease indigestion when cooked:
To make vegetables easier on your gut, cook them by roasting, sautéing, or steaming.
People with digestive problems have difficulty breaking down red meat.
If you want to relieve your stomach issues, eat eggs, poultry, and seafood. These foods are easier to digest and they require fewer enzymes, which means less gas or intestinal pains.
Poultry and seafood are also easier for your body to process, unlike fattier cuts of meat.
Easy-to-digest meats and proteins include:
When you’re already bloated or gassy, avoid foods that can make your condition worse. The foods listed below are harder to break down compared to a regular meal, especially if you’re already diagnosed with a health condition prone to digestive problems.
Cruciferous vegetables are chock-full of vitamins and minerals, but they also have a sulfuric quality that can cause severe digestive problems, even if they are cooked. (Related: The 5 Foods You May Want to be Avoiding in Your Diet.)
Avoid these vegetables if you have digestive issues:
Some people have trouble digesting foods that contain saturated fat, which requires more enzymes to break down than poultry. Some kinds of meat have a higher fat content that can cause discomfort if you have gallbladder issues or other low enzyme levels.
If you have sensitive digestion, eliminate the following meats from your diet to ease your condition:
Fruits are full of antioxidants and vitamins, but you may have trouble digesting them if they aren’t fully ripe or if you’re also eating the peel or skin of the fruit.
Avoid eating these unripe fruits:
As mentioned above, nuts and seeds have anti-nutrients. These proteins are designed to protect the plants from being destroyed in the wild.
However, these anti-nutrients don’t automatically go away when nuts and seeds are harvested. To neutralize them, most nuts and seeds must soak for several hours or even one whole day. Keep in mind that beans and grains also have anti-nutrients that are difficult to digest.
Unless you’re soaking these nuts and seeds, avoid eating them:
If you have digestive issues, making small sacrifices can help prevent or relieve bloating or indigestion. Add these easy-to-digest foods to your diet to improve quality of life and address your digestive problems.

https://food.news/2019-01-27-mental-health-benefits-of-ginger.html,Here’s what research shows about the mental health benefits of ginger,"Advertisement
Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory that also offers other health benefits. In fact, the versatile plant can even help boost your mental health.
Ginger (Zingiber officinale) comes from the rhizome or root of a flowering plant native to China, but the spice can grow in any area that is warm and humid. Aside from its use as a natural remedy for digestive disorders, ginger can also be used to address arthritis, memory loss and dementia, and muscle aches and pains.
Thanks to scientific research, experts are beginning to understand how ginger works. To date, research has identified over 100 compounds in ginger. More than 50 of these are antioxidants, which is crucial to brain health since the organ is vulnerable to free radical damage.
Ginger is often used as an anti-inflammatory, making it a popular natural remedy for arthritis. The plant’s anti-inflammatory property can also help people with brain disorders like ADHD, Alzheimer’s, anxiety, brain fog, and depression, which are often associated with chronic inflammation of the brain. Experts believe that ginger’s anti-inflammatory effects on the brain are due to two unique compounds called 6-shogaol and 10-gingerol.
Like the Indian spice turmeric, ginger also has a compound called curcumin. This compound is a natural antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral. Curcumin is a potent herbal brain supplement ingredient that can help address anxiety, brain aging, depression, and neurodegenerative diseases. (Related: What Happens To Your Body When You Start Eating Ginger Every Day.)

Your body is constantly under attack from oxidative stress. Oxygen in the body splits into single atoms with unpaired electrons, and electrons can often be found in pairs. These atoms, called free radicals, scavenge the body to find other electrons so they can become a pair. When these atoms are paired, they cause damage to cells, DNA, and proteins. Studies show that free radicals are linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, cancer, and Parkinson’s, among others.
Your brain is prone to free radical damage since it requires a lot of oxygen. Free radicals are caused by common factors like:
Antioxidants in ginger can also protect the brain from further damage and memory loss after a stroke.
Ginger increases the level of two of the most important brain chemicals: dopamine and serotonin. Depression is strongly associated with deficient levels of both chemicals.
Dopamine is called the “motivation molecule” because it helps you focus and be productive. Dopamine is also in charge of your pleasure-reward system. Meanwhile, serotonin is known as the “happiness molecule” because it helps sustain a positive mood.
The spice is traditionally used to treat memory loss and dementia and research has determined that ginger can help improve other cognitive functions besides memory. According to a study, healthy adults given dried ginger supplements showed improvements in attention, reaction time, and working memory.
People with diabetes also rely on ginger as a natural remedy because it can help control blood sugar, especially if you are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Ginger has antioxidants called gingerols that enhance insulin sensitivity and prevent certain neurological diabetic complications.
Ginger is an effective remedy that can minimize the pain of migraine headaches. The spice has similar effects to sumatriptan, a commonly prescribed migraine drug that narrows blood vessels to the brain. But unlike sumatriptan, which is associated with negative side effects, ginger can relieve migraines without any side effects.
Ginger, which comes in many forms, can be used as a food and as a supplement. Ginger supplements are available as capsules, crystals, essential oils, extracts, loose powder, and tinctures.
A typical dose of ginger is one gram, and the best way to ingest this dose is by taking two ginger capsules. Most supplements contain at 500 milligrams (mg) per capsule.
Below are some ginger dosage equivalents:
When consumed as a food, especially fresh, ginger is considered very safe with little to no side effects. However, when too much ginger is consumed in other forms, especially powdered ginger, it may cause side effects such as bloating, gas, heartburn, and nausea.
Ginger also functions as a blood thinner. Avoid taking it as a supplement if you take blood-thinning medication such as warfarin. If you take diabetes or high blood pressure medications, talk to a healthcare professional to determine adjustments to your medication if you want to take supplemental ginger.
Ginger is a versatile herbal remedy that can help relieve digestive upset, and it also offers various benefits for brain health and function. Add fresh ginger to your diet or take it as a supplement to enjoy its many benefits and improve both your physical and mental well-being.

https://food.news/2019-01-26-nutritional-recommendations-age-related-macular-degeneration.html,It’s possible: Nutritional recommendations that prevent age-related macular degeneration,"Advertisement
Saffron is a highly-prized spice with many uses. However, according to several studies, the spice can also be used to reduce your risk of developing age-related macular degeneration.
Macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in adults aged 50 and older. In the U.S., over 11 million older Americans have some degree of macular degeneration linked to aging. At least 30 percent of individuals aged 75 have the eye condition in the country.
Thankfully, studies have shown that some plant carotenoids can help lower your risk of developing macular degeneration or even delay its progression. Some studies have also determined that you can boost your eye health by taking at least 20 milligrams (mg) of saffron extract.


Macular degeneration occurs when a person is exposed to ultraviolet light and visible light. The condition can also be caused by chemical stresses from too much glucose or oxygen in the bloodstream. These factors can make the retinal light-sensing cells break down.
If you are continually exposed to these factors, you can eventually suffer from vision loss and blindness.

To prevent degeneration, you need to preserve the structural integrity of the macula. You can do this by taking saffron supplements that can help protect the macula and prevent the breakdown of the light-sensitive cells at its center. Thanks to these benefits, saffron can help address the root cause of age-related macular degeneration.
In an initial saffron study, patients who were in the early stages of age-related macular degeneration were given either a placebo or 20 milligrams (mg) per day of saffron. The study findings determined that the improvements in eye responses to light were noticeably stronger in the group that took saffron. This suggests that saffron intake is associated with healthier retinal cells. (Related: Saffron cures macular degeneration.)
According to the results of a second saffron study, participants who took saffron had stronger visual acuity, that is, sharpness in distance vision. The researchers noted that saffron supplementation helped improve the light-sensing abilities of the eyes and delay the progression of macular degeneration. After three months, volunteers from the second study “could see another full line on the eye chart.”
The researchers who conducted the second study said that taking 20 mg of saffron per day also had longer-term health effects. They found that after 14 months, participants could see two more additional lines on an eye chart. Researchers suggested that longer term supplementation of saffron may offer more benefits for eye health.
If you wish to improve your eye health, increase your intake of the nutrient alpha-carotene. Individuals who have high levels of alpha-carotene in their systems have about a 32 percent lower risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration.
Increase your intake of foods with alpha-carotene, and take saffron extracts together with other key retina-strengthening nutrients to keep your eyes healthy.
Keep in mind that the benefits of saffron and alpha-carotene are boosted by the intake of nutrients such as astaxanthin, cyanidin-3-glucoside, lutein, and zeaxanthin are taken.
The following foods contain nutrients that can boost the benefits of saffron and alpha-carotene:
Saffron is a fragrant spice used in cooking and it comes from the crocus flower (Crocus sativus).
In traditional medicine, saffron was used to treat health conditions like:

https://food.news/2019-01-26-taking-a-closer-look-at-how-ayurvedic-diet-prevents-cancer.html,Taking a closer look at how the Ayurvedic diet prevents cancer,"Advertisement
Ayurvedic seasonal eating involves food consumption that is both physically and energetically aligned with a particular time of year. However, as seasons change, most people adopt the Standard American Diet (SAD) instead, which is often linked to increased rates of conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and neurological disorders. To address this alarming concern, experts are advocating an eating plan called the Ayurvedic diet, which can help lower cancer risk.
Ayurveda, a traditional Hindu system based on preventative health, is concerned with harmonizing all aspects of a person’s mind, body, and spirit. Ayurveda aims to balance the physical body, which is made up of five natural elements: fire, water, air, earth, and ether (space).


These elements express themselves as doshas, or primary elements and energies that exist in the body. The three doshas are the Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas. Practitioners of Ayurveda believe that each person will express the doshas in their own unique way. The dosha also correspond to specific functions in the body.
If your doshas are unbalanced, you can develop diseases. On the other hand, balancing these can boost your health. Ayurvedic Ritucharya is a systematic method that balances the doshas through eating habits.
These eating habits are designed to help you become aligned with the rhythms of nature, which are also your own natural rhythms. In Ritucharya, each season coincides with to the Dakshinayana, or the gradual movement of the earth around the sun. Meanwhile, seasonal changes are related to particular tastes and changes in the doshas.
To illustrate, the summer months are associated with an “accumulation” and an “aggravation” of Pitta. This can cause common summertime aggravations like fevers, inflammation, and skin rashes. Ayurvedic Ritucharya recommends the consumption of Pitta-calming foods during the hot summer months, like fruits and vegetables, ghee (considered “tridoshic” in Ayurveda), sweet foods, and astringent and bitter tastes (e.g., lemon and coconut water).
However, even the birthplace of Ayurveda isn’t immune to the negative side effects of the SAD diet. In 2011, a report published in AYU, the international quarterly journal for research in Ayurveda, revealed that the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified India as a country at risk of having “most of the lifestyle disorders in the near future.”
To improve unhealthy eating habits, you can follow Ayurvedic Ritucharya or consume more organic and in-season produce.
Below are four reasons why eating fresh and organic produce from your region is good for your overall well-being.
The only downside of buying local organic produce is its shorter shelf-life. However, this is a small price to pay since you are consuming nutritious food that is also free from pesticides and GMOs.
If you want to lower your cancer risk, try following the Ayurvedic diet and consume more in season, organic produce.

https://food.news/2019-01-23-does-green-tea-really-deserve-its-health-halo.html,Does green tea really deserve its health halo? Experts say yes,"Advertisement
Whether you’re a green tea enthusiast or you drink tea occasionally to cut back on your caffeine intake, you’ve probably heard that this kind of tea is one of the most beneficial drinks out there. While not all of the claims listed below are accurate, health experts confirm that green tea is a healthy drink that can boost your overall well-being.
In an article on Good Housekeeping (GH), Nutrition Director Jacklyn London helps debunk 10 claims about green tea. London also confirms some of the health benefits of the popular superfood.


Green tea and matcha are two different things.
Matcha is still part of the green tea “family,” but it undergoes a slightly different farming process. Matcha is consumed in powder form instead of whole leaf form, which means matcha is a more concentrated version of green tea.
Choose matcha if you want to consume the higher caffeine and theanine version of green tea.
Green tea can boost your metabolism.
Some small-scale studies have determined a connection between an increased metabolic rate and the consumption of at least four cups of green tea daily. London noted that “the only truly variable factor in your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is increasing your lean body mass, a.k.a. building muscle.”
To boost your metabolism for the long-term, start strength training. This kind of training is essential for bone, immune, and muscle function, and these three factors can help support metabolism over time.
Green tea can burn belly fat.
This claim is false, especially since there is no food or drink that can “spot train” specific body parts. Once you make changes to your diet for a new plan where you burn more energy than you consume, chances are you’ll be burning off some additional fat mass, especially around your stomach.
Beware of green tea beverages, such as green tea “flavored” drinks, sparkling green teas with added sugar, and sugary lattes. These sugary beverages are often associated with weight gain over time, particularly near your abdomen.
Green tea can lower cancer risk.
Research data has confirmed that green tea does contain antioxidant compounds that can help fight cancer. But other plant-based diets are always associated with a minimized cancer risk, along with other chronic diseases, like diabetes and heart disease.
Eating lots of vegetables and drinking unsweetened green tea ensures that your diet contains polyphenolic compounds, a type of antioxidant that can help lower your risk of developing chronic diseases by boosting the cellular function of tissues, which helps prevent the growth of cancer cells.
Green tea can promote weight loss.
A person who often drinks sugary beverages like energy drinks, soda, or sweetened coffee and tea regularly will lose weight once they switch to unsweetened green tea. The number one source of added sugar and added calories in the American diet is sugar-sweetened beverages, so always choose a calorie-free alternative.
To lose weight for the long-term, make healthier choices and stay hydrated with sugar-free drinks.
Green tea can prevent heart disease.
In population studies, individuals who often consume unsweetened green tea “are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease later in life.” However, a lot of these population studies are specific to region and genetics. To illustrate, studies conducted in Japan and Taiwan, where green tea is “consumed regularly and consistently,” often involve people who could have a genetic predisposition to the benefits of green tea.
Meanwhile, population studies conducted in the U.S. and in other countries suggest that there is a connection between the consumption of unsweetened versions of any kind of tea with better cardiovascular health and minimized chances of developing other types of chronic diseases, particularly those linked with obesity. (Related: Daily green tea consumption found to slash dementia risk by up to 86%.)
Green tea has anti-aging properties.
Green tea has antioxidants that scavenge for free-radicals in the cells of the body. These antioxidants can help protect and prevent damage to tissues, such as skin. However, no single food or beverage can cure cancer.
Health experts from the GH Health, Beauty and Environmental Labs noted that green tea catechins called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) can help protect skin from UV damage. EGCG is a natural polyphenol antioxidant that can also help prevent cell damage.
Green tea helps lower blood sugar.
Drinking unsweetened green tea can help lower blood sugar. Just make sure you’re not drinking green tea-flavored drinks that are full of sweeteners.
Green tea is caffeine-free.
While this claim isn’t always true, some types of green tea are caffeine-free. If you’re trying to cut down on coffee, green tea is a great alternative because it has a lower caffeine content.
A cup of home-brewed coffee contains at least 100 milligrams (mg) of caffeine. On the other hand, tea only contains about 25 to 50 mg, depending on the type of tea and brew strength.
Green tea has calming properties.
Green tea’s calming effect may vary. It contains L-theanine, an amino acid that is associated with alertness and mood-enhancement. Study findings show that l-theanine consumption is linked to “reduced anxiety and improved focus.” This benefit is highly based on personal tolerance, so skip the green tea if you’re sensitive to caffeine.
Drink green tea regularly to enjoy the benefits above and to boost your overall health.

https://food.news/2019-01-23-veggies-and-fruits-for-psychology-wellbeing.html,Incorporating more vegetables and fruits in your diet causes IMMEDIATE improvements to your psychological well-being,"Advertisement
Following a healthy diet offers many benefits for your overall well-being. According to a study, eating more fruits and vegetables can also be good for your mental health.
The study, which was published in the journal American Journal of Public Health (AJPH), was a collaborative effort by researchers from the University of Queensland in Australia and the University of Warwick in England.
The results of the study suggest that eating at least eight servings of fruits and vegetables per day is linked to “immediate improvements to psychological well-being.”


According to the researchers, incorporating more vegetables and fruits in your diet can help lower your risk of depression and increase happiness levels.
For the study, the researchers analyzed data from a survey completed by more than 12,000 participants. The volunteers were selected at random and assessed in terms of their psychological well-being. They were also told to keep a food journal.
The volunteers who consumed little to no fruits or vegetables on a regular basis were instructed to follow a plan that included at least eight servings of fresh produce daily. The researchers observed significant increases in the well-being of the patients who followed the new diet.
The improvement in the mental health of these patients happened almost immediately in some cases and continued for more than two years.
The researchers noted that the healthy diet for managing depression offered more benefits when the participants consumed more servings of fruits and vegetables on average. The overall happiness and well-being of the patients increased when they were given an additional portion of vegetables or fruits per day, and the effect was observed when they were given about eight servings of fresh food.

Data from the study showed that while consuming more fruits and vegetables can improve a person’s heart health or prevent cancer and heart disease in the long-term, it can boost their happiness levels more quickly. (Related: Have you heard of the MIND diet? Learn how to boost your mental health with this new healthy eating plan.)
The study results were adjusted if the participants’ personal circumstances or incomes changed to influence study results. However, the findings suggest that managing depression with a healthy diet is a more effective and safer choice compared to the use of prescription drugs, which are often associated with negative side effects.
These findings are relevant, especially since some studies have determined that the typical Western diet doesn’t include enough fruits and vegetables. Additionally, a Western diet is often full of carbohydrates, processed foods, and sugar. A diet full of foods associated with increasing the risk of depression can only spell trouble for your mental health.
This is the first study of its kind to show that eating fresh fruits and vegetables regularly can effectively fight depression. The researchers added that there is a connection antioxidant-rich foods and optimism, which could be the result of higher levels of carotenoids in the blood.
Eat more of these fruits and vegetables regularly if you want to improve your mood and fight depression:

An improper diet has consequences for your physical health. However, a study has confirmed that the consumption of processed meats can also negatively affect your mental health.
The study was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.
Earlier research has determined that psychiatric disorders are usually aggravated by a poor diet.
The study, which was conducted by researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine, has revealed that the consumption of cured and processed meats may cause mania, especially in individuals who have already been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The researchers examined more than 1,000 participants, and the group included persons both with and without psychiatric disorders.


The researchers studied the diets of the volunteers, and the findings showed that people who often consume foods such as hot dogs, jerky, salami, and other processed meats with nitrates had a tendency to be in an abnormally elevated mood state.
This “manic state” is characterized by symptoms such as hyperactivity, persistent insomnia, and unfounded euphoria.
Other cured and processed foods that contain nitrates include:
The study results determined that individuals hospitalized for manic episodes were more than thrice as likely to have consumed nitrate-cured meats compared to those who have never been diagnosed with a serious psychiatric disorder.
The researchers have also confirmed that eating certain kinds of food can impact gut bacteria composition and could have a major role in several psychiatric conditions.

In a separate study, scientists analyzed the correlation between nitrates and mania using rat models.
The rats in the study were fed a similar ratio of food with nitrates as a human might consume. The test results revealed that the gut bacteria of the rats that ingested food with nitrates had different patterns than the subjects that didn’t consume the same kind of food.
The researchers also reported differences in their brains that resembled bipolar disorder in humans. This highlights the need for the psychiatric community of healthcare providers to acknowledge the importance of improving one’s diet.
While the cause of many psychiatric disorders remains unknown, genes and family history are often considered factors for these conditions. Researchers are still exploring environmental factors, such as diet, to determine if what a person eats can affect their mental health. (Related: Effects of the Mediterranean-style diet on depression, mental health.)
Research on nitrates and mental health confirms that certain diets, and possibly the amounts and types of bacteria in the gut, can trigger mania and other disorders that affect the brain.
Manic states can endanger individuals because they can make people prone to delusional thinking and risky behavior. Manic states can last weeks or months, and in a lot of cases, manic individuals may need hospitalization. This is alarming since bipolar disorder affects at least one to three percent of the population.
For decades, nitrates have been used to cure and preserve meat. Recent studies have confirmed that the regular consumption of cured meats is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and some types of cancer.
To avoid nitrates in food, make lifestyle changes and follow a healthy diet that includes organic meat, fruits, and vegetables. Proper nutrition can promote brain and cellular health, hormonal balance, and an ideal body chemistry. These factors can help improve your mental health and significantly minimize your risk of developing psychiatric disorders.

https://food.news/2019-01-22-fennel-reduces-postmenopausal-symptoms.html,Study confirms the effectiveness of fennel for reducing postmenopausal symptoms,"Advertisement
Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a herb that is used to infuse dishes with a delicate flavor similar to anise. The herb possesses medicinal properties, and a study has revealed that fennel can be used to help reduce the symptoms of postmenopause.
The study was published in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).
Fennel is traditionally used to treat different health issues like digestion and premenstrual symptoms. According to the press release of the NAMS study, fennel is also an effective remedy that can also be used to manage postmenopause symptoms that include anxiety, hot flashes, sleeplessness, and vaginal dryness without any serious side effects.


For the study, researchers conducted a small trial that involved 79 Iranian women. The researchers completed the study in Tehran, Iran, since the average age of women at menopause in the country is younger (48.2 years) compared to the U.S. (51 years).
The female participants, who were aged 45 to 60 years old , were given soft capsules containing 100 milligrams (mg) of fennel twice a day for a period of for eight weeks. The researchers compared improvements between the women from the intervention and placebo groups at four, eight, and 10 weeks. The results of the trial revealed a significant statistical difference between the two groups.
The study findings suggest that fennel is a natural and safe treatment that can effectively minimize menopausal symptoms without severe side effects. This study is one of the first clinical studies that analyzed the benefits of fennel for managing menopause symptoms.
Some of the most common symptoms of menopause include:
An earlier study has already confirmed that the beneficial herb can be used to manage premenopause symptoms.
The findings from these studies have helped identify safer complementary and alternative medicines that can be used to manage menopause symptoms, and these remedies have caught the attention of women who are interested in risk-free alternatives to hormone therapy (HT).
HT, which is one of the most effective treatments for managing most menopausal symptoms, is often associated with negative side effects that deter women from resorting to this kind of treatment. Other women prefer herbal medicine because they aren’t suitable candidates for HT, or they want to avoid the side effects of the treatment.
The herb fennel has essential oils with phytoestrogenic properties. Phytoestrogens are chemicals in plants that have similar properties to estrogen and they can be used to cure many menopausal symptoms. (Related: The amazing benefits of fennel seeds.)

https://food.news/2019-01-19-reishi-strengthens-immune-system.html,Reishi mushroom show tremendous promise in strengthening the immune system,"Advertisement
Reishi mushrooms (Ganoderma lucidum), also known as lingzhi mushrooms, are commonly used in traditional medicine to address various health conditions. According to research data, the potent mushrooms can also be used to boost the immune system.
Researchers believe that reishi mushrooms have powerful antiviral properties that can help strengthen the immune system. Consuming the mushrooms may also help “optimize immune function and lower the risk of many diseases.”
As people get older, they become more susceptible to immunosenescence. This condition is associated with the gradual decline of the immune system due to aging.


The immune system helps fight bacteria, destroy emerging cancer cells, and turn off the inflammatory response in the body once threats have been eliminated. However, because of immunosenescence, the elderly are at greater risk of developing health problems caused by inflammation and infections, which may cause conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.
In response to the growing concern about the health implications of immunosenescence, researchers are turning to recently discovered complex compounds in reishi mushrooms that can “help regulate and support an aging immune system, reduce inflammation, and prevent heart disease and cancer.”
Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine use reishi mushrooms to treat different conditions because the ancient remedy allegedly has healing and antiviral properties. Due to these qualities, the mushroom is even called “mushroom of immortality.”
Through modern technology, scientists have been able to learn how and the reishi mushroom can boost the immune system and supporting better health as people age. They noted that the potent mushroom has different “‘pharmacologically active compounds” that can safely and effectively slow down the aging process and boost overall health.
Continual inflammation is one of the markers of different conditions associated with aging, such as bone and joint disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. According to studies, reishi mushrooms, which have anticancer properties, can be used to prevent cancers of the breast, cervix, colon, lungs, ovaries, and prostate. (Related: Reishi mushroom powder is an effective treatment for mouth ulcers.)
The anticancer properties of the mushroom help strengthen immune system cells so the body can effectively expel invaders. The mushroom supports B and T lymphocyte and “natural killer” cell development, allowing the immune system to more effectively target and destroy cancer cells and viral invaders.
Additionally, reishi mushroom extract can deactivate carcinogens, inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and promote apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells. Some studies suggest that reishi mushrooms can also help fight depression and fatigue, boost heart health, and control blood sugar.
Researchers are currently trying to determine the potential medical applications of the antiviral and healing compounds in these mushrooms. A strong immune system is crucial to your overall health, and emerging scientific data suggest that reishi mushroom compounds may help boost immune function.
With continued research, health experts may one day determine how reishi mushrooms can address the side effects of immunosenescence so people can remain in the peak of health even as they grow older.
Unlike other foods or supplements, reishi mushroom dosages can vary based on which type of mushroom is consumed.
Reishi mushroom extract can also be made into a tea and consumed daily. Always consult an herbal medicinal expert before you start taking reishi mushrooms to determine the proper dosage for your condition.

https://food.news/2019-01-19-fruits-that-raise-blood-platelet-levels.html,These fruits found to raise blood platelet levels in patients with dengue fever,"Advertisement
When a person has dengue fever, they can experience symptoms like thrombocytopenia, or low platelet levels. This condition can range from mild to severe, depending on its underlying cause. To raise your platelet levels, you can consume healing fruits like kiwi or papaya.
Thrombocytopenia is a common symptom of dengue, and it is characterized by the drastic decrease of platelets in the blood. If a patient experiences low platelet levels because of dengue virus, they may feel dizzy and weak. A dengue patient with thrombocytopenia may also feel pain in their joints.


You can naturally increase the platelet levels of a person with dengue fever by feeding them the healing fruits listed below.
These four fruits can be processed into juice drinks if the patient is too weak to consume them as is. Juicing the fruits also makes it easier to absorb their nutritional content.
Blood is made up of different types of cells that float in a liquid called plasma. The three types of blood cells include red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (or thrombocytes).
When skin is injured or broken, platelets clump together and form clots to stop the bleeding. However, if you don’t have enough platelets in your blood, your body is unable to form clots.
If you have a low platelet count, you are suffering from a condition called thrombocytopenia. Some people with the condition experience severe bleeding, and they can die if they don’t receive medical treatment immediately.
However, other individuals with thrombocytopenia may not experience any symptoms.
In some cases, a low platelet count is caused by a medical condition like leukemia or certain medications. Treatment will often address the condition causing the thrombocytopenia.
The common symptoms of a low platelet count include:
Severe cases of thrombocytopenia may involve internal bleeding that includes symptoms such as:
Consult a healthcare professional immediately if you experience any signs of internal bleeding.
In very rare cases, thrombocytopenia may cause bleeding in the brain. If you have a low platelet count and experience headaches or any neurological problems, seek medical attention right away.

https://food.news/2019-01-17-5-health-benefits-of-eating-pineapples.html,"From preventing bloating to reduced cancer risk, here are 5 health benefits of eating pineapples","Advertisement
The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a nutritious tropical fruit, and you should consume fresh pineapples if you want to keep your bones healthy and lower your risk of developing cancer.
The best way to reap the benefits of this fruit is to drink fresh pineapple juice and eat organic fruits. Listed below are the five health benefits of eating pineapples.
Pineapples are full of nutrients and healthy antioxidants. These molecules can help the body fight oxidative stress.


Oxidative stress occurs when there are too many free radicals in the body. Free radicals interact with the body’s cells, and they cause damage linked to chronic inflammation, a weakened immune system, and various diseases. The fruit is also full of antioxidants called flavonoids and phenolic acids. (Related: 8 natural remedies that can cure preventable diseases in the U.S.)
Pineapple contains bromelain, a group of digestive enzymes that can help reduce bloating in the stomach. Bromelain acts as proteases that can break down protein molecules into their building blocks, like amino acids and small peptides.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports that the bromelain in pineapples can also help minimize the inflammation and swelling that occurs in some conditions like arthritis flare-ups, sinusitis, and sore throat.
Consume pineapples if you’re recovering from an infection or injury. Bromelain can also hasten healing time and minimize bruising, pain, and swelling after injuries and surgery.
The bromelain in pineapples can prevent blood clots. These enzymes can help reduce excessive coagulation of the blood, making the fruit the perfect snack for frequent fliers and other individuals who are at risk for blood clots.
Cancer is a chronic disease that is linked to uncontrolled cell growth, and the progression of the disease is often associated with oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. The results of some studies suggest that pineapple and its compounds can help lower cancer risk since they can minimize oxidative stress and reduce inflammation.
These compounds include bromelain, and test-tube studies have revealed that bromelain can suppress the growth of breast cancer cells and stimulate cell death. Other findings have determined that bromelain can “stimulate the immune system to produce molecules that make white blood cells more effective at suppressing cancer cell growth and eliminating cancer cells.”
Pineapple contains essential minerals like calcium and manganese that promotes bone health and strengthens connective tissue. Researchers from the University of Maryland Medical Center suggest that manganese helps prevent osteoporosis and ease symptoms of the bone disease by boosting improve overall bone and mineral density.

A 5.8-ounce cup (165 grams [g]) of pineapple chunks only has 82.5 calories. The serving also has the following nutrients:
Vitamin C is necessary for proper growth and development and a strong immune system. The vitamin can also promote the proper absorption of iron from the diet.
Pineapples also have vitamins A and K, along with calcium, phosphorus, and zinc.
Always consult a healthcare professional before you increase your intake of pineapples, especially if you have allergies or diabetes.

https://food.news/2019-01-17-cravings-and-lack-of-protein.html,Are you constantly craving salty or sweet foods? You may be lacking protein,"Advertisement
If you’re not getting enough protein in your diet, you can experience symptoms such as hair loss or a craving for salty and sweet foods. But what can you do to ensure that you get enough protein in your diet?
If you’re experiencing some of the symptoms below, you may be suffering from a protein deficiency.
You need to include enough protein in your diet because it is a major component of every cell in your body. This crucial building block also makes up your hair, skin, nails, muscle, and cartilage.


The body also needs protein so it can produce enzymes, hormones, and neurotransmitters, which are all required so your body can function normally.
Per government guidelines, an average person’s protein consumption should be 0.8 grams (g) per kilogram (kg) of body weight. For the average sedentary woman, this is equivalent to 46 g of protein per day, or 56 g for men.
If you eat meat, you can get protein from the following sources:
These sources contain all the essential amino acids that the body needs to function properly. (Related: 21 Foods Richer in Protein Than an Egg.)
If you’re a vegetarian, you can get protein from eggs, dairy, and whole grains. Pescatarians can also get protein from fish.
Protein sources for vegans include beans or pulses (e.g., chickpeas, lentils, and soybeans), grains, soy foods, and whole grains (e.g., brown rice and quinoa). Add nuts and seeds with amino acids and essential fatty acids that are necessary for optimal health.
Consume protein-rich foods daily and spread them out throughout a day to effectively build muscle. Since protein is a complex nutrient, it requires more energy to break down, unlike carbohydrates. Eating protein boosts your metabolic, which can promote weight loss.
If you’re trying to lose weight, consuming healthy foods that contain protein can also curb cravings, make you feel fuller for longer, and reduce your appetite.

https://food.news/2019-01-16-vr-shows-how-perception-of-real-food-is-altered-by-surroundings.html,Food scientists use VR to show how our perception of real food is altered by our surroundings,"Advertisement
When you’re eating, your meal doesn’t just involve the taste of the food that fills your belly. Eating also involves other senses like sight and smell. According to the results of a study on virtual reality (VR), people are also “influenced by the environment in which they eat.”
For the study, which was published in the Journal of Food Science, food scientists from Cornell University used VR technology to demonstrate how an individual’s perception of real food can change because of their surroundings.


Robin Dando, associate professor of food science and senior author of the study, explained that when a person eats, they perceive the taste and aroma of food along with sensory input from their surroundings, such as visual and auditory stimuli. It may even include certain memories evoked by their surroundings.
For the study, researchers observed at least 50 panelists who used virtual reality headsets as they were fed three identical samples of blue cheese. The volunteers were then virtually placed in one of three VR environments:
The panelists were then shown custom-recorded 360-degree videos. The study participants, who were unaware that they were given identical cheese samples, rated the pungency of the blue cheese considerably higher in the cow barn setting compared to when they were in the sensory booth or the virtual park bench.
To control for the pungency results, the panelists also rated the saltiness of the three samples. The results showed that there was no statistical difference between them.
Dando said that the project aims to develop an affordable and easy-to-implement method for adapting VR technology that can be utilized in food sensory evaluation. (Related: Virtual escape: Hospital in-patients using VR to alleviate boredom, stress, pain.)
Your environment is also crucial to your eating experience. Dando noted that you eat in surroundings that can influence your perceptions of the food. He added that VR food sensory evaluation offers advantages such as convenience and flexibility, especially since it can reduce the cost and effort required to manually build physical environments.
The findings suggest that VR can be used for this kind of testing since it allows participants to experience an immersive environment during testing. Dando concluded, “Visually, virtual reality imparts qualities of the environment itself to the food being consumed — making this kind of testing cost-efficient.”
Sensory evaluation, also called sensory analysis, refers to “the process of evaluating consumer products using the five senses.” Through sensory analysis, consumer panels are organized to test various products before they are sold in stores. Using the results of these tests, manufacturers can determine whether or not a product will become popular among consumers.
Food and drink companies often use sensory evaluation to test their products, and these companies ask consumer panels to test products while analysts record their responses.
Panels may be chosen based on certain criteria, while others can be picked at random. However, a random sampling usually provides a better gauge of the general public.
Using the data from panel responses, analysts make predictions that can help manufacturers improve their products. Consumer evaluation is crucial to determining how successful, or unsuccessful, a product can be. Through consumer evaluation, companies get feedback on a product before it is released to the public.
There are three types of sensory evaluation:

Garlic has a distinctive pungent odor. This can be off-putting for some people, while others are drawn to garlic’s aroma, especially when it’s used to make savory dishes. But did you know that eating garlic raw offers certain health benefits?
Practitioners of folk medicine believe that chewing raw garlic helps release some active substances that can cure conditions such as:


Some of these benefits have been confirmed by scientific research, and data has proven that garlic contains a beneficial compound called allicin. When fresh garlic is chopped, it releases the enzyme alliinase, which then results in the formation of allicin.
Allicin breaks down to form healthy organosulfur compounds. It also possesses anti-fungal, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties, and chewing raw garlic regularly can help fight off harmful organisms that can cause various diseases.
However, once garlic is cooked, heat may inactivate alliinase. Experts suggest crushing garlic and letting it stand for at least 10 minutes before cooking to let the alliinase work before heat inactivates it.
Research has also determined that garlic contains amino acids, vitamins, and minerals that can boost your overall well-being. Data from a study, which was published in the journal Advances in Therapy, showed that consuming garlic regularly can help strengthen your immune system. (Related: Garlic is a safe, delicious, and inexpensive way to improve your health.)
As a preventive measure, chew two cloves of garlic daily. This can also help boost your cardiovascular health. If you already have a cold and you want to avoid the negative side effects of prescription drugs, chew more than two garlic cloves daily until you feel better.

Aside from strengthening your immune system, garlic also has other health benefits.
Before you eat raw garlic or take garlic supplements, take note that it may cause some minor side effects such as:
Consult a healthcare professional before you increase your garlic intake, especially since it can thin the blood. This can be risky for people with a bleeding disorder or those scheduled to undergo surgery.
If you’re interested in reaping the benefits of eating raw garlic but are also wary of having bad breath, eat it with an apple. You can also drink a mix of apple vinegar, honey, and water after you chew on some garlic cloves.

https://food.news/2019-01-15-not-all-fats-are-bad-for-you.html,Not all fats are bad for you – learn which ones you should include in your diet,"Advertisement
If you’re trying to lose weight or make healthier dietary choices, you may be under the impression that all kinds of fats are bad for you. But this isn’t exactly true. There are four kinds of fats, and you actually need some of them to maintain your overall wellness.
All fats share a similar chemical structure, which is a chain of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms. However, the four kinds of fat differ from each other because of the length and shape of the carbon chain and the number of hydrogen atoms connected to the carbon atoms.


Trans fats, the worst type of dietary fat, are produced due to hydrogenation. This turns healthy oils into solids, which keeps them from going rancid. Trans fats don’t have health benefits and there is no safe level of consumption for this kind of fat. It’s officially banned in the U.S.
During the early part of the 20th century, trans fats were usually found in solid margarine and vegetable shortening. Food makers eventually discovered new ways to use partially hydrogenated vegetable oils to cook foods like commercial cookies and fast-food French fries.
Eating food that contains a lot of trans fats increases the amount of “bad” low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in your bloodstream, and reduces the amount of “good” high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.
Trans fats cause inflammation, a condition associated with health problems like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and other chronic conditions. This kind of fat aggravates insulin resistance, and this raises your chance of developing Type 2 diabetes.
Small amounts of trans fats are also bad for you. For every two percent of calories from trans fats that you eat daily, your heart disease risk goes up by a whopping 23 percent.
The American diet contains a lot of saturated fats, especially if you love cheese, coconut oil, red meat, whole milk (along with other whole-milk dairy foods), commercially prepared baked goods and other food products. This kind of fat is solid at room temperature.
“Saturated” refers to the number of hydrogen atoms surrounding each carbon atom. The chain of carbon atoms contains a lot of hydrogen atoms. In other words, it’s saturated with hydrogen.
Even if they aren’t as bad as trans fats, consuming a lot of food full of saturated fats may increase total cholesterol. This is linked to the increase of LDL cholesterol that may cause blockages to form in arteries in the heart and other parts of the body. To prevent this, keep your consumption of saturated fats to below 10 percent of calories daily.

Unlike saturated fats, the “good” fats in fish, nuts, seeds, and vegetables have fewer hydrogen atoms bonded to their carbon chains. Healthy fats remain liquid at room temperature.
Beneficial fats are grouped into two broad categories: monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. (Related: Nuts may be tiny but they are powerhouses when it comes to improving your health.)
Monounsaturated fat (oleic acid) has a single carbon-to-carbon double bond, which means it has two fewer hydrogen atoms compared to saturated fat. It has a bend at the double bond, which keeps the fat liquid at room temperature.
Foods that are rich in monounsaturated fats include:
In the 1960s, the results of the Seven Countries Study revealed that monounsaturated fat can be healthy. Data from the study showed that individuals who lived in Greece and other parts of the Mediterranean had a low rate of heart disease even if they followed a high-fat diet.
Researchers discovered that this was because the main fat in their diet was olive oil, compared to countries that consumed a lot of saturated animal fat. The latter is linked to higher rates of heart disease. Olive oil is mostly made up of monounsaturated fat, which highlighted the benefits of the Mediterranean diet.
There’s no recommended daily intake of monounsaturated fats, but the Institute of Medicine suggests using them whenever you can together with polyunsaturated fats instead of consuming foods that contain saturated and trans fats.
Polyunsaturated fats are essentials fats, and this means they’re required for normal body function. However, the human body can’t produce this kind of fat.
You need to consume food that contains polyunsaturated fats since they are required to build cell membranes and the covering of nerves. Additionally, they are crucial for blood clotting, inflammation, and muscle movement.
Polyunsaturated fats have two or more double bonds in their carbon chain, and there are two main types: omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. The numbers indicate the distance between the beginning of the carbon chain and the first double bond. Both types have different health benefits.
When you consume food that contains polyunsaturated fats instead of saturated fats or highly refined carbohydrates, you help lower harmful LDL cholesterol. This also improves your cholesterol profile and lowers blood pressure and triglyceride levels.
Foods rich in omega-3s include canola oil, fatty fish (like salmon and sardines), flaxseeds, unhydrogenated soybean oil, and walnuts. Omega-3 fatty acids can help prevent and cure heart disease and stroke.
Omega-6 fatty acids can also help prevent heart disease. Sources include linoleic acid and vegetable oils such as corn, safflower, soybean, sunflower, and walnut oils.
To stay healthy, make sure your diet contains little to no trans and saturated fats, along with moderate levels of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.

https://food.news/2019-01-14-eating-bright-yellow-foods-can-make-you-happy.html,Study reveals that eating bright yellow foods can make you happy,"Advertisement
When you’re feeling sad, seeing a pop of color can help brighten your day. According to a U.K. study, eating yellow foods can also help improve your mood.
The study, which was conducted by The Happy Egg Company, one of the largest free-range egg brands in the U.K.., gathered responses from about 1,000 survey participants. The researchers reported that the consumption of yellow foods releases significant levels of happy hormones since people often associate bright colors – like yellow – with joy.
The findings showed that 70 percent of the participants associated yellow foods with the feeling of happiness. The top-ranking yellow food was a plate of omelettes, with 61 percent of the respondents reporting that it “made them the most cheerful.”
Macaroni and cheese (56 percent) came in second, followed by pancakes (54 percent) and poached eggs (53 percent). Lemon cake (52 percent) also made it to the list.
More than two-thirds of the participants want to see more yellow in their fridges, and 30 percent of the respondents associate yellow with happiness compared to other colors. (Related: How to increase your serotonin levels with strategic eating.)
Psychologists posit that this is because people react positively to the color yellow from a young age, especially since it evokes “the warmth of sunshine and brightly [colored] children’s toys.”
Experts also suggest that yellow resonates with the left side of the brain, which is associated with logic. The left side of the brain makes people think of yellow as a “fun and happy” color.
Red foods came in second in the list, while brown foods ranked third. However, blueberries were the least popular food item because people associate blue with sadness.
In the study, researchers also measured the response time of individuals who were answering questions about food colors and happiness. The findings revealed that when choosing yellow, the overall response time was at least 31 percent faster than any other color.
Dr. David Lewis, a neuropsychologist, explained that while earlier findings have determined that color can affect emotions, the results of this study were surprising. The researchers didn’t expect that many yellow food groups “evoked such strong positive feelings as well as stimulating taste buds.”
Yellow vegetables can do more than evoke happiness. Yellow veggies are full of antioxidants, vitamins, and other health-boosting components.

https://food.news/2019-01-14-boswellia-extract-has-healing-and-anti-inflammatory-properties.html,Boswellia extract exhibits profound healing and anti-inflammatory properties,"Advertisement
Arthritis is the term for a debilitating condition that affects a person’s musculoskeletal system, and it is characterized by knots, painful and swollen joints, and stiffness in the affected parts of the body. It can severely affect a person’s ability to accomplish daily tasks, especially when their arthritis is flaring up. Thankfully, several studies have determined that a powerful herb with anti-inflammatory effects can help relieve arthritis.
Boswellia extract comes from trees that grow in dry, mountainous areas in India, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. The tree that produces the extract is often used in traditional medicine because it has potent anti-inflammatory and healing qualities.
There are 25 species of boswellia, but a certain plant called Boswellia serrata (Indian frankincense) has the most potent medicinal effects. Boswellia’s most powerful medicinal properties can be found in the tree resin, which has acids and compounds that can promote positive body chemistry and reactions, such as free radical-scavenging properties. This helps trigger the anti-inflammatory response in the body that’s associated with various healing effects.
A person with arthritis can benefit from boswellia extract since it can help reduce pain, swelling, and other symptoms associated with various forms of the condition.
Due to boswellia extract’s anti-inflammatory properties, medical professionals have started studying the plant’s potential to treat inflammatory conditions.
To date, research suggests that the extract can be used to ease inflammatory diseases such as bursitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and tendonitis. Boswellia extract can also be used to help prevent autoimmune disease, certain types of cancer, and headaches. Additionally, the extract can improve muscle strength, hasten wound healing, and support skin health.
Some of the factors that can affect the onset and progression of arthritis, a common inflammatory disease, include:
Making certain lifestyle changes can help a person manage the side effects of arthritis, such as eating healthily, exercising regularly, losing weight (if needed), or taking medication for pain and inflammation. However, unlike prescription painkillers, boswellia can fight inflammation and the other symptoms of arthritis minus the adverse side effects of the former.
Aside from addressing arthritis, boswellia extract can also treat conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and inflammation of the colon. The extract also has compounds that help protect the liver, regulate blood lipids, release blocks in the arteries, and relieve pain. (Related: Boswellia is a powerful anti-inflammatory herbal extract that can prevent cancer.)
Data from a 2003 study determined that Boswellia serrata can help individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee. The study observed two groups: one that was given the extract and another that was given a placebo for eight weeks. The two groups were then reversed.
The findings revealed that the participants who took the boswellia extract reported a considerable reduction in pain and swelling while comfort and flexibility improved. Volunteers who took the extract were also able to walk long distances. The studies that involved individuals with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis also reported that they experienced health benefits because of the extract.
These findings are proof that boswellia extract can be the key to curing arthritis or developing a treatment that addresses its symptoms.
There is currently no established ideal dosage for boswellia extract. However, studies have confirmed that it does possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Reports indicate that 150 milligrams (mg) to 400 mg per day can help relieve inflammation depending on an individual’s current health status.
If you have arthritis and you’re currently taking other medications, consult a healthcare professional about possible drug interactions before taking boswellia extract.

https://food.news/2019-01-14-seed-oils-are-the-best-choice-for-people-looking-to-improve-their-cholesterol.html,Seed oils are the best choice for people looking to improve their cholesterol,"Advertisement
According to a study, if you want to effectively lower your low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL or “bad” cholesterol) you must replace saturated fats with unsaturated fat. You can do this by switching from other kinds of cooking oil to healthier options such as seed oils.
The study was published in the Journal of Lipid Research.
Since there are many kinds of cooking oil to choose from, it can be hard to decide on a healthy option. A lot of studies which suggest both mono- and polyunsaturated fats are better for blood lipids than saturated fats replaced one food source at a time, and this can make it harder to identify which vegetable oils are good for heart health.
Blood lipids refer to all the fatty substances found in your blood, like cholesterol and triglycerides. If you have too much cholesterol (fat) in your blood, you have a greater risk of having a heart attack.
To address this dilemma, Lukas Schwingshackl, a researcher at the German Institute of Human Nutrition, has turned to sophisticated statistical tools to verify the findings of research concerning cooking oils.
For the study, the researcher team used network meta-analysis. This emerging technique helped “extract insight from published studies on the effect of various dietary oils on blood lipids.”
The study findings imply that seed oils are the best choice for individuals who want to improve their cholesterol.
Because of the lack of a large study comparing all available oils, Schwingshackl et al. constructed a network meta-analysis to illustrate how different oils and solid fats have been matched up. To do this, they collated 55 studies from the 1980s that analyzed the effects of consuming the same amount of calories from two or more different oils on the blood lipids of volunteers.
The studies included in the analysis must compare the effect of two or more oils or fats (from a list of 13 options) on participants’ LDL, or other blood lipids (e.g., total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins [HDL-cholesterol], or triglycerides) for at least three weeks or longer.
Schwingshackl said that using this method, the researchers were able to compare various interventions simultaneously. The results produced a ranking that made it easier to say which was the best oil for a specific outcome.
The final ranking in the study confirmed that solid fats (e.g., butter and lard) are the worst choice for LDL. It also revealed that the best oils are made from seeds such as flaxseed, rapeseed, and sunflower seeds. (Related: Black Cumin Seed Oil – The Most Powerful Oil for Your Health.)
Schwingshackl said that there were some things to consider for the results of the study. Since it only measured blood lipids, the study doesn’t present “a hard clinical outcome.” He added, “LDL is a causal risk factor for coronary heart disease, but it’s not coronary heart disease.”
He also explained that meta-analyses may be misleading, especially since they tend to combine “low-confidence data into a falsely confident-sounding ranking.” To illustrate, for this study there was a lack of evidence to determine a clear “winner” out of all the seed oils. While seed oils can help lower LDL, they may have adverse effects on triglycerides and HDL cholesterol.
Despite these factors, Schwingshackl believes that researchers can use network meta-analysis to successfully synthesize disparate clinical studies for future research.

https://food.news/2019-01-13-study-shows-people-who-live-near-fast-food-restaurants-type-2-diabetes.html,Study: Those who live near fast food restaurants are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes,"Advertisement
Junk food is bad for your health, and the regular consumption of fast food is often linked to problems like obesity. According to a U.K. study, simply living near a fast food restaurant can even increase your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.
The study, which involved a collaboration between researchers from the Healthy High-Density Cities Lab at the University of Hong Kong and Oxford University, was published in the journal Lancet Planetary Health. It is also the largest study concerning Type 2 diabetes and exposure to fast food chains.
The researchers who conducted the study are lobbying for a better public health model so individuals who live in cities full of fast food chains can become healthier. The researchers also believe that the implementation of health interventions can help address the nutritional imbalances caused by an individual’s proximity to fast food restaurants.
The team of scientists acknowledged that while the study only identified a link between fast food proximity and Type 2 diabetes risk, the findings verify earlier studies which indicate that residing near fast food chains is a risk factor for both obesity and Type 2 diabetes.
For the study, researchers evaluated 350,000 men and women from all over the U.K. and their proximities to fast food restaurants. (Related: Fast food prior to pregnancy found to increase risk of gestational diabetes.)
The research team discovered that in certain streets throughout the U.K., individuals had limited access to healthier food options. Study findings showed that people who resided in the densest cluster of fast food restaurants had an 11 percent higher risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to individuals who lived in a street that is at least one kilometer (km) away from fast food chains.
The authors said that the results of the study “have important public health implications.” To resolve this alarming concern, cities in the U.K. must make the switch from an “exclusively corporate-driven economic model to a public health-driven health economic model of urban food access and consumption.”
In 2018, the U.K. government urged all restaurants to label the calorie content in their menus so customers can make healthier decisions.
The researchers believe that national-level policies can encourage and give the food industry the incentive to make healthier changes to their menus. Dr. Chinmoy Sarkar, the lead author of the study, concluded, “We have to move away from the economic model to a more public health model.”

If you have Type 2 diabetes, it doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy the occasional snack. You just need to make sure that you eat foods from the healthy snacks listed below.
These foods are full of fiber, healthy fats, and protein and you can eat them without any guilt. These snacks also contain nutrients that can help keep your blood sugar levels under control.

https://food.news/2019-01-12-wasabi-can-help-prevent-cancer.html,"Sushi lovers, rejoice: Wasabi can help prevent cancer","Advertisement
If you’ve eaten sushi, you might have noticed that your meal usually comes with a green paste called wasabi (Japanese horseradish). Not everyone likes this pungent Japanese condiment, but according to a study, it could be the key to curing cancer.
The study was published in the Oxford Journal.
Data from the study showed that wasabi may prevent and inhibit cancer cell growth. In the study, researchers assessed the effectiveness of isothiocyanates (ITCs) in wasabi when used to treat bladder cancer.


Wasabi is full of isothiocyanates, and the study suggests that the organic compounds can be used to develop a natural cure for cancer. Studies have shown that ITCs can “strongly inhibit” the development and progression of cancer.
Once ITCs are inside cancer cells, the compounds can bind to proteins and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death). This means that once cancer cells are exposed to isothiocyanates, they commit suicide.
Isothiocyanates can also be found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.
Other vegetables that contain isothiocyanates include:
The study originally set out to test the compound more generally to verify its efficacy. The researchers also wanted to determine if cruciferous vegetables can inhibit the development of bladder cancer cells. (Related: Natural matcha green tea extract found to effectively kill breast cancer cells.)
When the study began, the researchers initially tested an ITC-rich form of mustard seed powder.
The results of the study have gone beyond the initial goals of the researchers involved in the project. Additionally, the study findings confirmed a known fact: that cruciferous vegetables are very effective when it comes to inhibiting cancer growth.
When an individual has untreated bladder cancer, tumors can invade surrounding muscle tissue. This occurs in more than 70 percent of cases.
During the course of the study, participants who received ITC lowered the spread of the tumor down to almost 35 percent. The researchers added that the spread of cancer to nearby muscles went down by an incredible 100 percent.
This isn’t the first study of its kind to confirm the cancer-fighting properties of ITCs. A separate study on isothiocyanates, which involved a collaboration between Dr. Fung-Lung Chung of Georgetown University and Dr. Anthony Di Pasqua, a bioinorganic chemist from the University of North Carolina, had similar findings.
Unless they’re treated immediately, bladder tumors can grow and spread rapidly. In most cases, bladder tumors are treated aggressively with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical interventions. However, these forms of treatment are associated with major risks and negative side effects. There are even cases where the entire bladder of a patient must be removed.
If you want to boost your bladder health and lower your risk of this type of cancer, consume more foods with ITC. Consuming ITC-rich foods allows the beneficial compounds to enter the urine. If the urine is still in the bladder, any cancer cells that are also present are exposed to ITCs and the cancer cells will then destroy themselves.
Natural health communities, and even people who simply enjoy eating sushi, are happy to learn about the findings of this study on wasabi and ITCs, which revealed that wasabi has at least 40 times the ITC of broccoli.
In Japanese cuisine, the root vegetable wasabi is grated into a paste or sauce and used as a condiment. Japanese culture prizes wasabi since it can help prevent various illnesses and improve a person’s overall well-being.

https://food.news/2019-01-11-the-dangers-of-aspartame-explained.html,The dangers of aspartame explained,"Advertisement
Whether you have diabetes or you’re trying to lessen your sugar intake, chances are you’ve already replaced table sugar (sucrose) with an artificial sweetener called aspartame. This sugar substitute has fewer calories, but studies have shown that the use of aspartame also comes with various health risks.
A popular type of artificial sweetener, aspartame is often used as an alternative to table sugar. Since it is at least 160 to 220 times sweeter than sucrose, you’ll use less aspartame when preparing food. Some people mistakenly believe that this means they can use as much aspartame as they want, especially if they have a sweet tooth.


However, manufacturers use aspartame to create different kinds of “low sugar” or “zero calorie” beverages, candies, dairy products, and jellies.
In the 1970s, a study revealed that an artificial sweetener called saccharin caused cancer of the bladder (urinary) in laboratory rats.
But the studies that followed suggest that the use of saccharin did not have the same results in humans. Because of this, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changed the safety label of saccarin from “hazardous” to “generally recognized as safe.”
While this seems like good news, take a moment to reconsider the use of any artificial sweetener. In a separate study, Dr. Robert Walton reviewed various research studies conducted on aspartame. The findings showed that out of the 166 studies analyzed, 74 were funded by companies that produced aspartame. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the results of all 74 studies say that aspartame is safe for human consumption.
Meanwhile, 92 percent of the 92 independently funded studies revealed that there were health risks linked to the consumption of aspartame. These contradicting results highlight the fact that the authenticity and conflict of interest in numerous studies should be reconsidered.
Aside from an increased cancer risk, studies are still trying to confirm some of the side effects of aspartame, which may include:
People who use aspartame also report digestive problems such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A lot of individuals who consumed products made with the artificial sweetener also reported symptoms such as generalized cramps, joint pain, and numbness in the legs.
The results of another study that involved 200 people with migraines determined that participants who consumed aspartame suffered from more headaches compared to the rest of the volunteers.
Aspartame is also bad for individuals who have been diagnosed with phenylketonuria, a genetic disease. If you have phenylketonuria, your body is unable to break down phenylalanine. This substance can be found in aspartame. If a child with phenylketonuria doesn’t limit their intake of aspartame, they may suffer from abnormal brain development. (Related: Bombshell study shows aspartame depletes neurotransmitters in the brain, makes brains vulnerable to chemical damage from food and vaccines.)
Even if the FDA has deemed aspartame as “generally recognized as safe,” individuals who have depression, mood disorders, or phenylketonuria should avoid using the harmful sugar substitute. Instead of jeopardizing your health by consuming aspartame, follow a healthy diet and use safe and natural sugar substitutes instead.

Research is ongoing to determine the negative side effects of aspartame. If you want to follow a healthier diet even if you have a sweet tooth, consider using these natural sugar substitutes instead of aspartame.
Like other beverages and foods, you still need to limit your consumption of these “natural” sugar substitutes since they have a lot of calories and little to no nutritional value.

https://food.news/2019-01-11-chewing-areca-nut-can-prevent-cancer.html,Chewing areca nut can prevent cancer,"Advertisement
Since ancient times, people from certain locations such as Africa and Asia have customarily chewed areca (betel) nuts to strengthen community ties. According to a study, the areca nut, which comes from the areca palm (Areca catechu), may also possess anti-cancer properties.
The study, which used mice models to test the anti-cancer properties of the nuts, was published in the journal Molecular Cell.
The habit of chewing areca nuts can help clean and strengthen teeth, but the study has proven that green and yellow areca nuts also contain an active substance called arecoline. Study findings also suggest that the nuts may help protect against the Warburg effect, which refers to a condition where cancer cells grow rapidly. (Related: Emerging research shows that a natural citrus fruit extract can prevent cancer growth.)


The researchers explained that arecoline substances in areca nuts can help inhibit the growth of cancer cells, especially in conditions such as leukemia and lung cancer. Based on study findings, after the mice that were previously given cancer cell leukemia and lung cancer were administered an injection of arecoline substances, cancer growth significantly slowed down.
The team of researchers said, “Uniquely, these arecoline substances do not affect the growth of normal blood cells.” They added that the areca nuts must be studied further to verify the current findings.
The researchers concluded that arecoline is a “powerful and selective anti-cancer substance” and that it can potentially be used to develop a natural and effective cure for cancer.
Aside from its anti-cancer properties, studies have shown that areca nuts offer other benefits.
Areca nuts, which are also known as betel nuts, comes from the areca tree.

Do you like sushi or egg salad? If you’re pregnant, you may need to avoid these foods, especially since you have to be twice as careful about your diet if you’re with child. Don’t risk your health by eating something that might make you sick, such as mayonnaise.
Mayonnaise ranks high in the list of foods that pregnant women need to avoid because the condiment, especially homemade mayo, includes raw egg whites. Even if you’re not pregnant, you could get sick by eating anything made with raw eggs that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria.


In most cases, only the mother will experience the symptoms of a Salmonella infection. These may include:
Sometimes, a Salmonella infection can cause cramps in the uterus. In rare cases, these cramps may result in premature birth or stillbirth.
Other foods that are often made with raw eggs include:
When you’re pregnant, you need to cook egg-based dishes thoroughly to avoid Salmonella. This bacteria can also harm the fetus if you get infected. A pregnant woman with Salmonella can also experience dehydration and other infections. (Related: Foods and Herbs That Must Not be Taken During Pregnancy.)
Pregnant women should also avoid mayonnaise because it is high in saturated fat and calories. Eating calorie-rich foods like mayo when pregnant can make you gain excess weight, and this can cause complications during childbirth.
According to the American Heart Association, you should limit your intake of foods with saturated fats that can also be found in butter, cheese, red meat, and other animal-based foods. Science-backed data has confirmed that saturated fat can raise “bad” cholesterol and increase your risk of heart disease.
Eating mayonnaise when pregnant can also increase your risk of listeriosis, an infection caused by the Listeria bacteria. This condition is also linked to the consumption of raw eggs during pregnancy.
Most mayonnaise products also contain preservatives that are bad for your health while other types of mayonnaise have a high salt and sugar content.
If you’re pregnant, exercise discipline when it comes to your diet. Ask yourself if it’s worth risking your baby’s health whenever you feel the urge to eat an egg salad or a sandwich with some mayo in it.
Being pregnant means you become responsible not just for yourself but also for your baby’s life. You can ensure their health by avoiding the other dangerous foods included in the list below.

https://food.news/2019-01-10-cocoa-cough-medicine-study.html,Cure for coughs found in chocolate? Study finds that cocoa is effective cough medicine,"Advertisement
Chocolate is often considered a guilty pleasure because the delicious treat is rich in calories, fat, and sugar. However, study findings have revealed that chocolate can help treat a cough.
In an interview with The Daily Mail, Professor Alyn Morice, who is the head of cardiovascular and respiratory studies at the University of Hull, said that chocolate “can calm coughs.” This may sound too good to be true, especially for chocolate lovers.


Professor Morice, who is also a founding member of the International Society for the Study of Cough, is an independent clinician and she has spent several years studying the mechanism of cough. Professor Morice explained that while this sounds unbelievable, it is a fact that is backed by verified scientific data.
The professor referenced a European study on over-the-counter (OTC) cough remedies. In the study, researchers found that patients who took a new medicine with cocoa had “a significant improvement in their cough and sleeplessness” after only two days, unlike the participants who took standard cough syrup.
Professor Morice added that there are other studies which prove that chocolate can help calm coughs.
Prior to the European study, scientists from Imperial College London discovered that theobromine, an alkaloid in cocoa, can suppress coughs more effectively than codeine. (Related: Dark chocolate is good for your heart.)
Codeine, an ingredient often used in cough medicine, is linked to many negative side effects. The common side effects of codeine include constipation, dry mouth, and nausea or vomiting. The ingredient can also cause serious side effects like difficulty breathing, muscle stiffness, seizures, or symptoms of low blood pressure (e.g., feeling dizzy and tired).
Scientists believe that chocolate can effectively calm coughs since cocoa has demulcent properties. A demulcent is any substance that can help relieve inflammation or irritation.
Chocolate is stickier than typical cough syrup, and it can form a more effective coating that helps protect the nerve endings in the throat that trigger your urge to cough. Honey and lemon have the same effect, but the remedy isn’t as effective as chocolate.
Professor Morice advised that drinking hot chocolate won’t have the same effect since the cocoa in the beverage “isn’t in contact with the throat long enough to form a protective coating.”
She concluded, “Slowly sucking on a piece of chocolate may provide some relief, but I think it is the way the chocolate compounds work with other ingredients in the [cough syrup] which make it so effective.”
Unlike the sugary variations of chocolate, dark chocolate is full of nutrients that can boost your health. To make sure that the chocolate you eat is actually nutritious, buy high-quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content. Dark chocolate with a lot of cocoa contains soluble fiber and various minerals.
A 100-gram (3.5-ounce) bar of dark chocolate with 70 to 85 percent cocoa has:
Dark chocolate is also rich in phosphorus, potassium, selenium, and zinc.
Take note that even dark chocolate, which has health benefits, should still be consumed in moderation. A 100-gram bar of chocolate is too much to eat in one sitting, and it also contains 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar.

The food you eat nourishes gut bacteria, and these bacteria then produce essential nutrients that fight off pathogens, guide immune responses, and keep you healthy. Now, according to a study by researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine, it may be possible to manipulate gut bacteria and prevent disease.
In theory, learning how and why certain bacterial strains humans ingest can thrive in the large intestine while others are rejected may help scientists find out how to manipulate the makeup of thousands of bacterial species to boost overall health or help prevent diseases. However, gut ecology is complex, making this task seem impossible.


For the study, researchers tested laboratory mice to find out they can manipulate the mice’s diet to influence the engraftment of a particular bacterial strain.
The team of researchers shared that they have discovered how to control how much a bacterium grows in the intestine by adjusting the amount of a specific carbohydrate in each mouse’s food or water.
Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, associate professor of microbiology and immunology, explained that everyone has a microbial community in their gut that formed in an uncontrolled manner during the first few years of life. As you grow older, you continue to acquire new strains.
However, this acquisition is “a poorly orchestrated and not-well-understood process.” Dr. Sonnenburg posited that the study results imply that it is possible to reshape the microbiome to boost health and fight off disease. (Related: Gut bacteria “signatures” predict how the body will respond to poor food choices, predicting risk for diabetes, heart disease.)
The growing field of probiotics, which involves beneficial live bacterial cultures naturally found in food like yogurt or supplements, illustrates the need for the public to be educated on the importance of gut bacteria. Not everyone takes probiotics or consumes yogurt, but everyone “unknowingly consumes low levels of gut-adapted microbes” throughout their life. Regardless of the source, experts still don’t know why one bacterial strain is more successful over another.
Dr. Sonnenburg et al. wanted to find out if a dietary boost could help certain bacterial strains survive in the human gut microbiome. The team started the study by visiting the San Jose Wastewater Treatment Facility to acquire members of the genus Bacteroides. This is the most prominent genus in the human gut microbiota.
The researchers searched for strains that can digest nori, an ingredient relatively rare in American diets. Nori is nutritious, and the seaweed is often used in sushi rolls and other Japanese foods. A separate study has determined that four grams of nori contain 2.4 micrograms (mcg), or 100 percent of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) of vitamin B12.
Researchers screened the bacteria collected in the primary effluent to find a strain that can use porphyran, a carbohydrate found in nori. Dr. Sonnenburg said that in humans, the genes that allow a bacterium to digest porphyran are very rare in people who don’t usually consume seaweed. He added that this let the researchers test how they can bypass the rules of complex ecosystems.
To do so, the researchers created “a privileged niche that could favor a single microbe by allowing it to exist in the absence of competition from the 30 trillion other microbes in the gut.”
After the researchers identified a strain of Bacteroides that could consume nori, the team tried to introduce the seaweed into three groups of laboratory mice.
Two mice groups had their own gut bacteria eliminated and replaced with the naturally occurring gut bacteria taken from two healthy human donors. Both individuals donated exclusively to each mice group. The third group of mice retained a conventional mouse-specific community of gut microbiota.
The test results showed that when the mice were fed a typical diet, the strain that could digest porphyran engrafted in two groups of mice to varying and limited degrees. One mice group with human gut bacteria completely rejected the new strain. Meanwhile, the mice group that followed a diet enriched with porphyran-rich diet produced significantly different results: the bacteria steadily engrafted at similar levels in all the mice.
Dr. Sonnenburg also said that she was able to “precisely calibrate” the population size of the engrafted bacteria by changing the amount of nori that the animals consumed. She noted that the results of the dilution experiment were extraordinary and that it clearly showed the direct effect of diet on the bacterial population.
After the researchers confirmed that they could manipulate the engraftment and growth of the bacterial strain, they also managed to prove that the genes required for the digestion of porphyran exist as a unit. These genes could be engineered into other Bacteroides strains to give them the same engraftment advantage. The researchers are now trying to identify other genes that may give similar dietary abilities.
Dr. Sonnenburg stated that for the past decade, gut microbes had been proven to be connected to various aspects of human biology. Thanks to the study, the research team was also able to show that these bacteria are “very malleable.” The research team is hopeful that their discovery can be used to revolutionize how precision health is practiced.
The study was published in the journal Nature.

https://food.news/2019-01-09-research-finds-that-eating-breakfast-helps-obese-people-become-more-active.html,Research finds that eating breakfast helps obese people become more active,"Advertisement
According to the results of a study, if you want to lose weight effectively and become more physically active, you shouldn’t skip breakfast. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, a leading diet and nutrition journal, examined connections between breakfast and health for obese people.
The study involved health scientists working at the Department for Health who compared the test results of two sets of participants: a fasting group and a breakfasting group. For the study, both groups ate similar amounts of food overall.


Based on the results of the study, eating breakfast didn’t make obese individuals lose weight but it did help them become more physically active in the morning. Breakfast consumption also helped reduced food intake later in the day.
The researchers noted that since “[increasing] activity is one of the most important ways to improve health” in an increasingly sedentary population, educating the public about the benefits of consuming a healthy breakfast regularly may help promote proper nutrition and regular exercise. (Related: Eating breakfast before exercise may “prime” your body to burn more carbohydrates.)
The results of this study on an obese group of volunteers referenced data from earlier studies by researchers at the University of Bath regarding the effects of eating breakfast in a “lean” population. The two studies are part of the three-year Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)-funded “Bath Breakfast Project” (BBP).
The combined results of these studies resulted in insights that are currently considered as “some of the most comprehensive to date into the effects of eating breakfast.” The study results also helped Dr. James Betts, the lead researcher of the BBP, win the prestigious Cuthbertson Medal from the Nutrition Society.
Researchers wanted to test for the potential connections among three factors: breakfast, body weight, and health. Dr. Betts said that even though many people have different opinions about “whether or not you should eat breakfast,” there is currently a lack of “rigorous scientific evidence” that proves how or even if eating breakfast could improve one’s health.
He noted that the study helped emphasize some of these impacts, but the importance of breakfast still “depends on the individual and their own personal goals.”
To illustrate, if a person wants to lose weight, there isn’t enough data to support the assumption that only eating breakfast or skipping it will significantly affect your weight. But Dr. Betts added that based on other markers of a healthy lifestyle, such as being more physically active or strictly controlling and monitoring blood sugar levels, there is sufficient proof that eating breakfast can help.
For the study, researchers conducted the obese trial by grouping participants, who were aged from 21 to 60, into two groups: “fasting” and “breakfasting.” The scientists measured the outcomes of the study during a six-week period.
The majority of existing research is limited to surveys of a large number of people. However, for this study researchers intensively tested a focus group in tightly-controlled conditions. This means the relevant effects of breakfast or fasting on the body can be studied without requiring data from thousands of people.
The breakfasting group was instructed to consume at least 700 kilocalories (kcal) by 11:00 a.m. The first half of the food for this group was consumed within about two hours of waking. The fasting group only consumed water until noon.
The participants were allowed to choose what they wanted to eat for breakfast, and the scientists wish to continue their research to determine if results will differ based on different breakfast types. Further study can help the researchers determine effective recommendations regarding the kind of food sources and nutrients that could best improve an individual’s overall well-being.

A study has revealed one more reason to stop eating fast food: it is linked to the “the rising prevalence of asthma and allergies, especially among children.”
Published data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey has revealed that over one in three Americans consume fast food every day.
Aside from being a major factor in the obesity epidemic, fast food is also significantly affecting children’s health.


In 2013, an international study that involved a team of researchers from Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Spain, and the U.K. published their findings from a Phase III study called the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC).
ISAAC, which was first published in the peer-reviewed journal Epidemiology, highlighted alarming facts about fast food consumption:
The research team posited that “a causal link between fast food, asthma, and allergies is plausible,” especially since fast foods are full of “trans fatty acids, sodium, carbohydrates, and sugar… and possibly preservatives.” These ingredients are confirmed to have immune-mediated inflammatory effects on the body.
Obesity is a known risk factor for asthma and the various ingredients often found in fast food can significantly increase a child’s risk of becoming obese or overweight.
The ISAAC study references self-reported questionnaire data, and survey-taking is usually regarded as a weaker type of evidence, especially when compared to other more rigorous scientific methods like randomized controlled trials. Questionnaires may ask study participants to remember their dietary habits over the past 12 months, and this kind of information can easily be forgotten or at least fabricated.
Despite these considerations, sample sizes were “impressively large.” The ISAAC study involved data from 319,196 children aged 13 to 14 years old and 181,631 kids aged six to seven from about 100 different countries.
The scientists reported that there is a reason why a healthy diet is the best prevention for respiratory conditions like asthma. Consuming fruit regularly is linked to various protective health benefits.
Study data also showed that adolescents and children who consumed fruit three or more times a week were 11 and 14 percent less likely, respectively, to develop severe asthma.

Citrus fruits can boost your immunity and even help fight cancer. According to a study, citrus fruits can also be crucial to the prevention of weight-related health problems.
The study findings showed that citrus fruits like grapefruits, lemons, limes, and oranges have a type of antioxidant that can help neutralize serious health risks of obesity. The researchers advised that consuming more citrus fruits can help an overweight individual minimize their risk conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or liver disease.


When you consume a high-fat diet, your body will store the fat it can’t immediately use in cells all over your body. These fat cells will then produce a substance that harms other healthy cells. This occurrence is called oxidative stress.
The immune system and its antioxidants usually address oxidative stress. But in overweight people, especially those who regularly consume high-fat foods, oxidative stress may overwhelm the immune system’s ability to respond and prevent disease. (Related: Prevent obesity-related diseases with hooker chive.)
Citrus fruits are full of vitamin C, which can boost the immune system and improve skin health. Low in calories, citrus fruits also contain other vitamins and minerals that the body needs to function properly, such as:
Additionally, citrus fruits are full of plant compounds with many health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These nutritious fruits have at least 60 varieties of carotenoids, essential oils, and flavonoids that are behind many of the benefits of citrus fruits.
Citrus fruits are a good source of flavonoids that can help prevent neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Citrus fruit also contains flavanones, a type of flavonoid with antioxidant properties. Flavanones can help minimize the risk of oxidative stress and damage to healthy cells, which can reduce pressure on your overworked immune system.
Researchers conducted the study on several mice groups with different diets. Some mice groups were fed a normal diet, while the rest were placed on a high-fat diet.
The researchers gave the mice on the high-fat diet a dose of the flavanones found in citrus fruits. One month after the study began, these mice were tested for specific indicators in the blood and liver that indicate the presence of cell-damaging substances. The test results revealed that the mice fed a high-fat diet had a high level of these indicators.
Subjects on the high-fat diet that also ingested flavanones had a decreased level of indicators in their blood and liver. Some mice even had a reported 50 percent decreased, reported the researchers. Other mice that ingested flavanones experienced less damage and fat build-up in the liver. The scientists explained that while introducing flavanones to the mice on the high-fat diet helped minimize damage; it did not make the subjects lose weight.
Adding citrus fruits with flavanones to your diet can improve your overall well-being by negating the effects of fat cells on your body. Consuming these beneficial fruits can also help minimize liver damage and lower the amount of fat and glucose in your blood.
Regardless of your weight, a diet that contains citrus fruits can help lower your risk of developing conditions like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. In general, you must follow a diet full of fruits and various vegetables to keep your body strong and healthy.

If you suffer from an inflammatory disease such as arthritis, one of the most common causes of joint pain, daily life can be difficult. One way to naturally address this symptom is by making lifestyle changes like exercising regularly or following an anti-inflammatory diet.
Anti-inflammatory foods can help reduce the inflammation caused by various types of arthritis like ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.


Following an anti-inflammatory diet means you need to include “a family of vegetables that offer a powerhouse dose of inflammation-fighting elements,” cruciferous vegetables. Studies have shown that cruciferous vegetables have positive effects on the biological factors that cause inflammation in the body. (Related: Mediterranean diet reduces inflammation and degradation of cartilage in osteoarthritis patients.)
Below are some examples of cruciferous vegetables:
Other healthy anti-inflammatory food options include certain oils, fish, fruits and vegetables, nuts, spices, tea, and whole grains.
Follow a healthy diet with a lot of anti-inflammatory foods to relieve the symptoms caused by arthritis.
There are different types of arthritis, but most of them start with similar symptoms. These symptoms tend to worsen over time, but there are measures you can take to slow down the progression of arthritis.

Children are impressionable, and adults are often wary of what they say and do around kids to make sure that they don’t imitate any of their bad habits. But are adults being careless when it comes to the food choices of their children? According to a study, children who viewed junk food TV commercials accompanied by healthy lifestyle messages rated the products as more healthful, unlike children who watched other ads for similar products but with a different message.
The study, which was conducted by the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity (UCONN Rudd Center) at the University of Connecticut, was published in the journal Pediatric Obesity.


Jennifer Harris, the lead author of the study, said that the findings, which confirm the “health halo” effect of healthy messages in child-directed advertising for junk food, are a cause for public health concern. The health halo effect misleads individuals into overestimating the health benefits of a food product based on claims on its label.
In advertising marketed to children, food and beverage companies claim that healthy lifestyle messages, like those promoting regular exercise and good eating habits, teach children about health and nutrition. However, Harris, who is also Associate Professor in Allied Health Sciences and Director of Marketing Initiatives for the UConn Rudd Center, explained that the study did not find any proof that these advertisements educate children about fitness or nutrition. She warned that food companies may be using the practice because it is beneficial and makes children think that unhealthy food is good for them.
In the randomized controlled study, which was conducted from August 2015 to March 2016, researchers worked with 138 children who were seven to 11 years old.
The volunteers were made to watch three child-friendly TV commercials in one of three conditions:
After watching the ads, the children were instructed to rate the commercials and advertised products. The participants were also asked to provide attitudes about exercise and nutrition, and they consumed and rated both healthy and unhealthy snack foods. (Related: Junk food ads on TV strongly influence children’s eating habits.)
Findings from the study revealed that children who watched the health halo commercials rated the products advertised as “significantly healthier overall” compared to the other participants who viewed the other commercials. The children also thought that their parents would buy 1.1 of the advertised products with the health halo messages compared to 0.4 products in the junk food ads with a different message category.
There was no proof that health halo messages positively influenced the children’s health-related attitudes, and almost all of the children agreed that it is important to consume fruits and vegetables and to exercise daily. The TV ads did not affect the children’s ratings of how much they liked the healthy or unhealthy snacks offered to them.
Harris said that the study results corroborate existing research data that was unable to provide proof that health-promoting messages positively affect the health-related attitudes or eating behaviors of children. Instead, these messages mislead children about the healthfulness of TV commercials for certain food products. Harris concluded, “Such practices should be discouraged, including through industry self-regulatory programs.”

Coconut oil is a staple in any prepper’s pantry. Aside from being a shelf stable product, coconut oil is a nutritious substitute for cooking oil. Additionally, coconut oil has various survival uses. (h/t to TheOrganicPrepper.com.)
There are many different types of coconut oil, and two of them include refined or unrefined coconut oil.
Refined coconut oil is separated by heat. This type of oil, which is more heat-stable, can be used for cooking methods like frying. Refined coconut is flavorless and odorless. Refined coconut oil’s shelf life may vary from 18 months to 2 years. Refined coconut oil may lose some of its nutritional benefits, depending on the refining process used.


Unrefined coconut oil is also called virgin or extra-virgin coconut oil. This type of oil has the light scent and flavor of coconut, but these can diminish when used in cooking. This type of coconut oil contains the most nutritional benefits, and its shelf life can range from two to five years to “indefinite.”
Coconut oil contains “healthy” saturated fats that you need in your diet. Saturated fats can promote fat burning, and they can also provide both the brain and body with “quick energy.” These kinds of fat can help increase the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in your blood, and this can lower heart disease risk. (Related: Basic nutrition for survival: 10 food items to keep in your emergency cache.)
Coconut oil is made up of 50 percent lauric acid, an essential fatty acid. The only other natural and rich source of lauric acid is human breast milk. Once consumed, the human body turns lauric acid into monolaurin that has antifungal, antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, and antiviral properties. In short, lauric acid can significantly boost your immunity.
Below are some of the many science-backed health benefits of coconut oil, as compiled by the Coconut Research Center:
Coconut oil is non-toxic to humans, compared to other Big Pharma products.
Coconut oil has a melting point of 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24 Celcius). When stored above that temperature it will turn into a liquid, and below it will turn the oil into a solid. Turning into a liquid won’t damage coconut oil in any way.
You can extend the shelf life of coconut oil by storing it in a cool, dark place, but if you store it in the refrigerator it will turn hard. Soften solidified coconut by placing the sealed jar in a pan of hot water.
If you buy a large quantity of coconut oil, such as a one- to five-gallon bucket, use a dry and sterilized spoon or scoop to get enough oil for regular use.
To get the best results, raise or lower the temperature of coconut oil to reach the consistency of the item you are replacing. If you’re baking and the recipe needs shortening, briefly chill the coconut oil until it turns firm. When replacing cooking oil, melt the coconut oil until it liquefies.
You can replace the following with coconut oil:
Coconut oil is also a safe alternative to cosmetic products with harmful ingredients like parabens and petroleum products. The oil is also safe enough to use with children, who have extremely sensitive skin.
Aside from cooking, coconut oil can be used as:
With coconut oil, you can utilize the limited storage space in your survival stockpile to make room for other items that you may need to stock up on before SHTF.

https://food.news/2019-01-04-probiotics-reduce-the-need-for-antibiotics.html,"Probiotics reduce the need for antibiotics, new review concludes","Advertisement
Probiotics are a certain type of “good” bacteria that offers various health benefits when consumed, and some people take probiotics as supplements with the goal of populating their gut with beneficial microorganisms. However, data from a review has determined that probiotics can also be used to reduce the need for antibiotics among infants and children.
The review, which was published in the European Journal of Public Health, involved researchers from England, the Netherlands, and the U.S. who examined data from several studies about the health benefits of probiotics.


The researchers said that once the results from twelve studies were collated, the data showed that “infants and children were 29 percent less likely to have been prescribed antibiotics if they received probiotics as a daily health supplement.” When the analysis was repeated using only the highest quality studies, the results revealed that the percentage increased to a whopping 53 percent.
Dr. Daniel Merenstein, the study’s senior investigator and a professor in the Department of Family Medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine, explained that the finding implies that the regular consumption of probiotics may help reduce antibiotic use.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that there are at least two million cases of antibiotic-resistant infections in the U.S. annually, which also results in 23,000 deaths. Experts believe that resistance to the drug can be prevented by curbing the use of antibiotics. (Related: Probiotics reduce allergic response in infants.)
Dr. Merenstein, who is also the director of research programs in the Department of Family Medicine, commented that existing data already proves how the consumption of probiotics can minimize the incidence, duration, and severity of specific types of common acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. He added, “the question is whether that reduction is solidly linked to declining use of antibiotics, and we see that there is an association.”
Dr. Sarah King, the study’s lead author from Cambridge, England, noted that further studies in people of all ages are required, especially among the elderly. Continued research can help determine if the regular use of probiotics is associated with an overall reduction in antibiotic prescriptions. Proving this crucial link can significantly affect the use of probiotics in general medicine and consumers in general.
It remains to be seen how exactly probiotics help fight infections, particularly those in the respiratory and lower digestive tract. But Dr. Merenstein believes that there are several potential mechanisms, like probiotic production of pathogen inhibitors and immune regulation.
Experts still haven’t identified all the mechanisms that probiotic strains can leverage, but the majority of the human immune system can be found in the gastrointestinal tract. According to Dr. Merenstein, this means that “ingesting healthy bacteria may competitively exclude bacterial pathogens linked to gut infections and may prime the immune system to fight others.”
The study was supported in part by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics.
Probiotics refer to living microorganisms that, once ingested, offer different health benefits.

The Mediterranean diet is popular among dieters because it has many health benefits, such as promoting weight loss and preventing heart attacks. According to a study, the diet can also “influence the association between long-term air pollution exposure and health effects.”
The study involved researchers from the New York University School of Medicine.
Chris Lim, a doctoral student at the university, noted that earlier studies have determined that dietary changes, such as the addition of antioxidants, can help blunt the negative effects of short-term exposure to high levels of air pollution. For the study, the researchers set out to confirm the long-term effects of the diet. (Related: The Mediterranean Diet Reduces Mortality From All Causes.)


The Mediterranean diet includes foods that are rich in molecules called antioxidants. These molecules can disarm free radicals, which are oxidized and highly reactive molecules that have been confirmed to cause cell and tissue damage.
The Mediterranean diet favors whole and single-ingredients and foods such as:
Researchers examined data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Diet and Health Study. The study covered a 17-year period which followed 548,699 individuals. The participants, who had an average age of 62 at enrollment, came from these six states: California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Participants also came from two cities, Atlanta and Detroit.
During the 17-year study period, 126,835 participants from the study group died.
The researchers categorized the volunteers into five groups depending on their level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet. They also linked participants to estimates of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrous oxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) based on census tract information.
The researchers compared the participants who were least and most adherent to a Mediterranean diet. The results showed that:
The scientists also noted that following a Mediterranean diet didn’t seem to prevent the negative effects of long-term O3 exposure. They added that the diet didn’t reduce deaths from all causes, heart attack, or other heart problems linked to O3 exposure.
George Thurston, the senior study author, said that based on the confirmed benefits of a diet full of antioxidants, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that particle air pollution due to fossil fuel combustion negatively affects health by causing oxidative stress and inflammation.
Thurston, who is also the director of the Program in Exposure Assessment and Human Health Effects at the Department of Environmental Medicine at NYU School of Medicine, added that since one-fourth of the study population lived in areas that had air pollution levels of 10 mcg/m3 or more above the lowest exposure, following the Mediterranean diet can help minimize the negative effects of air pollution in “a substantial population in the United States.”

https://food.news/2018-12-27-link-between-alzheimers-and-sugar.html,Are Alzheimer’s and sugar consumption linked? Studies detail the deadly connection,"Advertisement
Most people think that sugar consumption and Alzheimer’s disease are two unrelated health issues. However, according to various studies, consuming too much sugar can increase your risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
You need to be extremely careful when it comes to limiting your sugar intake, especially since most food companies try to add sugar to almost all kinds of food products. On the other hand, Alzheimer’s rates are also on the rise, along with obesity and the underlying metabolic syndrome.


While this could be nothing more than a coincidence, research implies that there might be a link between a diet high in sugar and Alzheimer’s. Since the condition is the third leading cause of death in the U.S., this matter should be thoroughly investigated.
Dr. Perlmutter, the author of the best-selling book “Grain Brain,” warned that the standard Western diet is linked to various neurological issues. Meanwhile, Dr. Emily Deans from Harvard University advised that new data suggests to a link between the standard Western diet and smaller brain size.
To date, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s. However, a small study by the University of California, Los Angeles, has determined that partial memory loss may be reversed. The researchers did this by following a template similar to the Paleo diet. The findings of the landmark study imply that a diet high in carbs and sugar may negatively affect an individual’s mental health.
At least one in 10 people older than 65 have Alzheimer’s, but those numbers are steadily increasing. Alzheimer’s is associated with symptoms that cause problems with judgment, memory, and thinking. The condition can aggravate dementia and memory loss since it occurs when the human brain starts malfunctioning.
People with Alzheimer’s can take medications to ease their symptoms, but the condition itself remains incurable. Experts note that while genetics is a crucial factor for Alzheimer’s, epigenetics (meaning your diet and lifestyle) can also greatly affect the development of the condition.
When a person has Alzheimer’s, plaques and tangles appear in their brain, causing problematic buildups. The accumulation of amyloid plaques between the nerve cells or neurons in the brain is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s. Meanwhile, neurofibrillary tangles are the insoluble twisted fibers found inside the brain’s cells.
Experts are still undecided when it comes to what causes Alzheimer’s, but there are a handful of hypotheses.

Sugar consumption is linked to Alzheimer’s because the pathways of diabetes development seem to influence Alzheimer’s. Data also implies that a diet high in sugar causes diabetes, which is bad for brain health.
Some researchers believe that burning too much glucose can interrupt proper brain function. This could be one reason why the UCLA Alzheimer’s study, where a lower-sugar diet was followed, is effective.
Alzheimer’s is even identified as “Type 3 diabetes” since the brain produces insulin. It’s worth noting that the brain cells need this insulin to survive and if insulin production is disrupted, the brain may be at risk.
People with diabetes lose more gray matter compared to people who don’t have the condition. This is an important fact because the loss of gray matter is a factor that causes Alzheimer’s. This highlights the fact that following a diet high in sugar is bad for your brain health. (Related: Eating too much processed sugar increases your risk of Alzheimer’s.)
Several studies have identified a link between sugar consumption and Alzheimer’s:
These studies suggest that a high-sugar diet increases your risk of Alzheimer’s, even if you don’t have diabetes. Thankfully, you can prevent Alzheimer’s by following a low-sugar Paleo diet.
Aside from obvious health reasons, you should limit your sugar intake to keep your brain healthy. Even if experts still don’t fully understand Alzheimer’s, you can start taking the necessary precautions to reduce your risk of developing the condition.

Preparing foods a certain way can affect their nutrient content, especially vegetables. But did you know that there are cooking methods that can also increase your diabetes risk?
According to several Australian studies, which involved researchers from Monash University and the University of Queensland, common food processing techniques are linked to a risk of Type 2 diabetes. These include methods that involve the use of direct heat as a primary treatment source.
The results of the studies have determined that the most common heat-based methods of food processing are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and Type 2 diabetes. Researchers explained that this occurs because of the high levels of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in foods processed using these methods.


The research was focused within the country of Australia, but the findings can be applied to other regions that also use the same food processing techniques.
Several countries worldwide are facing epidemic levels of Type 2 diabetes, and at least 25 percent of Australians older than 25 now have diabetes or prediabetes symptoms. Most of the time, cases like this are associated with the unhealthy American diet. In fact, more than 50 percent of Americans have diabetes or prediabetes symptoms.
The study findings reveal that despite being more health-oriented, societies such as Australia are also influenced by unhealthy trends in processed food. The researchers explained that the heat processing of food helps increase its flavor, shelf-life, and sterility. However, it also increases the production of AGEs.
The team warned that certain food processing and preparation methods, such as baking, frying, grilling, and roasting produce more AGEs compared to other methods like boiling and steaming, which use water and steam and not direct flames and high heat. (Related: Well done and overcooked meats greatly raise the risk of developing dementia and diabetes.)
For the study, scientists measured AGE levels in the volunteers’ urine. The test results determined a consistent link between high levels of AGEs and an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.
Over the last few years, Type 2 diabetes has turned into a major public health issue in several Western countries. The condition has reduced quality of life among different societies, and it has also caused heavy economic burdens.
In Australia, the estimated costs for healthcare related to Type 2 diabetes amounted to more than billion per year as of 2016. But experts fear that the figure could still double by 2025.
To address this alarming concern, scientists will continue their research to validate their findings via larger and longer-term studies. They hope that further study can help determine if the reduced consumption of advanced glycation end-products can help lower a person’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and improve their general well-being.
However, companies that profit off of these dangerous cooking methods are unlikely to change their ways. The best thing you can do to lower your diabetes risk is to make healthier and responsible dietary choices.
Avoid heating food when cooking, and keep in mind that you can obtain more nutrients from fruits and vegetables if you consume them raw or lightly cooked. Choose natural and organic foods instead of processed products to minimize your consumption of unhealthy AGEs.

Various studies have confirmed that regardless of your weight, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are major factors that affect metabolic health.

If you want to lose weight just before the holidays, take note of what you eat and when you do it. According to a study, there is a connection between your body clock and eating behavior.
Based on the researchers’ observations of the diets of lab mice with disrupted circadian clocks, timing is crucial to metabolism. They also explained that controlling the times when the subjects eat can help correct obesity and other metabolic problems often observed in these mice.


Surprisingly, the calorie intake of the different mice groups was the same even if some of them were fed an unhealthy diet. The study findings point to a newly discovered connection “between [the] disruption of the clock and eating behavior.”
Dr. Satchidananda Panda, the senior author of the study and a professor in the Regulatory Biology Laboratory at the Salk Institute, explained that the finding is an unexpected one. He explained that while experts previously believed that “the circadian clock had a direct impact on maintaining a healthy metabolism,” the research findings could prove otherwise.
Dr. Panda noted that based on their research, the circadian clock’s main role is to produce daily eating-fasting rhythms while metabolic disease could be the result of disrupted eating behavior.
Certain bodily functions are affected by the daily cycle of light and dark that is governed by the sun. In fact, combined with this cycle of day and night, other environmental factors such as humidity and temperature stimulate various processes in the human body such as:
Dr. Panda’s earlier studies have determined that having an intact circadian clock tells mice when to eat, such as when the mice have access to healthy food. Data from these studies revealed that subjects with defective clocks tend to have disrupted eating patterns if they could eat whenever they want. In time, most of these mutant mice developed signs of metabolic diseases, even when they were only given healthy food.
Separate studies had confirmed that when normal mice had free access to food full of fat and sugar, the bad diet nullifies their circadian clock. In turn, the mice ate randomly and developed metabolic diseases.
Meanwhile, restricting the timing of when the mice are allowed to eat allowed the researchers to prevent and reverse the negative impacts of the unhealthy diet. After an eight- to 12-hour time window, factors such as glucose levels, high cholesterol, and stamina on a treadmill were measured. The time-restricted feeding helped promote “robust rhythm in circadian clock components.” (Related: Midnight snacking makes you fatter.)
Dr. Panda shared that data from the previous studies helped them formulate the theory that “a robustly cycling circadian clock function” is crucial to preventing metabolic diseases.
In the recent study, the researchers set out to answer one question: “If the mice don’t have an internal clock telling when to eat, can we externally instruct mice when to eat, and will it prevent metabolic diseases?” The researchers noted that for the metabolic parameters that they examined, restricting the timing of feeding helped prevent health deterioration despite the absence of a normal circadian clock.
For the study, the scientists observed three different strains of mice with disrupted circadian clocks. The clocks were disrupted by “knocking out” specific genes that help regulate internal timing.
Some of the mice could eat food whenever they wanted, while others could only eat for a restricted nine- to 10-hour time window. Test results showed that the total calorie intake was the same whether the mice had normal or disrupted clocks.
This data can be used on future studies concerning how the clock influences the central nervous system and how it controls the urge to eat.
The researchers will also determine how the findings can be applied to human studies. Dr. Panda concluded that as individuals age, they may “start to lose their clocks.” Based on the study results, experts can determine new ways to manage compulsive eating in people with disrupted circadian clocks.
The study was published in the journal Cell Metabolism.
