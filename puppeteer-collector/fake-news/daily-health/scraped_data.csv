Imagine a natural remedy that can help suck that inflammation out of your joints and body, bringing you comfort and relief. Today, I’m going to share a powerful turmeric paste recipe that can transform your health by reducing inflammation and easing discomfort.

Key Takeaways
Turmeric contains curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory agent.
Black pepper enhances curcumin absorption by up to 2,000%.
Raw honey has natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
Coconut oil aids in the absorption of curcumin and has its own anti-inflammatory benefits.
Taking the paste sublingually maximizes its effectiveness.
The Power of Turmeric

Let’s start with turmeric. This golden spice has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. Its active compound, curcumin, is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. Curcumin works by inhibiting molecules involved in inflammation, such as cytokines and enzymes like COX-2. This makes it highly effective in reducing chronic inflammation, which is often linked to conditions like arthritis, heart disease, and even cancer.

The Role of Black Pepper

Next up is black pepper. This common spice contains piperine, a natural substance that enhances the bioavailability of curcumin by up to 2,000%. How does it do this? Piperine inhibits certain digestive enzymes, allowing more curcumin to enter the bloodstream. This synergy between turmeric and black pepper maximizes the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin, making it a powerful duo.

Benefits of Raw Honey

Now, let’s talk about raw honey. It’s more than just a sweetener; it has natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Honey can help modulate the body’s immune response, reducing inflammation and promoting healing. Plus, its soothing nature makes the turmeric paste more palatable, ensuring you enjoy it more.

Coconut Oil: The Carrier

Lastly, we have coconut oil. This oil is rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are easily absorbed and utilized by the body. These healthy fats aid in the absorption of fat-soluble compounds like curcumin. Additionally, coconut oil has its own natural anti-inflammatory properties, helping to reduce inflammation and support joint health as well as other organs in your body.

Making the Turmeric Paste

Let’s get to the fun part: making the turmeric paste! Here’s what you’ll need:

1 tablespoon of turmeric
1 tablespoon of raw honey
1 tablespoon of coconut oil (warmed to a liquid state)
5 dashes of black pepper
Instructions:
In a small bowl, combine the turmeric and raw honey.
Add the warmed coconut oil to the bowl.
Sprinkle in the black pepper.
Mix everything together until well combined.
Transfer the mixture into a small plastic container with a lid.
Refrigerate the paste until it firms up.
How to Use the Paste

To use the turmeric paste, take 1/4 teaspoon on an empty stomach, preferably first thing in the morning. Place it under your tongue and let it sit there until it melts. This sublingual method allows for quick absorption directly into the bloodstream, giving you fast results.

For optimal results, consider taking it about 15-20 minutes before a meal or 1.5 to 2 hours after eating. This timing helps maximize absorption and effectiveness.

Why This Matters

Incorporating this turmeric paste into your daily routine is a great way to tackle inflammation naturally. Remember, inflammation is at the root of many health issues, including joint pain, organ discomfort, and various diseases. By reducing excessive inflammation, you can feel better, heal quicker, and live a happier, pain-free life.

Final Thoughts

I hope you enjoyed learning about this simple yet effective turmeric paste. It’s not just about the ingredients; it’s about how they work together to support your health. Plus, it tastes great! I challenge you to give it a try and see how it can make a difference in your life.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/waking-up-to-pee/,Waking Up to Pee? The Real Reason Isn’t What You Think (Do This Instead),"Do you find yourself waking up multiple times every night to pee? That groggy stumble to the bathroom, the frustration of interrupted sleep, the exhaustion that follows you through the next day – you’re certainly not alone in this struggle. What most people don’t realize is that their frequent nighttime urination isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s actually one of your body’s clearest warning signs about a much deeper metabolic issue [1].

After years of research and clinical observations, medical experts have identified that 95% of nighttime urination cases are fundamentally linked to insulin resistance [2] – a condition that often goes undiagnosed for years before developing into prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. The good news? By understanding this connection and making some strategic lifestyle changes, you can not only stop those midnight bathroom trips but also significantly improve your overall health.

Why Everything You’ve Tried Probably Hasn’t Worked

Before we explore the solution, let’s examine why conventional approaches to nighttime urination often fail:

The Prostate Misconception
Many men immediately assume their frequent urination stems from prostate issues. While an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) can certainly cause urinary symptoms, the reality is more nuanced. Research shows that:

Prostate treatments alone often don’t resolve nighttime urination [4]

Many men with normal prostate size still experience frequent urination [4]

Addressing insulin resistance frequently improves symptoms regardless of prostate status [2]

The Hydration Myth
“You’re drinking too much before bed” is common advice, but it misses the mark for most people. While fluid intake timing matters, the root issue isn’t just about volume – it’s about how your body processes and retains that fluid, which is heavily influenced by insulin function [5].

The UTI Assumption
Urinary tract infections do cause urgency and frequency, but they come with distinct symptoms:

Burning sensation during urination

Cloudy or strong-smelling urine

Fever or pelvic pain
If these are absent, your nighttime trips likely have a different cause [1].

Insulin Resistance: The Hidden Culprit Behind Your Sleepless Nights

Understanding the Insulin-Bladder Connection
Insulin resistance develops when your cells stop responding efficiently to insulin, the hormone that helps glucose enter cells for energy. As resistance grows:

Your pancreas produces more insulin to compensate [6]

Chronically high insulin levels trigger multiple systems to malfunction [6]

Your bladder becomes overactive and sensitive [3]

This process explains why nighttime urination often appears years before blood sugar issues become apparent – it’s one of the earliest detectable symptoms of developing metabolic problems [2].

The Science Behind the Symptoms

Multiple physiological mechanisms link insulin resistance to frequent urination:

Osmotic Diuresis
When blood sugar runs high (even slightly), your kidneys work overtime to filter out excess glucose. Since glucose molecules attract water, this creates a “flushing” effect that dramatically increases urine output [6].
Bladder Muscle Overactivity
Studies using animal models show that elevated insulin levels directly stimulate bladder muscle contractions [3]. Human clinical observations confirm that improving insulin sensitivity consistently reduces urinary frequency [2].
Electrolyte Imbalance
Insulin plays a crucial role in electrolyte regulation, particularly sodium and potassium. When insulin signaling falters:

Sodium excretion increases, reducing fluid retention [7]

Potassium imbalances affect muscle function, including bladder control [7]

The Cortisol Connection
Insulin resistance and high cortisol (the primary stress hormone) form a vicious cycle:

High insulin → increased cortisol production [8]

High cortisol → worsened insulin resistance [8]

Both disrupt sleep architecture and bladder function [8]

Gender-Specific Considerations

For Men:

Insulin resistance lowers testosterone levels [9]

Low testosterone weakens pelvic floor muscles [9]

Testosterone therapy often improves both metabolic markers and urinary symptoms [9]

For Women:

Insulin resistance contributes to pelvic floor dysfunction [10]

Hormonal fluctuations amplify bladder sensitivity [10]

Weight gain (common with insulin resistance) increases abdominal pressure on the bladder [10]

The Nighttime Eating Trap: How Your Evening Habits Are Making It Worse

Here’s the surprising truth: What you eat at night impacts your bladder more than what you drink [11].

The Physiology of Late-Night Eating
Every time you eat, regardless of food type, your body releases insulin. Evening snacks are particularly problematic because:

Insulin Surges at Night

Your body’s insulin sensitivity naturally decreases in the evening [11]

The same snack causes a higher insulin spike at night vs. morning [12]

Digestive Disruption

Late eating keeps your digestive system active when it should be resting [11]

This raises core body temperature, impairing sleep quality [11]

Blood Sugar Rollercoaster

Nighttime carbs cause glucose spikes followed by crashes [12]

These fluctuations trigger stress hormones that further disrupt sleep [12]

The Worst Offenders
Certain foods exacerbate nighttime urination more than others:

Ultra-Processed Snacks:

Crackers, chips, and sweets cause rapid insulin spikes [12]

Their high sodium content can disrupt fluid balance [7]

“Healthy” Carbs That Backfire:

Whole grain crackers [12]

Dried fruits [12]

Granola bars [12]

Liquid Calories:

Fruit juices [12]

Alcohol [12]

Sweetened beverages [12]

Your 7-Step Action Plan to Stop Nighttime Urination
Establish a Nutrient-Dense Eating Window
Consume all meals within a 10-12 hour window [13]

Allow 2-3 hours between last meal and bedtime [13]

Focus on high-quality proteins, healthy fats, and fiber [13]

Optimize Your Evening Meal Composition
Build your dinner around:

4-6 oz of high-quality protein (salmon, chicken, grass-fed beef) [13]

2+ cups of non-starchy vegetables [13]

1-2 tbsp healthy fats (olive oil, avocado, nuts) [13]

Limit starchy carbs to 1/2 cup max [13]

Implement a “No Snacking After Dinner” Rule
Brush teeth immediately after dinner as a psychological cue [13]

Replace snack habit with herbal tea or warm lemon water [13]

If absolutely necessary, choose:

A few celery sticks with almond butter [13]

1/4 cup berries [13]

Small handful of nuts [13]

Rebalance Your Electrolytes
Sodium:

Add 1/4 tsp high-quality salt to water 1-2x daily [7]

Use mineral-rich salts like Himalayan or Celtic sea salt [7]

Magnesium:

Take 200-400mg magnesium glycinate before bed [14]

Eat magnesium-rich foods (spinach, pumpkin seeds, almonds) [14]

Potassium:

Include avocado, mushrooms, or leafy greens at dinner [7]

Consider a potassium supplement if levels are low [7]

Support Insulin Sensitivity with Targeted Nutrients
Vitamin D:

Maintain blood levels between 40-60 ng/mL [15]

Take with fatty meals for better absorption [15]

Chromium:

200-400mcg daily helps glucose metabolism [15]

Found in broccoli, grass-fed beef, and eggs [15]

Berberine:

500mg before meals supports insulin function [15]

Consult doctor if taking medications [15]

Optimize Your Sleep Environment
Keep bedroom temperature between 60-67°F [17]

Use blackout curtains to maximize melatonin production [16]

Implement a digital sunset 1 hour before bed [16]

Monitor and Adjust
Keep a bladder diary for 1-2 weeks [13]

Track:

Meal times and composition [13]

Fluid intake [13]

Bathroom trips [13]

Sleep quality [13]

Adjust strategies based on patterns [13]

Beyond the Bathroom: The Ripple Effects of Improvement

When you address the insulin resistance behind your nighttime urination, the benefits extend far beyond uninterrupted sleep:

Metabolic Benefits:

More stable energy throughout the day [13]

Reduced cravings, especially for sweets [13]

Improved body composition [13]

Cognitive Enhancements:

Sharper mental clarity [13]

Better mood regulation [13]

Improved memory retention [13]

Long-Term Health Protection:

Reduced risk of type 2 diabetes [18]

Lower cardiovascular disease risk [19]

Decreased likelihood of neurodegenerative conditions [13]

Making It Stick: Practical Tips for Success

Overcoming Evening Hunger
If cravings strike:

Drink sparkling water with lime [13]

Try a mindfulness meditation [13]

Engage in a distracting activity (puzzle, book) [13]

Dining Out Strategies
Schedule restaurant meals earlier in the day [13]

Request double vegetables instead of starch [13]

Box half the meal before starting [13]

Travel Adjustments
Pack healthy snacks (nuts, jerky, olives) [13]

Stay hydrated during transit days [13]

Reset eating schedule quickly after time zone changes [13]

When to Seek Professional Help
While these strategies help most people, consult a healthcare provider if:

Symptoms persist after 4 weeks of consistent changes [1]

You experience pain or burning during urination [1]

Notice blood in urine [1]

Have unexplained weight loss accompanying symptoms [1]

The Bigger Picture: Nighttime Urination as Your Health Barometer

Your frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom aren’t just an annoyance – they’re one of your body’s most honest communication tools. By responding to this signal and addressing the underlying insulin resistance, you’re not just solving a sleep problem; you’re taking one of the most impactful steps toward long-term metabolic health [2][18][19].

Remember: Progress happens gradually. Celebrate small victories like:

Waking up just once instead of three times [13]

Falling back asleep more easily [13]

Feeling more rested in the mornings [13]

Each positive change indicates your metabolic health is improving [13]. With consistent effort, you’ll find yourself sleeping through the night, energized in the mornings, and empowered with the knowledge that you’ve addressed the root cause rather than just masking symptoms [2].

Tonight could be your first step toward uninterrupted sleep. Start with one simple change – perhaps closing the kitchen after dinner or adding magnesium to your evening routine – and build from there. Your bladder (and your entire body) will thank you [13][14].”

https://dailyhealthpost.com/the-hidden-deficiency-ruining-your-eyesight/,The Hidden Deficiency Ruining Your Eyesight (And How to Fix It),"Do you reach for your glasses first thing in the morning just to see clearly? You’re not alone. By age 45, nearly 60% of adults require some form of vision correction—whether it’s reading glasses, bifocals, or contact lenses. But here’s the shocking truth: glasses don’t actually fix your vision.

In fact, the more you rely on them, the worse your eyesight may become over time. Many people report needing stronger prescriptions year after year, trapped in a cycle of worsening vision. But what if the real culprit behind poor eyesight isn’t just genetics or aging—but a critical nutrient deficiency that most eye doctors never test for?

Recent research reveals a hidden problem called contrast sensitivity loss, a condition where your eyes struggle to distinguish between shades of gray, especially in low light. This issue is directly linked to a depletion of protective antioxidants in the retina—nutrients that act like “internal sunglasses” to shield your eyes from damage.

The good news? You can reverse this decline naturally. In this guide, we’ll explore:

Why traditional eye exams miss this key problem
The #1 antioxidant deficiency ruining your vision
How modern diets and lifestyles accelerate eye damage
A science-backed 5-step plan to restore clarity and protect your eyes long-term

Let’s dive in.

Part 1: The Overlooked Vision Problem—Contrast Sensitivity Loss
What Is Contrast Sensitivity, and Why Does It Matter?

When you visit an optometrist, they test your vision using a Snellen chart—the classic black letters on a white background. But this only measures high-contrast visual acuity, which is just one piece of the puzzle.

Contrast sensitivity, on the other hand, is your ability to distinguish objects from their background when colors and shades are similar—like reading gray text on a white page or driving in foggy conditions. Poor contrast sensitivity makes the world appear washed out, blurry, or hazy, even if your standard vision test says you have “20/20” sight.

Why Don’t Eye Doctors Test for This?
Standard exams focus on refractive errors (nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism).
Contrast loss is tied to retinal health, not just lens shape.
Most clinics lack specialized equipment for contrast sensitivity testing.
The Temporary Fix That Doesn’t Solve the Problem

Many people compensate by:

Increasing screen brightness
Using stronger reading lights
Squinting in dim environments

While these help in the moment, they’re band-aid solutions. The real fix? Replenishing the antioxidants that protect your retina from damage.

Part 2: The #1 Deficiency Behind Poor Eyesight—Missing Carotenoids
The Role of Blue Light and Oxidative Stress

Your eyes are under constant attack from high-energy blue light (emitted by screens, LEDs, and the sun). Over time, this light generates free radicals, which degrade retinal cells—a process called oxidative stress.

To defend against this, your body relies on carotenoids, two of which are especially critical for vision:

Lutein
Zeaxanthin

These antioxidants act like “internal sunglasses”, absorbing harmful blue light and neutralizing free radicals before they damage delicate eye tissues.

The Aging Eye: Why Your Vision Declines After 40

As you age, your natural carotenoid levels drop dramatically:

At age 20, your retina has a dense concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin.
By age 60, levels can decline by 50% or more.

This explains why:

You need brighter light to read as you get older.
Night vision becomes weaker.
Glare from headlights or screens feels more blinding.
The Modern Diet Worsens the Problem

Our ancestors consumed 10x more lutein and zeaxanthin from wild greens, eggs, and seafood. Today, processed foods and industrial seed oils accelerate eye damage by:

Depleting antioxidants through inflammation.
Blocking nutrient absorption due to poor gut health.
Part 3: The 5-Step Plan to Restore Your Vision Naturally
Step 1: Eat Carotenoid-Rich Foods Daily

The best dietary sources of lutein and zeaxanthin include:
✅ Pasture-raised egg yolks (commercial eggs have 3x fewer carotenoids)
✅ Dark leafy greens (kale, spinach, collards)
✅ Orange peppers and goji berries (exceptionally high in zeaxanthin)
✅ Marigold flower extract (a potent supplemental source)

Pro Tip: Always pair these foods with healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, grass-fed butter) to enhance absorption—carotenoids are fat-soluble.

Step 2: Supplement with the Right Eye Nutrients

Look for a high-quality supplement containing:

At least 10 mg lutein + 2 mg zeaxanthin daily
Added fats (MCT oil, olive oil) for better uptake
Astaxanthin (another powerful eye-protective carotenoid)

Research shows: Taking these for 12 weeks can:
✔ Improve contrast sensitivity by 30%
✔ Reduce glare sensitivity
✔ Slow macular degeneration progression

Step 3: Eliminate Inflammatory Seed Oils

Industrial seed oils (soybean, canola, sunflower) are loaded with inflammatory omega-6 fats, which:

Displace healthy fats in retinal cells.
Increase oxidative damage in the eyes.

Swap them for:

Omega-3-rich fats (wild salmon, sardines, cod liver oil)
Grass-fed butter or ghee
Extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil
Step 4: Harness Sunlight (Without Burning Your Retinas)

Our ancestors spent hours outdoors daily, exposing their eyes to full-spectrum sunlight, which:

Stimulates melanin production (a natural antioxidant in the eyes).
Boosts vitamin D, critical for preventing glaucoma and macular degeneration.

Daily Habit: Spend 15–30 minutes outside in the early morning or late afternoon sun without sunglasses (avoid direct midday UV exposure).

Step 5: Add Vitamin D and Zinc for Long-Term Protection
Vitamin D (10,000 IU/day) – Low levels are linked to diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts.
Zinc (15–30 mg/day) – Helps transport vitamin A (essential for night vision) to the retina.
Final Thoughts: A Clearer Future for Your Vision

Your eyes weren’t designed for dim rooms, artificial lighting, and endless screen time. The decline in vision isn’t inevitable—it’s a nutritional problem with a nutritional solution.

3 Action Steps to Start Today:
Order a high-quality lutein/zeaxanthin supplement.
Swap seed oils for omega-3-rich fats.
Spend at least 15 minutes outside daily in natural light.

By rebuilding your retinal antioxidants, reducing inflammation, and giving your eyes the nutrients they crave, you can reclaim clearer, sharper vision—without relying on stronger prescriptions.

Your eyes are healable. Start nourishing them today!

Bonus: Frequently Asked Questions

But what if the solution wasn’t another pill, expensive gadget, or complicated routine? What if it was as simple as one tablespoon of chia seeds before bed?

Chia Seeds: The Ancient Superfood for Modern Sleep Problems

These tiny black and white seeds were once prized by Aztec warriors for energy and endurance. Today, science confirms they’re also a natural sleep enhancer—thanks to three key benefits:

1. Tryptophan: The Sleep-Inducing Amino Acid

Ever felt sleepy after Thanksgiving turkey? That’s thanks to tryptophan, an amino acid that converts into:

Serotonin (the “calm and happy” neurotransmitter)
Melatonin (the hormone that regulates sleep)

Chia seeds contain twice as much tryptophan as turkey! A tablespoon before bed helps your body naturally produce melatonin, syncing your internal clock for deeper, uninterrupted sleep.

2. Stabilizes Blood Sugar (No More 3 AM Wake-Ups!)

Blood sugar crashes at night can jolt you awake. Chia seeds prevent this by:

Slowing sugar absorption (thanks to soluble fiber)
Improving insulin sensitivity (so your body uses glucose more efficiently)

No spikes, no crashes—just steady energy and no midnight hunger pangs.

3. The Ultimate Relaxation Mineral Combo

Chia seeds are packed with magnesium and calcium, two minerals essential for:

Muscle relaxation (reducing nighttime twitching and restlessness)

https://dailyhealthpost.com/7-powerful-nutrients-that-destroy-joint-pain/,7 Powerful Nutrients that DESTROY Joint Pain Forever,"Are you one of the millions suffering from severe joint pain, seeking real relief? Scientists recently uncovered a surprising extract from a common vegetable that reduced joint pain by 70% in clinical trials—outperforming the medications and supplements most Americans rely on. This powerful compound targets 73 different inflammation pathways, working like a precision strike against your joint pain.

In this video, I’ll reveal 7 research-backed nutrients proven to reduce joint pain—no surgery or prescription drugs needed. You’ll discover:

Why most supplements fail (and which bioactive forms actually work),
The ancient herb that slashed inflammation markers by 72%,
And #3—a breakthrough that’s transforming mornings for people who wake up with stiff, aching joints.

Stay until the end, because I’ll show you exactly how to get optimal doses of these nutrients daily—so you can finally break free from the pain.

Operation Cucumber: The Vegetable Extract That Outperforms Popular Joint Supplements

So, let’s dive into #1, a joint pain fighter you might never expect – cucumber extract. Not the cucumber you toss in your salad, but a secret weapon hidden in nature’s arsenal. This remarkable extract has shown outstanding results in clinical studies, particularly when compared to traditional supplements.

In comprehensive head-to-head testing, this concentrated cucumber extract was proven to be twice as effective as glucosamine-chondroitin throughout a six-month study. From the 30-day mark to the final assessment, it consistently delivered superior results.

The science behind this is fascinating. When researchers tested these cucumber compounds in animal studies, they observed inflammation reduction of up to 72%, with effects beginning in as little as 2 hours. Like a quick strike force, the extract works quickly to neutralize joint discomfort.

A key player in this natural remedy is fisetin, working at the cellular level to slow age-related inflammation while simultaneously protecting cartilage from breakdown. This dual-action approach helps preserve joint structure over time.

Completing this natural powerhouse is silica—a crucial mineral that strengthens the framework around your joints. Silica reinforces muscles, tendons, and ligaments, providing better stability to the entire joint system and helping it withstand daily movement stresses.

The Ancient Bark That Provides Fast Relief: White Willow’s Secret

Next, at #2, we have an ancient remedy that’s been hiding in plain sight – white willow bark. While silica strengthens your joint system, this natural pain-fighter targets discomfort directly at its source.

Ancient healers from Greek, Egyptian, and Native American traditions treasured white willow bark as nature’s original pain reliever. They would make teas and topical remedies from the bark to treat fever and body aches.

Modern science has uncovered why: it contains a compound called salicin that your body transforms into salicylic acid – like a natural medicine factory inside you creating the same pain-fighting molecule that inspired aspirin.

Standard white willow bark supplements contain only about 15% salicin, insufficient for serious joint discomfort. Researchers have developed a concentrated form with 50% salicin content – triple the potency of regular extracts.

In a significant clinical study, 78 people with severe knee or hip discomfort experienced remarkable improvements after taking this concentrated form. This natural alternative supports a healthy inflammatory response without the digestive upset common with other options.

White willow bark offers additional benefits through its rich profile of flavonoids and polyphenols that enhance its therapeutic effects, making it particularly valuable for people who need effective relief but can’t tolerate conventional treatments.

The Mineral Link: How Boron Deficiency Affects Your Joints

Next, did you know a simple mineral deficiency could be the cause of your joint pain? Let me introduce you to a hidden piece of the joint health puzzle that most doctors never mention.

Scientists studying soil samples around the world made a remarkable discovery – in regions where boron was abundant in the soil, only about 10% of the population suffered from joint problems. In stark contrast, areas with boron-deficient soil saw joint issues affect a staggering 70% of residents.

Imagine two villages: in one, people walk easily to markets and tend gardens into old age, while in the other, many residents struggle with basic mobility, their days marked by discomfort.

Further investigation revealed that people experiencing hip joint discomfort had 50% less boron in their bodies compared to those without pain. This trace mineral, found in nuts and leafy greens, turns out to be crucial for your joints, yet most people don’t get nearly enough of it.

Boron helps produce synovial fluid – that essential cushioning liquid like oil for door hinges, keeping joints moving smoothly without grinding.

The most effective form of boron, Calcium Fructoborate, delivered impressive results in a 2-month study. Participants experienced better knee movement, less discomfort climbing stairs, and reduced pain while walking – improvements that translate to regaining everyday independence.

When added to glucosamine and chondroitin, it boosted pain relief by 25% – making our #3 mineral an important contributor to overall joint health.

The Ancient Resin: Boswellia’s Modern Breakthrough

Shifting from minerals to resins, our #4 nutrient is an ancient treasure that’s been hiding in plain sight for millennia. Frankincense, or boswellia as it’s scientifically known, has been a cornerstone of traditional Indian and Chinese medicine for thousands of years.

This resin was so valued in ancient times that it was considered a treasure, as much for its fragrant properties as for its remarkable ability to increase blood flow to joints and reduce inflammation.

Throughout history, boswellia’s power has been limited by poor bioavailability. When taken in traditional form, its beneficial compounds simply pass through your body without being absorbed – a powerful medicine unable to reach its destination.

Modern science has finally solved this ancient problem with a concentrated form of boswellia containing 60 times more boswellic acid than traditional extracts. This breakthrough works through a unique dual-action mechanism. First, it targets the 5-LOX enzyme that triggers inflammation at its source. Second, it inhibits MMP-3, which actively breaks down your cartilage.

The results are remarkable. Clinical studies show people experiencing a 52% improvement in both pain and stiffness – with noticeable results in just 7 days. Even more impressive, other research demonstrated that this concentrated form of boswellia reduced joint discomfort by up to 65%, making it one of the fastest-acting natural joint solutions available today.

The Golden Spice: Turmeric’s Hidden Potential Unlocked

Now let’s pivot from frankincense to perhaps the most familiar kitchen spice with extraordinary joint-healing potential. That vibrant yellow powder in your spice cabinet contains a powerful compound that directly targets the COX-2 enzyme – one of the primary triggers of your worst joint pain. Number five is turmeric, a cornerstone of Indian cuisine and Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years.

While frankincense remains relatively unknown, turmeric faces a different challenge. Your body struggles to absorb it effectively. Traditional turmeric passes through your system quickly, with minimal healing compounds reaching your aching joints. Imagine a skilled doctor who can’t enter the hospital to help patients.

Fortunately, scientists developed an ingenious solution by encapsulating curcumin (turmeric’s active compound) within microscopic fat bubbles called phospholipids. This technology makes turmeric 20 times more absorbable than standard forms. These phospholipid “vehicles” function like express trains, delivering curcumin directly to painful joints.

The clinical results are remarkable. Users reduced reliance on other treatments by 63%, while 38% reported less stomach discomfort. Participants walked three times farther during treadmill tests, showing significant mobility improvements.

“After years of limited movement, I can finally garden again without pain,” reports Martha, 68, a clinical trial participant. This absorbable turmeric also reduced C-reactive protein levels – a key inflammation marker directly linked to worsening joint conditions.

Desert Power Plant: Yucca’s Triple-Action Relief

Did you know a plant that thrives in one of Earth’s harshest environments might hold the key to ending your joint pain? Number Six is the Yucca plant, a remarkable desert survivor, which contains three distinct inflammation-fighting compounds that work through completely different pathways than all the nutrients we’ve discussed so far.

This desert powerhouse employs saponins, resveratrol, and polyphenols in a synchronized triple-action defense against joint inflammation. Each compound targets a different aspect of the inflammatory process, creating a comprehensive approach that outperforms single-pathway solutions like turmeric.

Clinical evidence confirms its effectiveness – studies show that 6 out of 10 people who supplemented with Yucca experienced significant improvements in joint comfort, making it a valuable addition to any natural joint health regimen.

Yucca’s resveratrol specifically blocks both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes – the same inflammation triggers targeted by many prescription medications. Simultaneously, its polyphenols act as powerful antioxidants, neutralizing free radicals that accelerate joint deterioration and protecting your joint tissue from ongoing damage.

This multi-pathway approach makes Yucca particularly effective when combined with other natural joint nutrients. While ingredients like turmeric and boswellia address specific inflammatory pathways, Yucca complements their action by targeting additional inflammation triggers and providing protective antioxidant support.

The Building Block: Why Glucosamine Type Matters

Beyond attacking inflammation, your joints need proper building materials to actually repair themselves. What most people don’t realize is that the space between your bones – that crucial cushion that prevents painful grinding – can actually be rebuilt with the right nutrients.

The evidence is remarkable on x-rays. In controlled studies, researchers measured the space between knee joints of people experiencing pain. After participants took 1500 mg of a special form of glucosamine, the results were transformative. “At the end of the studies, people getting this nutrient had significantly more space between their knee bones. It was clear as day—right there on the x-rays!” This visible change translates directly to better movement and less pain in everyday activities.

Many people take glucosamine for years without seeing improvement because the specific type matters tremendously. Most supplement companies use inferior forms to maximize profits. Think of it like building a bridge – you need premium-grade materials, not cheap substitutes that crumble under pressure. The superior form – glucosamine sulfate 2KCL – acts like these premium building blocks, being water-soluble and substantially easier for your body to absorb.

When you provide your body with this precise building block at 1500 mg daily, you give your joints exactly what they need to maintain that critical space between bones that x-rays can measure.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/nerve-pain-relief/,Nerve Pain Relief? The Vitamin Deficiency You Never Suspected!,"Today, let’s talk about the hidden cause of nerve pain you never suspected. If you’ve ever experienced tingling, numbness, burning, or shooting pain in your hands, feet, or elsewhere, you know how debilitating nerve pain can be. Doctors often prescribe medications to mask the symptoms—but what if the real culprit is something far simpler?

A Vitamin C deficiency could be silently sabotaging your nerves.

Most people think of Vitamin C as just an immune booster, but its role in nerve health is groundbreaking. Without enough of this vital nutrient, your nervous system starts to malfunction—leading to pain, poor signaling, and even long-term damage.

Here’s the shocking truth: Your nerve pain might not be a permanent condition—it could just be your body begging for more Vitamin C.

How Vitamin C Keeps Your Nerves Functioning Properly
1. Myelin Sheath: The Insulation Your Nerves Can’t Live Without

Imagine your nerves as electrical wires. Just like wires need rubber coating to prevent short-circuiting, your nerves rely on a protective layer called the myelin sheath to transmit signals smoothly.

When myelin breaks down (due to diabetes, autoimmune disorders, or nutrient deficiencies), you experience:

Burning pain
Pins and needles sensations
Muscle weakness
Slow reflexes

Vitamin C is essential for maintaining and repairing myelin. Without it, your nerves become exposed—like a frayed power cord—leading to misfiring signals and chronic pain.

2. Collagen: The Secret Scaffolding of Your Nerves

Collagen isn’t just for skin—it’s also the structural protein that holds your nerves and blood vessels together. Vitamin C is required to produce collagen, meaning:

Weak collagen = Fragile nerves & poor circulation
Strong collagen = Healthy, resilient nerves

If you’re deficient in Vitamin C, your nerves lose their support system, making them more prone to inflammation, compression, and damage.

The Vitamin C & Neuropathy Connection
3. Diabetic Neuropathy: A Vitamin C Deficiency in Disguise?

Millions with diabetes suffer from nerve damage (neuropathy)—but research suggests low Vitamin C levels worsen it.

Why?

High blood sugar destroys myelin.
Vitamin C neutralizes sugar-induced nerve damage.
Without enough Vitamin C, nerve repair slows down.

The fix? Studies show that Vitamin C supplementation can reduce neuropathy symptoms—proving that sometimes, pain isn’t just about blood sugar… it’s about missing nutrients.

4. Nerve Regeneration: Can Vitamin C Help Heal Damaged Nerves?

Your body can repair nerves—but only if it has the right tools. Vitamin C:

Boosts nerve growth factors (like BDNF)
Reduces oxidative stress (a major cause of nerve death)
Speeds up healing after injury

This means nerve pain isn’t always permanent—if you give your body the Vitamin C it needs, recovery is possible.

Are You Deficient? Signs You Need More Vitamin C

Since your body can’t store Vitamin C, you need a daily supply to prevent nerve issues. Warning signs of deficiency include:
✔ Chronic nerve pain (especially in hands & feet)
✔ Slow wound healing (collagen breakdown)
✔ Easy bruising (weak blood vessels)
✔ Fatigue & brain fog (poor neurotransmitter function)

How to Fix a Vitamin C Deficiency & Reverse Nerve Pain
Best Food Sources:
Citrus fruits (oranges, lemons)
Bell peppers (highest Vitamin C per calorie!)
Kiwi, strawberries, guava
Dark leafy greens (kale, spinach)
Should You Supplement?

If you have existing nerve pain, you may need higher doses (500–2000 mg/day). Opt for:

Liposomal Vitamin C (better absorption)
Buffered Vitamin C (gentler on stomach)
Final Verdict: Your Nerve Pain Might Be Fixable!

If you’ve been told your neuropathy is “just something you have to live with,” think again. Vitamin C deficiency could be the missing link—and correcting it might bring real relief.

Try this:

Increase Vitamin C-rich foods for 2 weeks.
Consider a high-quality supplement if pain persists.
Track changes—many report less tingling, sharper reflexes, and reduced pain.

Could it really be this simple? For many, yes. Don’t let a basic deficiency steal your quality of life—give your nerves the support they need!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-miracle-herbs-to-instantly-lower-blood-pressure/,5 Miracle Herbs to Instantly Lower Blood Pressure and Clear Arteries,"When it comes to heart health, what your doctor isn’t telling you could be costing you your life. While they’re quick to prescribe medications, they rarely mention the 5 herbs I’m sharing today – plants with scientific evidence showing they can lower blood pressure, clear arteries, and improve heart function naturally.

These aren’t just supplements – they’re powerful natural medicines that work through multiple mechanisms: reducing inflammation, thinning blood naturally, strengthening vessel walls, and improving circulation. One herb has been shown in studies to be as effective as common blood pressure medications. Another can reduce cholesterol without the muscle pain and liver damage that statins can cause.

Watch till the end to discover the five natural wonders that could transform your cardiovascular health.

First on our list is “Cayenne Pepper”: The Blood Flow Booster.

What if you could use a common kitchen spice to support your heart health? Cayenne pepper contains capsaicin, the active compound that makes it spicy and provides cardiovascular benefits. While most people think of cayenne as just a seasoning, it actually works in three specific ways to improve circulation and heart function.

First, cayenne helps thin your blood naturally. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed cayenne reduced platelet aggregation by 45%, which is crucial because it helps prevent dangerous blood clots that can lead to strokes and heart attacks. Unlike pharmaceutical blood thinners that come with risks of excessive bleeding, cayenne keeps blood flowing smoothly without thinning it to dangerous levels.

Second, cayenne helps dilate your blood vessels. Imagine your arteries as highways; capsaicin acts like a traffic controller, relaxing and widening these pathways to improve blood flow throughout your body. This means better circulation to your heart, brain, and other vital organs, naturally lowering blood pressure without medications that can cause side effects like kidney damage or persistent coughs.

Third, cayenne strengthens your arterial walls. The antioxidants in cayenne help protect your blood vessels from damage and inflammation that can lead to plaque buildup. Over time, this protective effect helps maintain flexible, healthy arteries that can better regulate blood pressure and resist hardening.

For those wanting to use cayenne, there are several effective methods. You can start with small amounts like 1/4 teaspoon in hot water as a tea. Capsules are another option, with some practitioners recommending two capsules three times daily for cardiovascular support. You can also add it to foods, though cooking may reduce some of its potency. The key is consistency—regular use provides the best results.

Next, the Number 2 herb is “Garlic”: Nature’s Blood Pressure Pill.

Here’s something you might not know about garlic—it can work as effectively as some prescription blood pressure medications, but without the unwanted side effects. The key compound in garlic is allicin, a sulfur-based molecule responsible for both its strong smell and its medicinal properties. To unlock its full potential for heart health, simply crush or chop garlic and let it sit for about 10 minutes. This step allows allicin to form and become highly bioactive.

While many doctors prescribe ACE inhibitors to manage blood pressure, these drugs often come with side effects like kidney strain or persistent coughs. Garlic, on the other hand, relaxes blood vessels and improves circulation naturally. A meta-analysis of 12 clinical studies found that garlic supplementation reduced systolic blood pressure by an average of 8-10 points, results comparable to many pharmaceutical options. This makes garlic a practical alternative for those looking to manage hypertension without medication risks.

Garlic also plays a crucial role in cholesterol management. Unlike statins, which only lower LDL cholesterol, garlic helps prevent LDL oxidation—the real danger behind plaque buildup in arteries. Oxidized LDL contributes to inflammation and arterial damage, but garlic’s antioxidants counteract this process. Research shows that regular garlic consumption can reduce total cholesterol by up to 10-15% in some individuals. This dual action on both blood pressure and cholesterol makes garlic a powerful tool for cardiovascular health.

To get the most benefit from garlic, preparation matters. Crush 1-2 cloves and let them sit for 10 minutes before consuming them raw or lightly cooked. This waiting period allows the enzymatic reactions needed to produce allicin. While cooked garlic still offers benefits, raw garlic provides the highest concentration of active compounds. If the taste is too strong, aged garlic extract supplements are another option, though fresh garlic remains the most potent form.

Consider the story of Jane, who incorporated garlic into her daily diet and saw her cholesterol levels drop significantly. Beyond blood pressure and cholesterol, garlic supports immune function and fights infections. Its antibacterial and antiviral properties have been recognized for centuries.

Moving on, Number 3 is “Ginger”: The Inflammation Fighter.

Chronic inflammation is like rust slowly compromising the engine of your heart, silently damaging your arteries over time. Ginger contains powerful compounds called gingerols and shogaols that combat this inflammation at its source. These active ingredients give ginger its distinctive spicy flavor while also providing medicinal benefits for your cardiovascular system. Unlike NSAIDs, which can harm your gut and kidneys with long-term use, ginger reduces inflammation without these dangerous side effects.

Research shows ginger significantly lowers inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP), directly linked to heart disease risk. Studies have found ginger can be as effective as some over-the-counter pain medications in reducing inflammation and pain. Natural remedies like ginger restore balance without harsh side effects, making it a viable alternative for managing chronic inflammation. Beyond fighting inflammation, ginger improves circulation by preventing platelets from clumping together. This means better blood flow to your heart and brain, reducing your risk of clots that could lead to heart attacks or strokes.

Imagine starting your day with a warm cup of ginger tea. Simply steep thin slices in hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. Add lemon and honey for taste and extra health benefits. This simple routine can seamlessly fit into your daily life. Ginger also works well in smoothies, juices, and cooked dishes. Its warming flavor complements both sweet and savory recipes. If you don’t enjoy the taste of ginger, standardized extracts in capsule form offer another option. These supplements contain concentrated doses of the active compounds found in fresh ginger.

Ginger supports overall health beyond heart benefits. It aids digestion, boosts immunity, and may help with weight management. The herb is generally safe for daily consumption, though people on blood thinners should consult their doctor before taking large amounts. Unlike medications that only mask symptoms, ginger addresses multiple root causes of cardiovascular disease. It reduces inflammation, improves circulation, and provides antioxidant protection—all without the side effects of pharmaceuticals.

Our Number 4 herb is “Hawthorn Berry”: The Heart Muscle Tonic.

Hawthorn berry has been used in European and Chinese medicine for centuries to support heart health. This small red berry contains flavonoids that improve cardiovascular function. Unlike many heart medications with serious side effects, hawthorn offers a gentler approach that strengthens the heart over time. Studies show it can help with heart failure symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue, making it a valuable natural option for heart support.

The active compounds in hawthorn relax blood vessels, improving circulation and lowering blood pressure. This effect reduces arterial stiffness, allowing blood to flow more easily. Research suggests hawthorn may help the heart pump more efficiently, though specific studies on ejection fraction weren’t detailed. The berries contain antioxidants that protect against LDL cholesterol oxidation, a key factor in plaque buildup in arteries.

Traditionally, hawthorn is used in teas made from berries, flowers, and leaves. In some regions, people make the berries into jams, pies, and syrups. While these forms provide benefits, standardized extracts offer more concentrated doses of active compounds. Typical supplement dosages range from 250-500 mg taken three times daily. It’s crucial to choose products tested for quality, as supplement purity can vary between brands.

Hawthorn acts like a natural tune-up for your heart, not just managing symptoms but strengthening the heart muscle over time. This makes it particularly useful for people with mild heart failure or those looking to support overall cardiovascular health. The berries have been part of traditional Chinese medicine since at least 659 A.D., showing their long history of safe use when properly prepared and dosed.

One important consideration with hawthorn is its potential to interact with heart medications. It may increase the effects of blood thinners, blood pressure drugs, and heart failure medications. If you’re currently taking prescription heart medications, consult your doctor before adding hawthorn to your routine. This precaution helps avoid unwanted interactions while still allowing you to benefit from hawthorn’s natural properties.

A personal story: my grandmother swore by hawthorn tea for her heart health, a tradition passed down through generations.

And at Number 5, we have “Hibiscus”: The ACE Inhibitor Alternative.

What if you could lower your blood pressure simply by drinking tea? Hibiscus offers this possibility, working similarly to prescription ACE inhibitors but without the side effects. The bright red flowers contain anthocyanins and other compounds that help relax blood vessels and reduce fluid retention, naturally supporting healthy blood pressure. While pharmaceutical ACE inhibitors often cause persistent coughs and kidney issues, hibiscus provides comparable benefits through natural mechanisms.

A study published in the Journal of Nutrition showed significant results. Participants who drank 3 cups of hibiscus tea daily saw their systolic blood pressure drop by an average of 7 points within just 6 weeks. This reduction is comparable to many blood pressure medications, highlighting hibiscus’s potential as a natural alternative. Instead of forcing your blood pressure down, hibiscus helps your body regulate it naturally through multiple pathways.

Hibiscus also reduces arterial stiffness, a condition that increases heart attack and stroke risk as arteries lose flexibility over time. Few medications effectively address this, making hibiscus particularly valuable. The plant compounds improve blood vessel elasticity, enhancing circulation and reducing strain on the heart. This effect complements its blood pressure-lowering action for comprehensive cardiovascular support.

Preparing hibiscus tea is straightforward. Use 1-2 teaspoons of dried flowers per cup of hot water. Steep for 5-10 minutes to extract the beneficial compounds. The tea has a tart, cranberry-like flavor with a refreshing aroma that some people enjoy plain, while others prefer adding a bit of honey. For consistent results, aim for 2-3 cups daily. If you don’t like the taste, standardized supplements containing 250-500 mg of hibiscus extract provide an alternative.

Beyond blood pressure benefits, hibiscus acts as a natural diuretic, helping reduce excess fluid without depleting potassium like some prescription diuretics do. The plant also contains antioxidants that protect against cellular damage throughout the body. Some research suggests it may support healthy cholesterol levels and liver function, though more studies are needed in these areas.

There you have it! Five powerful herbs that help lower blood pressure and clear arteries. You now have a powerful natural toolkit for supporting your cardiovascular system. Cayenne boosts circulation; garlic helps manage blood pressure; ginger reduces inflammation; hawthorn strengthens the heart; and hibiscus relaxes blood vessels.

Start with the herb that addresses your main concern, like high blood pressure or poor circulation. Consistency is key—daily use is most effective.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/3-miracle-herbs-to-instantly-lower-blood-pressure/,3 Miracle Herbs to Instantly Lower Blood Pressure & Clear Arteries Naturally,"Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, yet many people overlook the powerful natural remedies available in their own kitchens. Imagine being able to support your cardiovascular health, improve circulation, and reduce your risk of heart disease—all without expensive medications or invasive procedures. Nature has provided us with three extraordinary herbs that can do just that: cayenne pepper, garlic, and ginger. These humble ingredients pack a serious punch when it comes to heart health, offering benefits that have been recognized for centuries.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore how each of these herbs works to protect your heart and improve your overall well-being. We’ll break down the science into simple terms, provide practical ways to incorporate them into your daily routine, and explain why they’re often more effective—and safer—than many pharmaceutical options. Whether you’re looking to prevent heart problems or support existing cardiovascular health, these three herbs could be the natural solution you’ve been searching for.

Cayenne Pepper: The Fiery Heart Protector

Cayenne pepper does much more than add heat to your food—it’s a cardiovascular powerhouse. The secret lies in its active component called capsaicin, which gives cayenne its characteristic spiciness and its remarkable health benefits. This vibrant red pepper works in three key ways to support heart health: thinning the blood, dilating blood vessels, and strengthening arterial walls.

When we say cayenne thins the blood, we mean it helps prevent dangerous clotting that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Unlike pharmaceutical blood thinners that often come with risky side effects like excessive bleeding, cayenne provides this benefit naturally and safely. As a vasodilator, cayenne helps relax and widen blood vessels, improving circulation and reducing blood pressure. This is particularly important for people with hypertension or poor circulation.

Perhaps most impressively, cayenne actually strengthens the walls of your arteries. Over time, arteries can become damaged and clogged with plaque—a condition called atherosclerosis. Cayenne helps reinforce these vital passageways, making them more resilient. The herb is so effective that some natural health practitioners suggest it could be an alternative to bypass surgery in certain cases of clogged arteries.

Beyond its cardiovascular benefits, cayenne offers several other health advantages. It stimulates digestion by increasing gastric juices, which can improve nutrient absorption and relieve bloating. Many people find it helps with weight management by boosting metabolism and promoting fat burning. Topically, cayenne can relieve muscle and joint pain when used in creams or ointments because it increases blood flow to affected areas.

Incorporating cayenne into your routine is surprisingly easy. If you’re sensitive to spice, capsules are an excellent option—many practitioners recommend taking two capsules three times daily for cardiovascular support. For those who enjoy some heat, cayenne tea (just ¼ teaspoon in hot water with honey or lemon) makes a warming, circulation-boosting drink. You can also sprinkle it on foods like eggs, soups, or roasted vegetables, or add a pinch to smoothies for an extra metabolic kick. The key is to start with small amounts and gradually increase as your tolerance builds.

Garlic: The Ancient Heart Medicine

Garlic has been valued as both food and medicine for thousands of years, and modern research continues to uncover its impressive cardiovascular benefits. This pungent bulb contains powerful sulfur compounds, particularly allicin, which are responsible for both its distinctive aroma and its health-promoting properties. Garlic works on multiple fronts to protect your heart and improve circulation.

One of garlic’s most significant benefits is its ability to lower blood pressure naturally. The sulfur compounds in garlic help relax blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more freely and reducing strain on the cardiovascular system. Studies have shown that regular garlic consumption can be as effective as some prescription blood pressure medications, but without the side effects. For people with hypertension, adding garlic to their diet could make a meaningful difference in their health.

Garlic also helps manage cholesterol levels, specifically by reducing small dense LDL (the “bad” cholesterol) while supporting HDL (the “good” cholesterol). This balancing act is crucial for preventing plaque buildup in arteries, which can lead to atherosclerosis and increased risk of heart attack or stroke. Additionally, garlic acts as a natural blood thinner, helping to prevent dangerous clots that can block blood flow to the heart or brain.

The benefits of garlic extend far beyond heart health. It’s a potent immune booster, with antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties that can help ward off infections. During cold and flu season, garlic can be particularly valuable for both prevention and treatment. It also supports the body’s natural detoxification processes, helping to eliminate heavy metals and other toxins that can contribute to chronic disease.

To get the most from garlic, it’s best to consume it raw and crushed or chopped, then allowed to sit for about 10 minutes before eating or cooking. This waiting period allows the allicin to fully develop. While cooked garlic still offers benefits, some of its potency is reduced by heat. For those who dislike the taste or are concerned about garlic breath, odorless supplements are available. Whether added to salad dressings, blended into hummus, or taken in capsule form, making garlic a regular part of your diet could be one of the simplest and most effective steps you take for your heart health.

Ginger: The Warming Circulatory Tonic

Ginger, with its distinctive spicy-sweet flavor, has been used in traditional medicine systems for thousands of years to treat everything from digestive upset to inflammatory conditions. When it comes to heart health, ginger offers several important benefits that make it worthy of inclusion in your daily routine. Like cayenne and garlic, ginger acts as both a blood thinner and vasodilator, but it brings its own unique set of advantages to the table.

One of ginger’s standout features is its powerful anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation is now recognized as a root cause of many diseases, including heart disease. The compounds in ginger, particularly gingerols, help reduce this damaging inflammation throughout the body. For people with arthritis or other inflammatory conditions, ginger can provide relief comparable to some over-the-counter pain medications, but without the potential side effects.

Ginger’s ability to improve circulation makes it particularly valuable for cardiovascular health. By helping blood vessels relax and widen, ginger promotes better blood flow, which can lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the heart. Improved circulation also means more oxygen and nutrients reach your tissues and organs, enhancing overall vitality. Many people who regularly consume ginger report feeling warmer and having better circulation to their extremities—a boon for those who often suffer from cold hands and feet.

The herb is perhaps best known for its digestive benefits, which indirectly support heart health. Ginger stimulates digestive enzymes, helps food move smoothly through the digestive tract, and can relieve nausea, bloating, and indigestion. A healthy digestive system contributes to better nutrient absorption and reduced inflammation—both important factors in maintaining cardiovascular wellness. Additionally, ginger has been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels, which is crucial for preventing diabetes and its associated cardiovascular risks.

Incorporating ginger into your daily life is both simple and enjoyable. Fresh ginger makes a wonderful tea when steeped in hot water—add lemon and honey for extra flavor and health benefits. Grated ginger adds zing to stir-fries, soups, and salad dressings, while a small piece blended into smoothies provides a metabolic boost. For convenience, ginger supplements are widely available, though they may not offer the full spectrum of benefits found in the fresh root. Whether you choose to enjoy it in food, as tea, or in supplement form, making ginger a regular part of your routine could pay significant dividends for your heart health and overall well-being.

Final Thoughts: A Natural Approach to Heart Health

The combination of cayenne pepper, garlic, and ginger offers a comprehensive, natural approach to cardiovascular wellness. Together, these herbs provide blood-thinning properties, improved circulation, reduced inflammation, and stronger arteries—all crucial factors in preventing and managing heart disease. What makes them particularly appealing is their safety profile; unlike many pharmaceutical options, these herbs can be used long-term with minimal risk of side effects when consumed in reasonable amounts.

Implementing these herbs into your daily life doesn’t require drastic changes. Start by adding one to your diet—perhaps garlic in your evening meal or ginger tea in the morning. As you become comfortable, gradually incorporate the others. Pay attention to how your body responds; many people report increased energy, better digestion, and improved circulation within weeks of regular use.

While these herbs are powerful, they work best as part of a holistic approach to heart health that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, and adequate sleep. For those on blood-thinning medications, it’s wise to consult with a healthcare provider before making significant changes to your herb consumption.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 28, 2025"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/top-8-foods-for-stronger-legs/,"Top 8 Foods for Stronger Legs (Seniors, Eat Daily!)","What if I told you your leg muscles are slowly dying – and most people don’t realize it until it’s too late After age 40, your body starts a silent war against your muscle strength. You’ll lose 3-5% of muscle mass every decade[1], turning strong legs into weaker shadows of their former selves. By 60, you could be 20% weaker without even noticing[2].

But here’s what’s truly surprising: researchers have discovered 8 specific foods that activate muscle rebuilding at the cellular level—going beyond what squats, walking, or even resistance training alone can achieve.

These aren’t expensive supplements or hard-to-find superfoods, but common foods you might already have in your kitchen. In fact, #3 is so effective at turning back the clock on muscle loss that it even surprises nutritionists.

Continue watching, because in just 10 minutes, you’ll discover how these everyday foods can help you rebuild your strength from within – starting with your very next meal.

8. Sardines: Nature’s Muscle Repair Kit

First, let’s start with Number 8: Sardines, Nature’s Muscle Repair Kit. This humble fish might be the most overlooked protein in the grocery store, but it’s a muscle-rebuilding secret weapon.

While salmon steals the spotlight, sardines pack a comparable amount of omega-3 fatty acids, making them a powerhouse for leg muscle strength.

As you age, your leg weakness stems from what’s happening inside your muscle cells. The mitochondria, those tiny power plants inside your muscle cells, begin to malfunction. Think of it as your muscle engine running on dirty oil – no amount of walking or squats will fix this cellular damage.

That’s where sardines come in. The EPA and DHA omega-3s in these small fish repair the membranes of your mitochondria[4], making them more fluid and functional so your muscle cells produce energy efficiently.

What’s surprising? Research shows adults over 50 who consumed sardines just twice weekly experienced up to 15% increase in leg strength after 12 weeks[3]. This remarkable improvement comes from sardines’ unique combination of vitamin D and calcium that creates the perfect environment for muscle protein synthesis while strengthening the bone-muscle connection.

7. Pumpkin Seeds: Brain-Muscle Communication Booster

Moving to Number 7: Pumpkin Seeds, Your Brain-Muscle Communication Powerhouse. Those impressive gains from sardines are just the beginning. But what happens when your brain sends the command to move and your legs don’t respond properly? This communication breakdown affects nearly one-third of older adults, and the surprising culprit is often a zinc deficiency.

Muscle strength is about more than cells—it’s about communication. Sometimes your legs are perfectly capable of generating force, but the signal from your brain gets lost in transmission.

Think of your neuromuscular system as an orchestra that needs perfect synchronization. Zinc activates protein kinase C, an enzyme that strengthens the connection between nerves and muscles[6]. Without it, these vital signals become weak, making your legs feel unreliable.

This is why pumpkin seeds deserve a spotlight in your diet. A small handful delivers zinc that improves brain-to-muscle communication, while their magnesium content works alongside to relax muscles and prevent painful cramps.

Research shows adults over 60 who consumed just 1-2 tablespoons of pumpkin seeds daily experienced significant improvements in leg strength and reaction time[5]—helping with everyday activities like catching yourself before a fall.

6. Seaweed: Your Body’s Energy Efficiency Hack

Next up, we have Number 6, Seaweed: Your Body’s Energy Efficiency Hack. You’ve mastered the building blocks of muscle communication, but what if your muscles simply don’t have the energy to respond?

Many people have thyroid problems that don’t show up on standard blood tests, even though their thyroid isn’t working as well as it should. This hidden issue—called subclinical hypothyroidism—might be why your legs feel weak no matter what you try.

Here’s what’s happening: Your thyroid needs iodine to make hormones that control your energy levels. Without enough iodine, your leg muscles can’t generate power efficiently. Think about climbing stairs easily instead of feeling that burning fatigue—that’s what proper thyroid function feels like.

This is where seaweed comes to the rescue. Just one gram of nori seaweed gives you up to 20 times your daily iodine needs in a form your body can use immediately[8]. But seaweed does more than just provide iodine—it also contains vanadium (which helps transport glucose to fuel your muscles) and the brown pigment fucoxanthin (which boosts your cells’ energy production).

Research proves it works: A groundbreaking study at Hokkaido University found that older adults who consumed seaweed daily for 12 weeks saw their leg strength improve by 12% and reported 30% less fatigue during daily activities[7].

5. Organ Meats (Liver): Your Body’s Natural Energy Charger

Moving on, Number 5 is, Organ Meats: Your Body’s Natural Energy Charger. Seaweed’s impressive effects on muscle energy are just the beginning. But what happens when your muscles have the energy to work but lack the raw materials to repair and rebuild? The most nutrient-dense food on the planet—one that’s almost completely missing from modern diets—might be the answer your weakening legs have been waiting for.

Liver, once a staple for our ancestors, is actively avoided by most Americans today. This nutritional powerhouse acts like nature’s multivitamin, delivering the world’s richest source of bioavailable vitamin B12 alongside concentrated compounds specifically needed for muscle function.

This avoidance creates a serious problem: vitamin B12 deficiency affects approximately 15% of adults over 60[9], leading to muscle weakness routinely dismissed as “just getting older.”

What makes liver truly remarkable is its pre-formed vitamin A content that activates satellite cells—specialized stem cells that repair damaged muscle tissue but become increasingly dormant with age. Its unique heme iron improves oxygen transport to muscles[10], allowing your legs to generate more force with less fatigue.

4. Turmeric: The Natural Muscle Soreness Stopper

Next up, Number 4 is Turmeric: The Natural Muscle Soreness Stopper. The impressive strength improvement from liver consumption reveals just one piece of the muscle-building puzzle. What you may not realize is that while providing the right nutrients is crucial, your body might be fighting an invisible battle against its own repair systems.

As we age, a hidden inflammatory cascade begins to undermine our muscle integrity, regardless of how well we eat. The primary culprit is the NF-kB cellular pathway, which becomes hyperactive in adults over 50, increasing by approximately 40% compared to younger adults. This inflammation acts like rust slowly eating away at metal, signaling your muscles to break down protein faster than you can rebuild it.

I know how frustrating this silent battle can be. Fortunately, turmeric enters the picture with its active compound curcumin. Curcumin specifically targets and inhibits the NF-kB pathway – essentially acting as a biochemical “off switch” for muscle wasting.

Studies show that turmeric extract reduces inflammatory markers by up to 38%[11] and improves leg strength by up to 12% in older adults—likely due to its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

What makes turmeric particularly effective is how it also enhances muscle insulin sensitivity, improving glucose uptake – the primary fuel source for movement and strength.

3. Hemp Seeds: The Complete Muscle-Building Protein

Moving on, Number 3 is, Hemp Seeds: The Complete Muscle-Building Protein. Reducing inflammation with turmeric is only half the battle – your muscles still need the raw materials to rebuild. This is where protein quality becomes critical, especially after 40 when our bodies become more selective about the building blocks they can effectively use.

Most plant proteins present a frustrating problem for aging muscles. They lack essential amino acids your body needs, while excessive animal proteins can increase inflammatory markers, potentially undoing your turmeric benefits.

Hemp seeds offer a rare complete plant protein, providing all nine essential amino acids in proportions that support muscle growth—especially when combined with other protein sources.

While not as potent as animal proteins for triggering muscle synthesis, their balanced profile makes them a valuable option for plant-based diets.

A 2021 University of Manitoba study confirmed this advantage. When adults over 45 consumed hemp protein for eight weeks, they experienced 15% faster muscle recovery and greater strength gains compared to other plant proteins.

Hemp seeds contain leucine—a key amino acid for muscle growth—in amounts higher than many plants, though less than animal proteins. Their 3:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids[14] creates the ideal environment for muscle rebuilding. Participants reported noticeable improvements in everyday activities like climbing stairs.

2. Bone Broth: Your Muscle and Joint Repair Drink

Next, at Number 2, is Bone Broth: Your Muscle and Joint Repair Drink. Those newfound leg strength gains from hemp protein might be impressive, but they’ll be short-lived if you’re ignoring the silent breakdown happening in your connective tissue. After age 40, your body produces 1-2% less collagen each year—imagine your body’s natural glue slowly losing its adhesive power, affecting not just your skin, but the critical network that transmits force from your muscles.

You can build impressive leg muscles, but if the tendons connecting them to your bones deteriorate, that strength won’t translate to real life. Bone broth serves as a tissue regenerator by providing what other proteins can’t—specific amino acids like glycine[16], proline, and hydroxyproline that rebuild fascia, tendons, and ligaments. It also delivers glycosaminoglycans that act like natural WD-40 for your joints, reducing friction and grinding pain.

Clinical research confirms these benefits: adults with early sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) who consumed bone broth daily saw a 13% improvement in leg strength while joint discomfort decreased by 70%[15]. Many participants reported climbing stairs without handrail support for the first time in years.

1. Fermented Foods: Your Muscle’s Secret Support System

Finally, at Number 1, we have Fermented Foods: Your Muscle’s Secret Support System. Strengthening your leg muscles is about what your body absorbs, not just what you eat. There’s a hidden reason why 60% of adults over 50 struggle with muscle weakness despite eating well: their gut bacteria are working against them, not for them. Scientists have discovered the “gut-muscle axis”—a direct communication pathway between your intestinal microbiome and leg muscles that could be the missing piece in your strength puzzle.

When your gut microbiome falls out of balance (dysbiosis), it prevents proper nutrient absorption while triggering inflammation that weakens muscle fibers. Like a clogged pipe that reduces water pressure, this imbalance restricts the flow of nutrients your muscles need to stay strong.

A groundbreaking study from the University of Copenhagen found that participants consuming fermented foods daily for just eight weeks experienced a 25% improvement in nutrient absorption efficiency and an 11% increase in leg strength—without changing their exercise routines[17].

Fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, cottage cheese and kefir introduce beneficial bacteria that repair your gut barrier function. These friendly microbes produce short-chain fatty acids that travel through your bloodstream to your muscles, reducing inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity—allowing your muscles to absorb more glucose for energy[18].

There you have it – eight powerful foods to strengthen your legs. Start with just two or three that target your most pressing needs. Choose sardines and organ meats if fatigue is your main challenge, or bone broth if joint pain is holding you back.

For a simpler solution, try our recommended supplement below. It delivers all the essential amino acids in precise ratios to rebuild muscle and maintain strength as you age.

A subscriber of our email newsletter had this to say after trying these capsules: “I have a definite increase in strength in doing everything! I believe also that due to my increase in strength my stamina is also improved.””

These real-world results confirm what science tells us – proper nutrition transforms weakened legs into

Remember, age-related muscle loss isn’t your inevitable fate. With these strategic nutritional choices, you can rebuild strength, restore confidence, and reclaim the active, independent lifestyle you deserve.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/say-goodbye-to-leg-cramps/,Say Goodbye to Leg Cramps: 8 Vitamins Every Senior Needs for Stronger Legs,"Can you stand up from a chair without using your hands? Can you walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded or feeling unstable? If you hesitated before answering, you’re experiencing the early warning signs of nutrient-related leg weakness – a condition affecting millions of adults over 50.

I’ve identified the 8 specific nutrients that directly target leg strength and mobility. These aren’t general vitamins – they’re targeted compounds that each address a different aspect of leg health. One prevents cramps by optimizing nerve signals. Another rebuilds muscle tissue at the cellular level. Together, they form a complete system for restoring leg strength at any age. By the end of this video, you’ll know exactly which ones you need most.

8. VITAMIN D: THE MOBILITY MOLECULE

Ever notice how many seniors struggle just to get up from a chair? What most don’t realize is that this isn’t simply “old age” at work. In fact, up to 60% of older adults are walking around with insufficient vitamin D levels, completely unaware that this deficiency is sabotaging their mobility [1].

Here’s what’s really happening: vitamin D deficiency directly weakens your leg muscles, regardless of how much you exercise. This creates a dangerous cycle – as your legs grow weaker, walking becomes more difficult, which means you move less, further reducing both sun exposure and muscle strength. It’s a mobility trap that countless seniors fall into.

At the cellular level, vitamin D works like a key that unlocks your muscle’s full strength potential. It maintains muscle fiber integrity while simultaneously supporting the bone density that provides the structural foundation your legs need for stability [2].

The evidence is compelling – research from the American Geriatrics Society shows that seniors who take vitamin D supplements are 23% less likely to fall than those who don’t [3]. For optimal results, aim for 800 to 2000 IU daily, with vitamin D3 being far more effective than D2. The three most effective ways to boost your levels? Get 15-20 minutes of midday sun exposure, consume fatty fish like salmon and mackerel regularly, and take a quality supplement with a meal containing healthy fats for maximum absorption.

7. MAGNESIUM: THE MUSCLE RELAXATION MASTER

While vitamin D strengthens your muscles, there’s another crucial mineral your body desperately needs that most people overlook. Those excruciating leg cramps that jolt you awake at night? They’re not just random occurrences or inevitable signs of aging – they’re your body’s distress signal indicating a serious magnesium deficiency [4].

Magnesium serves as your body’s natural “relaxation mineral.” When levels drop too low, your muscles literally can’t release properly after contracting. This creates a dangerous biochemical imbalance where muscles remain in a semi-contracted state, leaving them tense, tight, and prone to those sudden, vise-like grips that can make you cry out in pain. The problem only intensifies as we age, when our ability to absorb this crucial nutrient naturally declines [5].

What makes magnesium so essential is its role in regulating muscle function and nerve signaling. It acts like a gatekeeper for calcium, which triggers muscle contractions. Without sufficient magnesium, calcium floods your muscle cells, keeping them perpetually tense. Beyond preventing cramps, research shows magnesium dramatically improves circulation to leg muscles, ensuring they receive the oxygen and nutrients needed for proper function [6].

For optimal results, aim for 320-420mg daily from three powerful sources: dark leafy greens like spinach, magnesium-rich pumpkin seeds, and yes, even a small square of dark chocolate. Can’t get enough from food? Magnesium glycinate supplements offer the highest absorption rate with minimal digestive discomfort.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 23, 2025"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/mistake-youre-making-with-canned-tuna/,Warning: The #1 Mistake You’re Making with Canned Tuna (Avoid Mercury!),"We all know canned tuna is a quick, affordable, and protein-packed meal option. But what if I told you that your favorite tuna sandwich could be slowly harming your health? Yes, that humble can of tuna sitting in your pantry might be hiding a dangerous secret: mercury.

Mercury is a toxic heavy metal that can wreak havoc on your brain and nervous system, especially if consumed in excess. And here’s the kicker—not all tuna is created equal. Some types of tuna are far more contaminated with mercury than others, and if you’re not paying attention, you could be unknowingly filling your body with this dangerous toxin.

In this post, we’ll dive deep into the world of canned tuna, uncovering the truth about mercury, the biggest mistakes people make when buying and eating tuna, and how you can enjoy this nutritious food without putting your health at risk. Let’s get started!

What is Mercury, and Why Should You Care?

Mercury is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in the Earth’s crust. However, thanks to industrial activities like coal burning and mining, large amounts of mercury have been released into the environment. This mercury eventually finds its way into rivers, lakes, and oceans, where it undergoes a dangerous transformation.

In water, mercury is converted into methylmercury, a highly toxic form that accumulates in the bodies of fish. Small fish absorb methylmercury from the water, and when larger fish like tuna eat those smaller fish, the mercury builds up in their bodies over time. This process is called bioaccumulation, and it’s why large predatory fish like tuna end up with such high levels of mercury.

When we eat tuna, we’re also consuming that accumulated mercury. Over time, this can lead to serious health issues, especially for vulnerable groups like pregnant women, young children, and people with nervous or cardiovascular system concerns.

The #1 Mistake Everyone Makes with Canned Tuna

The biggest mistake people make when buying canned tuna? Not knowing the difference between tuna species. Not all tuna is the same, and the type of tuna you choose can have a huge impact on your mercury exposure.

Here’s a breakdown of the three main types of tuna you’ll find on supermarket shelves:

Skipjack Tuna: This is the smallest and most commonly consumed tuna. It’s labeled simply as “tuna” on most cans and has the lowest mercury levels (0.12 parts per million). Skipjack is the safest choice for regular consumption.
Yellowfin Tuna: Larger than skipjack, yellowfin tuna lives longer (7-10 years) and has almost three times the mercury levels (0.35 parts per million). It’s still safe to eat but should be consumed in moderation.
Albacore Tuna: This is the big one—literally. Albacore tuna contains the highest levels of mercury (up to 0.50 parts per million). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend significantly limiting your consumption of albacore tuna.

Pro Tip: Always check the label to see which type of tuna you’re buying. If it just says “tuna,” it’s likely skipjack, the safest option. But if it’s labeled “light tuna” or “yellowfin,” be prepared for higher mercury levels.

3 More Common Mistakes When Eating Canned Tuna
Not Reading Labels Carefully: Many people grab a can of tuna without checking the label. But this small oversight can have a big impact on your health. Look for cans that specify the type of tuna, and if you’re unsure, do a quick search on the manufacturer’s website. Some brands are more transparent than others.
Overdoing It: Canned tuna is convenient, but eating too much can lead to mercury buildup in your body. The U.S. dietary guidelines recommend eating about 8 ounces (227 grams) of seafood per week, including tuna. To reduce your mercury exposure, rotate tuna with other low-mercury fish like salmon, sardines, mackerel, and trout.
Not Draining the Tuna Properly: Whether your tuna is packed in water or oil, draining it properly is crucial. If you don’t, your mayo will get watery, and your salad will turn into soup. Use a fine mesh strainer or the can’s lid to press out every last drop of liquid. This simple step makes a huge difference in the final texture of your dish.
Tuna in Water vs. Tuna in Oil: Which is Better?

Here’s where things get interesting. Fresh tuna is always the best option, but let’s face it—canned tuna is a lifesaver on busy days. So, should you go for tuna packed in water or oil?

Tuna in Oil: Heavy metals like mercury are lipophilic, meaning they’re attracted to fat. When you drain the oil from tuna, you’re also discarding a good portion of those unwanted contaminants. Plus, tuna in oil has higher amounts of omega-3s and vitamin D. However, it’s also higher in calories.
Tuna in Water: While it’s lower in calories, tuna packed in water retains more mercury because there’s no oil to trap the metals. So, if you’re looking to reduce mercury exposure, well-drained tuna in oil might be the smarter choice.
How to Enjoy Tuna Safely

Tuna is an incredibly nutritious food, packed with protein, omega-3s, and essential vitamins. The goal isn’t to stop eating it—it’s to make smarter choices. Here’s how:

Choose Skipjack Tuna: Opt for cans labeled simply as “tuna,” which are usually skipjack, the lowest-mercury option.
Read Labels Carefully: Always check the type of tuna and the brand’s transparency about mercury levels.
Rotate with Other Fish: Mix tuna with other low-mercury fish like salmon, sardines, and trout.
Watch Your Portions: Stick to the recommended 8 ounces of seafood per week to keep mercury exposure in check.

Final Thoughts

Canned tuna doesn’t have to be a health hazard. By understanding the risks and making informed choices, you can enjoy this convenient and nutritious food without worrying about mercury. Remember, it’s all about balance and awareness.

So, the next time you’re at the supermarket, take a moment to check the label and choose wisely. Your brain—and your body—will thank you.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 21, 2025"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-hair-loss-naturally/,Stop Hair Loss Naturally: The Vitamin Your Hair Has Been Craving,"Are you struggling with hair loss and dreaming of thick, healthy hair again? You’re not alone. Hair loss is a common issue that affects millions of people worldwide, but the good news is that there are natural solutions to help you regain your confidence and your hair. In this blog post, we’ll dive into the key causes of hair loss and reveal the secret vitamin that can make a world of difference. Let’s get started!

Understanding the Root Causes of Hair Loss

Before we talk about solutions, it’s important to understand what causes hair loss in the first place. There are five primary reasons why people lose their hair:

Genetic Predisposition: Unfortunately, if hair loss runs in your family, there’s not much you can do to change your genes. However, you can still take steps to slow down the process.
Hormonal Changes: This is especially relevant for women. Hormonal fluctuations due to pregnancy, menopause, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can lead to hair thinning and loss.
Medications: Certain medications can have side effects that include hair loss. If you’re taking daily medications, it’s worth discussing this with your doctor.
Medical Conditions: Diseases like alopecia areata, where the immune system attacks hair follicles, can cause significant hair loss. Androgenic alopecia, a hereditary condition, is another common culprit.
Poor Diet: A lack of essential vitamins and minerals in your diet can lead to weak, brittle hair and eventual hair loss. This is where we can make a real difference!

While we can’t control our genetics or some medical conditions, we can influence our diet, stress levels, and overall lifestyle. And that’s where the secret vitamin comes in.

The Secret Vitamin for Hair Health: Biotin (Vitamin B7)

When it comes to hair health, biotin, also known as vitamin B7, is the star of the show. Biotin is part of the B-complex group of vitamins, which are essential for maintaining a healthy metabolism, nerves, and cardiovascular system. But biotin’s real claim to fame is its role in the production of keratin, the protein that makes up your hair, skin, and nails.

Why Biotin is a Game-Changer for Hair Loss
Strengthens Hair: Biotin helps in the production of keratin, which is the main building block of your hair. Stronger keratin means stronger, healthier hair.
Prevents Thinning: A deficiency in biotin can lead to hair thinning and even hair loss. By ensuring you get enough biotin, you can prevent this from happening.
Boosts Hair Growth: Biotin promotes the healthy growth of cells, including those in your hair follicles. This means not only will your hair stop falling out, but it will also grow back thicker and healthier.
Improves Overall Health: Biotin doesn’t just benefit your hair. It also aids in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, helping your body function at its best.
How to Get More Biotin in Your Diet

The best way to ensure you’re getting enough biotin is through your diet. Here are some biotin-rich foods you should consider adding to your meals:

Eggs: A great source of biotin, especially the yolk.
Legumes: Beans, peas, lentils, and chickpeas are all excellent choices.
Nuts and Seeds: Almonds, peanuts, and sunflower seeds are packed with biotin.
Vegetables: Sweet potatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, and spinach are all rich in this essential vitamin.
Fish: Salmon and tuna are not only great for your hair but also for your overall health.
Other Sources: Liver, bananas, avocados, and nutritional yeast are also fantastic options.

If you’re not getting enough biotin from your diet alone, consider taking a B-complex vitamin supplement that includes biotin. Just make sure to follow the recommended dosage on the packaging.

A Word of Caution: Not All Supplements Are Created Equal

When it comes to supplements, quality matters. Unfortunately, not all supplement manufacturers are trustworthy. In fact, it’s estimated that only about 10% of supplement brands are of high quality. Do your research and choose a reputable brand to ensure you’re getting the best possible product.

Final Thoughts: Take Control of Your Hair Health

Hair loss can be a frustrating and emotional experience, but it’s not something you have to accept as inevitable. By understanding the causes of hair loss and taking steps to address them—especially by ensuring you get enough biotin—you can make a significant difference in the health of your hair.

Remember, a healthy diet, stress management, and the right supplements can go a long way in preventing hair loss and promoting hair growth. If you’re ready to take the next step, consider consulting with a healthcare professional or a nutritionist who can guide you on your journey to healthier hair.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/lower-your-blood-pressure-naturally/,Lower Your Blood Pressure Naturally: The Ancient Spice That Works Wonders!,"When it comes to natural remedies, few things are as powerful—and as delicious—as cardamom. This ancient spice, often found in curries, teas, and desserts, is more than just a flavor enhancer. It’s a powerhouse of healing properties that can address a wide range of health issues, from digestive problems to high blood pressure. If you’re looking for a natural way to improve your health, especially if you’re struggling with hypertension, cardamom might just be the answer you’ve been searching for.

What is Cardamom?

Cardamom is a spice that comes from the seeds of plants in the ginger family. It’s commonly used in Indian, Middle Eastern, and Scandinavian cuisines, but its benefits go far beyond the kitchen. The spice is available in two main forms: green cardamom and black cardamom. Green cardamom, the more commonly used variety, is known for its sweet, floral flavor and potent medicinal properties.

The Healing Powers of Cardamom

Cardamom is packed with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, and essential oils that make it a versatile remedy for various health issues. Here’s a breakdown of what this incredible spice can do for you:

1. Digestive Health

If you’ve ever struggled with bloating, gas, or indigestion, cardamom can be a game-changer. It helps soothe the digestive tract, reducing discomfort and promoting better digestion. The spice also contains insoluble fiber, which aids in relieving constipation and keeping your digestive system running smoothly.

2. Anti-Inflammatory Benefits

Inflammation is at the root of many chronic diseases, from arthritis to heart disease. Cardamom’s anti-inflammatory properties can help reduce inflammation in your joints, blood vessels, and even your digestive system. Whether you’re dealing with colitis, gastritis, or arthritis, incorporating cardamom into your diet can provide relief.

3. Oral Health

Bad breath? Cardamom has natural antimicrobial properties that fight bacteria in your mouth, leaving you with fresh breath. It’s no wonder that this spice has been used for centuries as a natural breath freshener.

4. Respiratory Health

Cardamom is excellent for your lungs and respiratory system. It soothes coughs, reduces congestion, and can even help with conditions like bronchitis. Acting as an expectorant, it helps clear mucus from your airways, making it easier to breathe.

5. Weight Management

If you’re looking to shed a few pounds, cardamom can help. It boosts your metabolism and improves fat metabolism, making it a valuable addition to any weight management plan.

How Cardamom Lowers Blood Pressure

Now, let’s dive into one of cardamom’s most impressive benefits: its ability to lower blood pressure. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and other serious health conditions. Here’s how cardamom can help:

1. Reduces Oxidative Stress and Inflammation

Cardamom is rich in antioxidants, which combat oxidative stress—a key contributor to high blood pressure. By reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in your blood vessels, cardamom helps keep your cardiovascular system healthy.

2. Acts as a Natural Diuretic

Cardamom promotes increased urine production, which helps your body eliminate excess fluid. This reduction in fluid volume can lead to lower blood pressure, as your heart doesn’t have to work as hard to pump blood through your system.

3. Promotes Vasodilation

Cardamom helps dilate your blood vessels, a process known as vasodilation. When your arteries are dilated, blood flows more easily, reducing the pressure on your heart. This means more oxygen and nutrients can reach your tissues, glands, and organs, keeping everything functioning optimally.

4. Contains Anti-Hypertensive Compounds

Cardamom is packed with compounds like terpenoids, flavonoids, and phola compounds, which have been shown to have anti-hypertensive effects. These compounds work together to relax your blood vessels and lower your blood pressure naturally.

How to Use Cardamom in Your Daily Life

Incorporating cardamom into your diet is easy and delicious. Here are a few simple ways to get started:

Tea: Add a third of a teaspoon of cardamom powder to your tea, or steep 4-6 cardamom pods in hot water for 10 minutes. You can drink it as is or strain it for a smoother texture.
Cooking: Use cardamom in your curries, stews, soups, and even desserts. Its unique flavor pairs well with both sweet and savory dishes.
Smoothies: Sprinkle a bit of cardamom powder into your morning smoothie for an extra health boost.
Chewing: After a meal, try chewing on a few cardamom pods. Not only will it freshen your breath, but you’ll also benefit from its digestive properties.
A Word of Caution

While cardamom is generally safe for most people, it’s always a good idea to consult with your doctor before making any significant changes to your diet, especially if you’re on medication for high blood pressure. Monitoring your blood pressure regularly is crucial, and your doctor can help you determine if cardamom is a good addition to your health regimen.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/12-amazing-benefits-of-drinking-baking-soda-water-daily/,12 Amazing Benefits of Drinking Baking Soda Water Daily,"Have you ever wondered if something as simple as baking soda could transform your health? This humble kitchen staple, known scientifically as sodium bicarbonate, has been used for thousands of years as a natural remedy. While it’s commonly associated with baking and cleaning, baking soda also boasts a surprising array of health benefits when consumed in water. From improving digestion to boosting your immune system, drinking baking soda water daily could be the game-changer your body needs. Let’s explore the 12 incredible benefits of this simple yet powerful remedy.

1. Prevents Acid Reflux

If you’ve ever felt that uncomfortable burning sensation in your chest or throat after a meal, you’ve likely experienced acid reflux. This occurs when stomach acid flows back into your esophagus, often due to poor digestion. Baking soda can help by neutralizing excess acid and promoting the flow of bile and pancreatic enzymes, which aid in breaking down food more effectively. This reduces pressure on the stomach and prevents acid from splashing upward. In fact, baking soda was even included in soldier ration packs during World War I and II to help with digestion!

2. Detoxifies the Kidneys

Your kidneys work tirelessly to filter toxins and waste from your blood. However, a buildup of uric acid can strain these vital organs, leading to kidney stones, gout, or even high blood pressure. Drinking baking soda water helps balance the pH of your kidneys, making it easier for them to flush out excess acid and toxins. Studies have shown that baking soda can slow kidney decline in patients with chronic kidney disease, making it a valuable tool for kidney health.

3. Boosts the Immune System

An overly acidic environment in your body can create the perfect breeding ground for harmful bacteria, viruses, and infections. Baking soda helps maintain a balanced pH, which is crucial for optimal immune function. As it breaks down, it releases carbon dioxide, which improves oxygen absorption in your tissues. This, in turn, enhances white blood cell activity, helping your body fight off pathogens more effectively.

4. Improves Oral Health

Tooth decay, cavities, and bad breath are often caused by an overgrowth of harmful bacteria in the mouth, which creates an acidic environment. Baking soda can neutralize this acidity, kill bacteria, and freshen your breath. Simply mix a small amount with your toothpaste and brush gently. However, limit this to twice a week to avoid damaging your tooth enamel.

5. Clears Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)

UTIs can be incredibly uncomfortable, but baking soda water may offer relief. By slightly raising the pH of your urine, it creates an environment where harmful bacteria struggle to survive. Combined with proper hydration and cranberry supplements, this remedy can help alleviate UTI symptoms within a week.

6. Reduces Muscle Soreness

After an intense workout, your muscles produce lactic acid, which leads to soreness and fatigue. Baking soda neutralizes this acid, helping your muscles recover faster. Many athletes use baking soda to improve endurance and reduce muscle fatigue during high-intensity exercise.

7. Increases Energy Levels

Feeling sluggish? Baking soda might be the pick-me-up you need. As it digests, it releases carbon dioxide, which helps red blood cells deliver more oxygen to your tissues. This boosts energy production, leaving you feeling more alert and awake throughout the day. For best results, avoid sugary breakfasts that can cause energy crashes.

8. May Help Manage Cancer Symptoms

While baking soda is not a cure for cancer, some studies suggest it can slow tumor growth by creating a less acidic environment in the body. Cancer cells thrive in low-oxygen, acidic conditions, but baking soda can increase pH levels, making it harder for tumors to grow and spread. Always consult your doctor before using baking soda as part of any treatment plan.

9. Soothes Irritated Skin

Baking soda isn’t just for internal use—it can also work wonders on your skin. Mix it with water to create a paste, and apply it to bug bites, sunburns, rashes, or allergic reactions. It balances the skin’s pH, reducing redness, itching, and swelling. For sunburns, adding baking soda to a cool bath can speed up healing.

10. Clears Sinus Congestion

Struggling with a stuffy nose? Baking soda can help clear your sinuses naturally. Use it in a nasal rinse or inhale steam with baking soda to break down mucus and open up your airways. This simple remedy can make breathing easier and provide relief from congestion.

11. Helps Prevent Bone Loss

As we age, our bones can become weaker, increasing the risk of osteoporosis. Acidic diets can exacerbate this by blocking mineral absorption. Baking soda helps the body retain calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, which are essential for maintaining strong bones. Studies have shown that it can slow down bone thinning, making it a valuable tool for bone health.

12. Fights Fungal Infections

Fungal infections, such as athlete’s foot or nail fungus, thrive in warm, moist environments. Baking soda weakens fungal cells by drawing out moisture and stopping their growth. Mix it with water or Vaseline and apply it to the affected area for a natural antifungal remedy.

How to Use Baking Soda Safely

To enjoy these benefits, mix 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda with 2 cups of cold water and drink it midday, at least an hour before lunch. However, moderation is key. Excessive use can lead to side effects like bloating, gas, or nausea. If you have a medical condition or are taking medications, consult your doctor before trying this remedy.

Final Thoughts

Baking soda water is a simple, natural remedy with a wide range of health benefits. From improving digestion and kidney function to boosting energy and fighting infections, it’s a versatile addition to your wellness routine. Give it a try and see how this ancient remedy can support your modern health goals.

Expanding on the Benefits: A Deeper Dive

Now that we’ve covered the 12 key benefits of drinking baking soda water, let’s take a closer look at how this simple remedy works and why it’s so effective.

Understanding pH Balance

One of the primary reasons baking soda is so beneficial is its ability to balance pH levels in the body. pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline a substance is, and our bodies function best when our pH is slightly alkaline. However, modern diets high in processed foods, sugar, and caffeine can make our bodies more acidic, leading to a host of health issues. Baking soda, being alkaline, helps neutralize this acidity, promoting overall health and well-being.

The Science Behind Baking Soda and Digestion

When you consume baking soda, it reacts with the acids in your stomach to produce carbon dioxide. This reaction helps neutralize excess stomach acid, which can alleviate symptoms of acid reflux and indigestion. Additionally, baking soda stimulates the production of bile and pancreatic enzymes, which are essential for breaking down fats and proteins. This improved digestion can prevent food from sitting in your stomach too long, reducing the likelihood of acid reflux.

Baking Soda and Kidney Health

Your kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and toxins from your blood. When your body is too acidic, your kidneys have to work harder to maintain balance, which can lead to kidney stones and other issues. Baking soda helps by alkalizing your urine, making it easier for your kidneys to flush out toxins. This can be particularly beneficial for people with chronic kidney disease, as studies have shown that baking soda can slow the progression of the disease.

Boosting Immunity with Baking Soda

Your immune system relies on a balanced pH to function effectively. When your body is too acidic, it creates an environment where harmful bacteria and viruses can thrive. Baking soda helps maintain a balanced pH, which supports the activity of white blood cells—the body’s primary defense against infections. By improving oxygen delivery to your tissues, baking soda also enhances your body’s ability to fight off pathogens.

Oral Health and Baking Soda

The mouth is home to millions of bacteria, some of which are harmful and can lead to tooth decay, cavities, and gum disease. Baking soda’s alkaline nature helps neutralize the acids produced by these bacteria, reducing the risk of dental issues. Additionally, its mild abrasive properties can help remove surface stains from your teeth, leaving them looking whiter and brighter.

Baking Soda for Muscle Recovery

After intense exercise, your muscles produce lactic acid, which can cause soreness and fatigue. Baking soda helps neutralize this acid, allowing your muscles to recover more quickly. This is why many athletes use baking soda as a natural performance enhancer, as it can help them exercise longer and recover faster.

Energy Boost from Baking Soda

Feeling tired and sluggish? Baking soda might be the solution. By improving oxygen delivery to your tissues, baking soda can boost your energy levels and help you feel more alert. This is particularly beneficial if you’re following a low-carb or ketogenic diet, as these diets can sometimes lead to fatigue due to reduced carbohydrate intake.

Baking Soda and Skin Health

Your skin’s pH is slightly acidic, which helps protect it from harmful bacteria and environmental pollutants. However, factors like sun exposure, harsh skincare products, and allergies can disrupt this balance, leading to irritation and inflammation. Baking soda can help restore your skin’s natural pH, reducing redness and swelling. It’s also a natural exfoliant, helping to remove dead skin cells and promote a healthy glow.

Baking Soda for Sinus Health

Sinus congestion can be incredibly uncomfortable, but baking soda can provide relief. When used in a nasal rinse, baking soda helps break down mucus and clear your sinuses. It also has antibacterial properties, which can help prevent infections. Inhaling steam with baking soda can further open up your airways, making it easier to breathe.

Baking Soda and Bone Health

As we age, our bones can become weaker and more prone to fractures. Acidic diets can exacerbate this by leaching calcium from your bones. Baking soda helps by alkalizing your body, which can improve calcium absorption and reduce bone loss. This is particularly important for postmenopausal women, who are at a higher risk of osteoporosis.

Fighting Fungal Infections with Baking Soda

Fungal infections thrive in warm, moist environments, making them difficult to treat. Baking soda works by drawing moisture out of fungal cells, effectively killing them. This makes it a powerful natural remedy for conditions like athlete’s foot, nail fungus, and dandruff.

Conclusion

Baking soda water is a simple, natural remedy with a wide range of health benefits. From improving digestion and kidney function to boosting energy and fighting infections, it’s a versatile addition to your wellness routine. Give it a try and see how this ancient remedy can support your modern health goals.

Let’s dive in and discover how you can naturally strengthen your legs and prevent those painful cramps!

1. Eggs: The Muscle Repair Powerhouse

Eggs are often referred to as nature’s multivitamin, and for good reason. They’re packed with essential nutrients that support overall health, but they’re particularly beneficial for muscle health. Let’s break down how eggs can help prevent leg cramps in seniors.

Muscle Fatigue and Protein

Muscle fatigue is one of the leading causes of cramps. When muscles are overworked or not properly nourished, they can become fatigued, leading to painful spasms. Protein is essential for muscle repair and maintenance, and eggs are an excellent source of high-quality protein.

As we age, we naturally lose muscle mass, a condition known as sarcopenia. This age-related muscle loss can make seniors more susceptible to cramps and weakness. Eggs are a complete protein source, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids that our bodies need to function properly. A single large egg provides about 6 grams of protein, which helps rebuild muscle fibers and reduce muscle fatigue. By including eggs in your diet, you can support muscle strength and endurance, lowering the likelihood of painful cramps.

Vitamin D and Calcium Absorption

Vitamin D is another critical nutrient found in eggs, and it plays a vital role in calcium absorption and muscle function. Without enough vitamin D, your muscles may become weak, leading to cramps and even chronic pain. Research has shown that seniors with vitamin D deficiency are more likely to experience frequent and severe leg cramps.

Egg yolks naturally contain vitamin D, which supports both bone and muscle health. While sunlight is the best source of vitamin D, many older adults spend less time outdoors, making dietary sources of this nutrient even more important. Eating eggs can help seniors maintain optimal vitamin D levels, reducing the risk of cramps.

However, it’s worth noting that while eggs are a good source of vitamin D, they alone may not be enough to meet the daily recommended intake for seniors, which is between 800 to 1,000 IU. To maximize your vitamin D intake, consider pairing eggs with other vitamin D-rich foods like fortified dairy products (milk, yogurt) or fatty fish (salmon, sardines). If your vitamin D levels are low, you might also want to consider taking a supplement after consulting with your doctor.

Vitamin B12 and Nerve Function

Vitamin B12 is another nutrient found in eggs that plays a direct role in nerve function. When B12 levels are low, nerve signals can become impaired, leading to muscle spasms, tingling, and cramping. This is especially important for seniors, as they are more prone to B12 deficiency due to reduced stomach acid production, which limits B12 absorption. Certain medications, such as metformin or acid reflux drugs, can also deplete B12 levels.

Eggs are a senior-friendly source of B12, providing both the vitamin and choline, which work together to support nerve insulation and improve communication between muscles and nerves. This ensures smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, helping to prevent cramps. For seniors who may have dietary restrictions or difficulty digesting meat, eggs offer an easily digestible and lower-fat alternative to red meat.

How Many Eggs Should Seniors Eat?

You might be wondering how many eggs are safe to eat each week, especially if you’re concerned about cholesterol. The good news is that research has shown that moderate egg consumption—about 6 to 7 eggs per week—is safe for most people and does not significantly impact cholesterol levels in healthy seniors. However, if you have heart conditions or high cholesterol, it’s always a good idea to consult with your doctor before making any dietary changes.

For most older adults, eggs are a highly beneficial food that supports muscle, nerve, and overall health. To maximize the benefits, try to eat eggs regularly, pairing them with other nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, dairy, and nuts. And don’t forget to stay hydrated and maintain a balanced electrolyte intake, as these factors also play a crucial role in preventing muscle cramps.

2. Bananas: The Potassium Powerhouse

When it comes to preventing leg cramps, bananas are often the first food that comes to mind—and for good reason. Bananas are packed with potassium, an essential mineral that plays a key role in muscle function, nerve signaling, and fluid balance. Let’s take a closer look at how bananas can help seniors stay cramp-free.

Potassium and Muscle Function

Potassium is crucial for proper muscle contraction and relaxation. When potassium levels drop too low—a condition known as hypokalemia—muscles can become overly excitable, leading to frequent cramping. This is because potassium helps transmit electrical signals between nerves and muscles. When potassium levels are low, these signals can become disrupted, increasing the risk of involuntary muscle contractions.

One medium banana contains about 420 mg of potassium, which is roughly 12% of the recommended daily intake. By maintaining proper potassium levels, bananas help regulate muscle contractions and prevent spasms. They also ensure smooth nerve communication for muscle control and balance fluid levels, reducing dehydration-related cramps.

Magnesium and Muscle Relaxation

In addition to potassium, bananas also contain magnesium, another crucial mineral for muscle relaxation and nerve function. Magnesium helps reduce muscle excitability, preventing sudden cramps. It also supports ATP production, which provides energy for muscle contractions, and helps regulate the balance of calcium and potassium in the body—both of which are essential for proper muscle function.

Each banana contains about 32 mg of magnesium, which contributes to preventing muscle tightness and spasms. Since many seniors don’t get enough magnesium in their diets, eating bananas along with other magnesium-rich foods like nuts and leafy greens can help reduce muscle cramping and improve recovery.

Vitamin B6 and Nerve Function

Bananas are also a good source of vitamin B6, a key nutrient for nervous system health. Vitamin B6 helps regulate neurotransmitters, which control muscle movements, and reduces inflammation, helping muscles recover faster after exercise. Each banana provides about 0.4 mg of vitamin B6, which is nearly 30% of the daily requirement for seniors.

Research has shown that low vitamin B6 levels can lead to increased muscle cramping and spasms due to nerve dysfunction. A 2018 study found that seniors with low vitamin B6 intake experienced more frequent leg cramps. By including bananas in your diet, you can help prevent nerve-related muscle issues and support overall muscle health.

How Many Bananas Should Seniors Eat?

The ideal intake of bananas varies from person to person, but generally, one banana per day provides enough potassium and magnesium to support muscle health. If you experience frequent muscle cramps, you might benefit from eating two bananas per day. However, since bananas are high in natural sugars, seniors with diabetes should consume them in moderation and pair them with fiber-rich foods like nuts or whole grains to avoid blood sugar spikes.

For seniors looking to reduce muscle cramps naturally, eating one banana daily, staying hydrated, and maintaining a balanced diet can significantly improve muscle function and reduce cramp frequency.

3. Nuts and Seeds: The Magnesium and Potassium Boost

While bananas are often the go-to food for preventing cramps, nuts and seeds are another powerful dietary addition that can significantly improve muscle health and prevent cramping. Packed with magnesium, potassium, protein, and healthy fats, nuts and seeds support muscle relaxation, circulation, and electrolyte balance. Let’s explore how these tiny powerhouses can keep your muscles strong and cramp-free.

Magnesium and Potassium Content

Many seniors don’t get enough magnesium in their diets, making them more prone to frequent and painful leg cramps. Nuts and seeds are some of the best natural sources of magnesium, making them an easy way to prevent cramps. For example, pumpkin seeds provide 168 mg of magnesium per ounce, while almonds offer 77 mg per ounce.

In addition to magnesium, many nuts and seeds are also rich in potassium. Pistachios, for instance, contain 290 mg of potassium per ounce, while almonds provide 200 mg. Electrolytes like magnesium and potassium are lost through sweat, so replenishing them is essential for muscle recovery and cramp prevention.

Healthy Fats and Circulation

Nuts and seeds are also rich in healthy fats, which support blood flow and ensure that muscles receive enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in walnuts and flax seeds, reduce muscle inflammation, while monounsaturated fats, found in almonds and cashews, improve circulation and reduce cramp risk.

Poor circulation can cause painful leg cramps, especially at night. By consuming nuts and seeds regularly, seniors can improve blood flow and reduce cramping episodes.

Anti-Inflammatory Benefits

Chronic inflammation can damage muscle tissue and make seniors more prone to cramping and soreness. Nuts and seeds contain antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that reduce oxidative stress in muscles, lower inflammation, and support long-term muscle health.

For seniors dealing with chronic muscle pain or arthritis, adding walnuts, flax seeds, and almonds to their diet can provide natural anti-inflammatory benefits.

How Many Nuts and Seeds Should Seniors Eat?

While nuts and seeds are highly nutritious, they are also calorie-dense, so portion control is important. A small handful (1 ounce) of nuts per day—about 20 almonds or 2 tablespoons of seeds—is recommended. You can sprinkle seeds like flax, chia, or pumpkin seeds on meals for added benefits.

Eating nuts with meals helps with nutrient absorption and electrolyte balance, while consuming them before bed can reduce nighttime leg cramps by keeping muscles relaxed. After exercise, nuts and seeds can help restore lost electrolytes and aid in muscle recovery.

Incorporating eggs, bananas, and nuts and seeds into your diet can significantly reduce the frequency and intensity of leg cramps. These foods provide essential nutrients like protein, potassium, magnesium, and vitamins D and B12, which support muscle and nerve health. Remember to stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet for the best results. So next time you prepare a meal, consider adding these superfoods to your plate. Your muscles will thank you!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/nutrients-to-prevent-alzheimers-and-dementia/,7 Best Nutrients to Prevent Alzheimer’s and Dementia,"Did you know that one in three seniors will develop Alzheimer’s or dementia in their lifetime? That statistic is terrifying, but equally concerning is how many people remain unaware of specific nutrients that can drastically reduce this risk.

In this video, I’ll reveal 7 scientifically-proven nutrients that form a powerful shield against cognitive decline. These nutrients work as a comprehensive protection system targeting different brain mechanisms. By the end, you’ll understand exactly how to safeguard your memory using everyday foods and ingredients, with simple steps you can implement immediately. I’ll explain how each nutrient specifically protects different aspects of brain health, all backed by research.

But first, let’s understand the difference between Alzheimer’s and dementia.

Did you know that every 3 seconds, someone in the world develops dementia? That’s over 10 million new cases every year. Despite how common this condition is, there’s a lot of confusion around what dementia actually is.

Many people use the terms Alzheimer’s and dementia interchangeably, but they represent different concepts. Dementia is the umbrella term for symptoms affecting memory and cognitive function, while Alzheimer’s is a specific disease causing 60-80% of dementia cases. Think of dementia as the wide umbrella, with Alzheimer’s being the most common condition underneath it.

What’s particularly concerning is how the early warning signs often go unnoticed. When someone becomes forgetful or struggles with familiar tasks, we tend to dismiss it as “just getting older.” These subtle changes – confusion about time or place, difficulty finding words in midsentence – can actually be the first indicators of something serious, signaling damage to brain cells.

Dementia isn’t an inevitable part of aging. Research shows specific factors damage your brain’s mitochondria – the tiny powerhouses energizing your brain cells. Inflammation, blood vessel damage, nutrient deficiencies, or infections harm these energy producers, causing brain cells to die and shrinking your hippocampus, your memory center.

Fortunately, many dementia cases can be prevented or delayed. The nutrients we’ll cover today work as a comprehensive system to shield your brain – targeting different protective mechanisms from generating new mitochondria to reducing inflammation.

Your brain’s power supply might be the difference between exceptional cognitive health and decline as you age. While some individuals maintain sharp memory well into their 90s, others experience significant mental fog much earlier. The secret lies in an extraordinary nutrient that does something once thought impossible in neuroscience.

1. PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Regrow Your Brain’s Power Plants

First, we have PQQ, or Pyrroloquinoline quinone, a powerhouse antioxidant that protects your brain approximately 100 times more effectively than vitamin C. Research published in the Journal of Nutrition revealed its most impressive ability: PQQ triggers the growth of brand new mitochondria, increasing their numbers by 60.2%. Think of it as installing fresh power plants in your brain cells that were previously running on outdated generators.

As cells age, toxic waste products attack your brain’s mitochondria – those tiny power plants generating nearly all the energy your neurons need to function. PQQ combats this decline effectively.

Scientists at UC Davis demonstrated this by removing PQQ from subjects’ diets, observing notable cognitive decline, then restoring mental capabilities when reintroducing it. Japanese research further confirmed elderly participants taking PQQ supplements showed marked improvements in memory, attention span, and mental processing.

While PQQ is found in small amounts in foods like kiwi, green peppers, parsley, papaya, the richest source of PQQ is natto, a traditional Japanese fermented soybean dish.

For those looking to incorporate this brain-boosting nutrient, the recommended dosage is 10-20mg daily. Taking it with meals containing healthy fats maximizes absorption, helping your brain cells create optimal energy for performance.

2. Bacopa Monnieri (50% Bacosides): Rewire Your Brain’s Communication Network

While boosting your brain’s energy factories is crucial, there’s another dimension to brain health that’s equally important – the actual connections between neurons. Our second nutrient is Bacopa monnieri, a botanical marvel that’s been hiding in plain sight for millennia. Ancient Ayurvedic texts revered this humble herb as a “brahmi” or consciousness-expander, but it took modern neuroscience to reveal its truly remarkable mechanism.

What sets Bacopa apart from other brain supplements is its unique ability to promote neuroplasticity – the brain’s capacity to rewire itself. Bacopa actively stimulates dendritic growth, planting seeds for new neural gardens throughout your brain. These microscopic branches form the brain’s communication network, transmitting signals between neurons.

The science behind this is fascinating. When researchers at the Central Drug Research Institute in India treated neurons with bacosides (the active compounds in Bacopa), they observed neurons developing significantly more branching patterns and connection points. These new connections explain why a 2016 study in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine found impressive cognitive improvements. After just 12 weeks, participants showed measurable enhancements in working memory, attention, and information processing speed compared to the placebo group.

Take 300-450mg of a standardized extract with at least 50% bacosides along with food to maximize absorption and minimize potential stomach discomfort.

3. Alpha-GPC: Fuel Your Brain’s Memory Molecule

Beyond enhancing neural networks with Bacopa, your brain requires specific raw materials to construct memories. Next, we have Alpha GPC, or Alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine, a natural compound that serves as the precursor to acetylcholine – your brain’s primary memory molecule. This crucial compound is often the missing piece in many brain health regimens.

Acetylcholine works as the messenger carrying information between neurons. Without adequate amounts, your brain struggles to form new memories or recall existing ones effectively. A groundbreaking study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that seniors with higher choline intake performed significantly better on memory tests and demonstrated lower risk of cognitive impairment.

As we age, our natural production of acetylcholine declines, explaining why memory problems typically appear later in life. What makes Alpha GPC exceptional is its superior ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, delivering memory-boosting benefits directly to brain cells where they’re needed most. MIT researchers discovered that Alpha GPC supplementation improved verbal memory while enhancing attention and information processing speed in older adults.

You can boost your choline levels naturally through foods like pastured chicken and eggs, grass-fed liver, wild-caught salmon, and non-GMO soybeans, which are all excellent sources of this essential nutrient.

For optimal results, take 300-600mg of Alpha GPC daily, split into 2-3 doses with meals to maintain consistent acetylcholine levels. Many users experience improvements in memory recall, mental clarity, and learning capacity within weeks of regular supplementation.

While Alpha GPC helps build memory pathways, there’s another crucial brain chemical that determines whether those pathways function properly or become overwhelmed with static. What happens when your brain is constantly in “emergency mode” but you don’t realize it?

4. GABA: Calm Your Brain, Sharpen Your Focus

Ever felt overwhelmed by stress at a crucial moment? Your thoughts scatter, memory falters, and clarity disappears. This cognitive chaos occurs because your brain lacks sufficient GABA—your neurological “brake pedal” that prevents mental overload. Without it, your neural circuits become like a car with a stuck accelerator—speeding but going nowhere useful.

Our fourth nutrient GABA, serves as both a calming agent and a cognitive enhancer. Japanese researchers discovered that beyond reducing neural hyperactivity, GABA triggers the release of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, which actively stimulates brain function rather than merely sedating it.

A 2020 study in the Journal of Clinical Neurology confirmed these benefits, showing participants taking GABA supplements experienced significant improvements in working memory and mental processing compared to placebo groups.

For those with early cognitive concerns, GABA supplementation offers particular value since anxiety often worsens memory issues. By breaking this cycle, GABA creates mental clarity while supporting memory systems.

The foods that are richest in GABA include strawberries, lychee, pumpkin seeds, tomatoes, spinach, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower.

The recommended approach is 100-200mg daily, preferably in the evening to enhance sleep quality, providing additional cognitive benefits through improved memory consolidation during rest.

Your evening dose of GABA isn’t the only daily ritual that matters for brain health. Imagine a nutrient so powerful that having too little of it doubles your dementia risk, yet so common that it’s nicknamed the “sunshine vitamin”—and despite its abundance in nature, nearly half of Americans don’t have enough to protect their brains properly.

5. Vitamin D3: The Sunshine Shield for Your Brain

The 2014 Neurology study revealed a staggering 122% increased dementia risk in people with severe vitamin D deficiency. This landmark research tracked over 1,600 adults for six years, highlighting a major red flag that researchers couldn’t ignore.

While most associate vitamin D with bone health, it functions as a potent neurosteroid, activating protective genes throughout the brain. Like sunshine nourishing a garden, vitamin D shields your neurons from damage and helps clear away toxic beta-amyloid proteins that accumulate in Alzheimer’s disease.

Vitamin D’s brain benefits come from its anti-inflammatory properties that target brain inflammation and improve cerebral blood flow, ensuring adequate oxygen and nutrients. Microscopic examination reveals vitamin D receptors throughout the hippocampus, suggesting a direct role in memory formation.

Just 10-30 minutes of midday sun exposure several times a week can significantly boost your vitamin D levels, depending on your skin tone and location. You can also get vitamin D from foods like fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), cod liver oil, egg yolks, and fortified foods like milk and cereals. However, because it’s difficult to get enough vitamin D from food and sunlight alone—especially in winter or for those with limited sun exposure—supplementation is often necessary to reach optimal levels.

For optimal brain protection, aim for 2,000-5,000 IU daily, always with a meal containing healthy fats – this pairing significantly increases absorption. Regular blood testing is crucial too—maintain levels between 50-80 ng/mL for the best cognitive benefits.

6. Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Energize Aging Brain Cells

Beyond protecting your brain cells, our fifth nutrient actually repairs them from the inside out. While your brain is constantly exposed to damage, vitamin B3—also known as niacin—works silently behind the scenes, fixing broken DNA strands that would otherwise lead to cognitive decline.

Every day, your neurons experience thousands of DNA breaks from environmental toxins, stress, and normal cellular processes. Your brain cells must last a lifetime, making DNA repair critical for long-term brain health.

Niacin significantly boosts levels of NAD+, a molecule that activates repair enzymes that patrol your brain and fix damaged DNA before permanent neurological problems develop. This was confirmed in a groundbreaking 2018 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The “niacin flush”—that warming sensation after taking it—increases blood flow throughout your brain. This delivers oxygen and nutrients while washing away toxins that accelerate cognitive decline.

University of Miami researchers found patients taking niacin experienced 10% less cognitive decline compared to non-users. In practical terms, this means maintaining memory and thinking abilities longer as you age.

For optimal brain protection, start with 100mg daily and gradually increase to 500mg with food. This approach helps your body adjust while providing full DNA repair benefits.

The niacin we just discussed works wonders for DNA repair, but our seventh nutrient is another B vitamin that tackles a completely different threat to your brain health. Have you ever heard of homocysteine? This toxic amino acid could be circulating in your bloodstream right now, silently damaging your neural connections without any warning signs.

7. Vitamin B6: Protect Your Brain’s Wiring

Vitamin B6, the guardian of your neural highways, serves as your brain’s primary defense against homocysteine damage. Research shows elevated homocysteine increases dementia risk by 70% – but B6 effectively neutralizes it before harm occurs.

A landmark 2010 study in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry tracked older adults with early cognitive decline using brain scans. Researchers measured actual brain volume changes, providing visible evidence that B6 supplementation significantly slowed brain shrinkage over time.

What makes B6 truly remarkable is that while fighting homocysteine, it simultaneously creates crucial neurotransmitters – serotonin for mood regulation, dopamine for motivation, and GABA for calm mental processing.

Be aware that common medications deplete B6 levels. Blood pressure medications, oral contraceptives, and acid reducers like Prilosec can lower your B6 without warning signs. For protection, take 25-100mg daily as part of a B-complex, preferably in the pyridoxal-5-phosphate form for better absorption.

Vitamin B3 and B6 are often found in many of the same foods, including meat, poultry, fish, fortified breakfast cereals, and some legumes like chickpeas.

Those B vitamins are working hard to protect your neural connections, but what’s happening in the 23 hours each day when you’re not taking supplements? There’s a hidden connection between your social calendar and brain health that researchers at Harvard discovered could be more powerful than any pill you’ll ever take.

While nutrients are crucial, your daily habits create the foundation that allows these nutrients to work effectively.

Movement is essential brain medicine. When you exercise for 30 minutes, 5 days a week, you flood your brain with growth factors that build new neurons. The University of Illinois found regular aerobic exercise increases hippocampal volume by 2% annually, essentially reversing age-related brain shrinkage.

During deep sleep, your brain activates its glymphatic system, flushing out toxic proteins linked to dementia – removing almost twice as much waste when properly rested.

The MIND diet reduces Alzheimer’s risk by up to 53% in rigorous followers, emphasizing berries, leafy greens, nuts, and fish while limiting processed foods.

Most surprising is how your social connections protect your brain. That Harvard study found people with active social lives had 70% less cognitive decline over 12 years. This creates cognitive reserve – your brain’s ability to find alternative pathways when neural connections are damaged, like having backup routes when your primary road is blocked.

Now that we’ve explored these seven powerful nutrients, I want to emphasize something important – they work best as a complete system. Each nutrient targets different aspects of brain health, creating a comprehensive approach that makes the difference.

Instead of searching for and purchasing all seven supplements separately, we’ve found one supplement that combines all seven in the right scientific doses. Click the link in the description to learn more.

Dr. Heather Sandison’s research, published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, confirmed that early intervention works – 73.9% of participants showed significant cognitive improvements through lifestyle interventions, reducing dementia risk by up to 45%.

The time to protect your brain is now, not after symptoms appear. These nutrients work synergistically with lifestyle strategies to create a powerful shield against cognitive decline. And to help you get started, we’re offering a free anti-inflammatory diet plan designed to support brain health and reduce inflammation.

Imagine a future where maintaining sharp thinking into our later years is the norm. If you found this valuable, please share it with someone you care about. Together, we can change how we age.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/brain-doctor-says-this-is-the-fastest-way-to-get-dementia/,Brain doctor says THIS is the fastest way to get dementia,"Imagine this: you’re 85 years old, surrounded by loved ones, and your mind is as sharp as ever. You can recall cherished memories, engage in stimulating conversations, and fully participate in life’s joys. Now, picture a contrasting scenario: a life where memories slip away, confusion sets in, and even recognizing family members becomes a challenge. What determines which of these futures will be yours? According to Dr. Ann McKee, a renowned neuropathologist and leading expert in neurodegenerative diseases, the answer lies in how you care for your brain today.

Let’s delve into the complexities of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. We’ll explore the actionable steps you can take to protect your brain, drawing on Dr. McKee’s extensive research and invaluable insights.

Dementia vs. Alzheimer’s: Clearing Up the Confusion

One of the most common misunderstandings revolves around the terms “dementia” and “Alzheimer’s.” As Dr. McKee clearly explains, dementia is not a specific disease but rather a general term for the decline in mental abilities severe enough to interfere with daily life. These abilities include memory, reasoning, problem-solving, and language. Think of dementia as an umbrella encompassing various underlying causes.

Alzheimer’s disease, on the other hand, is the most common cause of dementia, particularly in older adults. Dr. McKee emphasizes that while Alzheimer’s is a significant concern, it’s crucial to recognize that it’s not the only cause of cognitive decline.

Other types of dementia include:

Parkinson’s disease with Lewy bodies: A condition affecting movement, cognition, and behavior. Hallucinations and fluctuations in alertness are common.
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD): A group of disorders primarily affecting the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. FTLD often leads to changes in personality, behavior, and language.
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE): A neurodegenerative disease linked to repeated head injuries, often seen in athletes and military personnel. CTE can cause a range of symptoms, including memory problems, mood disorders, and cognitive impairment.
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): A rare brain disorder affecting movement, balance, and eye movements. PSP can also cause cognitive difficulties.
Vascular dementia: This form of dementia occurs after strokes or other conditions that block blood flow to the brain.

Each of these conditions has its unique characteristics, progression, and pathology. However, they all share the devastating outcome of cognitive decline that significantly impacts daily life.

Alzheimer’s Disease: Understanding the Risk and Prevalence

Alzheimer’s disease is a growing public health concern. Dr. McKee’s research highlights the prevalence of this condition. She notes that in people who live to the age of 85, over half would show signs of Alzheimer’s pathology in their brains if examined post-mortem. This statistic underscores the significant risk associated with aging.

However, Dr. McKee is careful to point out that not everyone with Alzheimer’s pathology develops clinical symptoms during their lifetime. This raises a fundamental question: why do some individuals remain cognitively intact despite having the brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s?

The answer, according to Dr. McKee and other experts in the field, lies in the concept of cognitive reserve.

Building Your Brain’s Resilience: Strengthening Cognitive Reserve

Cognitive reserve refers to the brain’s ability to withstand damage and continue functioning effectively. It represents the brain’s capacity to adapt, compensate, and find alternative pathways when certain areas are affected by disease or injury. Think of it as a “brain buffer” that protects against cognitive decline.

Dr. McKee emphasizes that the good news is that you can actively build your cognitive reserve throughout your life. She highlights several science-backed strategies:

Stay Socially Connected: Social interaction is vital for brain health. Loneliness and social isolation can accelerate cognitive decline. Engaging with friends, family, and community groups stimulates the brain and promotes cognitive function.
Challenge Your Brain: Mental stimulation is crucial for maintaining cognitive function. Engaging in activities that challenge your brain, such as solving puzzles, learning new skills, playing strategic games, or picking up a new language, strengthens neural connections and improves cognitive reserve.
Exercise Regularly: Physical activity is not just good for your body; it’s also beneficial for your brain. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, promotes the growth of new neurons, and enhances cognitive function. Even moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, can have significant benefits.
Eat for Brain Health: A healthy diet is essential for overall health, including brain health. Dr. McKee recommends a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods provide the nutrients the brain needs to function optimally.
Control Blood Sugar: High blood sugar levels and diabetes can damage blood vessels in the brain and increase the risk of cognitive decline. Managing blood sugar through diet, exercise, and medication (if necessary) is crucial for protecting brain health.
Limit Alcohol Consumption: While moderate alcohol consumption may have some potential health benefits, excessive alcohol intake can damage the brain and worsen cognitive problems. Dr. McKee advises limiting alcohol consumption to promote brain health.
Prioritize Sleep: Sleep is essential for brain health. During sleep, the brain clears out toxins and consolidates memories. Chronic sleep deprivation can impair these processes and increase the risk of cognitive decline.
Unveiling the Hidden Culprits: Inflammation and Vascular Health

Dr. McKee sheds light on two often-overlooked factors that play a significant role in accelerating brain diseases: inflammation and vascular health.

Inflammation: Inflammation is the body’s natural response to injury or infection. However, chronic inflammation in the brain can damage healthy brain cells and contribute to neurodegeneration. Dr. McKee notes that there is tremendous inflammation in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and CTE.
Vascular Health: The brain relies on a network of small blood vessels to deliver oxygen and nutrients. Damage to these blood vessels, known as small vessel disease, can impair blood flow to the brain and contribute to cognitive decline. Factors that can damage blood vessels include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. A damaged blood-brain barrier is also a contributing factor. This barrier prevents toxins in the blood from entering the brain and disrupting brain function.

To mitigate these risks, Dr. McKee recommends:

Managing stress: Chronic stress can lead to elevated cortisol levels, which can harm vascular health and contribute to cognitive decline.
Avoiding head injuries: Head trauma can damage blood vessels in the brain and trigger inflammation.
Maintaining cardiovascular health: Controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels is essential for protecting vascular health.
Prioritizing Sleep: Sleep helps clear beta-amyloid from the brain. Beta-amyloid is a toxic protein involved in Alzheimer’s disease.
Contact Sports and the Developing Brain: A Word of Caution for Parents

For parents considering whether their children should participate in contact sports, Dr. McKee offers a word of caution. She emphasizes that repeated head impacts, even those that don’t cause concussions, can lead to long-term brain damage, including CTE.

Dr. McKee suggests:

Delaying full-contact play until children are physically mature.
Ensuring that coaches are well-trained in concussion prevention and management.
Encouraging safer alternatives such as non-contact sports.
Ensuring that children have strong neck muscles, which may help to protect the brain from whiplash injuries.
Normal vs. Pathological Aging: Understanding the Difference

Dr. McKee highlights a crucial point: cognitive decline is not an inevitable part of aging. Some individuals maintain their cognitive abilities well into their 80s, 90s, and beyond. This underscores that dementia represents abnormal, or pathological, aging rather than a natural consequence of growing old.

Actionable Insights for Brain Health: A Call to Action

As Dr. McKee aptly puts it, “We all know what you need to do.” The strategies for protecting brain health are well-established. However, the challenge lies in consistently implementing these strategies in our daily lives. By staying mentally active, physically fit, socially connected, and mindful of our overall health, we can significantly reduce our risk of dementia and promote a lifetime of cognitive well-being. Remember, it’s never too early—or too late—to prioritize brain health. The choices we make today can shape our cognitive future for years to come.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/scientists-find-a-berry-that-can-combat-cancer-diabetes-and-obesity/,"Scientists find a berry that can combat cancer, diabetes, and obesity","Imagine a world where a single fruit could help combat some of the most devastating diseases of our time—cancer, diabetes, and obesity. It might sound like science fiction, but researchers at the University of Montreal are turning this vision into reality with their groundbreaking study on the Brazilian camu-camu berry. Packed with a powerful compound called castalagin, this small berry is poised to make a big impact on human health.

What Makes the Camu-Camu Berry Special?

Berries have long been celebrated for their health benefits, but the camu-camu berry stands out from the crowd. Native to Brazil, this fruit is already well-known for its role in preventing obesity and diabetes. Now, scientists have discovered that it may also hold the key to enhancing cancer treatments.

At the heart of this discovery is castalagin, a polyphenol compound that acts as a prebiotic. Prebiotics are substances that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, which play a crucial role in maintaining overall health. However, castalagin does more than just support gut health—it has the potential to supercharge the body’s immune system in its fight against cancer.

How Does It Work?

Cancer treatments often rely on boosting the immune system to target and destroy cancer cells. One such approach involves immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), drugs that have shown promise in treating cancers like melanoma and lung cancer. Unfortunately, not all patients respond well to ICIs, leaving researchers searching for ways to improve their effectiveness.

This is where castalagin steps in. Scientists found that this compound can alter the gut microbiome—the complex ecosystem of bacteria living in our digestive tract—in ways that enhance immune function. By strengthening the immune system, castalagin could make ICIs more effective in combating cancer.

The Study: From Mice to Humans

To test their hypothesis, researchers conducted experiments using mice. The results were promising: castalagin helped the animals’ immune systems fight off cancer more effectively. Encouraged by these findings, the team is now preparing to take their research to the next level with human clinical trials.

The upcoming trial will involve 45 patients diagnosed with either lung cancer or melanoma. Participants will take castalagin orally in pill form to evaluate its impact on their treatment outcomes. If successful, this trial could pave the way for a revolutionary new approach to cancer therapy.

A Small Berry with Big Potential

The implications of this research are enormous. If castalagin proves effective in humans, it could transform how we treat cancer and potentially improve outcomes for countless patients worldwide. And it all starts with a humble berry from Brazil.

As we await the results of these clinical trials, one thing is clear: nature continues to be an incredible source of inspiration and innovation in medicine. The camu-camu berry serves as a powerful reminder that sometimes, the most extraordinary solutions come from the most unexpected places.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 24, 2025"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/artificial-sweeteners-linked-to-higher-risk-of-heart-disease/,"Artificial sweeteners linked to higher risk of heart disease, study reveals","Artificial sweeteners have long been marketed as the guilt-free alternative to sugar, promising all the sweetness with none of the calories. But could that diet soda in your hand be doing more harm than good? A groundbreaking study published in Cell Metabolism has uncovered a startling link between aspartame, one of the most common artificial sweeteners, and an increased risk of heart disease. The findings could reshape how we think about these sugar substitutes and their impact on our health.

From a Casual Observation to a Scientific Revelation

The inspiration for this study came from an everyday moment. Yihai Cao, a senior researcher at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, noticed a student sipping on a diet soda during a meeting. That seemingly trivial observation sparked curiosity: what exactly does aspartame do to the body, particularly to the cardiovascular system? This question set the stage for an in-depth investigation into the biological mechanisms behind artificial sweeteners and heart health.

How the Study Was Conducted

To explore aspartame’s effects, researchers designed an experiment using mice. The animals were fed a diet containing 0.15% aspartame for 12 weeks—an amount equivalent to a human consuming about three cans of diet soda daily. The results were alarming. Compared to mice that didn’t consume aspartame, those that did exhibited:

Larger and fattier plaques in their arteries
Increased levels of inflammation
Damage to arterial smooth muscle
A higher concentration of immune cells in their blood vessels, signaling early signs of heart disease

These findings suggest that aspartame may contribute to atherosclerosis, a condition where fatty deposits accumulate inside arteries. Over time, this can lead to life-threatening events like heart attacks and strokes.

The Sweetness-Insulin Connection

One of the study’s key discoveries was how aspartame influences insulin levels. Aspartame is about 200 times sweeter than sugar, which overstimulates sweetness-detecting receptors in the mouth and intestines. This triggers an excessive release of insulin—a hormone crucial for regulating blood sugar levels but problematic in excess. Elevated insulin levels were found to play a significant role in the buildup of fatty plaques within arteries.

The Role of CX3CL1 in Inflammation

To dig deeper into why insulin caused artery damage, researchers focused on CX3CL1, an immune signal that acts like a trap for immune cells along blood vessel walls. These trapped cells trigger inflammation—a key driver of heart disease. When researchers removed CX3CL1 receptors from immune cells in aspartame-fed mice, the harmful plaque buildup disappeared. This confirmed CX3CL1’s pivotal role in linking aspartame consumption to cardiovascular damage.

What Does This Mean for You?

While these findings are based on animal studies, they raise serious concerns about the long-term safety of artificial sweeteners like aspartame. The researchers plan to investigate whether these effects are replicated in humans. If confirmed, it could fundamentally change how we view artificial sweeteners—not just as calorie-cutting tools but as potential contributors to chronic diseases.

Artificial sweeteners are ubiquitous, found in everything from diet sodas to sugar-free snacks. While they offer convenience and calorie reduction, this study suggests they may not be as harmless as once thought. As Yihai Cao aptly put it: “Artificial sweeteners have penetrated almost all kinds of food, so we have to know the long-term health impact.”

Final Thoughts

Until more research is conducted, it might be worth reconsidering how much aspartame you consume daily—especially if you’re concerned about your heart health. This study adds to growing evidence that what seems like a healthy swap for sugar might carry hidden risks.

Your choices today could shape your health tomorrow—so perhaps it’s time to think twice before reaching for that next can of diet soda.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/ultra-processed-foods-and-an-increased-risk-of-cancer/,Study finds link between ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of cancer,"Are you reaching for that brightly packaged snack, thinking it’s a quick and easy treat? What if that convenience came at a much steeper price than you imagined? Groundbreaking research is emerging, and it suggests a disturbing link between ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of cancer. It’s time to take a closer look at what we’re really eating.

The Ultra-Processed Culprits

Ultra-processed foods are everywhere. We’re talking about fizzy drinks, mass-produced bread, those enticing ready meals promising a quick dinner, and most breakfast cereals lining supermarket shelves. These aren’t your grandma’s home-cooked meals; they’re engineered for convenience and shelf life, undergoing extensive processing and often packed with artificial additives, salt, fat, and sugar. While marketing often touts them as healthy alternatives, the reality may be far more sinister.

The Cancer Connection: What the Science Says

We already know that excessive consumption of ultra-processed foods has been linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Now, a comprehensive study led by scientists from Imperial College London and other institutions has revealed a potential association between these foods and a heightened risk of developing and succumbing to cancer.

Here’s the breakdown:

Overall Cancer Risk: The study found that for every 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption, there was a 2% rise in overall cancer incidence.
Ovarian Cancer: The link was particularly strong with ovarian cancer, showing a shocking 19% surge in incidence with every 10% increase in ultra-processed food intake.
Cancer Mortality: Overall cancer mortality also saw a 6% uptick with every 10% increase in consumption of these foods.
Breast and Ovarian Cancer Mortality: Specifically, breast cancer mortality increased by 16%, and ovarian cancer mortality jumped by a staggering 30%.
Beyond Cancer: The Ripple Effect

The dangers don’t stop at cancer. The study also reinforced previous findings, linking high consumption of ultra-processed foods to increased risks of obesity and type 2 diabetes in adults. Childhood consumption is also a concern with the research showing notable weight gain from childhood into adulthood.

What Can You Do?

This research, published in eClinicalMedicine, is a wake-up call. While further studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the best public health strategies, it’s clear that we need to be more mindful of what we’re putting on our plates.

Here are a few steps you can take:

Read Labels Carefully: Become a label detective. Scrutinize ingredient lists and be wary of foods loaded with artificial additives, excessive salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats.
Embrace Whole Foods: Focus on incorporating more whole, unprocessed foods into your diet – fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
Cook at Home More Often: Take control of your ingredients by cooking meals from scratch. It doesn’t have to be complicated; simple, home-cooked meals can be delicious and nutritious.
Stay Informed: Follow credible sources of information about nutrition and health to stay up-to-date on the latest research.

The evidence is mounting: ultra-processed foods may pose a significant threat to our health, including an increased risk of cancer. By making informed choices and prioritizing whole, unprocessed foods, we can take control of our health and reduce our risk.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 24, 2025"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/most-powerful-natural-remedy-in-the-world/,The #1 Most Powerful Natural Remedy In The World,"Imagine a single golden-hued compound so potent it can combat inflammation, shield your brain, protect your heart, and even help you live longer. This isn’t science fiction—it’s curcumin, the superstar molecule found in turmeric. For centuries, turmeric has been revered in traditional medicine, but modern science now confirms its extraordinary benefits. From fighting chronic diseases to enhancing cognitive function, this ancient remedy offers modern miracles. Let’s explore why curcumin deserves a prime spot in your wellness routine—and how you can enjoy it in a delicious, keto-friendly butter chicken recipe.

Turmeric Through the Ages: A Historical Perspective

Turmeric’s journey from ancient spice to modern superfood is nothing short of remarkable. Originating in Southeast Asia over 4,000 years ago, it was a cornerstone of Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Practitioners used it to treat everything from wounds to digestive disorders. In India, turmeric became sacred, symbolizing purity and prosperity in Hindu rituals. Fast-forward to today: over 12,000 peer-reviewed studies highlight curcumin’s role in combating inflammation, oxidative stress, and chronic disease. This golden root has truly stood the test of time.

The Science Behind Curcumin’s Superpowers

Curcumin’s power stems from its role as a natural defense mechanism in turmeric, evolved to protect the plant from pests and diseases. In humans, it works holistically, targeting multiple biochemical pathways. Here’s how this molecular marvel operates:

1. Fights Inflammation at Its Core

Chronic inflammation is the root of most modern diseases, from arthritis to heart disease. Curcumin tackles this by blocking five major enzymes (COX-2, LOX, TNF-α, NF-κB, and IL-6) that drive inflammation. A 2021 meta-analysis in Advances in Nutrition found curcumin as effective as ibuprofen for reducing arthritis pain—without the gut-wrenching side effects. Whether you’re battling joint stiffness, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or even acne, curcumin acts like a fire extinguisher for your cells.

2. Boosts Brain Health and Fights Alzheimer’s

Curcumin serves as a powerful ally for brain health. By inhibiting the enzyme MAO-B, which is linked to the breakdown of neurotransmitters and Alzheimer’s risk, curcumin helps maintain cognitive function. It also elevates levels of BDNF, a protein crucial for neuron growth and combating depression. Lower BDNF levels are associated with cognitive decline and mood disorders. Additionally, curcumin reduces the formation of beta-amyloid plaques, toxic accumulations commonly found in Alzheimer’s patients. A groundbreaking study involving aging mice demonstrated that curcumin not only restored vitality but also extended their lifespan by 38%, equivalent to humans living up to 130 years.

3. Shields Your Heart from the Inside Out

Curcumin plays a vital role in cardiovascular health by protecting the endothelial lining of arteries, the primary site for heart disease development. It prevents plaque buildup by blocking oxidative damage to LDL cholesterol, often referred to as the “rust” of the arteries. By boosting nitric oxide production, curcumin helps relax blood vessels, thereby lowering blood pressure. It also reduces the risk of dangerous blood clots by inhibiting platelet aggregation. A 2020 study published in Nutrition Journal found that curcumin supplementation improved endothelial function in postmenopausal women as effectively as regular aerobic exercise.

4. Stabilizes Blood Sugar Naturally

By improving insulin sensitivity, curcumin helps balance blood sugar levels—a game-changer for prediabetes or metabolic syndrome. A trial in Diabetes Care revealed that curcumin delayed type 2 diabetes onset by 100% in high-risk individuals over nine months.

5. Detoxifies and Protects Your Liver

Fatty liver disease affects 25% of adults globally. Curcumin reduces liver inflammation and fat accumulation while aiding detoxification. It binds to heavy metals like mercury and arsenic, facilitating their safe removal via bile.

6. Accelerates Healing Without Harming Gut Flora

Curcumin’s antimicrobial properties target pathogens like H. pylori (linked to ulcers) and Staphylococcus aureus while sparing beneficial gut bacteria. This makes it a natural alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics.

7. Soothes Allergies and Autoimmune Flare-Ups

From eczema to psoriasis, curcumin tames allergic reactions by modulating immune responses. It suppresses histamine release and calms overactive T-cells, offering relief without the drowsiness of antihistamines.

Unlocking Curcumin’s Potential: Tips for Better Absorption

There’s one catch: curcumin isn’t easily absorbed. Only 1% of ingested curcumin enters the bloodstream. Here’s how to maximize bioavailability:

1. Pair with Black Pepper

Piperine in black pepper enhances absorption by 2,000%. Add a pinch to turmeric tea or supplements.

2. Combine with Healthy Fats

Curcumin is fat-soluble. Blend it into smoothies with coconut milk, stir into olive oil-based dressings, or cook with ghee.

3. Heat It Up

Cooking turmeric unlocks its benefits. Simmer it in soups, stews, or golden milk (a traditional Indian drink with turmeric, milk, and honey).

4. Opt for Nano-Formulations

New supplements use liposomal or nanoparticle technology to bypass poor absorption. Look for brands with “bioavailable” on the label.

Avoid megadoses, as excessive consumption can lead to nausea and other digestive discomforts. Stick to culinary doses—think 1 teaspoon daily in meals or tea.

Culinary Magic: A Curcumin-Rich Butter Chicken Recipe

Why swallow pills when you can savor curcumin in a creamy, aromatic butter chicken? This keto-friendly dish marries flavor and function.

Ingredients
1 lb boneless chicken thighs (rich in collagen for joint health)
1 tbsp turmeric (curcumin’s star source)
1 tsp cumin, garam masala, chili powder (anti-inflammatory spices)
3 cloves garlic, 1-inch ginger (natural antimicrobials)
1 onion, 2 tomatoes (rich in quercetin and lycopene)
50g butter, 100ml heavy cream (fat boosts curcumin absorption)
Fresh cilantro (detoxifying and rich in antioxidants)
Step-by-Step Guide
Marinate: Coat chicken in turmeric, cumin, garam masala, chili powder, and salt. Let sit for 15+ minutes.
Sear: Cook chicken in olive oil until golden—don’t stir too soon! This creates a caramelized crust (Maillard reaction) for depth of flavor.
Sauce: Blend garlic, ginger, onions, and tomatoes into a puree. Simmer with chicken and butter for 10 minutes.
Finish: Stir in cream and garnish with cilantro.

Serve this dish as your last meal to leverage curcumin’s nighttime repair benefits. Studies show it enhances autophagy—the body’s cellular cleanup process—during sleep.

Curcumin FAQs: Your Questions Answered
Q: Can curcumin interact with medications?

A: Yes. Curcumin may enhance the effects of blood thinners (e.g., warfarin) or diabetes drugs. Consult your doctor if you’re on medication.

Q: Is turmeric safe during pregnancy?

A: In culinary amounts, yes. Avoid high-dose supplements, as they may stimulate the uterus.

Q: Which is better: fresh turmeric or supplements?

A: Fresh turmeric offers synergistic compounds, but supplements provide standardized doses. Combine both for optimal benefits.

Potential Side Effects and Precautions

While curcumin is safe for most, overconsumption can cause:

Nausea or diarrhea (dose-dependent; stick to 500–2,000 mg daily).
Iron deficiency: Curcumin binds to iron, so avoid taking it with iron supplements.
Gallbladder issues: May worsen bile duct obstructions.

Tip: Start with small doses and monitor your body’s response.

Curcumin vs. Modern Medicine: A Comparative Look

Curcumin’s multi-target approach contrasts sharply with single-mechanism pharmaceuticals. For example:

NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) reduce pain but harm the gut. Curcumin eases inflammation while healing the intestinal lining.
Antidepressants increase serotonin but don’t address neuroinflammation. Curcumin boosts BDNF and reduces brain oxidative stress.

However, curcumin isn’t a cure-all. It complements—not replaces—medical treatments for severe conditions.

The Golden Takeaway

Curcumin isn’t just a spice—it’s a daily defense against aging, inflammation, and disease. Whether stirred into golden milk, sipped as tea, or blended into smoothies, this golden compound offers a holistic path to vitality. Ready to glow from the inside out? Your journey might just start with a sprinkle of spice and a simmering pot of butter chicken.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/veggies-to-detox-your-arteries-and-prevent-heart-attacks/,Top 5 Veggies to Detox Your Arteries and Prevent Heart Attacks!,"Imagine waking up one morning with a tight chest, shortness of breath, and the room spinning around you. Scary, right? These could be the first signs of a heart attack. Here’s something even more alarming: most people don’t realize they have heart disease until it’s too late. Atherosclerosis, often called the silent killer, quietly builds up plaque in your arteries without any warning signs. Shockingly, nearly half of those with heart disease don’t know they have it until they’re facing a life-threatening crisis.

But what if you could fight back using foods already sitting in your kitchen? Today, we’ll explore the science behind five powerful vegetables that can help clean your arteries and potentially save your life. We’ll break down the exact compounds that make these veggies heart heroes and show you simple ways to add them to your daily meals for maximum protection. Get ready to discover nature’s secret weapons against heart disease—your heart will thank you.

Garlic: Nature’s Heart Protector

Let’s start with one of nature’s most potent heart-protecting vegetables. Number 5 is garlic.

Garlic, that pungent kitchen staple, has been used for centuries for its medicinal properties. Modern science now backs up its reputation as a powerful ally in the fight against heart disease. The key compound in garlic is allicin, which forms when you crush or chop the cloves. But that’s not all—garlic also contains sulfur compounds, flavonoids, and selenium, all of which contribute to its heart-protective effects.

So, how does garlic work its magic? It lowers blood pressure by boosting the production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is crucial because it helps the endothelium – the inner lining of your blood vessels – relax and widen, improving blood flow.

It also reduces LDL cholesterol (which is more prone to oxidation and contributes to plaque buildup) while increasing HDL, which helps remove LDL from the bloodstream back to the liver.

Additionally, garlic helps prevent blood clots by stopping platelets from clumping together and acts as a powerful antioxidant, protecting your heart and blood vessels from damage caused by oxidative stress.

The research is compelling. A 2016 meta-analysis in the Journal of Nutrition found that garlic supplementation significantly lowered blood pressure in people with hypertension. Another study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018) showed garlic’s ability to reduce total and LDL cholesterol levels.

And if that’s not enough, a 2010 study in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that garlic oil could protect against cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart muscle becomes weakened or stiff, making it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively—a problem often linked to diabetes.

To reap the benefits, aim for 1-2 cloves of fresh garlic daily. For maximum allicin production, crush or chop the garlic and let it sit for 10-15 minutes before cooking or eating. Raw garlic packs the most punch, but cooked garlic still offers plenty of benefits.

Incorporating garlic into your meals is simple and versatile—try stirring minced raw garlic into salad dressings or homemade mayo for a quick flavor boost, or mix crushed garlic with olive oil to create a heart-healthy bread dip. For a richer, sweeter flavor, roast whole garlic bulbs and spread the soft, caramelized cloves on whole-grain toast.

And if you’re cooking up soups, stews, or stir-fries, just toss in some chopped garlic during the last few minutes of cooking to infuse your dish with its savory goodness.

Spinach and Leafy Greens: The Verdant Powerhouses

Next up, at Number 4, we have spinach and other leafy greens like arugula, kale, and Swiss chard. Spinach, in particular, is a standout. It’s loaded with nitrates, potassium, magnesium, and antioxidants like beta-carotene and lutein. Together, these nutrients work synergistically to support your cardiovascular health.

Here’s how spinach helps your heart: The nitrates help relax blood vessels and improve blood flow, while potassium regulates blood pressure and magnesium supports proper heart muscle function. The antioxidants, on the other hand, protect your heart by reducing oxidative stress, a key player in chronic conditions like heart disease.

The science backs it up. A 2015 study in Clinical Nutrition Research found that eating spinach effectively lowered blood pressure in participants. And a 2024 BBC Good Food article highlighted how nitrate-rich foods like spinach, arugula, and kale might even improve heart attack survival rates.

For the best results, aim for a half-cup serving of cooked spinach or other leafy greens daily. This provides about 600 milligrams of potassium, which is a big win for heart health.

To get the most out of spinach, lightly cook or wilt the leaves to reduce oxalic acid, which can interfere with iron absorption, or enjoy it raw in salads and smoothies to preserve heat-sensitive nutrients. If you’re cooking with them, add spinach, arugula, or Swiss chard to soups, stews, or stir-fries during the last few minutes to keep their nutrients intact.

What makes these leafy greens truly stand out is their incredible versatility—toss them into omelets, use them as a salad base, blend them into smoothies, or sauté them as a quick and nutritious side dish.

Broccoli and Cruciferous Veggies: The Heart’s Best Friends

Now, let’s shift gears to Number 3, broccoli and its cruciferous cousins like cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage.

Broccoli is a nutritional superstar, thanks to sulforaphane, fiber, potassium, and antioxidants like vitamin C. Sulforaphane, in particular, is a sulfur-containing compound with powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

Here’s how broccoli works its magic: The fiber helps lower cholesterol by binding to bile acids and promoting their excretion. Sulforaphane activates a key process in the body called the Nrf2 pathway. Think of Nrf2 as your body’s internal defense system – when activated, it boosts your antioxidant defenses and reduces inflammation. And the potassium? It helps keep your blood pressure in check, easing the strain on your heart.

Recent research highlights the benefits of cruciferous vegetables. A 2020 study in The British Journal of Nutrition found that women who ate more than 44.6 grams (about 1/4 cup) of cooked cruciferous veggies daily—like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts—were 46% less likely to have aortic calcification, a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes.

For optimal benefits, aim to eat broccoli 1-2 times a week. A 2024 study even linked this frequency to a 32-43% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Steaming is the best way to preserve its cholesterol-lowering properties.

Broccoli is not only nutritious but also incredibly versatile and delicious. For a flavorful twist, roast it with olive oil and your favorite spices, or add it to stir-fries and soups for a hearty, healthy addition.

If you’re looking for a creative way to sneak in extra nutrients, blend it into smoothies, or keep it simple by snacking on raw broccoli with a healthy dip. And don’t forget—its cruciferous cousins, like cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, can be prepared in similar ways for equally tasty and heart-healthy meals.

Carrots: The Crunchy Heart Hero

Next, at Number 2, we have carrots, those vibrant, crunchy root veggies that are as good for your heart as they are for your eyes.

Carrots are packed with carotenoids like beta-carotene and alpha-carotene, which give them their bright orange color. They’re also rich in fiber, potassium, and antioxidants like vitamin C and polyphenols.

Here’s how carrots help your heart: The antioxidants combat oxidative stress and inflammation, while the fiber lowers cholesterol by binding to bile acids. Potassium helps regulate blood pressure, keeping your cardiovascular system in check.

Research supports these benefits. A 2018 study in the British Journal of Nutrition found that eating carotenoid-rich veggies like carrots reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. Another 2020 study in the European Journal of Nutrition linked regular carrot consumption to improved lipid profiles and reduced inflammation.

Aim for 1/2 to 1 cup of carrots daily to reap their heart-healthy benefits, and maximize their nutritional value by lightly cooking them to boost beta-carotene absorption or pairing them with a bit of healthy fat, like olive oil. If you prefer a satisfying crunch, enjoy them raw.

Carrots are incredibly versatile—grate them into salads, roast them as a flavorful side dish, or blend them into smoothies for a nutrient-packed drink. For a quick and easy snack, try carrot sticks with hummus or a yogurt-based dip.

Beets: The Heart’s Vibrant Ally

Finally, at Number 1, we have beets, those deep red root veggies that are as striking as they are nutritious.

Beets are loaded with nitrates, which your body converts into nitric oxide to relax blood vessels. They also contain betalains, powerful antioxidants that give beets their rich color, along with fiber and potassium.

Research strongly supports beets’ heart benefits. A 2008 study in Hypertension found that drinking beet juice lowered blood pressure within hours. A 2021 study in the Journal of Nutrition showed that regular beetroot juice consumption improved endothelial function and reduced blood pressure in older adults with hypertension.

For the best results, aim for 1/2 cup of cooked beets or 1 cup of beet juice 3-4 times a week, and to preserve their nutrients, enjoy them raw or lightly cooked, roast them to bring out their natural sweetness, or drink beet juice within 1-2 hours of preparation.

Beets are incredibly versatile—grate them into salads for a colorful crunch, roast them alongside other veggies for a hearty side dish, or blend them into smoothies for a nutrient-packed boost. For a fun and creative snack, try beet chips or whip up some beet hummus.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/truth-about-statins-and-diabetes/,Shocking Truth About Statins and Diabetes You Need to Know,"Have you ever heard the phrase, “The benefits outweigh the risks?” It’s a common line, especially when discussing medications. But what if the risks are far more significant than you’re led to believe? This is particularly concerning when it comes to statins, the go-to drugs for lowering cholesterol. While they’re widely prescribed, a closer look reveals a disturbing connection to type 2 diabetes, especially if you already have it!

The Statin Story: Lowering Cholesterol at What Cost?

Statins work by blocking an enzyme in your liver responsible for producing cholesterol. With the guidelines for “high” cholesterol dropping over the years, statins have become one of the most prescribed medications in America. Millions are taking them, believing they’re safeguarding themselves against heart disease. But are they truly protecting us, or are they opening the door to a different, equally serious health problem? Is it possible that the very drug designed to protect your heart might actually be increasing your risk of diabetes, a major risk factor for heart disease?

The Diabetes Connection: A Hidden Danger

The concerning truth is that statins come with a range of side effects, with one of the most alarming being an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Recent studies are strengthening this link, revealing a potentially stronger connection than previously thought. This is particularly risky for individuals who already have diabetes or are at high risk of developing it!

One study, which followed over 8,500 individuals for 15 years, revealed that statin use was associated with a significantly higher risk of insulin resistance, elevated blood sugar, and a 38% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. What’s even more alarming is that the risk was especially high for overweight or obese individuals already at higher risk for type 2 diabetes.

The Ironic Twist: Treating Heart Disease by Increasing Diabetes Risk?

Here’s where it gets truly unsettling: heart disease is the number one risk factor for people with type 2 diabetes. Adults with type 2 diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than those without diabetes. So, if you’re taking statins to prevent heart disease, but they increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, is it really a worthwhile trade? Are we trading one problem for an even bigger one down the road?

How Statins Increase Diabetes Risk: Unveiling the Mechanisms

Statins don’t just magically increase diabetes risk; they do it through specific mechanisms that disrupt your body’s natural processes:

Increased Insulin Resistance: Statins can make your cells less responsive to insulin, leading to chronic inflammation. Ironically, this increased insulin resistance can, in turn, contribute to heart disease – the very condition statins are supposed to prevent!
Elevated Blood Sugar: Statins interfere with your liver’s ability to process sugar. Instead of storing excess sugar, your liver sends it back into your bloodstream, raising blood sugar levels.

The most alarming part? Elevated blood glucose, a side effect of statins, is sometimes misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes, leading to more medications.

Beyond Diabetes: A Cascade of Other Side Effects

The potential side effects of statins extend far beyond diabetes. Many people report cognitive problems, memory loss, muscle weakness and pain, kidney problems, anemia, sexual dysfunction, immune depression, cataracts, increased cancer risk, abnormal liver enzymes, and even depression.

CoQ10 Depletion: A Critical Deficiency

Statins can deplete your body of CoQ10, a vital component for energy production in every cell, especially in the heart muscle. Low CoQ10 levels can lead to extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, and even heart failure.

Rethinking Cholesterol: Is Lower Always Better?

Conventional medicine often focuses on total cholesterol numbers, but is this the complete picture? It’s now commonly known that cholesterol is not the primary cause of heart disease. In fact, this study shows there’s no real link between cholesterol and heart disease. Cholesterol is essential for hormone production, cell membrane health, brain function, and vitamin D synthesis. Studies suggest that low cholesterol may even be linked to increased risks of cancer, memory loss, and other health problems.

Related: Study Says Treating High Cholesterol With Statins Is a Waste of Time

A More Holistic Approach: Beyond the Numbers

Instead of solely relying on total cholesterol, consider these key ratios for a more accurate assessment of your heart disease risk:

HDL/Total Cholesterol Ratio: Aim for above 24%. Below 10% indicates a significantly elevated risk.
Triglyceride/HDL Ratio: Aim for below 2.
Protecting Your Health: Natural Alternatives and Lifestyle Changes

If you’re concerned about statins, know that there are ways to protect your health through a healthy diet and lifestyle. A low-carb, low-sugar diet rich in antioxidant-rich vegetables can protect you from heart disease, diabetes, and other ailments.

Here’s how to take a proactive approach:

Embrace a Low-Carb, High-Fiber Diet: Focus on nutrient-dense foods that stabilize blood sugar and reduce inflammation.
Prioritize Regular Exercise: Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity and boosts overall cardiovascular health.
Manage Stress: Chronic stress can wreak havoc on your hormones and blood sugar levels. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as meditation or yoga.
Consult a Knowledgeable Healthcare Provider: Work with a doctor who understands the complexities of cholesterol management and is open to exploring alternative approaches.
The Takeaway: Make Informed Decisions

The decision to take statins is a personal one that should be made in consultation with your doctor. However, it’s crucial to be fully informed about the potential risks and benefits. By understanding the link between statins and type 2 diabetes, exploring natural alternatives, and adopting a holistic approach to your health, you can make informed decisions that empower you to live a long, healthy life.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/study-reveals-alarming-microplastic-invasion-in-human-brains/,Groundbreaking Study Reveals Alarming Microplastic Invasion in Human Brains,"A bombshell study published in Nature Medicine has uncovered that human brains now harbor microplastic concentrations equivalent to an entire plastic spoon’s worth of toxic debris—with levels skyrocketing by 50% in just eight years . Researchers warn this invisible invasion, linked to surging global plastic pollution, could exacerbate neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, raising urgent questions about humanity’s plastic addiction.

Key Findings:

Brain vs. Organs: Microplastics in brain tissue were found at concentrations 7–30 times higher than in the liver or kidneys, with polyethylene—common in food packaging—dominating 75% of the particles .
Dementia Connection: Brains of dementia patients contained 10 times more microplastics than healthy samples, clustered near blood vessels and immune cells. However, scientists caution this correlation does not confirm causation .
Temporal Surge: Postmortem samples from 2024 showed a 50% spike in brain microplastics compared to 2016, mirroring the exponential rise in global plastic production .

How Are Plastics Hijacking Our Brains?
The study, led by toxicologist Matthew Campen at the University of New Mexico, suggests nanoplastics—smaller than viruses—may exploit lipid-binding pathways to breach the blood-brain barrier, a critical shield against toxins . “These particles are Trojan horses, carrying harmful chemicals into our cells,” said Dr. Philip Landrigan, a global health expert unaffiliated with the study .

Health Implications:
While direct causation remains unproven, microplastics are increasingly tied to inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and cellular damage. Dementia’s hallmark features—like blood-brain barrier degradation—may create a “sink” for plastic accumulation, worsening neurological decline .

Global Call to Action:
Experts urge immediate measures to curb plastic exposure:

Avoid single-use plastics and heated food containers .
Support policies to reduce plastic production, which is set to double by 2040 .
Invest in filtration technologies and biodegradable alternatives .

The Bottom Line:
“Our brains are 99.5% brain tissue and 0.5% plastic—a jarring reality we can no longer ignore,” said Campen . As plastic permeates every organ, from placentas to arteries, this study sounds a dire alarm: humanity’s plastic footprint is now etched into our very biology.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/long-term-use-of-heartburn-drugs-linked-to-hidden-kidney-damage/,Long-term Use of Heartburn Drugs Linked to Hidden Kidney Damage,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are medications commonly prescribed to treat conditions such as heartburn, acid reflux, and ulcers. These drugs work by reducing stomach acid production, providing relief from these ailments. Known by brand names like Prevacid, Prilosec, Nexium, and Protonix, PPIs are integral in managing gastrointestinal disorders.

Prevalence of PPI Usage

In the United States, PPIs are extensively used, with over 15 million prescriptions issued each year. Additionally, their availability over the counter contributes to their widespread use. This accessibility has made PPIs a popular choice for individuals seeking relief from digestive issues.

Related: 3 Ways to Stop Acid Reflux Naturally

The Study and Its Revelations

Research Conducted by Washington University

A recent study by Washington University in St. Louis has highlighted potential risks associated with long-term PPI use. Led by Ziyad Al-Aly, the research was published in the journal Kidney International, revealing significant findings about the impact of these medications on kidney health.

Key Findings on Kidney Damage

The study found that more than half of the patients who developed long-term kidney damage from PPIs did not experience acute kidney issues beforehand. This challenges the belief that sudden kidney problems are necessary precursors to chronic damage. Instead, the research suggests that PPIs can cause a gradual decline in kidney function, potentially leading to irreversible kidney failure.

Implications for Patients and Healthcare Providers

Rethinking Warning Signs for Kidney Damage

The discovery that PPIs can lead to kidney damage without prior acute symptoms necessitates a reevaluation of kidney health monitoring in patients using these medications. Healthcare providers are encouraged to consider the risk of chronic kidney disease in patients on long-term PPI therapy, even without acute kidney issues.

Recommendations for PPI Use

Given these findings, it is advised that both doctors and patients exercise caution with long-term PPI use. These medications should be used only when necessary, and patients should consult healthcare providers if they have been using PPIs for extended periods without medical supervision.

Broader Impact on Public Health

Raising Awareness on Medication Risks

The potential risks of prolonged PPI use underscore the need for increased awareness among the public and healthcare professionals. Educating individuals about the possible side effects of these medications is crucial in preventing kidney damage and ensuring informed decision-making.

Future Research Directions

The study calls for further research to explore how PPIs may cause kidney damage. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to the development of safer alternatives or more comprehensive guidelines for PPI use, ultimately protecting patient health",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 11, 2025"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/study-finds-heavy-cannabis-use-may-significantly-increase-anxiety-risk/,Study Finds Heavy Cannabis Use May Significantly Increase Anxiety Risk,"Cannabis use has become increasingly common in Canada, with many viewing it as a safe or even beneficial substance. However, a recent study conducted by the Bruyère Research Institute, University of Ottawa, The Ottawa Hospital, and ICES challenges this perception. The study examines the potential risks associated with heavy cannabis use and its link to anxiety disorders.

Methodology

Published in eClinicalMedicine, this extensive study analyzed health records from over 12 million individuals in Ontario, Canada, covering the period from 2008 to 2019. Researchers focused on individuals who visited the emergency department (ED) due to cannabis use, comparing their outcomes with those of the general population who had no prior diagnosis or treatment for anxiety.

Related: Panic Attacks And Anxiety Linked To Low Vitamin B6 And Iron levels

Key Findings and Statistics

Increased Risk of Anxiety Disorders

The study found that 27.5% of individuals who visited the ED for cannabis use were diagnosed with a new anxiety disorder within three years. This rate is nearly four times higher than the 5.6% incidence observed in the general population, indicating a significant correlation between cannabis use and anxiety disorders.

Severity of Anxiety Among Cannabis Users

Additionally, 12.3% of cannabis users required hospital or ED care for severe anxiety, compared to just 1.2% in the general population. This finding highlights the potential severity of anxiety symptoms among cannabis users.

Demographic Insights

The research identified young adults (ages 10–24) and men as the demographics most at risk of developing anxiety disorders related to cannabis use. Notably, heavy users whose ED visits were primarily due to cannabis use faced a 9.4 times higher risk of needing hospital care for anxiety.

Implications of the Study

Understanding the Causality Dilemma

A major question arising from the study is whether cannabis use causes anxiety disorders or if individuals with anxiety are more likely to use cannabis for self-medication. While the study does not provide a definitive answer, it suggests that cannabis use could exacerbate anxiety rather than alleviate it.

Health Misconceptions and Risks

The study challenges the common misconception that cannabis is inherently safe or beneficial for health. The authors caution against using cannabis to manage anxiety symptoms, as it may delay appropriate medical treatment and potentially worsen anxiety over time.

Expert Opinions and Recommendations

Insights from Researchers

The study’s authors emphasize the importance of understanding the potential mental health risks associated with cannabis use. They recommend that individuals considering cannabis for anxiety management seek professional medical advice to avoid exacerbating their symptoms.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/escalating-egg-shortage-crisis-in-2025/,The Escalating Egg Shortage Crisis in 2025,"In February 2025, the United States faces a severe egg shortage, primarily due to an outbreak of avian influenza. Over the past three months, approximately 30 million egg-laying chickens have been culled to prevent the virus’s spread, significantly impacting the egg supply. This reduction accounts for about 10% of the nation’s egg-laying population, resulting in empty supermarket shelves and rationing measures at major retailers like Costco and Trader Joe’s.

The Impact of Avian Influenza

The current wave of avian influenza is the most devastating in recent years, disproportionately affecting farms that supply the retail sector. Efforts to control the outbreak include culling infected flocks and temporarily closing live poultry markets for disinfection. The USDA has reported a new strain of the virus detected among dairy cattle in Nevada, raising concerns about its potential to replicate in mammals, including humans.

Economic and Consumer Effects

The shortage has led to rationing measures, with stores imposing limits on egg purchases. Consumers face frustration due to empty shelves and increased prices. Economically, the shortage has disrupted both retail and wholesale markets. Experts predict it could take up to six months for the market to stabilize, contingent on the cessation of avian influenza outbreaks and the repopulation of chicken farms.

Government and Scientific Response

In response to the crisis, the USDA and other health authorities have intensified efforts to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. Scientists and virologists are calling for more robust government intervention and policy changes to address the crisis. The detection of the virus in mammals has heightened the urgency for scientific research and public health measures.

Future Outlook and Solutions

Experts, including Brian Moscogiuri from Eggs Unlimited, suggest that market stabilization could take several months. Potential strategies for mitigating future crises include improving biosecurity measures, enhancing surveillance of avian diseases, and increasing public awareness and education about the risks and prevention of avian influenza. As the situation evolves, informed consumer behavior and government policy will play crucial roles in navigating the challenges ahead.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 10, 2025"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-ignoring-these-8-subtle-signs-of-heart-trouble/,Stop Ignoring These 8 Subtle Signs of Heart Trouble Before It’s Too Late,"Imagine this: you’re climbing a flight of stairs, and halfway up, you feel an unusual heaviness in your chest. You pause, catch your breath, and brush it off as fatigue. Weeks later, you learn it was your heart’s quiet cry for help. Heart disease doesn’t always scream; sometimes, it whispers. And those whispers—subtle symptoms—are often ignored until it’s too late.

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, yet many of its warning signs are misunderstood or dismissed. According to studies, subtle symptoms like fatigue or nausea are often overlooked, especially in women, despite being strong indicators of underlying cardiovascular issues. Let’s uncover the eight overlooked signs of heart disease that could save your life.

1. Nausea or Vomiting (Especially in Women)

Heart disease doesn’t always present as chest pain, particularly in women. Research reveals that nausea or vomiting can be a primary symptom of angina or even a heart attack. Unfortunately, these symptoms are often mistaken for gastrointestinal issues like food poisoning or acid reflux. This misinterpretation delays critical care and increases the risk of severe outcomes. If you experience unexplained nausea alongside other symptoms like fatigue or dizziness, it’s time to consult a doctor.

While nausea may seem unrelated to the heart, other symptoms like chest heaviness during activity are more directly tied to cardiovascular strain.

2. Chest Heaviness or Tightness During Activity

A feeling of heaviness or tightness in the chest during physical exertion—such as climbing stairs or walking uphill—that subsides with rest is a classic warning sign of angina. This occurs when narrowed coronary arteries restrict blood flow to the heart muscle. Unlike sudden sharp pain, this sensation is often described as a dull pressure that can be easily dismissed as fatigue or aging. However, ignoring this symptom could lead to more severe complications like a heart attack.

Related: Stop Making These 13 Common Health Mistakes After 50 (Before It’s Too Late)

Chest heaviness is a clear signal from your heart under stress, but what about more subtle signs like persistent fatigue?

3. Persistent Fatigue

Do you find yourself feeling unusually tired during routine activities? Persistent fatigue can be a sign that your heart is struggling to pump blood efficiently. This reduced blood flow affects your muscles and organs, leaving you drained even after minimal exertion. Studies have linked chronic fatigue to conditions such as coronary artery disease and heart failure. While fatigue can result from various causes, when paired with other symptoms on this list, it warrants immediate medical attention.

Fatigue might seem ordinary, but other seemingly unrelated issues—like erectile dysfunction—can also point to hidden cardiovascular problems.

4. Erectile Dysfunction (ED)

For men, erectile dysfunction can be one of the earliest signs of arterial damage. The same narrowing of blood vessels that impairs blood flow to the heart can also affect circulation elsewhere in the body. Experts emphasize that ED often precedes coronary artery disease by several years, making it an important early warning sign. If you’re experiencing ED, consider it not just a quality-of-life issue but also a potential indicator of underlying cardiovascular risks.

Related: 6 Natural Nutrients That Dissolve Arterial Plaque

Just as impaired blood flow affects circulation in men, it can also manifest as leg pain during activity—a condition known as peripheral artery disease.

5. Leg Pain or Cramps While Walking

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) occurs when narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the legs. This often causes cramping or tightness in the calves during physical activity that eases with rest—a condition sometimes called “leg angina.” PAD not only signals localized vascular issues but also reflects systemic problems that frequently coexist with coronary artery disease. Early detection through vascular ultrasounds or angiograms can prevent further complications.

Related: Top 5 drinks to INSTANTLY improve leg circulation and blood flow

While leg pain points to circulation issues in the lower body, temporary vision loss may indicate blockages closer to the brain.

6. Temporary Vision Loss (Amaurosis Fugax)

A sudden “shade” descending over one eye—lasting seconds to minutes—is known as amaurosis fugax and is often caused by tiny blood clots blocking blood flow to the retina. These microemboli typically originate from plaques in the carotid arteries and serve as an early warning sign for stroke or heart attack risk. If you experience this symptom, seek medical evaluation immediately—it’s your body signaling serious vascular trouble.

Vision loss may seem alarming enough to prompt action, but what about dizziness caused by head movements? This too can signal cardiovascular problems.

7. Dizziness with Head Movements

Sudden dizziness when tilting your head up or down could indicate vertebral artery narrowing—a condition that reduces blood flow to the brainstem. This type of dizziness is often overlooked because it’s attributed to inner ear issues or dehydration. However, if it occurs frequently or alongside other symptoms like chest tightness or vision changes, it may point to serious cardiovascular concerns requiring further investigation.

From dizziness to hearing disturbances—your body has many ways of signaling trouble with your circulatory system.

8. Pulsatile Ear Noises

Hearing a “whooshing” sound in one ear while lying down—often described as pulsatile tinnitus—can indicate narrowing in the carotid artery on that side. This symptom is frequently dismissed as harmless but may reflect turbulent blood flow caused by arterial blockages. A simple carotid ultrasound can help identify whether this noise is linked to vascular issues needing intervention.

Why These Signs Are Often Missed

Many of these symptoms are subtle and easily attributed to non-cardiac causes like aging, stress, or lifestyle factors. Traditional diagnostic methods focusing solely on cholesterol levels and stress tests often miss non-obstructive forms of heart disease such as microvascular angina or plaque erosion—conditions more common in women. Advanced imaging techniques like CT coronary angiograms and inflammation markers (e.g., LP-PLA2) are proving more effective at detecting these hidden risks.

Now that you know what signs to look for and why they’re missed, let’s explore what steps you can take today to protect your heart health.

What You Can Do Today

If you’ve experienced any of these symptoms—even if they seem mild—don’t wait to take action. Schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider and discuss advanced diagnostic options such as coronary CT angiograms or inflammation marker testing. Early detection and treatment could prevent life-threatening complications like heart attacks or strokes.

Closing Thought:
Heart disease doesn’t always announce itself with dramatic chest pain; sometimes, it’s subtle—a whisper rather than a shout. By recognizing these overlooked signs and acting promptly, you can take control of your heart health before it’s too late.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-making-these-13-common-health-mistakes-after-50/,"Stop Making These 13 Common Health Mistakes, Especially After 50","Aging is inevitable, but staying healthy and vibrant as you age is entirely within your control. Unfortunately, many people unknowingly make mistakes that can sabotage their health, especially after turning 50. If you’re in this age group—or even if you’re younger—this guide will help you avoid these pitfalls and take charge of your well-being.

1. Relying on Unreliable Health Information Sources

One of the biggest mistakes people make is relying on advice from sources that lack expertise in nutrition and holistic health. Many conventional health recommendations focus on treating symptoms rather than addressing root causes. Seek advice from professionals with proven results in solving the specific health issues you face. This ensures your treatments are effective and free from unnecessary side effects.

2. Blindly Accepting Misdiagnoses or Overmedication

Blindly accepting a diagnosis that doesn’t feel right can lead to unnecessary treatments that might do more harm than good. Always question whether the solution being offered creates more problems than it solves. For example, many medications come with side effects that can exacerbate your issues rather than resolve them.

3. Failing to Manage Chronic Stress

Stress is a silent killer, especially as we age. Chronic stress can disrupt sleep, increase cortisol levels, and leave you feeling stuck in a cycle of worry and fear. Combat this by prioritizing relaxation and making time for nature. Living in a calm environment or regularly spending time outdoors has therapeutic benefits that can significantly improve mental and physical health.

4. Neglecting Regular Exercise

Exercise isn’t just about burning calories; it’s about flushing out stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Focus on moderate, wave-like exercises rather than sustained high-intensity workouts to protect your body from unnecessary strain. Consistency is key—regular movement keeps your body strong and resilient.

5. Ignoring Key Nutrients

As you age, certain nutrients become essential for maintaining optimal health:

Vitamin D: Influences up to 10% of your genes and supports immune function, bone health, and more.
Magnesium: Vital for energy production, heart health, and muscle function.
Zinc: Supports immunity and works synergistically with vitamin D and magnesium.

On the flip side, be cautious with calcium and iron intake to avoid toxicity risks.

6. Over-consuming Calcium and Iron

Excess calcium can accumulate in soft tissues without enough magnesium to regulate it, increasing the risk of heart disease. Similarly, too much iron can damage organs over time due to the body’s limited ability to excrete it.

7. Avoiding Salt Due to Misconceptions

Contrary to popular belief, salt isn’t the enemy—sea salt contains 84 essential minerals that support overall health. If you’re sensitive to salt, it’s likely due to a potassium deficiency since sodium and potassium work together in the body.

8. Cutting Cholesterol Too Much

Cholesterol gets a bad rap but is crucial for hormone production, especially during menopause when hormone levels naturally decline. Foods like butter, eggs, dairy, and shellfish provide the cholesterol needed to support brain function, digestion, and hormone synthesis.

9. Consuming Too Much Sugar and Starch

Processed carbohydrates like sugar and starch wreak havoc on blood sugar levels and overall health. Instead of relying on medications to manage blood sugar spikes, reduce your intake of these foods altogether. Pay attention to hidden starches listed as “modified food starch” or “wheat flour” on labels—they’re just as harmful as sugar.

Related: 8 Signs You’re Eating Too Much Sugar

10. Neglecting Protein Intake

Protein is the building block of life—it supports muscle maintenance, immune function, and tissue repair. As you age, protein becomes even more critical to prevent muscle loss. Opt for nutrient-dense sources like grass-fed beef or lamb or alternatives like cod liver for its rich nutrient profile.

11. Eating Too Frequently

Frequent eating or snacking throughout the day can lead to excessive insulin production—a major contributor to chronic illnesses like diabetes, fatty liver disease, and high blood pressure. Instead, aim for two meals a day with no snacks in between to promote intermittent fasting and reduce insulin levels naturally.

12. Not Addressing Autoimmune Diseases Holistically

Autoimmune conditions often stem from low vitamin D levels, chronic stress events (like loss or trauma), and microbial imbalances in the gut. To combat this:

Increase vitamin D intake.
Manage stress through exercise.
Support gut health with probiotics or fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi.
13. Neglecting Gut Microbiome Health

Your gut microbiome isn’t just a collection of bacteria—it’s an organ that plays a critical role in digestion, immunity, mood regulation, sleep quality, and even cancer prevention. Avoid antibiotics unless absolutely necessary since they permanently alter your microbiome composition. Instead, nurture your gut by consuming fermented foods regularly and taking high-quality probiotics.

Health doesn’t happen by accident—it’s something you create intentionally through informed choices about nutrition, lifestyle habits, and self-care routines. By avoiding these 13 common mistakes after 50 (or earlier), you’ll set yourself up for a healthier future filled with energy and vitality!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/scientists-discover-hidden-brain-changes-in-regular-cannabis-users/,Scientists Discover Hidden Brain Changes in Regular Cannabis Users,"The largest study ever conducted on cannabis and brain function has unveiled concerning findings about how heavy marijuana use affects our cognitive abilities. In a groundbreaking investigation of over 1,000 young adults, researchers discovered that nearly two-thirds of heavy cannabis users showed reduced brain activity during critical memory tasks[1][2].

The Surprising Numbers

Heavy cannabis users, defined as those who have used marijuana more than 1,000 times in their lifetime, demonstrated a significant decline in brain activity. Specifically, 63% of lifetime heavy users exhibited reduced brain activity during working memory tasks, while an even higher percentage (68%) of recent users showed similar impairments[4].

What is Working Memory?

Working memory is crucial for everyday tasks that we often take for granted. It’s what allows you to remember driving instructions, follow a conversation, or solve a math problem in your head. Think of it as your brain’s temporary sticky note – holding onto information just long enough to use it[2].

The Science Behind the Impact

The research revealed decreased activity in several critical brain regions:

Key Affected Areas:

Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
Anterior insula

These regions are vital for decision-making, memory, attention, and emotional processing[1]. The impact was substantial enough to show a measurable difference from non-users, with a Cohen d value of -0.28[10].

Long-Term vs. Recent Use

Perhaps most concerning is that the effects appear to persist even after stopping cannabis use. The study found that chronic use had a more significant impact than recent use on working memory difficulties[7]. This suggests that heavy lifetime use might lead to lasting changes in brain function, regardless of current usage patterns.

Who’s Most at Risk?

The study focused on adults aged 22 to 36, with participants classified into three categories:

Heavy users (>1,000 times): 8.8%
Moderate users (10-999 times): 17.8%
Non-users (<10 times): 73.4%[1]
What This Means for You

If you’re a cannabis user, these findings suggest that taking breaks before engaging in cognitively demanding tasks could help improve performance[4]. The research indicates that residual cognitive effects might persist for up to four weeks after stopping use[4].

Looking Forward

As cannabis legalization continues to spread globally, understanding its impact on brain function becomes increasingly crucial. While this research provides valuable insights, it also raises important questions about long-term cognitive health and the need for informed decision-making regarding cannabis use[1][2].

Remember, this study doesn’t suggest that everyone who uses cannabis will experience these effects, but it does highlight the importance of being aware of potential risks, especially for heavy users. As we continue to learn more about how cannabis affects our brains, this research serves as a crucial piece of the puzzle in understanding the long-term implications of heavy use.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/10-silent-signs-your-leg-arteries-are-clogged/,Doctors Warn: 10 Silent Signs Your Leg Arteries Are Clogged,"Imagine walking up stairs and suddenly feeling intense leg pain that forces you to stop. This isn’t just muscle fatigue – it could be your body’s urgent warning about a condition that affects millions. In fact, 50% of people with this disease don’t even know they have it, and by the time symptoms appear, their arteries may already be 60% blocked.

In this video, we’ll dive deep into what’s really causing that mysterious leg pain – Peripheral Arterial Disease, or PAD – a serious condition where fatty deposits (plaque) build up in your leg arteries, reducing blood flow to your legs and feet. We’ll reveal 10 warning signs that most people miss, explain why this condition affects 12% to 20% of Americans over 60, and nearly 50% of those 85 and older, and share the crucial steps you need to take to protect your arterial health.

Whether you’re in your 40s, 50s, or beyond, understanding these silent signals could literally save your life or limb. We’ll explore how everyday habits contribute to artery clogging, the simple tests your doctor can use to diagnose PAD, and most importantly, the proven lifestyle changes that can help reverse this condition before it’s too late.

From understanding your risk factors to learning which foods clear your arteries naturally, we’ll equip you with the knowledge you need to take control of your vascular health. Stay tuned as we uncover the hidden signs your body might be sending you right now.

Related: Top 5 Nutrients to Reduce Swelling in Feet and Legs

First, let’s explore what actually causes PAD.

Over 90% of cases stem from atherosclerosis – where plaque builds up inside your arteries, creating a dangerous cascade effect in your body. This plaque progressively narrows your arteries, making vessel walls stiffer and significantly reducing crucial blood flow to your legs.

Perhaps most concerning is that these buildups can form blood clots that further block circulation – if these clots break off and travel through the bloodstream, they can cause a heart attack if they reach the heart, or a stroke if they reach the brain’s arteries, creating life-threatening situations

PAD can also develop through several other mechanisms. Blood vessel inflammation, known as vasculitis, can cause vessel walls to thicken and scar. Physical traumas, including fractures and surgical procedures, can damage blood vessels and lead to PAD. Some people develop the condition from radiation exposure, particularly during cancer treatments, while others may have irregular blood vessel formation present since birth.

But here’s what’s really shocking about PAD – certain lifestyle factors and conditions can dramatically increase your risk. Smoking stands out as the single most dangerous contributor, increasing risk by 400%. Other significant risk factors include diabetes (especially Type 2), high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol. Age plays a crucial role, with risk climbing sharply after 65. Chronic kidney disease and a family history of cardiovascular disease also significantly increase your chances of developing PAD.

What makes these risk factors particularly dangerous is their synergistic effect – they don’t just add up, they multiply. Having three or more risk factors can increase your PAD risk by a factor of ten.

This multiplication effect helps explain why PAD is rarely an isolated condition. When plaque builds up in your leg arteries, it’s usually a sign of systemic atherosclerosis, meaning other arteries throughout your body are likely affected as well.

Now that you understand the devastating impact of PAD and how risk factors multiply its danger, let’s examine these ten warning signs – your body’s desperate cry for help. Some are subtle, others dramatic, but all deserve your immediate attention.

Related: 7 Nutrients To Remove Calcium Plaque From Your Arteries

Let’s begin with the most common signal: intermittent claudication – that same leg cramping we mentioned earlier that forces you to stop walking or climbing stairs.

Unlike normal muscle fatigue, this pain has a distinct pattern: it strikes during activity and quickly subsides with rest. It’s your muscles crying out for more blood flow.

Moving to our second sign, we see persistent leg numbness and weakness.

This isn’t normal aging – it’s an ongoing sensation affecting your feet and leg muscles, signaling that blood flow has been significantly reduced.

The third warning sign reveals something many people overlook: temperature differences in your legs and feet.

If one leg feels notably colder than the other, or your feet feel cold compared to the rest of your body, it’s a clear signal that blood isn’t reaching these areas effectively.

Your skin tells the fourth story.

PAD can cause your legs to develop a shiny, smooth texture, often taking on pale, bluish, or purplish tones – all signs that your skin isn’t getting the blood supply it needs.

Here’s a surprising fifth sign that most people overlook: increased hair loss on your feet and legs.

Those ‘balding toes’ aren’t just cosmetic – they’re telling you that blood flow has become so restricted it can’t even sustain normal hair growth.

The sixth sign is subtle but significant: changes in your toenails.

When they become brittle and grow unusually slowly, it’s another sign that reduced blood flow is affecting your body’s normal functions.

Now we’re entering more serious territory with our seventh sign: non-healing sores on your feet or legs.

These stubborn ulcers that refuse to heal are red flags that demand immediate attention – if left untreated, they can lead to dangerous complications like gangrene, and even amputation.

As we move into advanced warning signs, number eight is something your doctor will check: weak or absent pulses in your feet and ankles.

While you might not notice this yourself, it’s a crucial indicator during medical examinations.

The ninth sign signals advanced PAD: pain even at rest – a burning sensation in your feet that typically worsens at night or when you elevate your legs.

This pain, occurring without any physical activity, means your arteries are severely narrowed. This can progress to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI), where blood flow becomes so restricted that tissue death becomes a real risk.

Our final warning sign, particularly concerning in men with diabetes, is erectile dysfunction.

While it might seem unrelated to leg arteries, it often signals the same underlying problem – restricted blood flow throughout your body.

Remember: PAD is a silent threat – half of those affected show no symptoms at all. Don’t wait for multiple warning signs to appear. If you spot even one of these signals, especially with risk factors like smoking or diabetes, seek medical help immediately. Your quick action could save more than just your legs.

Your doctor begins with a physical exam – checking your skin, feeling for pulses, and listening to blood flow with a stethoscope. But the real game-changer is a simple test called the ankle-brachial index, or ABI. Think of it as a tale of two blood pressures: your doctor compares pressure readings between your ankles and arms. In healthy arteries, these numbers match. A significantly lower ankle pressure? That’s PAD raising its red flag.

When needed, doctors can look deeper with advanced imaging – from ultrasounds that peek inside your arteries to special X-rays called angiograms that map out exactly where blockages lurk.

Once you’ve been diagnosed with PAD, there’s good news: you can take control starting today.

Your daily choices can help stop and even reverse artery damage.

Walking is your secret weapon. Start with an exercise program, alternating between walking and resting periods. While it might feel uncomfortable at first, just 30 minutes daily can dramatically increase your walking distance and transform your circulation. Cycling and swimming are great alternatives to walking.

Your diet plays a crucial role in healing your arteries. Think of your plate as medicine: fill half with colorful vegetables and fruits packed with natural antioxidants that fight inflammation—the root of artery damage and heart disease.

Modern diets sabotage arteries in three key ways: hidden sugars in processed foods, appearing as high-fructose corn syrup, dextrose, and maltodextrin; industrial seed oils, like canola, soybean, corn, sunflower, and safflower oil; and highly processed grains stripped of nutrients, found in refined cereals and packaged snacks. These culprits are rampant in ultra-processed foods. Eliminate items like soft drinks, packaged snacks, sweetened cereals, ready-to-eat meals, frozen desserts, and processed meats. Studies show these foods increase inflammation and can raise your risk of cardiovascular disease by up to 50%.

When it comes to healing foods, start with healthy fats like olive oil, avocado oil, and fatty fish like wild-caught salmon, sardines, and mackerel. Omega-3 fatty acids from these fish help lower triglycerides, reduce blood pressure, and stabilize atherosclerotic plaques. They also provide anti-inflammatory benefits and help prevent blood clots while improving heart function.

Add protein power through grass-fed meat (rich in omega-3s compared to grain-fed beef) and pasture-raised eggs (packed with choline, vitamin D3, and eye-protecting antioxidants). Choline helps regulate blood pressure, improves cardiac function, and protects against cardiovascular damage by reducing inflammation. Boost gut health with fermented foods like kefir, natto, and sauerkraut—their vitamin K2 fights arterial calcification. Enhance flavor and circulation with anti-inflammatory spices like turmeric and garlic, paired with plenty of water to flush toxins and maintain blood flow.

For additional support, consider supplements like this nutrient-rich powder containing 8 key nutrients, including vitamin K2, clinically shown to boost blood flow and combat plaque. But remember: Supplements are just one piece of the puzzle.

In the next 10 minutes, I’m revealing seven incredible foods that most cardiologists never discuss with their patients. These natural powerhouses are often overlooked during medical appointments, yet they work wonders for your heart health—and the best part? They’re delicious! Get ready to transform your cardiovascular health with real food that gives your body exactly what it needs. What I’m about to share may change the way you think about heart health forever.

Let’s start with one of nature’s most powerful heart-healing foods: seafood.

What swims in our oceans could be the key to a stronger heart, thanks to its incredible omega-3 fatty acids—particularly EPA, DHA, and DPA. Studies show these healthy fats can lower triglycerides by 25-30% and reduce blood pressure by up to 4.5 mmHg in people with hypertension.

Here’s something fascinating: astaxanthin, the antioxidant that gives salmon and shrimp their reddish hue, actively protects your heart by preventing arterial plaque buildup. Wild-caught salmon leads the pack as nature’s heart medicine with high levels of EPA and DHA omega-3s, but those tiny sardines and anchovies pack an equally powerful punch—and because they’re lower on the food chain, they contain minimal contaminants like mercury and PCBs compared to larger fish. Just one cup (149 g) of canned sardines provides 1,463 mg of omega-3s, making them one of the richest sources of these essential fatty acids.

The seafood story gets even better. Shellfish like shrimp, scallops, and mussels are excellent sources of high-quality protein that’s highly digestible. They deliver a powerful trio of heart-protective nutrients: taurine, an amino acid that strengthens your heart muscle; zinc, which maintains heart rhythm; and selenium, which fights inflammation. And here’s a pro tip: wild salmon roe is nature’s heart supplement in concentrated form, combining all these powerful nutrients—EPA, DHA, astaxanthin, and antioxidants—in one package.

Now, let’s move on to our second heart-healing powerhouse: pasture-raised meats and organ meats.

While most people shy away from organ meats, they’re actually nature’s most concentrated source of heart-supporting nutrients. These nutrient-rich powerhouses are packed with CoQ10, heme iron, and essential amino acids that your heart craves.

Let me share something most doctors won’t tell you: grass-fed heart meat is one of the richest sources of CoQ10, a crucial nutrient that powers your mitochondria—the tiny energy factories inside every cell. Your heart cells contain thousands of these mitochondria because they need enormous amounts of energy to beat continuously. That’s why CoQ10 is so vital—it helps your mitochondria produce the energy your heart needs to function optimally. Think about it—what better way to support your heart than with nutrients from another heart? It’s nature’s perfect match.

But the benefits don’t stop there. Grass-fed liver is like nature’s multivitamin, loaded with vitamins A, B12, and folate that your cardiovascular system needs to thrive. And kidney? It’s packed with selenium, a powerful antioxidant that protects your heart.

When you choose regular cuts of meat, go for pasture-raised bison, beef, lamb, or poultry—these provide not just high-quality protein, but also three types of omega-3s: ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) from the grass they eat, plus EPA and DHA. What’s even more interesting is that grass-fed meat contains 2 to 4 times more omega-3s than grain-fed meat, along with higher levels of a special fat called CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid). Research suggests that CLA may help reduce inflammation and support healthy weight management—both of which are important for heart health.

Now for our third heart-healthy powerhouse, and this one might surprise you: eggs from pasture-raised chickens.

Forget what you’ve heard about eggs being bad for your heart—they’re actually one of nature’s most complete heart-supporting foods. Think about it: an egg contains all the nutrients needed to create a living, breathing chicken. That’s some serious nutritional power!

These golden-yolked wonders are packed with choline, a crucial nutrient that helps regulate your heart’s electrical system, and selenium, the same powerful antioxidant we found in kidney meat. But here’s what makes pasture-raised eggs truly special: they’re also rich in vitamin D3, which many cardiologists now recognize as essential for heart health. And unlike your morning bowl of oatmeal, eggs provide complete protein along with these heart-protective nutrients, making them a much better breakfast choice for your cardiovascular system.

Moving on, we have our fourth heart-healing superstar: plant-based fats.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking—aren’t fats bad for your heart? Actually, the right kinds of fats are absolutely essential for cardiovascular health, and nature provides them in perfect packages.

Let’s start with avocados. These creamy powerhouses are loaded with monounsaturated fats and potassium that work together to help regulate your blood pressure. Just one avocado provides more potassium than a banana, and these heart-healthy fats help your body absorb other essential nutrients better.

But the plant-based fat story doesn’t end there. Olives—and their precious oil—are packed with special compounds called polyphenols, such as Oleocanthal and Hydroxytyrosol, that fight inflammation and help maintain healthy cholesterol levels.

And here’s something fascinating about coconut: it contains unique fats called medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that your body processes differently than other fats. These MCTs provide quick energy for your heart and help promote healthy cholesterol levels. Whether you choose coconut oil or unsweetened coconut flakes, you’re giving your heart the fuel it needs to thrive.

Now let’s explore our fifth heart-healing champion: nuts and seeds.

These tiny powerhouses might be small in size, but they pack an incredible punch when it comes to heart health.

Almonds and walnuts lead the pack with their impressive ability to reduce inflammation and improve cholesterol levels. But what makes them truly special is their combination of healthy fats, fiber, and magnesium—three nutrients your heart absolutely loves.

Then we have chia and flaxseeds, which are like little omega-3 factories. Unlike the EPA and DHA we found in seafood and grass-fed meats, these seeds provide ALA, a plant-based omega-3 that works alongside their soluble fiber to keep your arteries healthy and strong. And here’s a fun fact about pumpkin seeds: they’re one of nature’s richest sources of magnesium, a mineral that’s crucial for maintaining healthy blood pressure. Just a handful of these seeds can provide the magnesium your heart needs to maintain its natural rhythm.

Moving to our sixth heart-healing hero: green, leafy, and sulfur-rich vegetables.

These everyday vegetables are rich in vitamin C and special compounds that work together to protect your cardiovascular system.

Let’s start with the green champions like spinach, kale, and Swiss chard. These leafy greens are packed with nitrates—not the artificial kind found in processed meats, but natural compounds that begin their journey to heart health in your mouth. The process starts with beneficial bacteria converting nitrates to nitrites, which your body then transforms into nitric oxide, a molecule that helps your arteries relax and improve blood flow throughout your body.

The cruciferous crew—broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts—brings another layer of protection to your heart. These vegetables contain compounds that support your body’s natural detoxification processes and help maintain cardiovascular health. When you chop or chew these vegetables, these beneficial compounds are activated.

And don’t forget the aromatic allies: onions and garlic. These kitchen staples release sulfur compounds that do more than just add flavor to your meals—they support vascular health, reduce inflammation, and may help lower cholesterol levels. It’s nature’s way of making sure the most common vegetables in your kitchen are also some of the best for your heart.

Last but not least, let’s talk about our seventh heart-healing food: raw dairy from pasture-raised animals.

While most people think dairy might be bad for their heart, the right kind of dairy can actually be a powerful ally in cardiovascular health.

Raw, pasture-raised dairy is nature’s calcium-rich package, but it offers something even more special: vitamin K2. This crucial nutrient directs calcium to its proper destinations in your body, ensuring it builds strong bones while keeping it away from your arteries. This helps keep your blood vessels flexible and healthy. Whether you choose raw milk, cheese, or yogurt from trusted sources, you’re getting this powerful nutrient that supports arterial elasticity and prevents calcification.

But the benefits don’t stop at K2. Raw dairy from grass-fed animals is also rich in magnesium, another mineral your heart craves. Together with calcium, these nutrients work in harmony to support your heart’s natural rhythm. Just remember to source your raw dairy products from trusted farmers who prioritize the health of their animals—because healthy cows make healthy milk.

So there you have it—seven powerful foods that can transform your heart health from the inside out. Every bite you take is an opportunity to nourish your cardiovascular system with these nutrient-rich, minimally processed options.

Here’s a sweet bonus: organic fruits and raw honey provide additional antioxidant benefits, and even your morning coffee can support heart health when it’s organic and mold-free.

I understand that accessing some of these foods consistently can be challenging—whether it’s the cost of wild-caught seafood or the limited availability of grass-fed organ meats and raw dairy. While whole foods should always be your first choice, here are three recommended supplement combinations to help fill nutritional gaps in your heart-health protocol:

A high-absorption omega-3 complex with fish and krill oils, DPA, vitamin D3, and astaxanthin.

A specialized vitamin K2 formula enriched with magnesium and nitric oxide-boosting nutrients, such as beetroot and pomegranate extracts.

A mitochondrial blend of CoQ10 to power cells, PQQ to generate new mitochondria, and Shilajit to amplify CoQ10’s benefits.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"January 20, 2025"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/4-vital-nutrients-vanishing-from-your-food/,4 Vital Nutrients Vanishing From Your Food (Here’s How to Fix It),"Imagine eating 100 carrots and getting the same nutrition as a single carrot from your grandparents’ era. That’s not science fiction—it’s happening right now. Even your perfect diet, packed with superfoods and lean proteins, could be secretly starving you. Over the last 70 years, our food has lost up to 99% of its vital nutrients. Today, I’m going to reveal 4 critical nutrients that are disappearing from your food, why it’s happening, and—most importantly—how you can fix it. Stick around, because this information could completely transform your health.

Let’s start with the root of the problem: the soil.

The food we eat is only as nutritious as the soil it grows in. For thousands of years, plants absorbed minerals and nutrients from the earth, and when we ate those plants—or the animals that ate those plants—we got all the vitamins and minerals we needed to thrive.

In the 1960s, a dramatic shift occurred in our food system. As giant agricultural corporations began buying family farms, they introduced intensive farming methods that prioritized quantity over quality. Instead of letting the soil rest and replenish, farmers planted the same crops repeatedly, year after year. They also used chemical fertilizers and herbicides, which made plants grow bigger and faster but stripped the soil of its natural nutrients, leading to nutrient-poor plants and less nutrition for us.

The impact on our food has been staggering. One Australian study showed that between 1948 and 1991, apples lost 80% of their vitamin C, meaning you’d need to eat five apples today to get the same amount of vitamin C as one apple from 1948. Carrots have lost 99% of their beta-carotene, which your body converts to vitamin A, so you’d need to eat 100 carrots today to get the same amount of beta-carotene as one carrot from the 1940s.

This nutrient depletion extends beyond our produce to affect our protein sources as well. The shift from traditional grass-feeding to modern grain-feeding practices has significantly altered beef’s nutritional profile. Grass-fed beef contains up to 2-3 times more B vitamins, and 5-6 times more omega-3 fatty acids than grain-fed cattle raised in factory farms.

The consequences of these nutrient losses affect us directly—these vitamins and minerals are the building blocks of a healthy body, and without them, we’re left feeling sluggish, weak, and prone to illness.

At this point, you’re probably wondering about solutions. You might be thinking, ‘I’ll just take a multivitamin and call it a day,’ but here’s the thing: multivitamins are like trying to fight a wildfire with a squirt gun. Sure, they provide a dose of vitamins, but your body might not absorb them effectively.

Think of your body as a car and vitamins as fuel. If the engine is broken, no amount of fuel will make it run. That’s why just taking a multivitamin isn’t enough—you need to fix the engine, or in this case, address the missing nutrients.

So, what exactly is this ‘engine’ that needs fixing? It turns out there are four critical nutrients that act like the spark plugs, oil, and filters of your body’s engine. These are the missing pieces that make everything else work better.

Let’s start with the most important nutrient: fulvic acid—your body’s master key and one of the most powerful nutrients you’ve never heard of.

This organic compound, created by beneficial soil microorganisms during plant decomposition, doesn’t just carry over 70 trace minerals and antioxidants—it’s your body’s ultimate nutrient booster.

Without fulvic acid, it’s like having premium fuel but no spark plugs; your body can’t utilize the vitamins and minerals you consume. It’s nature’s delivery system, ushering nutrients in and escorting toxins out, while firing up your energy and supercharging your digestion.

Unfortunately, modern pesticides and chemical fertilizers have killed off the microorganisms that create fulvic acid, leading to a crisis. These chemicals disrupt its natural formation in humus—that rich, dark organic matter in soil created when plants decompose.

Your body needs 100 to 500 mg of fulvic acid daily, but even organic root vegetables can’t provide enough anymore. Those wild mushrooms, blackstrap molasses, and root vegetables that once burst with fulvic acid? They’re now nearly empty.

There are only two places where fulvic acid still exists in abundance:

One: Shilajit, a rare, tar-like substance that oozes from Himalayan rocks, concentrated by centuries of pressure. But even this natural wonder contains only 15 to 20% fulvic acid.

Two: MLG-50, a fulvic mineral complex produced from a unique deposit in the Southern United States, delivers 35% fulvic acid—almost double what’s found in shilajit. It’s like centuries of nature’s work in a single dose.

Now that we’ve unlocked your body’s ability to absorb nutrients with fulvic acid, let’s talk about protecting them.

Enter our second nutrient, astaxanthin—nature’s strongest antioxidant.

That vibrant pink in wild salmon? That’s astaxanthin, a compound that helps fuel their incredible upstream journeys.

This remarkable nutrient slashes muscle soreness by 58% after workouts, helps you bounce back faster, and even protects your eyes from digital strain—with half of study participants reporting complete relief in just four weeks. Studies show it’s significantly stronger than vitamin C at protecting cell membranes.

To achieve these benefits, research shows your body needs 4 to 8 mg of astaxanthin daily. In nature, wild salmon obtain astaxanthin by consuming tiny sea creatures that feed on microscopic algae. These algae are nature’s richest source of astaxanthin, giving wild salmon their pink color and nutritional benefits.

But farmed salmon tell a different story. Without synthetic astaxanthin added to their feed, their flesh would be gray. The farming industry uses synthetic astaxanthin primarily as a coloring agent to achieve the pink color consumers expect. The problem? This synthetic version is 20 to 30 times weaker in nutritional benefits than natural astaxanthin. Wild sockeye salmon contains roughly four to five times more astaxanthin than farmed salmon. Plus, it’s in its natural, more bioavailable form.

This difference creates a modern dilemma: to get just the minimum effective dose, you’d need to eat 4 ounces of wild sockeye salmon every single day. Getting enough natural astaxanthin from food today is nearly impossible.

Now that we’ve covered how astaxanthin protects your muscles and eyes, let’s move to another critical protector—this time for your bones.

Related: Why 90% of People Take Vitamin D Wrong (And How to Fix It)

Enter our third nutrient, tocotrienols, remarkable members of the vitamin E family that are revolutionizing bone health.

Studies show these compounds significantly improve bone strength, prevent osteoporosis, and accelerate fracture healing. Unlike regular vitamin E, tocotrienols penetrate cell membranes more effectively, fighting the oxidative stress and inflammation that lead to bone loss as we age.

Your body needs 200 to 300 mg of tocotrienols daily for therapeutic effects, but the average American gets only 2 to 3 mg—far below optimal levels.

Why? The richest sources, like palm oil and rice bran oil, are rarely used in Western diets, and modern food processing strips away these valuable compounds from the foods we do eat.

Nature packs tocotrienols primarily in palm oil, which contains up to 70% of its vitamin E as tocotrienols. But to reach optimal levels, you’d need to consume an entire cup of palm oil (100-200 g) or 1.5 to 4 kg of wheat germ daily—amounts that are impractical.

The real breakthrough comes from combining these nutrients. When paired with astaxanthin, tocotrienols create a synergistic antioxidant effect, and combined with fulvic acid, they form a powerful support system for bone health.

Now that we’ve covered three powerful protectors—from muscles to eyes to bones—let’s complete our nutrient quartet with your body’s energy producer: CoQ10 (Coenzyme Q10).

Think of it as your cellular battery pack, working alongside fulvic acid to power every cell in your body.

Found in every cell, CoQ10 is essential for heart health, brain function, and energy production. Your body needs 100 to 200 mg of CoQ10 daily, but natural food sources provide surprisingly small amounts. Even organ meats—the richest source—contain only small amounts of CoQ10. Fatty fish like mackerel provide even less, and vegetables like broccoli offer only trace amounts. When combined with fulvic acid, however, studies show CoQ10 can increase energy production by 144% in muscle cells and 56% in the brain.

But like the other nutrients we’ve discussed, CoQ10 faces a double crisis. First, our bodies’ natural production peaks in our 20s and steadily declines—by age 65, we have less than half the CoQ10 we had at 25. Second, modern food processing has stripped away much of the CoQ10 from our food sources. Our typical diet provides just 25% of what we need, and this shortfall grows as we age.

This is where fulvic acid’s role becomes crucial again—it helps shuttle CoQ10 directly into your mitochondria, your cells’ power plants, where it’s needed most. These tiny energy factories convert nutrients into fuel, and with fulvic acid, CoQ10 makes this process far more efficient.

There you have it: four critical nutrients that modern farming and food processing have stripped from our food supply. While our produce may look the same on the outside, it contains just a fraction of its original nutritional power—making it virtually impossible to get therapeutic amounts from diet alone.

You could purchase these supplements individually, but that means managing multiple pills, significant expense, and the challenge of finding quality sources. To solve this, researchers combined these four powerful nutrients into one scientifically-formulated blend:

MLG-50’s concentrated fulvic mineral powder with 35% pure fulvic acid
Natural astaxanthin from Hawaiian microalgae
Tocotrienols from Malaysian palm oil
High-potency CoQ10 from Japan

The formula harnesses fulvic acid’s ability to enhance nutrient absorption, creating powerful synergistic effects. Clinical studies show remarkable results after just four weeks: 96% reported increased energy, 87% experienced stronger muscles, and 96% improved digestion.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/this-vegetable-oil-linked-to-aggressive-tumour-growth-study-finds/,"This vegetable oil linked to “aggressive” tumour growth, study finds","In a recent study published in the journal Nature, researchers at IRB Barcelona identified one type of dietary fatty acid that promotes tumour expansion.

The study details the mechanism by which dietary palmitic acid, which is commonly found in palm oil, can increase metastasis in oral cancer and melanoma skin cancer. Palm oil is an ingredient found in numerous everyday products, from chocolate to toothpaste and shampoo. (Updated Jan 5, 2025)

According to the researchers, tumour cells that are temporarily exposed to a diet rich in palmitic acid can develop a more aggressive profile, which can remain as “memory” within the tumor cell.

This change causes cancer cells to conserve greater metastatic capacity, even months after having been exposed to the fatty acid. This effect was not seen in the presence of oleic acid (abundant in olive oil) or linoleic acid (omega-6).

Since having discovered how palmitic acid alters the cancer genome to make it more aggressive, researchers have started developing therapies to interrupt this process.

Metastasis, which is a medical term used to refer to the spread of a primary tumour to other parts of the body, is responsible for ninety per cent of cancer deaths in the world.

In the study, researchers found that adding palmitic acid into the diet of mice not only contributed to metastasis, but also had long lasting effects on the genome.

Cancer cells that were exposed to palmitic acid even for just a short period of time remained highly metastatic long after the fatty acid had been removed from the diet.

Cancer neural network

For a tumour cell to metastasize, first it must detach from the tumour of origin, enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system, reach another organ, and survive and grow there.

In this study, the authors found that a diet rich in palmitic acid allowed tumour cells to form a neural network around the tumour. This produces a regenerative environment for the tumour, which the cells use to their advantage to grow and spread.

How to slow down metastasis

One of the key elements in the formation of the neural network that promotes metastasis are the so-called Schwann cells, which surround and protect neurons. The study published in the journal Nature demonstrates that various approaches to block Schwann cells inhibit the development of this neural network, thereby preventing metastasis.

“This discovery paves the way for research into and the development of therapies that specifically block cancer metastasis, a process that is almost always the cause of death by cancer,” concludes Dr. Gloria Pascual, associate researcher in the Stem Cells and Cancer lab at IRB Barcelona and co-first author of the paper together with Dr. Diana Domínguez.

While the research team believes it is still too early to determine what type of diet could help cancer patients slow down the metastatic process, based on the results from this study, reducing the amount of palmitic acid in your diet could be a step in the right direction.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"January 5, 2025"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/10-nutrients-to-fix-your-mitochondria/,10 Nutrients to Fix Your Mitochondria & Feel 10 Years Younger,"Feeling like you’re running on empty—no matter how much coffee you drink or how well you sleep? The answer might be hiding deep inside your cells: your mitochondria.

These tiny power plants fuel everything you do, from thinking to moving. But as you age, they slow down. By 60, they produce only half the energy they did in your 30s, leaving you tired, achy, and feeling older than you should. The good news? Science shows specific nutrients can revive your mitochondria, restore your energy, and help you feel years younger.

In this video, we’ll break down 10 powerful, science-backed nutrients to help you feel energized, vibrant, and youthful again. You’ll learn how they work to boost energy and reverse aging at the cellular level, the best foods to find them in, and when supplements are essential.

By the end, you’ll have a clear roadmap to supercharge your mitochondria and reclaim your youthful vitality. Ready to transform your health and turn back the clock? Let’s go!

Nutrient #10: Niacinamide

Let’s start with our most fundamental nutrient, niacinamide, a powerful form of vitamin B3. This nutrient is a key player in energy production because it’s a precursor to NAD+—a molecule essential for your mitochondria to function at their best. Think of NAD+ as the spark plug that ignites your cells, turning the food you eat into ATP, the energy your body runs on.

But here’s the catch: as you age, your NAD+ levels drop dramatically. By your 40s, they’re about half of what they were in your 20s. This decline is a big reason why you feel more tired and sluggish as you get older.

Research, like a 2018 study in Cell Metabolism, shows that boosting NAD+ levels can improve mitochondrial function, support brain health, and even promote healthy aging. While niacinamide is one of the most effective ways to raise NAD+, the results depend on factors like dosage, age, and your metabolism.

You can find niacinamide in foods like chicken, turkey, fish, and peanuts, but for a more significant boost, supplementation is often recommended.

Nutrient #9: D-Ribose

Now that we understand how NAD+ helps your mitochondria convert food into ATP, let’s explore D-Ribose—a unique sugar that serves as the actual building block for that ATP. Unlike regular sugars, D-Ribose doesn’t spike your blood sugar. Instead, it directly fuels ATP production, helping to combat fatigue and boost energy levels.

As you age, your body becomes less efficient at producing ATP, leaving you feeling drained. Supplementing with D-Ribose can help your mitochondria generate ATP more effectively, giving you the energy you had in your younger years.

The results are impressive: A 2006 study in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine found that D-Ribose increased energy levels by up to 61% in just three weeks. Participants experienced significant improvements in energy, mental clarity, and even sleep quality.

While you can find small amounts of D-Ribose in red meat, poultry, and fish, it’s not abundant in most diets. For optimal results, supplementation is often recommended.

Nutrient #8: Itadori Extract

Now that we understand how D-Ribose provides immediate energy through ATP production, let’s explore a nutrient that takes a longer-term approach through longevity pathways. Our Number 8 nutrient is Itadori extract from Japanese knotweed, a traditional medicine now making waves in modern science.

The secret lies in its rich resveratrol content, which activates sirtuins—your ‘longevity genes.’ These remarkable proteins protect your DNA, reduce inflammation, and enhance mitochondrial function, making your cells more efficient energy producers.

A 2011 study in Cell Metabolism revealed impressive results: overweight participants taking Itadori extract experienced increased energy, healthier mitochondria, and reduced inflammation.

Most fascinating is Itadori’s unique ability to mimic calorie restriction’s benefits—a proven longevity strategy—without the need to cut calories. Through sirtuin activation, it repairs cellular damage while keeping your energy levels high.

Nutrient #7: PQQ

While Itadori extract optimizes your existing mitochondria through longevity pathways, our next nutrient takes an even more fascinating approach. Let’s talk about our Number 7 nutrient, PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline quinone)—a compound that helps your body create entirely new mitochondria.

PQQ activates a gene called PGC-1α, triggering fresh mitochondria production and boosting brain energy. The results? Enhanced memory, focus, and mental clarity.

A fascinating 2010 study in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry revealed the power of this nutrient: older adults taking PQQ for three months experienced significant improvements in attention, working memory, and blood flow to their brain’s command center.

Though found in kiwi, papaya, and green peppers, supplementation typically provides optimal benefits.

Nutrient #6: CoQ10

Now that we know how PQQ helps create new mitochondria, let’s explore CoQ10 (Coenzyme Q10)—the nutrient that ensures these powerhouses run at peak efficiency. Think of it as high-grade oil for your cellular engines.

CoQ10 converts food into ATP, your body’s energy currency. But here’s the catch: as you age, your CoQ10 levels drop, leading to fatigue and slower cellular repair.

A 2020 study in Antioxidants revealed something remarkable: combining CoQ10 with PQQ created powerful results. Participants experienced better memory, faster reaction times, and improved mental clarity than with either nutrient alone.

While you can find CoQ10 in foods like beef liver, salmon, and mackerel, supplementation often provides optimal benefits.

Nutrient #5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine

With CoQ10 ensuring efficient energy production, we need to make sure your mitochondria have the right fuel to work with. Enter Acetyl-L-Carnitine, an amino acid that acts like a fuel injector, transporting fats directly to these cellular powerhouses.

This remarkable nutrient shows particular promise for older adults. A 2007 study in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that centenarians taking Acetyl-L-Carnitine gained 8 pounds of muscle and lost 4 pounds of fat in six months, while experiencing improved energy, strength, and mental clarity.

Though found in beef, milk, and cod, supplementation often provides the most beneficial amounts.

Nutrient #4: Alpha-Lipoic Acid

Now that we’ve optimized fuel delivery with Acetyl-L-Carnitine, let’s protect your cellular powerhouses with Alpha-Lipoic Acid—a unique antioxidant that works in both water- and fat-based environments.

This remarkable nutrient neutralizes free radicals—unstable molecules that accelerate aging and damage cells. A 2018 study in Free Radical Biology and Medicine revealed stunning results: older adults taking Alpha-Lipoic Acid had 68% more brain volume than the placebo group, while experiencing improved energy and reduced inflammation.

Though found in spinach, broccoli, and beef liver, supplementation often provides optimal benefits.

Nutrient #3: Curcumin

Now that we’ve protected your mitochondria with Alpha-Lipoic Acid, let’s enhance their performance with our Number 3 nutrient. Enter Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, which boosts stamina and improves physical performance.

A 2015 study in the Journal of Medicinal Food revealed impressive results: participants experienced less joint pain, fewer muscle cramps, and enhanced physical performance by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.

Though found in turmeric root, used in curries and golden milk, supplements provide more concentrated benefits.

Nutrient #2: Quercetin

Curcumin’s benefits can be amplified even further by our Number 2 nutrient. Let’s explore Quercetin, a polyphenol that boosts endurance by improving your body’s oxygen efficiency.

A 2010 study in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism revealed impressive results: older adults taking Quercetin could exercise longer without fatigue due to increased VO2 max—your body’s oxygen utilization capacity.

Found in apples, red onions, capers, and blueberries, Quercetin also enhances Curcumin’s absorption, creating a powerful duo for energy and endurance.

Nutrient #1: Magnesium

If you’re someone who enjoys running or exercising, chances are that you’ve had at least one of the following things: (Updated Dec 30, 2024)

shin splints
compartment syndrome
heal pain
achilles tendinitis, pain or tightness
scar tissue build-up from past sprained or broken ankles (which can lead to ankle immobility and compensation patterns up your entire chain)
limited range of motion in the ankles
tendonitis on the tops of the feet (usually originating in the shins)

Many of these foot problems, stem from overuse of your feet and having tight calves. While stretching your calves after each workout is a good idea, in most cases, it’s not enough.

There is, however, one stretching technique that will help with all kinds of issues such as plantar fasciitis, or pain in the bottom of the feet.

This stretching technique is the best possible one-off solution you will ever find. It’s easy and saves you time by tackling both sides of your leg.

That being said, it is not a foolproof solution for everything. But doing this daily for a week will you make you feel significantly better for any the conditions mentioned previously.

How to Relieve Plantar Fasciitis (Instructions Begin at 1:35)

Using this technique you will be able to stretch ALL of your calf, more specifically the fascia in those muscles.

When you do it right you’re not just releasing your “calf” muscles (aka your gastrocnemius) but you’re also simultaneously releasing the soleus and Achilles tendon.

Useful Tips:
Use your body weight as much as you can handle (make sure you’re not directly on your shin BONE, that will hurt and not in a good way).
Don’t be afraid to move up and down on the calf. Once you find a good spot, hold your position and rotate your foot and point out like a ballerina.
Remember that your fascia needs to be pinned and THEN stretched.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/nutrients-that-dissolve-arterial-plaque/,6 Natural Nutrients That Dissolve Arterial Plaque,"Do you struggle with persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, or a racing heart? These common symptoms can have many causes – and some might surprise you. Every 34 seconds, someone in the United States dies from heart disease. But here’s what your doctor isn’t telling you: 75% of heart attack patients had normal cholesterol levels.

In this video, I’ll reveal six powerful nutrients that target a hidden protein more dangerous than cholesterol – one that could be silently damaging your arteries right now. You’ll discover how these nutrients work together to help clear your arteries naturally, boost your energy levels, and improve your circulation. Best of all, I’ll show you a simple solution to get the optimal amounts daily, since getting enough from food alone can be nearly impossible.

=> Recommended natural solution to dissolve arterial plaque

Your arteries face a hidden threat: uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (ucMGP), or “plaque protein”.

While active MGP prevents calcification, inactive ucMGP allows calcium to build up in your arterial walls. As ucMGP levels rise, this protein acts like biological glue, causing cholesterol to stick and harden in your arteries. The resulting narrowing and stiffening restricts vital blood flow to your organs.

What makes plaque protein particularly dangerous is its silent progression. By the time symptoms appear, significant damage may have already occurred. However, your body has an incredible defense system – the endothelium, a delicate layer of cells lining your blood vessels that produces nitric oxide, a powerful gas molecule.

Nitric oxide tells your arteries when to relax and expand, ensuring smooth blood flow throughout your body. But because it’s a gas, nitric oxide dissipates quickly, so your body needs to constantly produce more. When plaque protein levels rise, it damages your endothelium, reducing nitric oxide production. This creates a vicious cycle: less nitric oxide means stiffer arteries, which means more plaque buildup, which leads to even less nitric oxide.

This is why the six nutrients I’m about to share are so important.

Each one plays a unique role in supporting your endothelium’s health, boosting nitric oxide production, or helping transform harmful plaque protein into its protective form. By the end of this video, you’ll know exactly how to use these nutrients to help maintain clear, flexible arteries naturally.

Remember that dangerous plaque protein I mentioned? The first and most powerful nutrient that fights it is Vitamin K2 – nature’s calcium traffic controller.

When present in adequate amounts in your body, K2 activates Matrix Gla Protein (MGP), preventing calcium from building up in your arteries and directing it to your bones where it belongs. Even better, it boosts your body’s production of nitric oxide.

The power of K2 isn’t just theory – it’s backed by impressive clinical research. In a groundbreaking study of 243 adults aged 40 to 70, researchers discovered that K2 worked in two critical ways: it reduced harmful inactive MGP in the blood and made arteries more flexible and elastic. Even more exciting, the study showed that K2 actually builds up in arterial walls, providing long-lasting protection for your heart health.

Now, K2 comes in two major forms – MK-4, found in animal products like eggs and butter, and MK-7, found primarily in natto, a fermented soybean food from Japan. Clinical studies have shown MK-7 to be the superior form because it stays in your bloodstream longer and your body can use it more effectively. In fact, the research I mentioned used MenaQ7, a specialized form of MK-7, to achieve these remarkable results.

But here’s the challenge – getting enough MK-7 through diet alone is nearly impossible. While you can find its cousin Vitamin K1 in leafy greens, MK-7 is much harder to come by. Fermented foods like hard cheeses, brie, and sauerkraut contain some MK-7, but their levels are minimal. Natto remains the richest natural source, but its strong taste and slimy texture make it unpalatable for most people outside Japan. In short, food sources simply don’t provide enough MK-7 to match the levels used in successful clinical studies.

Fortunately, there’s a simple way to get all the MK-7 your arteries need without ever having to taste natto. But before I reveal that, let me show you how we can amplify its effects with our second powerful nutrient – beetroot powder.

Related: 7 Nutrients To Remove Calcium Plaque From Your Arteries

Beetroot is one of nature’s best nitric oxide boosters.

While MK-7 helps protect your arterial health, beetroot powder takes this protection to the next level through its rich nitrate content. These natural nitrates convert to nitric oxide in your body, helping blood vessels relax and expand, and increasing blood flow to clear harmful plaque protein from your arteries.

Clinical studies show beetroot can lower reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 6 mmHg and 4 mmHg respectively, with improvements in blood flow and arterial function appearing within just 30 minutes of taking concentrated beetroot extract. It even helps fight inflammation and oxidative stress in your blood vessels.

But here’s the catch – you’d need to eat, or juice, 2 to 3 whole beets every day to get these benefits.

But what if we could enhance these benefits even further? That’s where our third powerful nutrient comes from – a fruit so special it’s been treasured for thousands of years.

The pomegranate’s heart-protecting properties work in a completely different way from MK-7 and beetroot.

When consumed, pomegranate’s compounds are transformed by gut bacteria into urolithins – powerful molecules that protect your cardiovascular system.

The science behind this is stunning. In a groundbreaking year-long study of people with severely blocked neck arteries, those consuming pomegranate juice saw their arterial plaque decrease by up to 30%, while the control group’s blockages worsened by 9%. Even better, pomegranate’s unique compounds help reduce oxidized LDL cholesterol – the dangerous form that sticks to your artery walls.

But here’s where it gets tricky. To get these benefits, you’d need to drink at least one cup of pomegranate juice daily for 12 months – and with its high natural sugar content, it may not be practical for many people. Moreover, some people’s gut bacteria can’t effectively produce those beneficial urolithins, so they miss out on the benefits entirely.

But protecting your arteries requires more than just fighting plaque – we need to ensure strong blood flow throughout your entire cardiovascular system.

Related: Drink one cup daily of this juice to UNCLOG arteries?

That’s where our fourth nutrient comes in: a unique combination of two amino acids, L-citrulline and L-arginine, that work together as natural vasodilators to boost nitric oxide production.

You might wonder why we need both. Many people try L-arginine supplements alone, but here’s the problem: your body breaks down L-arginine so quickly that it loses up to 75% of its effectiveness before reaching your bloodstream, often causing unpleasant side effects like bloating and stomach pain.

That’s why L-citrulline is the superior choice. When consumed, it converts to L-arginine in your kidneys, creating a sustained release of nitric oxide that helps relax blood vessels and improve circulation – providing more usable L-arginine than taking L-arginine supplements directly.

The results speak for themselves. In a clinical study of postmenopausal women with elevated blood pressure, L-citrulline supplementation improved arterial flexibility and reduced blood pressure in just four weeks. But there’s a catch – getting therapeutic amounts from food sources like watermelon would require eating 2 to 4 slices of watermelon daily.

Now, while L-citrulline helps boost nitric oxide production, we need to ensure that nitric oxide stays active in your body long enough to do its job.

Related: Top 7 Vitamins to Increase Blood Flow and Circulation

That’s where our fifth nutrient comes in – Vitamin C.

This powerful antioxidant preserves nitric oxide while producing collagen, the protein that gives arteries their strength and flexibility.

When arteries are under stress from high blood pressure or inflammation, they produce harmful free radicals that can damage the delicate endothelium. Vitamin C protects your arteries by neutralizing these free radicals and maintaining arterial wall integrity. Clinical studies have shown that people with higher vitamin C levels tend to have more flexible arteries and better blood pressure control.

But here’s the challenge – getting optimal amounts for cardiovascular protection requires more than eating an orange or two. While citrus fruits and vegetables provide some vitamin C, you’d need considerably higher amounts to support your heart health effectively.

While Vitamin C protects your arteries from the inside, there’s one more nutrient that takes this protection even further.

Related: The Best Way to Clear Out Your Arteries

Our sixth and final nutrient comes from grape seeds, which contain unique polyphenols that shield your endothelium.

These compounds work like warriors inside your arteries, fighting off harmful plaque protein while supporting healthy blood pressure levels.

The science backs this up. In a key study of middle-aged adults with elevated blood pressure, those taking grape seed extract showed significant improvements in both blood vessel flexibility and blood pressure readings after just 12 weeks, while also protecting against oxidative stress.

So there you have it – six powerful nutrients, each playing a unique role in protecting your heart and arteries. Together, they work synergistically to reduce plaque protein, boost nitric oxide production, and maintain arterial flexibility. Most importantly, they provide comprehensive protection for your entire cardiovascular system.

But as you’ve seen, getting therapeutic amounts of these nutrients through diet alone is nearly impossible. You’d need to eat impractical quantities of natto, beets, pomegranates, watermelon, citrus fruits, and grape seeds daily.

That’s why we’ve developed a simple solution: combining all six nutrients in their optimal amounts in a convenient powder form. Just one daily scoop provides the clinically proven levels of each nutrient – no pills needed.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/3-minerals-to-reduce-and-eliminate-cellulite/,3 Minerals To Reduce and Eliminate Cellulite,"Every woman would love to know how to win the war against cellulite. CNN reports “more than 90 percent of women develop some type of cellulite in their lifetime.”

Creams and potions abound, claiming to get rid of its unsightly appearance, but few live up to their assertions. But what if a large part of the cure really begins on the inside of the body, rather than the outside?

Most experts agree that the dimpled appearance of cellulite occurs due to problems/imbalance in the connective tissue and fat in a person’s body but there are many theories about what may cause this imbalance. It seems that hormones, diet, lifestyle and genetics all play a role but are not absolutes.

Minerals That May Help Get Rid of Cellulite

#1 Phosphorus

Phosphorus can help reduce cellulite because it aids in the healing and repair of tissues and cells. It also helps the body utilize and burn carbohydrates and fats and increases energy. Food sources include salmon, pork, beef, nuts, and pumpkin seeds.

#2 Selenium

As an antioxidant, selenium helps the body to detoxify and also increases youthfulness of the skin. It also stimulates the thyroid gland, thereby increasing metabolism. Chicken, beef, pork, seafood, brazil nuts, and whole wheat bread are good sources of selenium.

#3 Zinc

Like phosphorus, zinc is essential for the renewal of tissues and cells and has antioxidant properties. It also increases metabolism and aids the body in balancing blood sugar, which helps to burn fat.

Zinc deficiency has been found to inhibit the formation of collagen, which is necessary for healthy skin.  Zinc is found in seafood, spinach, wheat germ, lamb, beef, pumpkin seeds, and cashews.

It’s important to remember that these minerals are just a part of an effective anti-cellulite nutrition program.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/7-warning-signs-of-alzheimers-related-memory-loss/,7 Warning Signs of Alzheimer’s-Related Memory Loss,"While early-onset Alzheimer’s disease can strike at any time, Alzheimer’s is most common in adults over the age of 60, affecting as many as 5.1 million adults in the United States.

However, recent research suggests that symptoms can begin appearing far earlier in life, so it’s important to keep track of any changes in your memory, judgment, and other higher brain function. Here are 7 warning signs that might indicate Alzheimer’s-related memory loss.

While brain changes are part of the normal aging cycle, it’s important to talk to your doctor about sudden or severe changes and anything that begins to significantly impact your daily life.

1 – Misplacing Things

 

Younger folks often like to joke about their grandparents putting the car keys in the refrigerator or leaving their glasses in the silverware drawer, but misplacing things – especially in odd places – can be an early sign of Alzheimer’s. While it’s normal to occasionally forget where you put your wallet when you get home, misplacing objects can be worrisome if it’s increasingly frequent, or if you can’t retrace your steps to figure out where you might have put the lost item.

2 – Problems With Decision-Making

 

Poor judgment can be a sign of Alzheimer’s when taken to the extreme. While occasionally spending more money than you should on a big purchase is an unfortunate fact of life, people whose decision-making skills completely and suddenly go out the window, or who begin making decisions out of line with their usual characters, may be exhibiting early Alzheimer’s symptoms.

See also: preventing Alzheimer’s

3 – Issues With Words

This can take a number of forms, from forgetting vocabulary words to struggling to describe abstract thoughts to having difficulty with the physical process of writing. An occasional “tip of the tongue” forgotten word is totally normal, but general communication difficulties may signal a larger problem.

4 – Changes in Sense of Time

Rather than experiencing a nostalgic sense of “where did the time go”, people with Alzheimer’s may completely lose periods of time. Forgetting dates is a small symptom of this, but larger things to be worried about include confusion at the passage of seasons, or not being able to tell how long you’ve been somewhere.

5 – Getting Lost

Many of us have little sense of direction to begin with, especially now that we tend to depend on GPS apps to get us places. However, people beginning to exhibit Alzheimer’s symptoms might get lost in places that they should be familiar with, like their home neighborhood or the area around their place of work.

6 – Repetition

Re-telling the same story now and then tends to happen with age, but constantly repeating the same stories or phrases over and over might indicate larger memory loss. Another form of repetition might be asking the same question repeatedly, even after its been answered multiple times.

7 – Difficulty Completing Tasks

Many tasks come to us naturally with years of repetition, like showering, playing favorite games, or driving to work. People exhibiting signs of Alzheimer’s-related memory loss, however, may have trouble completing tasks that they were formerly able to do with little thought.

CITATIONS",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"December 12, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/why-90-of-people-take-vitamin-d-wrong/,Why 90% of People Take Vitamin D Wrong (And How to Fix It),"Today, I’m revealing these critical mistakes and sharing the exact science-backed methods to make your vitamin D supplements safe and effective. This is especially crucial since nearly half the world’s population suffers from vitamin D deficiency, with rates doubling during winter months and in regions far from the equator. The situation is even more severe for women, who experience 1.3 times higher rates of severe deficiency than men.

Our modern indoor lifestyle is the main culprit, as less time in the sun means less vitamin D production. This is particularly concerning because our bodies have evolved a sophisticated vitamin D production system that relies on sunlight: When UVB rays hit your skin, they convert a molecule called 7-dehydrocholesterol into previtamin D3, which undergoes further processing in the liver and kidneys to become active vitamin D3 (calcitriol). This 8-hour natural process produces vitamin D that remains in your system 2-3 times longer than food sources, with built-in mechanisms to prevent toxicity.

The risk of deficiency increases further for people with darker skin, those living in northern regions, and those who regularly use sunscreen. Medical conditions like IBD, liver disease, certain medications like statins, and even environmental pollutants can interfere with vitamin D absorption and processing. While fatty fish, free-range egg yolks, and UV-exposed mushrooms contain vitamin D, you would need to consume excessive amounts to get adequate vitamin D – making it impractical to rely on diet alone.

Vitamin D plays crucial roles in strengthening your immune system, ensuring proper calcium absorption, and supporting heart and brain health. When levels drop below 50 nmol/L, deficiency can manifest as:

Frequent infections as your immune system weakens
Progressive bone weakness from poor calcium absorption
Chronic muscle weakness and joint pain affecting daily activities
Persistent fatigue and unexplained weight changes
Mood changes, including depression and anxiety
Increased risk of heart disease and blood sugar problems

Related: 12 Bizarre Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency You Need to Know

Now that you understand how your body naturally produces vitamin D, let’s look at three critical mistakes that could be preventing you from getting the full benefits from vitamin D3 supplements.

Mistake #1: Not Getting Enough Magnesium

While your liver and kidneys work to activate vitamin D3, they can’t do this job without sufficient magnesium. This essential mineral, along with copper and iron, is crucial for every step of vitamin D conversion and utilization.

This explains why some people maintain low vitamin D levels despite getting plenty of sun exposure or taking supplements. The more vitamin D you take, the more magnesium your body requires. Studies show that magnesium supplementation can increase vitamin D levels in deficient people but decrease them in those with high levels – helping regulate vitamin D metabolism for optimal balance.

Nearly half of all Americans consume less than the estimated average requirement for magnesium. Several factors can deplete magnesium levels: poor diet, chronic stress, digestive issues like IBD, and medical conditions affecting absorption.

When magnesium levels are low, your body cannot process vitamin D properly, affecting everything from bone health and calcium absorption to cardiovascular health and immune system function.

You can increase your magnesium intake through foods rich in magnesium like spinach and other leafy greens, pumpkin seeds, almonds, cashews, and other nuts and seeds.

However, since modern fruits and vegetables are often nutrient-depleted, consider supplementing with magnesium bisglycinate. This highly bioavailable form is well-absorbed and gentle on the stomach.

Now that we understand how magnesium affects vitamin D processing, let’s look at another crucial nutrient partnership.

Mistake #2: Taking Vitamin D3 Without Vitamin K2

Many people don’t realize that taking vitamin D3 without vitamin K2 could actually be harmful. While vitamin D3 needs magnesium to be processed, it also requires another crucial partner: vitamin K2. These vitamins form a synergistic relationship that ensures calcium ends up strengthening your bones instead of potentially causing problems elsewhere in your body.

Here’s how this partnership works: vitamin D3 helps your intestines absorb calcium and directs it into your bloodstream. However, without adequate vitamin K2, this calcium might not reach its intended destination – your bones and teeth. Instead, it could accumulate in your blood vessels, leading to arterial calcification.

It’s important to understand that while vitamin K2 cannot remove existing calcium deposits from your arteries, it can help slow down their progression. This happens through two important proteins that K2 activates:

Osteocalcin, which helps bind calcium to your bones
Matrix GLA protein (MGP), which helps prevent new calcium deposits in your arteries when properly activated

Vitamin K2 comes in two main forms: MK-4 and MK-7. MK-7 is better absorbed and stays in your blood longer, which leads us to our next crucial mistake in vitamin D3 supplementation: taking vitamin D3 and K2 in the wrong ratio.

Mistake #3: Taking Vitamin D3 and K2 in the Wrong Ratio

While combining vitamin D3 and K2 makes sense, taking them in a pre-mixed supplement can be problematic. Most popular combination supplements contain about 90 micrograms of K2 with 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 – an inadequate amount of K2 for optimal benefits.

Research shows you need 180-360 micrograms of K2 daily to effectively activate MGP in your body. Without adequate K2, MGP remains in its inactive form (ucMGP), leading to increased risk of arterial calcification and chronic kidney disease. Studies show that higher doses of K2 lead to better MGP activation, enhancing your body’s protection against unwanted calcium deposits.

However, trying to get these higher K2 doses from combination supplements creates a dangerous situation: you’d need to take multiple pills, which would mean consuming up to 20,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily – a potentially harmful amount that could raise blood calcium to dangerous levels and damage your kidneys.

You might wonder about getting K2 from food sources instead. To get 180-360 micrograms daily, you would need to eat 2-3 tablespoons of natto (fermented soybeans), the richest source of K2. While natto contains about 200 times more K2 than sauerkraut, it’s rarely consumed outside Japan due to its strong flavor and slimy texture. Other sources include fermented foods like kimchi and aged cheeses, or animal products like organ meats, egg yolks, and dark chicken meat – but these contain much smaller amounts.

The solution is simple: take vitamin D3 and K2 supplements separately. This allows you to get the optimal dose of each vitamin without risking the side effects of excessive vitamin D3, which can include dizziness, shortness of breath, and elevated blood calcium levels. By taking them separately, you can maintain the recommended 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 while getting the full 180-360 micrograms of K2 your body needs.

However, there is an even better and cheaper solution.

Before I talk about this, let’s recap the three critical mistakes in vitamin D3 supplementation.

First, overlooking magnesium prevents proper vitamin D activation in your body, as this mineral is essential for every conversion step. Second, taking vitamin D3 without adequate K2 can lead to improper calcium distribution, potentially causing arterial calcification instead of strengthening bones. Finally, using combination supplements typically provides insufficient K2 (90 micrograms) relative to vitamin D3 (5,000 IU), while you actually need 180-360 micrograms of K2 for optimal benefits.

The obvious solution is to supplement with vitamin D3 and K2 separately while ensuring adequate magnesium intake for proper absorption and utilization.

Let me ask you a question: What if you could get vitamin D3 and K2 in the correct ratio from a single supplement? What if this natural solution provides up to 800% better absorption than traditional vitamin D3 and K2 supplements? What if it also costs less than purchasing the supplements separately? Would you be interested in learning more?

Here’s how this revolutionary supplement works. Traditional vitamin D supplements face two major problems: they are unprotected from stomach acid destruction, and their particles are too large to pass through intestinal walls. These issues can greatly reduce their effectiveness.

This advanced formulation solves both issues through a sophisticated protection system. The vitamin D3 is first encased in micelles—protective barriers that shield it from stomach acid. These micelles are then wrapped in liposomes, made from fats (phospholipids) that match your cell membranes, making the nutrients easily recognizable and absorbable by your body.

This dual-layer protection ensures your vitamin D3 reaches your bloodstream intact and ready for use. This results in up to 800% better absorption compared to traditional supplements and delivers both vitamin D3 and K2 in the optimal ratio your body needs.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/they-lied-to-you-about-this-common-healthy-ingredient-for-100-years/,They Lied to You About This Common ‘Healthy’ Ingredient for 100 Years,"What if I told you that one of the most common “healthy” ingredients in your kitchen is actually making you sick? This seemingly innocent substance is hiding in almost everything you eat, and food companies have been deceiving the public about its safety for over a century[5]. Every time you consume processed foods, dine at restaurants, or even reach for “healthy” snacks, you’re unknowingly ingesting a substance that’s silently undermining your health.

The most shocking part? This ingredient didn’t even exist until the 1900s[4]. Yet somehow, through clever marketing and industry influence, it found its way into virtually every processed food on supermarket shelves. It’s in your morning granola, your salad dressing, your favorite snacks, and even in products marketed as “health foods.”

The deception runs deep. While this ingredient is marketed as heart-healthy and essential for a balanced diet, mounting scientific evidence tells a completely different story[1]. What makes this revelation particularly disturbing is how this ingredient became so deeply embedded in our food supply without proper long-term safety studies[6].

The ingredient in question? Industrial seed oils – more commonly known as “vegetable oils.” These include canola, soybean, corn, cottonseed, and sunflower oils[2]. Despite their natural-sounding names, there’s nothing natural about how these oils are produced or how they interact with our bodies.

The manufacturing process alone should raise alarm bells. These oils undergo an intense industrial process involving extreme heat, chemical solvents, and bleaching agents that strip away any semblance of natural nutrients[3]. The result is a highly processed substance that bears little resemblance to anything found in nature. What’s left is a product your body was never designed to handle in large quantities[6].

The danger lies in their molecular composition. These industrial oils are packed with omega-6 fatty acids, which in excessive amounts trigger inflammation throughout your body[7]. While we need some omega-6s, the modern diet, thanks to these oils, contains up to 20 times more than what’s healthy[1]. This isn’t just a minor inconvenience – it’s a serious health concern that’s been linked to numerous chronic conditions.

The inflammation caused by these oils isn’t just minor irritation. Research has connected high consumption of industrial seed oils to alarming health issues including autoimmune diseases, cognitive decline, and heart problems[1][7]. The evidence is so compelling that many health experts now consider these oils to be one of the most harmful components of the modern diet.

The good news is that avoiding these oils is possible, though it requires vigilance. Start by checking food labels carefully – if you see any industrial seed oils listed, consider that a red flag[1]. Instead, opt for traditional, minimally processed fats like olive oil, avocado oil, or butter. When cooking at home, use these natural fats that humans have consumed safely for thousands of years[7].

The food industry’s century-long campaign to convince us that industrial seed oils are healthy may be one of the most successful marketing deceptions in history[8]. But now that you know the truth, you can make informed decisions about what goes into your body. Your health depends on it.

Remember, real food doesn’t require a marketing campaign or industrial processing. Nature has already provided us with all the healthy fats we need – no chemical solvents required[6].

https://dailyhealthpost.com/drinks-that-improve-blood-flow-and-prevent-varicose-veins/,7 Science-Backed Drinks That Improve Blood Flow and Prevent Varicose Veins,"Poor circulation is a widespread health concern that manifests through various uncomfortable symptoms including tired legs, calf pain, tingling sensations, numbness, swelling, varicose veins, skin discoloration, slow-healing ulcers, weak nails and hair, cold extremities, and muscle cramps due to insufficient oxygen supply. While these symptoms can be concerning, nature provides us with several beneficial beverages that can help improve circulation naturally.

Understanding Poor Circulation

Before diving into the remedies, it’s crucial to understand that poor circulation often stems from underlying health conditions. Risk factors include obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, and high blood pressure – all of which can damage blood vessels and impair proper circulation. A comprehensive approach to improving circulation should address these root causes while incorporating beneficial drinks into your daily routine.

Powerful Beverages for Better Blood Flow
1. Beetroot Juice: The Nitrate Powerhouse

Beetroot juice stands out as a premier choice for improving circulation thanks to its high nitrate content. These compounds transform into nitric oxide in the body, promoting blood vessel dilation and relaxation. For optimal benefits, consume between 250-500ml daily. However, those with low blood pressure should exercise caution, as beetroot juice can further lower blood pressure levels. It’s also worth noting that using antiseptic mouthwash might reduce the effectiveness of nitrates, as beneficial oral bacteria are necessary for converting nitrates into nitric oxide.

2. Hibiscus Tea: Nature’s Vasodilator

Hibiscus tea offers a double benefit through its flavonoid content and natural diuretic properties. The flavonoids promote blood vessel dilation while helping to reduce blood pressure. For best results, enjoy 1-2 cups daily, but avoid consumption close to bedtime due to its diuretic effects. Those taking blood pressure or diabetes medications should consult their healthcare provider, as hibiscus can enhance these medications’ effects.

3. Lemon Balm Tea: The Calming Circulation Booster

This soothing tea contains rosmarinic acid, which naturally promotes vasodilation and supports healthy blood flow. A daily intake of 1-2 cups can provide optimal benefits. However, pregnant women should avoid this tea, and those taking sedative medications should consult their healthcare provider first.

4. Garlic Tea: The Ancient Circulation Remedy

Garlic’s active compound, allicin, helps prevent blood clots and improves blood flow. The recommended daily intake is 2-4 grams of garlic. This powerful ingredient also shows promising results in controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels. However, those taking blood-thinning medications, particularly coumarin anticoagulants, should exercise caution and consult their healthcare provider.

5. Horsetail Tea: The Vein Strengthener

Rich in silica, horsetail tea strengthens blood vessels and enhances cardiovascular health. While the standard dosage is 1-2 cups daily, this tea is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. The silica content makes it particularly effective for supporting vascular integrity.

6. Swiss Lemonade: The Citrus Solution

This isn’t your ordinary lemonade. Swiss lemonade, made with both lemon peel and pulp, provides unique circulatory benefits. The peel contains two crucial compounds – diosmin and hesperidin – which significantly improve circulation. Additionally, the vitamin C content supports blood vessel integrity and collagen synthesis, essential for maintaining healthy blood vessels.

7. Pineapple and Ginger Juice: The Anti-inflammatory Duo

This powerful combination works through multiple mechanisms. Pineapple contains bromelain, which provides anti-inflammatory benefits, while ginger acts as a vasodilator to improve circulation. However, diabetic individuals should be cautious with this option due to pineapple’s higher glycemic index.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/why-weight-loss-is-making-you-gain-weight/,Why Weight Loss Is Making You Gain Weight: The Science Explained,"Are you tired of the endless cycle of dieting and weight gain? Here’s something counterintuitive: obsessing over weight loss might be exactly what’s preventing you from achieving your goals. The secret lies not in counting calories, but in understanding and stabilizing your glucose levels.

The Truth About Weight Loss

The weight loss industry profits from selling quick fixes and temporary solutions. These approaches ignore how our bodies actually work and lead to frustrating cycles of loss and regain[1]. The real solution lies in understanding our body’s energy processing system.

The Glucose-Weight Connection

Your body’s relationship with glucose is the key to weight management[1]. When blood sugar levels remain stable, three powerful changes occur:

1. Craving Control
The glucose roller coaster isn’t just uncomfortable – it’s what drives food cravings. Stable blood sugar naturally reduces the urge to snack and overeat[3].

2. Natural Appetite Regulation
Balanced blood sugar creates balanced hunger hormones, leading to genuine hunger signals instead of false alarms from blood sugar crashes[1].

3. Enhanced Fat Burning
A stable glucose environment allows your body to efficiently access and burn stored fat for energy[1].

Understanding Insulin’s Role

Insulin acts as your body’s fat-storage hormone. High insulin levels lock your body in fat-storage mode[4]. By maintaining stable glucose levels, you naturally lower insulin, enabling your body to access stored fat for energy. This metabolic flexibility is crucial for sustainable weight management[1].

Simple Science-Backed Strategies

Start with Vegetables
Begin meals with fiber-rich vegetables to slow glucose absorption and increase satiety[7].

Time Your Sweets
Consume desserts after main meals to minimize blood sugar spikes[9].

Move After Meals
Take a short walk after eating to improve glucose processing[6].

Prioritize Protein
Start your day with protein to establish stable blood sugar levels[9].

Proven Results

Research following 2,700 people using these glucose-stabilizing principles showed:

90% experienced reduced hunger
89% had fewer cravings
77% reported increased energy
38% achieved natural weight loss[10]
The Path Forward

Stop fighting your body with restrictive diets and impossible rules. Work with your biology by focusing on glucose stability[7]. When you align with your body’s natural processes, weight management becomes effortless.

Remember: Your body is not your enemy – it’s your most sophisticated ally. By supporting its natural processes, weight management becomes a natural byproduct of optimal health rather than an endless struggle[1].

https://dailyhealthpost.com/artery-cleaning-foods/,Artery-Cleaning Foods: The One Meal Doctors Won’t Tell You About,"Could the secret to cleaner arteries be found in foods that mainstream medicine often warns against? Recent scientific research involving germ-free mice has revealed a fascinating connection between gut health and arterial cleanliness that might change everything you thought you knew about heart health.

The Gut-Heart Connection

The relationship between your gut microbiome and cardiovascular health is more profound than previously thought. Scientists have discovered that mice lacking gut bacteria develop significant inflammation throughout their bodies, particularly in their arterial walls. This groundbreaking research highlights how crucial our gut bacteria are for maintaining healthy arteries.

Understanding Arterial Health

Calcium buildup in arteries is a major concern for cardiovascular health, leading to hardening and dangerous plaque formation. However, vitamin K2 emerges as a crucial nutrient in preventing this calcification. What’s particularly interesting is that this vital nutrient is produced by beneficial gut bacteria, creating a direct link between gut health and arterial cleanliness.

The K2 Revolution

While many people focus on consuming vitamin K1 through leafy greens, the real hero is vitamin K2. Your gut bacteria can convert K1 to K2, but this conversion is quite inefficient in humans and requires specific conditions.

The process depends on having specific bacterial strains like Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacillus in your gut. Additionally, the conversion requires proper fat absorption since vitamin K is fat-soluble, needing bile salts and pancreatic enzymes for proper absorption. Even under ideal conditions, only 5-25% of K1 intake is converted to K2.

This is why many people may be K2 deficient despite consuming plenty of leafy greens, as the conversion process is only possible in a very healthy gut – something few modern humans have. For optimal K2 levels, it’s more reliable to consume K2 directly through fermented foods and animal products from grass-fed sources, rather than relying solely on bacterial conversion.

Take this form of vitamin K2 to clear out arterial plaque

The Ultimate Artery-Cleansing Meal

Three powerful foods work synergistically to support arterial health:

1. Brie Cheese

Naturally rich in K2 through fermentation
Contains beneficial probiotics
Provides essential minerals

2. Fatty Pork Sausage

Contains up to five times more K2 than conventional meats
Provides necessary fats for nutrient absorption
Rich in essential proteins

3. Sauerkraut

Packed with live beneficial bacteria
Enhances gut microbiome diversity
Supports natural K2 production

Maximizing Benefits

To optimize arterial health, consider these key points:

Combine vitamin K2 with vitamin D3 in a ratio of 100 micrograms of K2 for every 10,000 IU of vitamin D3
Consume these foods regularly as part of a balanced diet
Focus on fermented foods to support gut health
Taking Action

Start incorporating this powerful trio into your weekly meal planning. The combination of fermented dairy, quality meat, and probiotic-rich vegetables creates a perfect symphony for arterial health. Remember, supporting your gut health isn’t just about digestion – it’s about creating a foundation for overall cardiovascular wellness.

By making these dietary changes, you’re not just feeding yourself; you’re nourishing the beneficial bacteria that play a crucial role in keeping your arteries clean and healthy. Your heart will thank you for it.

Note: Always consult with your healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet, especially if you’re on blood-thinning medications or have specific health conditions.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-warning-signs-your-heart-is-secretly-changing-during-menopause/,5 Warning Signs Your Heart Is Secretly Changing During Menopause,"Menopause marks a significant transition in a woman’s life, affecting far more than just reproductive health. While hot flashes and mood changes are widely discussed, the impact on heart health often goes unnoticed[1][3].

Heart Palpitations and Racing Heart

During menopause, many women experience unexpected heart palpitations and episodes of racing heartbeat. These sensations, while alarming, are typically a natural response to declining estrogen levels[4][7]. You might feel your heart skipping beats or doing somersaults, particularly during hot flashes. While usually benign, these symptoms deserve attention, especially if they become frequent or severe[4].

Blood Pressure Fluctuations

The menopausal transition often brings changes in blood pressure readings. As estrogen levels decrease, blood vessels lose some of their natural elasticity[1][6]. This reduced flexibility can lead to elevated blood pressure, placing additional strain on your cardiovascular system[6].

Shifting Cholesterol Patterns

Menopause typically triggers significant changes in cholesterol profiles. Women often experience an increase in LDL (low-density lipoprotein) – the “bad” cholesterol – while HDL (high-density lipoprotein) – the “good” cholesterol – tends to decrease[6][8]. This shift can elevate the risk of heart disease, making dietary choices increasingly important[3].

Changes in Body Fat Distribution

One of the most noticeable changes during menopause affects body composition. The decrease in estrogen often leads to increased fat accumulation around the midsection[3][9]. This isn’t merely a cosmetic concern – visceral fat around internal organs can significantly impact cardiovascular health and increase the risk of heart-related complications[6].

Blood Clot Risk

Perhaps the most serious cardiovascular change during menopause is the increased risk of blood clots[1][2]. This elevated risk requires attention and awareness, as blood clots can lead to serious cardiovascular events if left unmonitored[2].

Taking Control of Your Heart Health

To maintain optimal heart health during menopause, consider implementing these essential strategies[3][9]:

Engage in regular cardiovascular exercise
Adopt a heart-healthy diet rich in whole grains and vegetables
Monitor blood pressure and cholesterol levels regularly
Practice stress-reduction techniques like yoga or meditation
Schedule regular check-ups with your healthcare provider
The Path Forward

Remember that menopause is a natural life transition, not a medical condition[3]. Understanding these cardiovascular changes empowers you to take proactive steps in protecting your heart health[2][9]. By staying informed and implementing healthy lifestyle choices, you can navigate this transition while maintaining optimal heart health[3].

If you experience concerning symptoms or have questions about your heart health during menopause, don’t hesitate to consult with your healthcare provider[4]. They can provide personalized guidance and help monitor your cardiovascular health throughout this important life phase[9].

Stay proactive about your heart health – it’s never too early or too late to start taking better care of your cardiovascular system during menopause and beyond[2][9].

https://dailyhealthpost.com/the-hidden-truth-why-colon-cancer-is-rising-among-20-30-year-olds/,The Hidden Truth: Why Colon Cancer Is Rising Among 20-30 Year Olds,"At 25, Sarah thought her persistent stomach pain was just stress from her new job. At 28, she was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. Her story isn’t an anomaly – it’s part of a frightening new trend. Someone born in the 1990s is twice as likely to develop colorectal cancer compared to those born in the 1950s[2]. Even more alarming is the staggering 333% surge in cases among young adults in just two decades[1]. This isn’t just another health statistic – it’s a wake-up call for an entire generation that thought they were too young to worry about colon cancer.

Why This Generation Faces Higher Risks

Our modern lifestyle has created a perfect storm of risk factors. The combination of ultra-processed foods, extended screen time, and sedentary habits has dramatically increased our vulnerability[4]. Rising obesity rates among young adults, coupled with significant changes in gut microbiome due to modern diets, create an environment where colon cancer can thrive[4]. Environmental pollutants further compound these risks, making our generation particularly susceptible[4].

The Changing Landscape of Colon Cancer

What was once considered an “older person’s disease” has evolved into a serious threat for younger adults. Colon cancer now ranks as the leading cause of cancer deaths in men under 50 and stands second only to breast cancer in women of the same age group[5][6]. This dramatic shift demands a complete reimagining of how we approach cancer prevention and awareness.

Critical Warning Signs for Young Adults

Commonly Overlooked Symptoms
Young people often mistake serious warning signs for minor health issues. Persistent belly cramps might be dismissed as stress, and chronic fatigue attributed to a busy lifestyle[7]. Unexplained weight changes, rectal bleeding (often misidentified as hemorrhoids), and changes in bowel habits deserve immediate attention, not rationalization[7].

Signs Requiring Immediate Medical Attention
Certain symptoms should trigger immediate medical consultation:

Blood in stool persisting beyond 48 hours[7]
Unrelenting abdominal pain[7]
Unexplained weight loss[7]
Chronic changes in bowel movements[7]
Consistently narrow, pencil-thin stools[7]
Proactive Prevention for Young Adults

Traditional screening guidelines are evolving, but don’t wait for symptoms to act. Consider early screening if you have family history[8]. Focus on preventive measures: embrace a fiber-rich diet, minimize processed foods, maintain regular exercise, and limit alcohol consumption[3]. Most importantly, take digestive issues seriously and seek prompt medical attention when concerns arise.

Your Age Is Not Your Shield

The myth that youth provides protection against colon cancer must be dispelled. This disease is becoming more aggressive and striking earlier than ever before[9]. Understanding and acting on warning signs could mean the difference between early detection and late-stage diagnosis[10]. Remember: in today’s world, age offers no immunity against colon cancer, making vigilance and early detection crucial for survival.

An astonishing 84% of Americans regularly consume a breakfast duo that may be significantly increasing their risk of cardiovascular problems.

The Culprits on Your Breakfast Table

The seemingly innocent combination of cereal and orange juice has emerged as a potential threat to cardiovascular health. While these breakfast staples might appear nutritious on the surface, their combined impact on our bodies tells a different story.

The Cereal Conundrum

Your morning bowl of cereal harbors a concerning secret. With up to 29 grams of carbohydrates per serving, most cereals pack a significant carbohydrate punch. What’s more concerning is that many people pour well beyond the recommended serving size, multiplying their carbohydrate intake. Even varieties marketed as “heart-healthy” can cause dangerous blood sugar spikes.

The Orange Juice Dilemma

That glass of orange juice alongside your cereal isn’t doing your health any favors. A single 8-ounce serving contains 26 grams of carbohydrates. Unlike whole oranges, juice lacks essential fiber, leading to rapid sugar absorption. This combination can elevate blood sugar levels above 140 mg/dL, entering a danger zone for arterial damage.

Understanding the Impact

The science behind this harmful combination is clear. When consumed together, these foods trigger a cascade of effects in your body: dramatic blood sugar spikes, followed by insulin surges, leading to increased arterial inflammation. Over time, this pattern contributes to plaque accumulation and arterial hardening.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/eating-bread-before-your-meal-does-this-to-your-body/,WARNING: Eating Bread Before Your Meal Does THIS to Your Body (Not What You Think!),"Picture this: you’re seated at your favorite restaurant, and the server brings out a basket of warm, freshly baked bread with creamy butter. While this complimentary starter may seem like a delightful beginning to your dining experience, science suggests it could be undermining your health and energy levels.

The Science Behind Pre-Meal Bread

The moment you bite into that warm dinner roll, your body begins a complex metabolic process. Bread, particularly refined varieties, quickly breaks down into glucose molecules in your digestive system. This rapid conversion triggers an immediate and significant spike in your blood sugar levels, setting off a chain reaction that affects your entire meal experience.

The Blood Sugar Rollercoaster

The Initial Spike
When bread is consumed on an empty stomach, your body responds with a dramatic increase in blood glucose. However, what goes up must come down. Approximately 60-90 minutes after eating that bread, you experience a sharp decline in blood sugar levels.

The Consequences
This blood sugar crash manifests in two significant ways:

An unexpected return of hunger, despite having just started your meal
Strong cravings for sweet foods and desserts

It’s no coincidence that restaurants often present their dessert menus during this crucial window when your blood sugar is plummeting and your willpower is at its weakest.

Smart Dining Strategies

To maintain stable blood sugar levels and enjoy your dining experience to the fullest, consider implementing these practical approaches:

Before the Meal

Politely request that bread not be brought to your table
Focus on starting your meal with vegetables or protein-rich foods

During the Meal
If bread is already served, exercise patience and save it for later in your meal. When consumed after proteins and vegetables, the carbohydrates in bread are absorbed more slowly due to the presence of other foods in your digestive system.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/7-powerful-foods-for-autophagy/,7 Powerful Foods for Autophagy: Unlock Your Body’s Self-Cleaning Mode,"Your body possesses an incredible natural cleaning mechanism called autophagy, a process that recycles damaged cell components and promotes cellular renewal. While fasting remains the most potent trigger for autophagy, certain foods can enhance this vital process. Let’s explore the most effective foods that can support your body’s cellular cleanup.

Understanding Autophagy

Autophagy, meaning “self-eating” in Greek, is your body’s sophisticated recycling system. This process becomes particularly active during fasting periods, typically starting at 17 hours and reaching its peak at 72 hours. However, you can support this natural process through strategic food choices.

Top Autophagy-Promoting Foods

Beverages
Black coffee leads the pack as the most powerful autophagy-promoting drink. For those seeking alternatives, green tea and Earl Grey tea with bergamot offer similar benefits while providing diverse flavor profiles.

Essential Oils
Two oils stand out for their autophagy-enhancing properties: MCT oil and extra virgin olive oil. For maximum benefit, try adding MCT oil to your morning coffee – this combination can significantly amplify the autophagy response.

Antioxidant-Rich Berries
Blueberries and strawberries play a crucial role in stimulating autophagy. Their high antioxidant content makes them ideal choices for breaking a fast while maintaining the cellular cleanup process.

Medicinal Mushrooms
Chaga and reishi mushrooms are powerful allies in promoting autophagy. These functional fungi can be consumed either as teas or supplements, offering flexibility in how you incorporate them into your routine.

Beneficial Spices
Turmeric and ginger deserve special attention for their autophagy-promoting properties. These versatile spices can be incorporated into your diet through cooking or enjoyed as therapeutic teas.

Omega-Rich Fish
Wild-caught fatty fish, including salmon, black cod, and sardines, provide essential omega-3s that support the autophagy process. Always opt for wild-caught varieties to ensure maximum nutritional benefit.

Cruciferous Powerhouses
Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli sprouts contain sulforaphane, a compound that enhances cellular cleanup and supports overall cellular health.

Optimal Daily Protocol

To maximize autophagy benefits, consider this daily food schedule:

Morning: Start with black coffee combined with MCT oil
Mid-morning: Break your fast with fresh berries
Afternoon: Enjoy a cup of ginger tea
Evening: Prepare a dinner featuring wild salmon, sautéed mushrooms, and steamed cruciferous vegetables, seasoned with turmeric

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vegetable-oil-may-increase-cancer-spread/,"This Vegetable Oil May Increase Cancer Spread, Study Finds","In a groundbreaking scientific discovery, researchers have uncovered a concerning link between a common cooking oil and cancer progression. Let’s get into what you need to know.

The Discovery

Scientists at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Barcelona have made a startling finding – palmitic acid, a fatty acid commonly found in palm oil, may increase the likelihood of cancer spreading throughout the body[1]. This discovery is particularly significant since palm oil is an ingredient found in numerous everyday products, from chocolate to toothpaste and shampoo[1].

The Science Explained

When cancer spreads through the body – a process called metastasis – it becomes much more dangerous. In fact, metastasis is responsible for approximately 90% of cancer-related deaths worldwide, claiming around nine million lives annually[1].

The research, published in Nature[3], revealed that palmitic acid can actually alter the cancer genome[1]. Even more concerning, these effects persist long after exposure to the fatty acid has ended[1]. The study showed that cancer cells exposed to palmitic acid developed the ability to form neural networks around tumors, making it easier for cancer to spread[1].

Important Distinctions

Not all fatty acids show this effect. The researchers found that other common fatty acids, such as:

Oleic acid (found in olive oil)
Linoleic acid (found in flaxseeds)
Did not promote cancer spread[1].
Future Hope

Scientists are already working on developing new therapies to interrupt this process, with clinical trials potentially beginning within the next few years[1]. However, researchers caution against making immediate dietary changes without proper medical guidance[2].

https://dailyhealthpost.com/3-silent-killers-that-make-strokes-deadly/,3 Silent Killers That Make Strokes Deadly (Warning Signs),"Every 40 seconds, someone in America has a stroke. But what’s more frightening are the silent killers that could be putting you at risk right now. Today, we’re exposing the three deadliest stroke risk factors and their warning signs that you can’t afford to ignore.

Silent Killer #1: The Silent Pressure

The first silent killer is high blood pressure, often called ‘the silent assassin’ because you might feel perfectly fine while it’s damaging your blood vessels. Warning signs include:

Persistent headaches, particularly in the morning
Irregular heartbeat
Vision problems
But here’s the scary part – many people have no symptoms at all. That’s why it’s called silent.

Prevention Tips:

Avoid or limit added sugar and salt from processed foods
Exercise for 30 minutes, 5 days a week
Practice stress management through meditation or yoga
Monitor your blood pressure regularly at home
Silent Killer #2: The Hidden Heart Problem

The second silent killer is atrial fibrillation, or AFib. This sneaky heart condition can be lurking without your knowledge. Watch for these warning signs:

Heart palpitations that feel like a fluttering in your chest
Unexplained fatigue
Shortness of breath during normal activities
AFib can create blood clots that travel to your brain, triggering a devastating stroke.

Prevention Tips:

Limit alcohol and caffeine consumption
Maintain a healthy sleep schedule
Consider a Mediterranean diet rich in omega-3s
Stay hydrated with 8 glasses of water daily
Silent Killer #3: The Sweet Danger

The third silent killer is diabetes. Your body’s inability to properly process sugar doesn’t just affect your energy levels – it’s secretly damaging your blood vessels. Key warning signs include:

Increased thirst and frequent urination
Unexplained weight loss
Blurred vision
Slow-healing wounds

Prevention Tips:

Keep your A1C below 7%
Choose low-glycemic foods
Time your meals consistently
Get regular physical activity
Lifestyle Changes That Protect Against All Three

Here are powerful lifestyle changes that help prevent all three silent killers:

Maintain a healthy weight
Quit smoking or never start
Limit alcohol to one drink per day
Get 7-9 hours of quality sleep
Eat an anti-inflammatory diet rich in fruits, vegetables, grass-fed meat, and wild-caught seafood
Take Action

These silent killers become deadly because they often go undetected until it’s too late. But here’s the good news – knowing these warning signs could save your life or the life of someone you love.

Don’t become another statistic. If you recognize any of these warning signs, see your doctor immediately. Remember, these silent killers are preventable and treatable – but only if you act now.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 19, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/these-common-medications-are-more-dangerous-than-you-think/,These Common Medications Are More Dangerous Than You Think,"Every day, millions of Americans reach for their medicine cabinets, believing they’re making a safe choice. But what many don’t realize is that these common medications can hide deadly secrets.

Think about this: You’re more likely to die from an accidental opioid overdose than in a car crash. That’s not just a statistic – it’s a wake-up call.

Let’s talk about opioids first. These powerful painkillers work by attaching to receptors in your brain, blocking pain and creating feelings of pleasure. Sounds good, right? But here’s the dangerous part: even slightly higher doses can slow your breathing and heart rate to lethal levels.

But it’s not just opioids we need to worry about. Many prescription medications can deplete your body of essential nutrients, with some experts estimating that up to 30% of pharmaceutical side effects come from these hidden nutrient deficiencies.

Take fentanyl, for example. This painkiller is many times more potent than morphine or oxycodone. While it’s excellent for surgical procedures, its potency makes it incredibly dangerous if misused. Just combining it with certain medications or alcohol can trigger a deadly cascade of respiratory failure.

Before you reach for that pill bottle, remember:

Only take medications prescribed by your doctor
Never share prescriptions with others
Always follow dosing instructions exactly
Discuss any concerns about side effects with your healthcare provider

One pill can change everything. And sometimes, that change can be permanent. Stay informed. Stay safe. Your life might depend on it.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/nicotine-free-vapes-cause-lung-damage/,Warning: Nicotine-Free Vapes Cause Lung Damage – Here’s What Scientists Found,"Is vaping without nicotine really as safe as we thought? In this post, we’ll look at an important topic that might surprise many: the dangers of vaping, even when using nicotine-free products. A groundbreaking study has uncovered that these seemingly harmless vape fluids can still cause significant harm to lung health.

The Unexpected Discovery

A team of researchers has identified a specific protein called ARF6 that increases in the lungs during vaping. This elevation leads to oxidative stress, inflammation, and damage to blood vessels – effects previously thought to be primarily associated with nicotine. These findings, published in Microvascular Research, reveal serious risks even in nicotine-free e-cigarettes.

The Vaping Epidemic

The popularity of e-cigarettes has seen a dramatic surge, particularly in the UK, where user numbers have jumped from 700,000 in 2012 to nearly five million today. While 39 countries have banned nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, this has led to an unintended consequence: a significant increase in nicotine-free vaping, especially among young people.

Breaking Down the Research

Methodology
The study, conducted by Anglia Ruskin University’s Biomedical Science Research group, examined three watermelon-flavored vapes with varying nicotine levels:

0mg nicotine
10mg nicotine
20mg nicotine per 2ml solution

Key Findings
The results were alarming. Even nicotine-free vape fluid caused substantial damage to lung cells, including:

Oxidative stress
Heightened inflammation
Blood vessel deterioration
The ARF6 Factor

The discovery of ARF6’s role represents a significant breakthrough. While this protein was previously known for its vascular function, its connection to vaping-induced lung injuries opens new understanding about how these devices affect our respiratory health.

Expert Perspective

Dr. Havovi Chichger’s findings challenge a common misconception: that nicotine-free means risk-free. The research demonstrates that removing nicotine doesn’t eliminate the potential for harm to lung tissue.

The Implications

This research serves as a crucial wake-up call for both users and healthcare providers. The evidence suggests that all forms of vaping, regardless of nicotine content, warrant careful consideration. As we continue to understand the long-term effects of vaping, one thing becomes clear: the absence of nicotine doesn’t guarantee safety.

The message is straightforward – when it comes to vaping, we need to look beyond just nicotine content and consider the broader health implications of all e-cigarette products.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-high-cortisol/,8 Signs of High Cortisol: Understanding Your Body’s Stress Signals,"Cortisol, commonly known as the stress hormone, plays a vital role in our body’s response to stress and influences numerous physiological processes. It serves as nature’s built-in alarm system, working with certain parts of your brain to control mood, motivation, and fear[4]. While essential for regulating metabolism, immune response, and blood pressure, chronically elevated cortisol levels can lead to significant health complications[3].

Understanding Cortisol’s Role

Produced by the adrenal glands, cortisol serves as a master regulator in our body’s stress response system. The hormone is crucial for metabolism, immune functioning, and is one of the key hormones in the body’s response to acute and chronic stress[3]. In short spurts, cortisol can boost immunity by limiting inflammation, but chronic stress can lead to elevated cortisol levels that open the door for more inflammation[1].

Sign #1: Muscle Loss and Fat Distribution

One of the earliest indicators of elevated cortisol is muscle loss, particularly noticeable in the thighs and buttocks. This occurs due to cortisol’s catabolic effects, where the hormone breaks down muscle tissue to release amino acids for energy during stressful periods. Simultaneously, there’s often an increase in belly fat accumulation, as cortisol promotes fat storage in the abdominal area. This pattern is especially prevalent among older men, who may already experience natural muscle mass decline due to aging[4]. This pattern is especially notable as it includes rounding of the face and thinning of the arms and legs[5].

Related: How to Fight Sarcopenia (Muscle Loss Due to Aging)

Sign #2: Sleep Disruptions

Poor sleep has been linked to higher cortisol levels[6]. A telltale sign of high cortisol is the tendency to wake between 2 and 3 AM. This disruption prevents the body from achieving deeper sleep stages, leading to restless nights. Many individuals find themselves lying awake with an overactive mind, unable to quiet their thoughts about daily stresses or future concerns. This creates a vicious cycle where sleep disturbances lead to increased cortisol production, further exacerbating sleep problems. When cortisol levels remain chronically elevated, it can lead to significant sleep disturbances and extreme tiredness[5].

Related: Top 10 Tips to Sleep Better (Fix Insomnia)

Sign #3: Blood Pressure Changes

High cortisol levels significantly impact blood pressure, especially during stressful situations. As part of the body’s fight or flight response, cortisol release triggers increased heart rate and constricted blood vessels. When this becomes chronic, it can result in sustained high blood pressure, potentially leading to serious long-term risks including heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage[4].

Sign #4: Compromised Immune Function

Elevated cortisol levels suppress immune function by decreasing lymphocytes — the white blood cells that help fight off infection. This makes the body more susceptible to viruses, including the common cold and cold sores[1]. This immunosuppressive effect also increases vulnerability to other infections, including shingles and respiratory illnesses. The combination of high cortisol and disrupted sleep patterns creates an environment where viruses can more easily reactivate, leading to frequent outbreaks.

Sign #5: Respiratory Issues

Cortisol plays a crucial role in controlling lung inflammation and maintaining proper respiratory function. However, chronically elevated levels can lead to cortisol resistance, diminishing its effectiveness in managing inflammation. This can result in increased airway inflammation and susceptibility to respiratory issues, potentially contributing to conditions like asthma and COPD. This is because physical stress activates both the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous systems, affecting multiple body systems including respiratory function[2]. Chronic stress can lead to various physiological effects, including altered immune-inflammatory responses[2].

Sign #6: Anxiety Symptoms

Anxiety is a common manifestation of high cortisol, characterized by persistent worry, restlessness, and difficulty concentrating. This heightened state keeps the body in constant fight or flight mode, leading to physical symptoms such as muscle tension, rapid heartbeat, and shallow breathing. The continuous state of alertness can be both physically and mentally exhausting. Chronically elevated cortisol levels can have negative effects on brain functioning and mood, leading to depression, anxiety, and irritability[3]. People with depression or PTSD often show an impaired ability to regulate cortisol production[3].

Sign #7: Digestive Problems

High cortisol affects various bodily processes, including metabolism and digestive function, particularly contributing to acid reflux. During stress response, the body prioritizes other functions over digestion[2]. The hormone can disrupt normal stomach acid production and slow digestion, increasing the likelihood of acid reflux by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter. This creates a cycle where digestive discomfort leads to increased anxiety and further cortisol production.

Related: 3 Ways to Stop Acid Reflux Naturally

Sign #8: Additional Physical Manifestations

Beyond the primary symptoms, high cortisol can cause various other issues, including:

Dizziness due to hormonal imbalances affecting blood pressure
Insulin resistance, increasing diabetes risk
Skin problems, such as easy bruising, acne or thinning skin
Bone loss by inhibiting bone formation
These symptoms demonstrate cortisol’s widespread impact on multiple body systems[4].
Testing and Management

Doctors can measure cortisol levels through various methods, including blood, urine, and saliva tests. Saliva tests are particularly useful as they can track cortisol’s natural daily fluctuations[7].

Addressing High Cortisol

Managing elevated cortisol levels involves several approaches:

Prioritizing quality sleep
Practicing mindfulness techniques
Engaging in low-intensity physical activity
Making time for social connections
Spending time in nature[6]

By recognizing these signs and taking proactive steps to manage cortisol levels, individuals can work toward better health and overall well-being.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/best-oil-for-cooking/,The Best Oil for Cooking Is?,"Today, let’s get into the heated debate on cooking oils. With so many options available, which ones are the best for your health? And more importantly, which should you avoid? Let’s find out!

When it comes to cooking oils, not all are created equal. Did you know that cooking oils can be classified based on their fat content? There are three main types: saturated fats, monounsaturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats.

Saturated fats are stable even at high temperatures, making them a popular choice for cooking. Monounsaturated fats, while also stable, are best kept at low to medium heat to preserve their health benefits. On the other hand, polyunsaturated fats are unstable and should generally be avoided in cooking.

Now, let’s talk about the best oils for cooking. First on our list is coconut oil. Despite being packed with saturated fats, these are primarily medium-chain triglycerides, which your body uses efficiently rather than storing. Coconut oil is also versatile, with a smoke point of up to 450 degrees, making it ideal for various cooking methods, including frying and baking.

Another excellent option is avocado oil. It’s known for its heart-healthy properties and can withstand even higher temperatures of up to 510 degrees. Whether you’re sautéing or baking, avocado oil is a robust choice.

For those lower heat options, extra-virgin olive oil comes highly recommended. While rich in monounsaturated fats that are beneficial for heart health, it should be used at low to medium temperatures to prevent oxidation.

Sesame seed oil deserves a mention too. It not only enhances the flavor of your dishes but also boasts properties that may help lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Ideal for low heat cooking, it’s great for sautéing or adding to stir-fries.

However, not all oils are suitable for cooking. Grapeseed oil, despite its popularity, primarily contains polyunsaturated fats which can easily oxidize, making it a less favorable option. Flaxseed oil is packed with omega-3 fatty acids, but it’s best used raw in salads rather than heated.

Also on the list of oils you should avoid are corn oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, and canola oil. These oils break down quickly when exposed to heat, leading to rancidity and potential health issues.

Now that you’re equipped with the knowledge of which oils to choose, you can make informed decisions that benefit your health. Remember, while oils serve an essential purpose in cooking, choosing the right type is vital for maximizing their health benefits.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 2, 2024"

https://dailyhealthpost.com/relationship-sugar-cancer/,Nine Year Study Finally Explains The Relationship Between Sugar And Cancer,"Every cell in your body requires energy to function. There are many types of energy sources available. However, glucose, which is derived from carbohydrates is of special interest within the medical community. (Updated Nov 1, 2024)

Why? Because it’s also the preferred source of energy among cancer cells. Not only do cancer cells require more glucose than healthy cells but they also metabolize it faster.

Dubbed the Warburg effect, cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to quickly and efficiently break down sugar to promote growth, survival, proliferation, and long-term maintenance.

Discovered by Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Otto Warburg found that tumors required enormous amounts of glucose compared to surrounding healthy tissue. In addition, cancer cells were also observed to be able to ferment glucose and produce lactate in the presence of oxygen, thus the term aerobic glycolysis.

Can Sugar Cause Cancer? 

It seems that evidence pointing this way was discovered in a study funded by the sugar industry nearly 50 years ago — but the work was never published, until recently.

“The sugar industry did not disclose evidence of harm from animal studies that would have strengthened the case that the coronary heart disease risk of sucrose is greater than starch and caused sucrose to be scrutinized as a potential carcinogen,” the latest paper concludes. (1)

Many researchers have long pondered whether the Warburg Effect was related to how aggressively tumors grow and how cancer cells ferment sugar rather than relying on the same pathways healthy cells use to produce energy. It is this fermentation process that has now been linked to tumor growth.

According to researcher, Prof. Johan Thevelein:

“Our research reveals how the hyperactive sugar consumption of cancerous cells leads to a vicious cycle of continued stimulation of cancer development and growth. Thus, it is able to explain the correlation between the strength of the Warburg effect and tumor aggressiveness.

This link between sugar and cancer has sweeping consequences. Our results provide a foundation for future research in this domain, which can now be performed with a much more precise and relevant focus.” (2)

Strong Connection Between Sugar and Cancer

Dr. Lewis Cantley explains in an interview that he hasn’t eaten sugar in decades. “I have a very simple rule,” he says. “I eat fruit, but I don’t eat anything that has sugar added to it. And I guarantee everybody would be better off if they ate zero sugar.” (3)

According to an accumulating body of research by Dr. Cantley and his team at Weill Cornell Medicine, excess sugar also helps many types of cancer to grow more rapidly.

“As we learn more and more about cancer metabolism, we understand that individual cancers are addicted to particular things. In a lot of cancers, that’s insulin—and sugar.”

It’s important to understand that sugar that comes from fruits and vegetables are different. Unlike commercially made sources of sugar, which have been striped of cancer-fighting antioxidants, natural sources of carbohydrates that come from fruits and vegetables naturally come with a variety of antioxidants, which help fight cancer.

These findings are very exciting for the future of cancer research. It shows how important your diet truly is. And while researchers continue to make progress, limiting the amount of processed sweets eaten every day certainly wouldn’t hurt. Besides, eating less sugar can help with many different diseases, not just cancer.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 1, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-low-blood-oxygen/,8 Warning Signs of Low Blood Oxygen Levels,"Low blood oxygen levels can have a severe impact on our health, affecting everything from energy production to organ function. Being able to recognize the warning signs early is crucial for maintaining good health and preventing serious complications. Let’s explore the eight key warning signs you should watch out for.

Air Hunger and Breathing Difficulties

One of the first warning signs of low oxygen levels is air hunger – an intense craving for air accompanied by chest tightness and shortness of breath. When oxygen levels drop, your body compensates by increasing your breathing rate. This occurs because low oxygen leads to carbon dioxide buildup, which increases blood acidity and further compromises oxygen delivery to tissues.

Dizziness and Weakness

Physical activity may trigger feelings of lightheadedness and unsteadiness when your oxygen levels are low. These symptoms occur because your brain isn’t receiving adequate oxygen, affecting your balance and vision. If you experience persistent dizziness or weakness, it’s essential to seek medical attention, as these symptoms can lead to falls or accidents.

Increased Heart Rate

Your heart will work harder to compensate for low oxygen levels by pumping faster than normal. While a normal resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, an elevated heart rate can signal that your body is struggling to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs.

Related: Top 6 Ways to Increase Oxygen in Blood Naturally

Muscle Cramps and Chest Pain

Insufficient oxygen supply can cause muscle cramps and angina (chest pain). These symptoms occur when your muscles and heart aren’t receiving enough oxygen-rich blood. To support proper muscle function, consider incorporating electrolyte-rich foods like bananas, spinach, and avocados into your diet.

Heavy Legs During Activity

During physical activity, you might experience unusually heavy or fatigued legs when oxygen levels are low. This occurs because your muscles aren’t receiving enough oxygen to function optimally. Poor fitness levels and nutrient deficiencies, particularly in iron and vitamins, can worsen this condition.

Changes in Nail Health

Pay attention to your nails – pale or brittle nails can indicate low oxygen levels and anemia. When oxygen is scarce, your body prioritizes vital organs over peripheral tissues, affecting nail health. Regular monitoring of nail condition can help identify potential underlying health issues.

Cyanosis

A particularly serious sign is cyanosis – a bluish discoloration of the skin, especially around the lips, fingertips, and toes. This condition indicates significantly low blood oxygen levels and requires immediate medical attention as it can signal severe respiratory or cardiovascular problems.

Confusion and Lethargy

Low oxygen levels can significantly impact cognitive function, leading to confusion, memory issues, and disorientation. These symptoms may be exacerbated by vitamin deficiencies, particularly in B vitamins and iron, which affect oxygen transport and energy production.

Related: Top 12 Iron Deficiency (Anemia) Symptoms

Monitoring and Improving Oxygen Levels

Regular monitoring of blood oxygen levels can be done easily using a pulse oximeter, with normal readings ranging from 95% to 100%. Readings below 90% warrant medical attention. To maintain healthy oxygen levels, focus on consuming iron-rich foods, staying hydrated, and engaging in regular gentle exercise like walking or yoga.

Remember, recognizing these warning signs early and seeking prompt medical attention can prevent serious complications and support better overall health outcomes.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 31, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/vaping-dangers/,"Vaping Linked to Brain Damage, Narrow Arteries & Serious Lung Damage New Studies Found","Not too long-ago electronic cigarette companies told us that their product was the new revolutionary device that would change the lives of smokers and make every young person look cool. They marketed e-cigs as the best alternative to traditional cigarettes with zero side effects. (Updated Oct 19, 2024)

Most people believed the campaign that vaping using e-cigs was going to be the easiest way to help them quit smoking, but a recent public health scare is revealing a different reality. in 2019, over 1000 cases of pulmonary lung infection linked to the use of vaping products have been reported in the US. While there are many debates about what is causing these events, it is important that you understand the science behind vaping and how it affects you. 

This article will give you an in-depth analysis of what vaping is, the research supporting the health scare, and why you should be concerned about using e-cigarettes. 

What Does Vaping Mean?

The word “vaping” describes the act of inhaling and exhaling aerosol from an electronic handheld device containing a liquid. People who vape can choose to use a vaporizer or an e-cigarette.

The magic of vaping happens when the liquid mix of chemicals which sometimes contain nicotine, is heated to create a thick white cloud of smoke.

Thanks to influencers and the speed of social media, vaping has become a cultural phenomenon worldwide. The Surgeon General of the United States reported in 2016 that more than 85% of vapers in the country were 25 years old or younger (1). This popularity among young people is partially due to various flavors being made available on the market, such as fruit, chocolate, and candy (2).

Even though the e-cigarettes market is worth over $19 billion (3), one company is said to be responsible for most of the increase in the use of vape products. That company is Juul, a Silicon Valley startup with $12 billion in private valuation (4). One report suggests that the colorful and clever marketing of Juul might have contributed to the 78% rise of vaping among high schoolers (5). 

Why does the Government want to Ban E-Cigarettes?

Currently, both the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are investigating newly reported cases of lung injury associated with the use of vaping products. According to the CDC, 33 people have been confirmed dead and over 1000 more cases are being treated (6).

While the investigation is ongoing, health professionals are warning the public especially young people to avoid using any type of vaping products. Some e-cigs brands are blaming the use of cheap black-market varieties as the cause of the outbreak. They claim that for example, in the European Union electronic cigarettes are regulated and that is why there is no report of such cases (7). Still, experts argue that vaping products should be placed under the same restrictions as tobacco. 

How Nicotine in E-Cigarettes Affects Vapers

Even though e-cigs are not lighted on fire, the heat used to create the vape cloud is enough to release a similar toxic chemical mixture that is also present in tobacco-related products (8). 

We also know that smoking traditional cigarettes increases blood pressure; the findings for vaping is no different. According to one study (9), people who vaped for 30 minutes or more daily experienced stiffness in their arterial blood vessels. This stiffness was caused by the nicotine in vape mist. Nicotine raises blood pressure especially if it is combined with caffeine (10). So, using e-cigs with nicotine can affect your health just like traditional cigarettes do. 

To make matters worse, the Journal of Addictive Medicine (11) discovered that some brands of vape mist contain up to 52% higher levels of nicotine than the recommended 18mg/mL. In fact, even vape oils labeled nicotine-free contained levels of nicotine as high as 23.9mg/mL.

Is Nicotine-Free Vape Mist Bad for Your Lungs?

If nicotine is the reason why vaping is addictive and dangerous, then it should be okay for vapers to enjoy their nicotine-free e-cigs, right? Unfortunately, the answer is No.

A recent study by Muthumalage and colleagues (12) found that nicotine-free vape juice still released tiny chemical particles that can damage the functioning of the lungs.

Although, some chemicals in e-cigs like propylene glycol are deemed harmless, the combination with other chemicals especially the flavoring agents that many vapers love, creates a toxic solution. The data is not clear on how this new chemical mixture affects the respiratory system.

However, one study published by Journal Frontiers of Physiology found that vaping particles causes irritation and inflammation in the lungs (13). For this reason, vapers have been advised to avoid electronic cigarette products until more conclusive research emerges.

Can You Develop Popcorn Lungs From Vaping?

Popcorn lung is known medically as bronchiolitis obliterans, a rare chronic condition that affects people with advanced respiratory damage. It was first discovered in popcorn factory workers exposed to a toxic chemical called diacetyl. This chemical is used by factories as a replacement for butter in popcorn production.

According to a study published by Scientific Reports (14), inhaling diacetyl is dangerous as it causes inflammation in the lungs which leads to thickened and narrow airways; thereby increasing vapers’ risk of developing popcorn lungs. While diacetyl is banned in the European Union (15), the American Lungs Association (16) says some brands of e-cigarettes contain this toxic chemical. 

Another study by Allen and partners analyzed 51 brands of vape mists and found that 39 of them contained diacetyl (17). The most shocking finding of this study was that some brands of vape juice tested had levels of diacetyl that is way beyond the safe limit. 

Studies like these are the reason why the United States Surgeon General issued a warning against using e-Cigarettes as popcorn lung is not curable. In severe cases, popcorn lung can lead to breathlessness, coughing, and even death.

Other Ways Vaping Affects Your Respiratory Health

Popcorn lung disease is not the only respiratory risk associated with vaping. 

According to a study from Harvard T.Chan School Of Public Health, vaping can cause lasting long-term damage to the lungs and its surrounding tissues (18).

Researchers Rowell and Tarran have also reported that using electronic cigarettes can cause asthma-like symptoms and reduce respiratory functioning. They concluded that the health effects of e-cigs are the same as smoking (19).

Higher Risks of Stroke, Heart Attack, And Other Cardiovascular Diseases Linked with Vaping

Aside from the harmful effects of e-cigs on the functioning of the lungs, vaping can affect your cardiac health.  

Dr. Paul Ndunda who is an assistant professor at Kansas School of Medicine led a cross-sectional study to investigate how e-cigarettes affect the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). They included 343,856 people who never used e-cigarettes and 66,795 regular vapers; making it the largest study of CVD risks and vaping to date. 

The team found that compared to the other group, people who vaped had a 40% increase in their risk of heart-related conditions. Their findings also showed that the vapers increased their risk of stroke by 71% and heart attack by 59% (20). 

Other researchers from the University Of West Virginia (21) studied 250 vapers in a lab trial and found acrolein in the vape juice. They concluded that regular users of e-cigs are at risk of thickening their arteries. Inhaling acrolein can also damage the blood vessels which affects blood circulation and increases the risk of atherosclerosis (22). 

Finally, one paper published in the PLOS Journal shows that vapers are more likely to suffer from blood clots and reduced functioning of the arteries of the leg (23). The many evidence above makes vaping a strong negative risk factor for your cardiovascular health. 

Other Possible Health Consequences of Vaping Includes:
Cancer-Linked Genetic Mutations:

For many smokers, the scare of cancer is the reason they want to quit but vaping might not be the solution they seek.  A detailed 2019 study (24) explained that vape juice contains known carcinogenic compounds like glycol, glycerin, and artificial flavorings. The study pointed out that these carcinogenic chemicals present in e-cigs are also found in traditional cigarettes but with a lesser dose. Nevertheless, the levels of these carcinogenic chemicals in e-cigs remains high enough to cause cancer. This dangerous effect (25) of vaping is confirmed by the National Cancer Institute’s report that inhaling vape mist increases one’s risk of cancer.

One other study warns that young people who use e-cigs are exposing themselves to carcinogenic enzymes. Teenage vapers are at risk of cancer-linked genetic mutations as chemicals found in e-cigs increase the formation of free-radicals in the body (26). 

Poisoning of DNA Cells:

Regular users of electronic cigarettes may be unknowingly damaging the DNA cells in their mouths.

One introductory study by scientists associated with the American Chemical Society identified formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal in the saliva of vapers (27). These compounds are known to cause mutations in DNA cells.

Affects Brain Functioning:

Texas Tech University Researcher Kaisar and others (28) explains that the chemical found in e-cigs juice can cause brain damage for chronic vapers. This is because vaping leads to the obstruction of blood flow in the brain. Suggesting that vapers are at risk of stroke and are less likely to recover from a brain surgery. 

Can Vaping Make You an Addict?

When e-cigs came to the market in 2004, it was advertised as a healthy alternative for people who wanted to quit smoking. Even though vaping may not be an addictive habit, data shows that the majority of vape juice sold contained nicotine. 

Dr. Blaha at John Hopkins Medicine argues that nicotine addiction is the reason why the use of e-cigarette is a health concern (29). He says some e-cigs brands are deceiving the public as data shows vaping produces more nicotine than smoking cigarettes.

These findings are shocking for smokers who thought e-cigarette was the miracle solution to help them stop smoking. The harsh reality is that smokers who switch to vaping are exchanging one addictive habit for another (30). What’s worse, vapers could end up using both e-cigs and traditional cigarettes in order to satisfy their daily need for nicotine high.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/philadelphia-youth-find-ptsd-relief-through-proven-treatment/,Philadelphia Youth Find PTSD Relief Through Proven Treatment,"In this post, let’s look at an inspiring story from Philadelphia, where a dedicated team has created a successful model for treating youth suffering from PTSD—Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Now, integrating effective treatments into healthcare isn’t easy. Surprisingly, only about 31% of these attempts succeed. But a decade-long study in Philadelphia has proven that with the right approach, it can be done. This remarkable effort involved doctors, clinic managers, and researchers coming together to implement a specific form of talk therapy tailored for young people grappling with trauma.

So, why was this study so crucial for Philadelphia? Many youths in the city live in challenging conditions, often facing violence, poverty, and abuse. These experiences significantly increase the likelihood of developing PTSD, and unfortunately, these children also have less access to recovery resources compared to their wealthier peers.

Since 2012, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, among other institutions, have collaborated with the city’s health department to train local therapists in this effective talk therapy. Impressively, the therapy has led to an average reduction in stress symptoms by 30%. What’s truly remarkable is how Philadelphia has maintained this program for over ten years. As researcher Rinad Beidas noted, this is a success story rooted in community collaboration and clinical commitment.

The lessons from Philadelphia can benefit other cities facing similar challenges. Many youth across the U.S. are also traumatized, and while each city has its unique landscape, the foundational principles of this program can be adapted to fit places like Chicago or New York.

Training therapists to genuinely understand and empathize with their patients is paramount. Briana Last, who led this initiative, emphasized how impactful it is to have clinicians who truly grasp their clients’ struggles. Financial support for mental health services played a significant role in the project’s success, enabling 478 therapists to be trained in this specialized therapy.

As a result, over 23,000 young people have been screened for stress, with more than 7,500 receiving treatment. This Philadelphia initiative illustrates that with adequate training, funding, and community collaboration, cities can implement effective treatment strategies, changing lives for the better.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/link-between-high-blood-pressure-and-weaker-bones/,The Surprising Link Between High Blood Pressure and Weaker Bones,"High blood pressure is often associated with heart disease and stroke, but emerging research highlights another alarming connection: weaker bones. Scientists have discovered that individuals suffering from hypertension may experience a decline in bone density, which elevates their risk for fractures and osteoporosis. But how exactly does high blood pressure influence bone health?

Let’s explore the intriguing link between hypertension and bone strength.

Bone density refers to the strength and solidity of our bones. Higher density means that bones are less likely to break. However, as we grow older, our bone density tends to decrease. Conditions like high blood pressure can accelerate this natural decline. While osteoporosis is primarily regarded as an age-related condition, research indicates that hypertension might contribute to bone fragility as well.

The connection seems to stem from the effects high blood pressure has on our blood vessels. When blood pressure is elevated, it puts extra strain on these vessels, making them less flexible over time. This damage compromises the essential blood flow that our bones depend on, leading to poorer bone health.

A significant study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research sheds light on this matter, revealing that those with hypertension carry a greater risk for low bone density, particularly in critical areas like the hips and lower spine. One contributing factor is the inflammation caused by high blood pressure. When blood pressure rises, it often results in tiny injuries to blood vessels, inciting ongoing inflammation that can extend to the bones.

So, what does this inflammation do? It triggers the release of chemicals that disrupt a delicate balance between bone-building cells (osteoblasts) and bone-breaking cells (osteoclasts). When more bone is broken down than rebuilt, the result is weakened bones.

Moreover, high blood pressure can negatively impact calcium levels in the body. A study from the University of California found that hypertension can increase calcium excretion through urine. This is alarming because calcium is vital for maintaining strong bones. If the kidneys filter out excessive calcium, it reduces the levels available for bone health. Over time, this depletion can make bones more fragile and susceptible to fractures.

Interestingly, the choice of blood pressure medication can also play a role in bone density. Diuretics, often referred to as “water pills,” assist in lowering blood pressure but may also lead to calcium loss. Research published in JAMA indicates that individuals on certain diuretics for extended periods experienced reduced bone density compared to those taking alternative medications. On a positive note, calcium-channel blockers, utilized to relax blood vessels, do not seem to influence bone density adversely.

It’s crucial to recognize overlapping risk factors between high blood pressure and osteoporosis. Diets high in salt are known to elevate blood pressure and can hinder calcium absorption as well. Additionally, a sedentary lifestyle heightens risks for both conditions, suggesting that a healthier lifestyle may offer protection against both high blood pressure and reduced bone density.

Fortunately, there are proactive steps individuals can take to mitigate these risks. Engaging in regular physical activity, such as walking, weight training, or yoga, supports bone health while aiding in blood pressure management. A 2019 study published in The American Journal of Medicine even demonstrated that moderate exercise a few times a week positively impacts both blood pressure and bone density in older adults.

Finally, a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D is imperative for bone health, and reducing salt intake can help maintain healthy blood pressure levels.

In summary, high blood pressure has been linked to diminished bone density and a heightened risk of osteoporosis. Through inflammation, calcium loss, and medication effects, these connections illuminate the necessity for awareness and action. By adopting a balanced diet and an active lifestyle, you can help shield both your heart and bones, paving the way for better overall health.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 25, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-magnesium-deficiency/,Top 15 Bizarre Signs of Magnesium Deficiency You Need To Know,"Do you experience muscle cramps, restless legs, or tossing and turning at night? Are you struggling with poor concentration or sudden mood changes? These common symptoms may indicate a deficiency in magnesium, an essential mineral involved in over 600 enzymatic reactions in the human body.

Magnesium is fundamental to cellular function, controlling processes ranging from nerve signaling and energy production, to neurotransmitter regulation. When magnesium levels drop, these vital processes become disrupted, leading to problems with sleep, energy, stress management, and muscle function.

Despite its importance, studies show that about 57% of the U.S. population does not meet the recommended daily intake of this vital nutrient. The implications of this widespread deficiency are serious: chronic magnesium deficiency has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, and type 2 diabetes, and it may also play a role in depression and other health conditions.

In today’s video, we’ll explore the top 15 signs your body needs more magnesium and share practical solutions. You’ll learn about magnesium-rich foods, proper supplementation, and the common causes of deficiency. Watch until the end to discover essential information about this crucial mineral that may surprise you!

Now, let’s look at the 15 signs your body is deficient in this crucial mineral and electrolyte:

At Number 15, we have “Digestive Discomfort”.

Early signs of magnesium deficiency often manifest in the digestive system. Loss of appetite is a common initial symptom, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. These symptoms can be subtle at first but may worsen as magnesium levels continue to drop.

Next, at Number 14, we have “Muscle Spasms and Cramping”.

One of the earliest signs of magnesium deficiency appears in muscle function: weak, uncoordinated movements, involuntary spasms, and painful cramps – particularly in the legs, feet, and eyelids. Women with low magnesium levels may experience more intense menstrual cramps, but studies show that supplementation, especially when combined with vitamin B6, can help reduce both cramping and anxiety-related premenstrual symptoms.

The next symptom is Number 13, “Fatigue”.

Magnesium participates in energy production in mitochondria and adrenal gland function. When magnesium levels drop, these processes slow down, forcing your body to work harder and leading to fatigue. Studies show that restoring magnesium levels can help boost energy, particularly in chronically tired individuals.

Coming up, Number 12 is “Impaired Blood Sugar Control”.

Magnesium plays a key role in blood sugar control, and its deficiency is particularly common in type 2 diabetes. When magnesium is low, cells become resistant to insulin, the blood sugar-regulating hormone, leading to higher blood glucose levels. This creates a vicious cycle: low magnesium increases insulin resistance, which further depletes magnesium stores. Studies show that magnesium supplementation can help break this cycle by improving insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control in diabetic patients.

The next symptom is Number 11, “Numbness and Tingling”.

Peripheral neuropathy – damage to nerves outside the brain and spine – often causes numbness and tingling in hands and feet. Since magnesium is essential for healthy nerve function, low levels can contribute to these symptoms. Studies show magnesium supplementation may help reduce neuropathic pain, particularly in chemotherapy patients where nerve damage is common.

Moving on, we have Number 10. “Poor Cognitive Performance”.

Magnesium is essential for mitochondria – the cellular powerhouses that produce energy for brain function. When magnesium levels drop, cognitive problems emerge, including difficulty concentrating, mental cloudiness, and memory issues. The brain contains the highest concentration of mitochondria in men, while women have peak concentrations in their ovaries. Studies show that restoring magnesium levels through supplementation can enhance learning and memory capabilities.

Next, the Number 9 symptom is “Insomnia”.

Magnesium helps produce GABA, a neurotransmitter that signals your brain to relax and prepare for sleep, while also helping to lower levels of cortisol, the body’s primary stress hormone. When magnesium levels are low, GABA production decreases and cortisol can remain elevated, making it harder to achieve restful sleep. This explains why magnesium supplementation often improves sleep quality.

Moving on, we have Number 8, “Constipation and IBS”.

Magnesium plays a dual role in healthy digestion: it draws water into the intestines to soften stools while helping intestinal muscles contract properly to move waste. When magnesium levels are low, stools become hard and difficult to pass. Beyond regular digestion, magnesium supplementation can help people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) by reducing stomach pain and cramping.

Coming up, is symptom Number 7, “Headaches and Migraines”.

Magnesium helps prevent migraines by regulating calcium levels in nerve cells and supporting neurotransmitter production. When magnesium levels are low, nerves can become overstimulated, triggering severe headaches. Studies show that people who suffer frequent migraines often have magnesium deficiency, and supplementation can effectively reduce both the frequency and severity of their headaches.

Related: These Are The Best Headache And Migraine Tips

The next symptom, Number 6, is “Mood Disorders”.

As mentioned earlier, magnesium helps produce GABA, a key neurotransmitter that promotes calmness and relaxation in the brain. When magnesium levels are low, GABA production decreases, which can trigger anxiety, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. This explains why maintaining adequate magnesium levels is crucial for stable mood, focus, and sleep patterns.

Next up, is Number 5, “Dry and Dull Skin”.

Magnesium plays a key role in skin health by regulating hormone balance and fatty acid production. When levels are low, skin conditions like eczema may become more difficult to manage.

Moving on, we have Number 4, “Weak or Brittle Bones”.

Magnesium is essential for healthy bone structure, with 60% of the body’s stores found in your bones. Along with vitamin D, vitamin K2, calcium, and zinc, magnesium helps maintain bone strength and density. When levels are low, bones become more vulnerable to osteoporosis, particularly in high-risk groups like postmenopausal women.

Related: Researchers Make Surprising Discovery: Magnesium, NOT Calcium, Is The Key To Healthy Bones

The next symptom, Number 3 is, “Chronic Pain and Fibromyalgia”.

In chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia, anxiety creates muscle tension, which intensifies pain, leading to more anxiety. When magnesium levels are low, this cycle worsens as both nerve sensitivity and muscle tension increase. Research shows magnesium supplementation can help break this cycle by calming nerves and relaxing muscles, addressing both physical and emotional symptoms.

Next, at Number 2, we have “Arrhythmia and High Blood Pressure”.

Magnesium regulates heart rhythm by controlling calcium and potassium in heart cells. When levels are low, arrhythmias can develop, causing irregular, fast, or slow heartbeats – including Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), where the heart’s upper chambers beat chaotically. Studies show magnesium supplementation helps prevent AFib by stabilizing heart cell signaling. Beyond heart rhythm, magnesium keeps blood vessels flexible, and daily supplementation can effectively lower blood pressure.

Related: Cinnamon and Magnesium May Lower Blood Pressure More Than Medication

And the Number 1 symptom is “Hearing Problems”.

This may be surprising, but magnesium deficiency can make your ears more vulnerable to both noise-induced hearing damage and tinnitus (persistent ringing in the ears). Studies have found that daily supplementation with higher doses of magnesium over three months can help reduce tinnitus symptoms.

Now that we know the signs of magnesium deficiency, let’s explore three ways to improve your magnesium levels.

First, to boost your magnesium intake, focus on nutrient-rich foods:

Pumpkin seeds reign supreme as nature’s magnesium powerhouse among all nuts and seeds.
Cooked spinach delivers exceptional magnesium content, making it the champion of leafy greens.
Black beans and legumes offer substantial magnesium while providing essential fiber and protein.
Quinoa and brown rice lead the whole grains category with impressive magnesium content.
Mackerel and fatty fish deliver magnesium alongside beneficial omega-3 fatty acids.
Dark chocolate with 70% plus cocoa provides magnesium with a delicious antioxidant boost.
Avocados combine magnesium with healthy fats in a versatile package.
Tofu serves as an excellent plant-based source of both magnesium and protein.
Bananas provide magnesium with a convenient boost of potassium.
Wheat bran concentrates magnesium in a form perfect for cereals and baking.

The second way to increase magnesium levels is to take an Epsom salt bath.

Epsom salt baths boost magnesium levels through skin absorption, offering a relaxing soak with either traditional magnesium sulfate or newer magnesium chloride flakes.

And obviously, the third way to improve magnesium levels is through supplementation.

Different forms of magnesium offer unique benefits. Magnesium glycinate is highly bioavailable, gentle on the stomach, and excellent for promoting relaxation and sleep while helping with anxiety. Magnesium malate combines magnesium with malic acid to boost energy production and help with chronic pain and fatigue. Magnesium L-threonate uniquely crosses the blood-brain barrier to enhance cognitive function, memory, and learning. Magnesium oil provides a transdermal option by applying on the skin, bypassing digestion while helping with muscle cramps and sleep quality. If you’re interested in a magnesium supplement that combines multiple forms of magnesium, please see the link below.

Next, let’s look at the four major causes of magnesium deficiency.

Today’s widespread magnesium deficiency mainly comes from poor diet, made worse by farming practices that leave soil mineral-poor and food processing that removes magnesium.

Digestive problems like Crohn’s and Celiac disease make it hard for the body to absorb magnesium, and common medicines such as heartburn medications, water pills, and some antibiotics lower magnesium levels.

Health issues play a major role too – Type 2 diabetes causes magnesium loss through frequent urination, while regular heavy drinking damages both kidney function and the body’s ability to absorb magnesium.

And as people age, they typically eat less magnesium-rich food and their bodies become less efficient at absorbing it. Ongoing stress, heavy sweating, and hormone disorders that affect the kidneys speed up magnesium loss, leading to a continuing cycle of deficiency.

Finally, how can you test for magnesium deficiency?

The red blood cell (RBC) magnesium test is the most reliable method for detecting deficiency because it measures magnesium inside cells. Standard blood tests can be misleading since the body maintains normal blood levels by drawing magnesium from bones and tissues even when overall stores are low.

By now you understand magnesium’s vital role in human health. Even without obvious signs of deficiency, most people can benefit from increasing their magnesium intake. Daily intake of this mineral helps maintain mental clarity and balanced energy levels, while its adaptogenic properties enhance the body’s resilience to everyday stress, making it an essential health tonic for modern living.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 25, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/hidden-link-between-dental-health-and-heart-attacks/,The Hidden Link Between Dental Health and Heart Attacks,"Recent research has uncovered a startling connection between dental health and heart attacks. Dr. Thomas Levy, MD, has shed light on the role of pathogens in root canal-treated teeth, suggesting that these microorganisms can enter the bloodstream and potentially lead to serious cardiovascular issues[7].

Alarming Statistics and Dental Infections

Studies have revealed a significant link between pathogens found in heart attack patients and dental infections. A considerable percentage of individuals who suffer from myocardial infarction harbor bacteria typically associated with oral health problems. These pathogens can enter the bloodstream through various means, including inflamed gums or dental procedures, ultimately affecting heart health by promoting inflammation and plaque buildup in arteries[1].

This connection raises a critical question: how closely related are dental health and cardiovascular issues? As we uncover the intricate links between oral bacteria and heart disease, it becomes increasingly evident that maintaining good dental hygiene may play a vital role in preventing serious cardiovascular events[6]. This study from Harvard Health states: “people with periodontal (gum) disease have two to three times the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or other serious cardiovascular event”.

The Silent Threat of Chronic Apical Periodontitis

Chronic apical periodontitis is a dental condition characterized by inflammation at the apex of a tooth’s root, often resulting from untreated dental decay or trauma. One of its most concerning aspects is that it frequently presents with few or no symptoms, leading many individuals to remain unaware of its presence[2].

This seemingly benign condition can have serious implications for systemic health, as the bacteria involved can enter the bloodstream and contribute to various health issues, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes[2]. Regular dental checkups and awareness of oral health are essential in preventing these infections and their potential systemic consequences.

Root Canal Procedures: A Double-Edged Sword

While root canal procedures can save a tooth and alleviate pain, they present challenges, particularly in achieving complete sterilization of the tooth. The intricate anatomy of tooth roots can make it difficult to eliminate all bacteria, potentially leaving behind pathogens that can lead to chronic inflammation[5].

This lingering inflammation may contribute to systemic health issues, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream and affect other parts of the body. Understanding these potential health risks associated with root canal procedures is essential for patients, as it emphasizes the importance of thorough dental care and monitoring to mitigate complications and maintain overall health[5].

Detecting Dental Infections: The Role of C-Reactive Protein

Measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can be an effective method for detecting dental infections and their systemic effects. Elevated CRP levels can indicate the presence of inflammation in the body, which may stem from infections in the mouth[1].

These oral infections can have broader health implications, potentially contributing to conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory issues[3]. As research continues to unveil the connections between oral health and systemic wellness, it becomes increasingly important for individuals to consider their dental health as an integral part of their overall well-being.

Oxidative Stress and Dental Infections

Oxidative stress, an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, can lead to cellular damage and negatively impact the immune system. Dental infections can trigger an inflammatory response, contributing to systemic inflammation throughout the body[4].

This chronic inflammation can overwhelm the immune system, making it less effective at combating infections and increasing susceptibility to various diseases. By prioritizing oral health through regular dental checkups and good hygiene practices, individuals can help mitigate oxidative stress and its harmful effects[4].

https://dailyhealthpost.com/ancient-drug-shows-promise-in-reducing-joint-replacements-for-osteoarthritis/,Ancient Drug Shows Promise in Reducing Joint Replacements for Osteoarthritis,"Are you one of the millions affected by osteoarthritis? This common condition can severely impact mobility, especially in the knees and hips, as the cartilage in our joints wears down over time due to daily wear and tear. Until now, options for treatment have been relatively few, primarily relying on painkillers or major joint replacement surgeries. However, there’s promising news on the horizon.

Recent research indicates that a small daily dose of a medication called colchicine may help reduce the need for knee and hip replacements among osteoarthritis patients. Colchicine has a long history, dating back to the first century AD for use in gout management.

A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine as part of the LoDoCo2 trial highlights how this existing drug, typically used to treat conditions like gout, could play a critical role in managing osteoarthritis.

In this study, over 5,500 participants aged between 35 and 82 were involved. They were randomly assigned to receive either a 0.5 mg daily dose of colchicine or a placebo. Throughout an average monitoring period of 29 months, researchers observed some promising results.

Only 2.5% of participants taking colchicine required total knee or hip replacements, compared to 3.5% in the placebo group. While the difference may seem small, it suggests that colchicine could effectively slow the progression of joint damage, potentially delaying or even eliminating the need for major surgery.

Interestingly, the benefits of colchicine were most pronounced in men, though the study wasn’t extensive enough to confirm similar effects in women. Hence, additional research is crucial to fully assess how this drug works for both genders.

Despite these encouraging findings, experts emphasize the need for further studies to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of colchicine. This could pave the way for an essential treatment option for managing osteoarthritis and ultimately reduce the number of costly surgeries that require lengthy recovery periods.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-d-supplements-fail-to-lower-heart-disease-risk/,"Vitamin D Supplements Fail to Lower Heart Disease Risk, Study Shows","Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in adults over 65 years old, a demographic that often struggles with low Vitamin D levels. This has raised questions about whether Vitamin D supplements could be a potential safeguard against heart issues. However, despite numerous observational studies suggesting a link between low Vitamin D levels and increased cardiovascular risk, randomized trials have produced different results.

Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center set out to clarify this issue through a rigorous study. They focused on whether high doses of Vitamin D could lower the presence of two proteins in the blood that indicate cardiac injury and strain. By utilizing a double-blind, randomized trial—considered the gold standard in clinical testing—the team aimed to provide clearer insights into the relationship between Vitamin D supplementation and heart health.

The study, published in the American Journal of Preventative Cardiology, revealed some striking findings. Lead author Dr. Katharine W. Rainer emphasized that their analysis disproved the hypothesis that higher doses of Vitamin D could reduce cardiovascular risk in adults with low blood levels of the vitamin. Over a two-year follow-up period, Vitamin D supplementation showed no effect on the markers of cardiovascular disease, regardless of the dose administered.

Conducting this study required participants aged 70 and older with low Vitamin D levels. They were divided into four groups, receiving daily doses of 200, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 International Units of Vitamin D3. Researchers measured blood levels of cardiovascular markers both at the beginning and during the follow-up visits at three, 12, and 24 months.

The findings revealed that while there was an initial association between lower Vitamin D levels and one marker of cardiovascular disease, supplementation itself did not lead to any reductions in these markers over time. This conclusion remained consistent across factors such as age, sex, race, and existing health conditions, including high blood pressure and diabetes.

Senior author Dr. Stephen P. Juraschek added that although more research is needed to understand the link between Vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular disease, the results from their study clearly suggest that Vitamin D supplementation alone is not an effective prevention strategy for heart-related events.

Interestingly, Dr. Juraschek hinted that other elements, perhaps linked to lifestyle choices like outdoor physical activity, may offer better avenues for preventing cardiovascular diseases, rather than relying solely on Vitamin D supplementation.

In summary, while Vitamin D has long been associated with various health benefits, including heart health, this latest trial provides compelling evidence that simply increasing Vitamin D levels through supplementation does not significantly lower cardiac risk. As researchers continue to explore the complexities surrounding Vitamin D and cardiovascular health, the focus may shift to broader preventive strategies that encompass various lifestyle factors.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/healthy-foods-that-are-secretly-sabotaging-your-diet/,7 “Healthy” Foods That Are Secretly Sabotaging Your Diet,"Are you trying to eat healthier but not seeing the results you want? You might be surprised to learn that some of the foods you think are good for you are actually working against your health goals. In this eye-opening blog post, we’ll explore seven common “health” foods that could be derailing your diet and what you can eat instead.

The Granola Bar Trap

Granola bars, especially popular brands like Nature Valley, often masquerade as nutritious snacks. However, these convenient treats can be wolves in sheep’s clothing. Many contain GMOs and glyphosate residues, a controversial herbicide linked to various health concerns[2]. Moreover, they’re frequently loaded with sugar and refined starches, which can lead to blood sugar spikes and contribute to weight gain and metabolic issues[2]. For a truly healthy alternative, opt for organic options that are less likely to contain harmful additives and are produced without synthetic pesticides or GMOs.

The Sweet Deception of Agave Syrup

Agave syrup has gained a reputation as a natural sweetener, but its health halo is undeserved. With more fructose than regular table sugar, agave syrup can lead to fat accumulation in the liver and potentially result in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease[3]. Excessive fructose consumption is also linked to insulin resistance, which can pave the way for type 2 diabetes and contribute to weight gain[3]. When choosing sweeteners, consider alternatives lower in fructose or use agave syrup in strict moderation.

Flavored Yogurts: A Sugar Bomb in Disguise

While yogurt is often touted as a healthy snack, flavored varieties can contain as much sugar as candy bars – up to 20 grams per serving[5]. This excessive sugar content not only contributes to weight gain but also increases the risk of chronic diseases. Moreover, the processing and added sugars often compromise the beneficial probiotics typically found in yogurt[5]. For a healthier option, choose plain Greek yogurt or kefir, which are lower in sugar and rich in protein and probiotics.

The Chemical Cocktail in Non-Dairy Creamers

Non-dairy creamers may seem like a healthier alternative to cream, but they often contain harmful additives like high fructose corn syrup and trans fats[8]. These ingredients are linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and increased risk of heart disease[8]. Instead of non-dairy creamers, consider using organic cream or half-and-half, which are typically free from harmful additives and provide a more natural source of flavor and creaminess.

Fast Food Salads: Not As Healthy As You Think

Fast food salads might seem like a smart choice, but they often come with unhealthy dressings laden with sugars, unhealthy fats, and preservatives[7]. Additionally, the salad ingredients are frequently treated with chemicals to enhance shelf life, compromising their freshness and nutritional quality[7]. For a truly healthy option, prepare fresh, homemade salads using organic ingredients and dressings made from healthy oils and natural flavors.

The Puffed Cereal Problem

Recent experiments on rats have revealed alarming findings about puffed cereals. Rats fed a diet high in puffed cereals exhibited significant weight gain, increased fat accumulation, and metabolic disturbances[10]. The high levels of sugar and refined carbohydrates in many puffed cereals can lead to similar issues in humans, including obesity, insulin resistance, and an increased risk of chronic diseases[10]. To promote better health, choose whole grains over processed cereals for a more balanced and nutritious diet.

By being aware of these hidden dangers in seemingly healthy foods, you can make more informed choices about your diet. Remember, the key to better health lies in choosing whole, natural foods and being mindful of what you consume[11]. Stay informed, read labels carefully, and prioritize your health with every bite you take.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/food-that-harms-your-heart/,One Hidden Food That Harms Your Heart (Avoid Now!),"Heart disease remains a leading cause of death globally, and trans fats are a significant contributor to this health crisis. These unhealthy fats, often lurking in processed foods, can elevate bad cholesterol levels while lowering good cholesterol, increasing the risk of cardiovascular issues[1]. Many people are unaware of the hidden dangers of trans fats in everyday items like baked goods, snacks, and margarine. Understanding how to identify and avoid trans fats is crucial for maintaining heart health and reducing the risk of heart disease[2].

What Are Trans Fats?

Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat that can be artificially created through a process called hydrogenation, where hydrogen is added to liquid vegetable oils, transforming them into solid fats[3]. This process enhances the shelf life and stability of products, making them more appealing to food manufacturers. Common sources of trans fats include margarine, shortening, and many processed foods like baked goods, fried items, and snack foods[1]. Manufacturers favor trans fats for their ability to improve texture and extend the shelf life of products, despite their health risks[3].

Healthier Alternatives

To replace trans fats in your diet, consider incorporating healthier fat options such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which can be found in olive oil, avocados, and nuts[8]. Cooking at home allows you to control ingredients and avoid harmful trans fats commonly found in processed foods. When preparing meals, opt for healthier cooking oils like olive oil, avocado oil, or coconut oil instead of margarine or shortening[8]. These alternatives not only enhance flavor but also provide essential nutrients that support heart health and overall well-being.

Making Healthier Choices When Eating Out

When eating out, it’s important to make healthier choices to avoid trans fats. Be cautious of fried and baked foods, as they often contain high levels of trans fats that can harm your heart health[7]. Don’t hesitate to ask restaurant staff about the oils they use in cooking; many establishments are willing to provide this information. Instead of choosing fried items, opt for grilled or baked options, which are typically lower in unhealthy fats and can be just as delicious while supporting your overall well-being[7].

Take Action for Your Heart Health

I encourage you to take an active role in reducing trans fats in your diet. Start by checking the food labels in your pantry for any hidden trans fats, and consider making a commitment to reduce or eliminate them from your meals[5]. By being mindful of your choices, you can significantly improve your heart health and overall well-being. Remember, even small changes can have a positive impact, leading to a healthier lifestyle and a reduced risk of heart disease. Your heart will thank you for it!

Conclusion

https://dailyhealthpost.com/cleanse-your-arteries/,How To Cleanse Your Coronary Arteries With Only 3 Ingredients,"A diet high in junk food and sugar can be destructive to your cardiovascular health. You may have heard about how cholesterol can accumulate in your arteries and put unnecessary strain on your heart. (updated Oct 12 2024)

Most people rely on blood thinners and other medications (statins) to combat the effects of high cholesterol, but the condition can easily be managed by food alone.

High cholesterol levels can lead to a buildup of plaque in the artery walls, narrowing the  arteries, and causing a condition called atherosclerosis. this impairs blood flow throughout the body and increases risk of heart disease and stroke (1).

What Is Cholesterol?

There exist two main types of cholesterol (2):

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL): small dense LDL transports cholesterol particles throughout your body, and can be easily oxidized, building up in the walls of your arteries, and making them hard and narrow.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL): picks up excess cholesterol and takes it back to your liver to be cleared away through bile.

High levels of small dense LDL cholesterol is typically caused by smoking, poor diet, inactivity, diabetes and is linked to obesity. To put it simply, high cholesterol, in most cases, is simply a reflection of an unhealthy lifestyle.

Specifically, high cholesterol refers to high levels of “oxidized cholesterol”.

When cholesterol is oxidized, it leads to a build-up of plaque in the artery walls, which hardens and narrows the arteries, and causes a condition called atherosclerosis. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, cellular waste products and fibrin, that lodge inside our arterial walls and damage the cells that are already there, causing inflammation.

We now know that LDL cholesterol poses a health risk only if it is oxidized.

Oxidized cholesterol and oxidized fat are the real enemies. Our bodies treat these as foreign substances and stimulate inflammatory cytokines to damage and kill them with inflammation.

The fact that LDL cholesterol is highly prone to oxidation explains why a rise in LDL cholesterol normally brings about an increase in coronary artery disease risk.

The oxidized cholesterol that clogs our arteries and causes coronary artery disease stems from two sources:

One. We acquire some of them straight from our diets when we eat oxidized fats and oils.

Two. Our bodies produce the remainder internally.

Dietary oils and fats tend to become oxidized when they are heated, dried, aged, exposed to light, and otherwise chemically processed. A diet high in vegetable oils is unmistakably hazardous.

A lesser-known fact is that sugar oxidizes as well as oils and fats do. Glucose, and especially fructose, produce many oxidation products when they are aged, heated, or otherwise processed.

Studies have shown that people who are at serious risk of heart attacks to the extent that they need bypass surgery have high oxidized LDL cholesterol, not normal LDL cholesterol.

Luckily, it’s possible to get antioxidants from foods to neutralize free radicals and reverse the damage they cause to cells and organs. Let’s get to our cholesterol-busting recipe with 3 natural ingredients.

Cholesterol-Busting Recipe

This recipe provides your body with nutrients that can help break down bad cholesterol and clear your arteries as you transition into a healthier lifestyle.

Ingredients:

4 liters/1 gal of clean water
8 organic lemons
8 cloves of organic garlic
4-5 cm /1.9 inches of organic ginger

Instructions:

Scrub lemons properly to clean the rind, but do not peel.
Slice lemon and peel the ginger and garlic.
Crush the garlic and let it sit for 15 minutes. This will activate the allicin.
Place everything but the water in a blender and pulse until smooth.
In a medium saucepan, add water and the paste and warm over medium heat.
Just as it begins to boil, remove the mixture from heat.
Let it cool and strain the liquid.
Pour the drink in glass jars or bottles with lids and store in the refrigerator.

How to Use:

Drink daily on an empty stomach two hours before meals. Combine with exercise 3 times a week.

How It Works

Ginger: Dried ginger powder administered at 0.1 g/kg  of body weight limits the risk of atheroma (degeneration of the walls of the arteries caused by accumulated fatty deposits and scar tissue) by up to 50% in just 75 days (3).

It also prevent heart disease by inhibiting the accumulation of platelets in the arteries and inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. Additionally, it doesn’t have the negative side effects of other medication such as aspirin.

Garlic: Garlic is traditionally used to help prevent heart disease, including atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, which are risk factors for heart disease and stroke. It also treats high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and boosts the immune system (4).

One study that lasted 4 years found that people who took 900 mg daily of standardized garlic powder slowed the development of atherosclerosis.

It also contains antioxidants which fight free radicals to prevent heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer disease.

Lemons: Daily lemon intake and walking showed significant effects on lowering blood pressure while also increasing red blood cell count (5). Lemon also helps detox the liver to help it clear excess cholesterol.

First, it’s important to understand why blood sugar levels tend to be higher in the morning, especially for those with diabetes or prediabetes.

Several body processes contribute to elevated morning glucose levels, beyond just the impact of your evening meal. To better understand these processes, checking your blood sugar before bed is crucial as it reveals how your body has handled food and activity during the day. This helps you spot patterns and make changes to your nighttime routine if needed.

Hormones play a significant role in this process, particularly cortisol and growth hormone, which your body releases at night. Cortisol, known as the stress hormone, can raise blood sugar by triggering gluconeogenesis – a process where your body produces glucose from non-sugar sources. Growth hormone, which aids in growth and metabolism, can also increase blood sugar by making your body less responsive to insulin.

In addition to these hormonal effects, another important factor is the dawn phenomenon. This natural occurrence causes blood sugar to rise in the early morning hours due to hormone changes that prepare your body for waking up. During this process, your liver increases glucose production, contributing to higher morning blood sugar levels.

Understanding these factors will help you develop strategies to keep your blood sugar stable, which we will cover in the rest of this video.

Second, pay attention to your evening meal choices.

To manage your overnight blood sugar levels effectively, make smart choices about your meals and snacks, focusing on the types of carbohydrates you consume.

Carbohydrates are divided into three types: sugars (such as those found in table sugar, honey, and fruits), starches (like those in potatoes, rice, and bread), and fiber (found in vegetables, whole grains, and legumes).

While sugars and starches can quickly raise blood sugar levels, fiber stands out as it doesn’t spike your blood sugar. This is because your body can’t break down most fibers. Therefore, when choosing low-carb dinners to keep your blood sugar stable through the night, opt for fiber-rich foods that have little to no sugar or starches.

Incorporate foods high in soluble fiber, which slows digestion and glucose absorption, directly improving blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity. Good options include oats, beans, lentils, flaxseeds, berries, avocados, chia seeds, apples, barley, and Brussels sprouts. These foods can help regulate your blood sugar levels more effectively.

In addition to choosing the right foods, timing your carb intake is crucial. Try to eat most of your carbs earlier in the day, like at breakfast and lunch, when your body can use them better. This helps reduce their effect on your blood sugar in the evening.

While it’s generally best to avoid late-night snacks, if you must have one, opt for healthier options like a small handful of nuts, a hard-boiled egg with whole-grain crackers, low-fat cheese with cucumber slices, celery sticks with unsweetened peanut butter, plain Greek yogurt with berries, or air-popped popcorn without added butter or salt.

Following these steps not only helps control your blood sugar, but also promotes better overall health, helping you wake up feeling refreshed and balanced.

Third, get regular exercise to better control glucose levels.

Exercise plays a vital role in managing blood sugar levels, so find creative ways to stay active. Incorporate enjoyable activities like dancing, hiking, or gardening into your daily routine.

When you engage in physical activity, your body utilizes glucose more effectively, leading to improved blood sugar regulation. The benefits extend beyond the workout itself, as enhanced insulin sensitivity continues even after exercising. This helps lower blood sugar levels not just during the activity but for hours afterward.

Moreover, consistent exercise combats insulin resistance, a condition where cells become less responsive to insulin, potentially leading to elevated blood sugar. By making physical activity a part of your lifestyle, you can help your body become more efficient at processing glucose, ultimately reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other related health issues.

To maintain this habit long-term, find a routine that fits your lifestyle and preferences. Whether you choose to take a brisk walk, join a fun workout class, or play a sport, staying active is a powerful tool in managing blood sugar levels and promoting overall well-being.

Next, stay properly hydrated to regulate blood sugar.

Hydration plays a crucial role in flushing out excess blood sugar, and understanding this process can significantly impact your health. Your kidneys serve as the primary flushing organ in your body, filtering blood and removing waste products, including excess glucose.

When you hydrate well, your kidneys can function optimally, effectively excreting surplus sugar through urine. This natural process helps maintain balanced blood sugar levels and prevents complications associated with elevated glucose.

However, be mindful of when you hydrate to avoid sleep disruption. While it’s important to drink enough water, consuming large amounts right before bed can lead to frequent trips to the bathroom during the night, interrupting your sleep cycle. To strike a balance, hydrate adequately throughout the day, ensuring you meet your body’s needs without overloading your system before bedtime.

Staying hydrated consistently helps your body manage blood sugar levels more effectively, as water aids in the transportation of nutrients and the regulation of bodily functions. Additionally, proper hydration can help curb cravings and reduce the likelihood of consuming sugary snacks, further supporting blood sugar management.

Make a conscious effort to drink water regularly and mindfully to enhance your overall health and well-being. Remember, proper hydration is not just about quenching thirst; it’s a vital component in maintaining optimal bodily function and effectively managing blood sugar levels.

Finally, use medications and supplements for blood sugar management.

Medications and supplements play a significant role in blood sugar management, particularly for individuals with diabetes.

SGLT2 inhibitors, a common class of medications, work by preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, allowing excess sugar to exit through urine. This mechanism not only helps lower blood sugar levels but can also lead to weight loss and reduced blood pressure, benefiting many patients.

However, be aware of potential side effects like urinary tract infections, dehydration, and in some cases, ketoacidosis, a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. Therefore, work closely with your healthcare provider to monitor for adverse effects and adjust treatment as needed.

In addition to medications, incorporate supplements to further support overall health and blood sugar management. Supplements such as chromium picolinate, berberine, cinnamon, benfotiamine, and naringin can help improve insulin sensitivity and regulate blood sugar levels.

Chromium picolinate enhances insulin sensitivity, allowing cells to more effectively utilize glucose.

Berberine has been shown to improve insulin resistance and reduce glucose production in the liver.

Cinnamon may help lower blood sugar by mimicking insulin and increasing glucose transport into cells.

Benfotiamine, a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1, can help prevent glucose-induced damage to blood vessels and nerves.

Naringin, a flavonoid found in citrus fruits, may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation associated with high blood sugar.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/sleeping-90-minutes-less-immune-system/,Sleeping 90 Minutes Less Than Your Normal Turns Your Immune System Against You,"Having trouble sleeping? You’re not alone. More than a third of American adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis. (Updated Oct 10, 2024)

Yet, each year, new studies related to sleep show just how important it is for overall health. Lack of sleep has been found to weaken your immune system and increase your risk for all sorts of chronic diseases in the short term and over time.

Thanks to a recent study, researchers now have additional insight as to why. According to the study, Inconsistent sleeping patterns during the night can physically alter the DNA inside stem cells.

Stem cells mostly live in the bone marrow (the spongy center of certain bones). One of the main functions of these cells is to produce white blood cells, which are essential to your immune system.

Counterintuitive results..

As a result of getting less sleep than normal, participants in the study showed an overproduction of white blood cells. So why is flooding the body with white blood cells a bad thing?

Because it can cause your immune system to overreact and trigger inflammation. This can lead to heart disease and other inflammatory disorders.

“The stem cells have been imprinted, or genetically altered, under the influence of sleep restriction,” said study team member Filip Swirski, PhD, director of cardiovascular research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

For the study, a group of healthy adults had their blood tested before a six-week period of sleep restriction, in which they slept 90 minutes less than their normal. At the end of the experiment, blood was drawn again revealing higher levels of both the stem cells and the white blood cells.

In another study, researchers kept waking up mice several times at night, artificially creating fragmented sleep rather than just reduced duration. The end result showed a similar response. The mice experienced an increase in stem cells and white blood cells, as well as altered cell DNA.

“It shows that in humans and mice, disrupted sleep has a profound influence on the programming of immune cells and rate of their production, causing them to lose their protective effects and actually make infections worse — and these changes are long-lasting,” Swirski said in a statement.

Catch-up sleep does not seem to rectify the problem.

Even after the mice were given time for recovery sleep, the negative effects remained.

“Our findings suggest that sleep recovery is not able to fully reverse the effects of poor-quality sleep,” said the research paper’s first author, Cameron McAlpine, PhD, an assistant professor of cardiology at Icahn Mount Sinai.

The limits of catch-up sleep were already discovered in previous studies. Even if it feels like you’ve recovered, and you “get back to feeling normal,” some permanent damage on a cellular level may have already been done to the body and brain.

Experts say that losing sleep in one night can be made up the next day, but only partially. Not getting your normal amount of sleep across several days or weeks is almost guaranteed to cause irreparable harm, even if all you see is dark circles under your eyes and a cranky mood.

“Sleep impacts optimal functioning of nearly every cell and organ in the body,” said Marishka Brown, PhD, director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research. While Brown wasn’t involved in the research, she did mention that this new study “supports findings from larger population studies, which have shown that sleep can have a protective effect against a variety of conditions, including heart disease, cancer, and dementia.”

In general, adults should be getting anywhere between seven to eight hours of sleep. Although there are exceptions to the rule. We all know one person who can get away with just five to six hours of sleep.

It’s even more important for children and teenagers to get adequate amounts of sleep during their growing phase. Unfortunately, a staggering 77.9% of high school students don’t get the minimum suggested amount.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/dissolve-blood-clots/,8 Nutrients You Need to Dissolve Blood Clots Now!,"Today, we’re exploring natural ways to maintain healthy blood flow and prevent unwanted clotting. This knowledge is valuable if you want to prevent heart attacks, strokes, clots related to atrial fibrillation (Afib), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and more. In this video, I’ll share eight nutrients and lifestyle tips that can help prevent and dissolve blood clots and promote better circulation.

First, let’s understand how your body’s clotting process works.

When you get a cut or injury, your body has a remarkable system to stop bleeding quickly, called the coagulation system. This system mainly uses two key components: platelets and fibrin.

Platelets are tiny cell fragments in your blood that act like natural band-aids. When you’re injured, they rush to the cut and stick together, forming a temporary plug to slow bleeding. However, this platelet plug alone isn’t enough to completely stop blood loss. That’s where fibrin comes in.

Fibrin starts as a protein called fibrinogen that’s dissolved in your blood. When you’re injured, fibrinogen is converted into fibrin, which forms long, sticky strands. These strands weave through the platelet plug, creating a mesh-like structure that traps more blood cells and platelets. Think of it like this: if the platelets are bricks in a dam, fibrin is the cement that holds everything together, creating a strong barrier to stop blood flow.

However, while this process serves a critical function, it can also pose serious health risks when clots form abnormally or fail to dissolve as they should. In such cases, these undissolved clots can obstruct blood flow, leading to dangerous conditions.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, typically in the legs. This can cause swelling and pain in the affected area. The real danger arises if a piece of the clot breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs, resulting in a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.

Blood clots also play a significant role in other serious cardiovascular events. In the case of a heart attack, a blood clot can block a coronary artery, cutting off blood supply to the heart muscle. Similarly, when a blood clot travels to the brain and blocks an artery, it can cause a stroke by depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients.

Therefore, maintaining optimal blood flow is crucial – allowing clotting when necessary but preventing it when it’s not. While blood-thinning medications are often prescribed to manage this delicate balance, they can come with side effects, such as increased risk of bleeding and gastrointestinal issues.

As a result, many people seek natural alternatives. Fortunately, nature offers many options that can effectively help regulate blood consistency with minimal (if any) side effects. In the next segment, we’ll explore these natural options in detail, starting with the first of our eight key nutrients.

As always, this information is educational and does not constitute medical advice. Remember to consult with your doctor before taking any new supplements, especially if you’re already on blood thinners, or have any existing health conditions.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/maca-women/,"Maca Powder: The Perfect Food For Hormone Imbalance, Anxiety, Energy, Sleep, And Libido","Although centuries old, maca comes from the brassica (mustard) family, similar to turnip, cabbage, and watercress (1). This root was first considered a superfood by the Incans who grew this hearty plant high in the Andes Mountains of Peru. (Updated Sept 27, 2024)

They valued maca, which they commonly called Peruvian ginseng, for its incredible sources of vitamins, minerals, proteins, fiber, carbohydrates, tannins and amino acids, as well as a number of complex alkaloids and up to 20 essential fatty acids, along with numerous other phytochemicals.

The healing properties of maca were so powerful, in fact, that Incan imperial warriors regularly ate it prior to battle to help increase their “fighting spirit,” strength, stamina, and libido. Although relatively small, this vegetable was so potent that its use was restricted mainly to royalty and their court. Incans respected the value of this plant so much they even used it as a form of payment (2).

Today, many athletes and even bodybuilders still use maca to help build their strength, stamina and overall performance (3, 4). But maca has another, lesser known benefit that researchers are only beginning to understand. This potent vegetable has the ability to balance hormones, which makes it invaluable for both men and women in various stages of life. However, maca is especially good for women during menopause.

Maca For Women
Regulates Hormonal Imbalances

Maca is considered to be an endocrine adaptogen. While it does not contain any hormones itself, it does contain the necessary nutrients to support normal hormone production within your body. One of these nutrients is DIM (Diindolylmethane), a phytochemical that is found in many cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cabbage. DIM has been found in numerous studies to greatly improve hormone balance (both estrogen and testosterone) in both men and women. It has also been found effective against some forms of cancer (5).

Research shows that maca can actually help to normalize hormone levels by working with your endocrine system. For women, maca can be a lifesaver, especially when most conventional options typically involve synthetic forms of hormones that are proven to be dangerous, even causing such things as ovarian cancer, stroke, and asthma, among other things (6,7,8).

Essentially, maca provides the nutrients your body needs to naturally produce its own hormones to effectively restore balance. In comparison, conventional hormone treatments introduce synthetically made chemicals that can wreak havoc on your endocrine system. Hormone regulation is vital as these substances are responsible for virtually every process in your body.

Reduces Symptoms of Menopause

Because maca can help to balance hormones, it is extremely helpful for women to reduce the typical symptoms associated with menopause.

One 2006 study reveals that maca can help to alleviate the negative physiological and psychological symptoms experienced by women in perimenopause, such as the frequency of hot flashes, the incidence of night sweats, interrupted sleep, nervousness, depression, and heart palpitations. Researchers state, “It appears that Maca-GO may act as a toner of hormonal processes, leading to alleviation of discomfort felt by perimenopausal women, hence, its potential use as non-hormonal alternative to HRT program.” (9)",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 27, 2024"

We often take vitamin D for granted, assuming our bodies get enough from sunlight. But did you know that despite the seemingly simple process of vitamin D synthesis, deficiency is shockingly common? Studies show that about one in four Americans lack sufficient vitamin D, with some experiencing severe deficiency.

While certain groups are at higher risk, including those who always use sunscreen, people with darker skin, older adults, and individuals with limited sun exposure, vitamin D deficiency can affect anyone. And the symptoms? They’re not always what you’d expect.

Sure, a blood test is the only surefire way to diagnose vitamin D deficiency. But before you rush to the doctor, wouldn’t you like to know about the weird and unusual ways your body might be trying to tell you something’s amiss?

In today’s video, we’ll reveal twelve strange and lesser-known signs that could indicate you’re running low on the sunshine vitamin. Recognizing these symptoms of vitamin D deficiency is crucial for your health and well-being, so make sure you watch this video till the end.

First, we need to understand the five most common symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, as these are related to the unusual symptoms we’ll mention next.

Common Symptom ONE. Fatigue and Tiredness.

Vitamin D deficiency can cause a bone-deep exhaustion that persists even after a full night’s sleep. Imagine struggling to get out of bed every morning, feeling like you’ve run a marathon just from climbing a flight of stairs, or finding yourself unable to focus on simple tasks due to overwhelming tiredness.

Common Symptom TWO. Muscle Weakness or Aches.

The muscle weakness linked to vitamin D deficiency can significantly affect daily activities. You might find it challenging to rise from a seated position without using your arms, or struggle to climb stairs and perform other activities that require leg strength. There’s often a sensation of heaviness in the limbs, particularly in the thighs and upper arms, and some people may experience unexplained muscle tremors or twitches.

Common Symptom THREE. Bone and Joint Pain.

Vitamin D deficiency can cause a deep, penetrating ache that’s often mistaken for arthritis. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and bone health, and its deficiency can lead to increased pain and inflammation in the joints. This pain is most noticeable in weight-bearing joints like hips and knees, and many people experience a dull, persistent ache in the lower back that doesn’t improve with typical back pain remedies. There may be tenderness when pressure is applied to the breastbone or shin bones, and the pain often worsens at night or when lying down.

Common Symptom FOUR. Depression or Mood Changes.

The mood changes associated with vitamin D deficiency can range from mild to severe. Vitamin D is known to influence neurotransmitter function and mood regulation, making its deficiency a potential contributor to mental health issues. You might experience persistent feelings of sadness or emptiness, lose interest in activities you once enjoyed, or struggle with irritability or unexplained mood swings.

Common Symptom FIVE. Getting Sick More Frequently or Easily.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in your immune system. A deficiency can weaken your body’s ability to fight off infections. You might notice more frequent colds or flu-like illnesses, along with longer recovery times from common infections. There’s often an increased vulnerability to unusual infections, and those with autoimmune conditions, like multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus, may experience a worsening of their symptoms.

Now that we’ve covered the common symptoms, let’s explore some less obvious signs that your body might be crying out for more vitamin D.

Let’s begin with number 12. “Bone Fractures and Osteoporosis”.

Remember that bone pain we talked about earlier? Well, in severe cases, vitamin D deficiency can lead to more serious bone issues. It can significantly impact bone density and strength, leading to an increased risk of fractures, especially in the hips, wrists, and spine. You might experience height loss over time due to compression fractures in the spine, or develop a stooped posture or a curved spine (kyphosis).

Next, we have number 11. “Psoriasis and Eczema”.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in skin health, helping to regulate the immune response and reduce inflammation. Its deficiency can exacerbate skin conditions, leading to dry, itchy, and inflamed patches of skin. In psoriasis, this may manifest as thickened, scaly plaques, while those with eczema might experience increased skin sensitivity and irritation. Skin lesions may heal more slowly, and symptoms often worsen during winter months when sun exposure is limited.

Moving on, we have number 10. “Tooth Decay and Gum Disease”.

Vitamin D is essential for maintaining oral health, as it helps regulate calcium and phosphate levels, crucial for strong teeth and gums. A deficiency in vitamin D can increase the risk of dental caries (cavities) and gum inflammation and bleeding (gingivitis). Tooth enamel may be weakened, leading to increased sensitivity and decay. In children, tooth development may be delayed, while adults face an increased risk of periodontal disease.

The next symptom, is number 9. “Problems Sleeping Well”.

If dental issues weren’t surprising enough, did you know vitamin D can affect your sleep too? Vitamin D deficiency can disrupt sleep patterns in various ways. You might have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, experiencing restless sleep with frequent waking. Overall sleep duration may be shorter, leading to increased daytime sleepiness. There’s also a higher risk of sleep disorders like sleep apnea.

Moving on to number 8, we have “Heart Problems”.

Vitamin D plays a vital role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining heart function. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with various cardiovascular issues. There’s an increased risk of hypertension (high blood pressure) and a higher likelihood of developing coronary artery disease. You may face an increased risk of heart failure and potential for irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias).

The next unusual symptom, is number 7. “Reduced Cognitive Function”.

Vitamin D is crucial for brain health, influencing neurodevelopment and cognitive processes. When deficient, this can manifest as difficulties with memory, focus, and overall mental clarity, often leading to frustration and decreased productivity. You might experience memory problems, particularly short-term memory loss, and difficulty concentrating or focusing on tasks. Processing speed and reaction times may be slower, and there’s an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults.

Coming up, is number 6. “UTIs and Incontinence”.

Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of urinary tract infections and issues with bladder control, particularly in women. These conditions can be both uncomfortable and embarrassing, often affecting daily life significantly. The link between vitamin D and urinary health is directly connected to the immune system. Vitamin D is essential for immune function, and a deficiency can leave you more susceptible to frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) that are difficult to clear. There may be increased urgency to urinate and difficulty fully emptying your bladder. Additionally, weakened pelvic floor muscles can lead to stress incontinence.

The next weird symptom, is number 5. “Hair Loss”.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the hair growth cycle, and a deficiency can disrupt this process, leading to noticeable hair loss. While hair loss has many causes, vitamin D deficiency may contribute to increased hair shedding and slowed hair growth. Thinning hair, particularly noticeable on the scalp, is common, and in severe cases, patchy hair loss (alopecia areata) may occur.

Moving on next, we have number 4. “Slow Wound Healing”.

If you’ve noticed that cuts and scrapes seem to take forever to heal, it might be another sign of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is needed to repair and regenerate tissues, and a deficiency can lead to slower healing of cuts, scrapes, and surgical incisions. There’s an increased risk of wound infections and delayed closure of wounds. Prolonged inflammation at wound sites is common, and there’s potential for abnormal scarring.

The next lesser known symptom, is number 3. “Excessive Sweating”.

Excessive sweating, particularly on the head, can be a surprising sign of low vitamin D levels. This isn’t just normal perspiration from exercise or heat. You might experience excessive sweating even in cool environments or with minimal physical exertion. This condition often manifests as a constantly damp forehead or scalp. These sweating episodes can occur without any apparent trigger and may be one of the earliest symptoms of vitamin D deficiency to appear.

Coming up next, is number 2. Binge Eating.

Compulsive or binge eating behaviors could be linked to low vitamin D levels. Research has shown a potential connection between vitamin D deficiency and increased urges to act rashly, particularly in relation to eating habits. This manifests as consuming large quantities of food in a short period, often accompanied by feelings of loss of control. You might find yourself engaging in spontaneous snacking or experiencing episodes of binge eating. This isn’t just about lack of willpower; it could be your body’s way of signaling a vitamin D deficiency. Those with low vitamin D levels may also report eating in response to emotions or engaging in nighttime eating.

And at number 1, we have “Anxiety Attacks”.

Research has shown an association between vitamin D deficiency and increased anxiety symptoms. While anxiety has many potential causes, low vitamin D levels may contribute to anxiety disorders. Anxiety symptoms may include persistent worry, restlessness, and physical sensations such as a racing heart, sweating, chest tightness, and an overwhelming sense of unease. These symptoms typically build gradually rather than appearing suddenly.

There you have it! Twelve unusual symptoms of vitamin D deficiency.

If you experience a combination of these symptoms, it’s important to consider if low vitamin D levels could be at play. Remember, while these symptoms can indicate vitamin D deficiency, they can also be caused by other conditions. Always consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.

While sunlight is the best natural source of vitamin D, you can also get it from certain foods like fatty fish (such as salmon and mackerel), egg yolks, fortified dairy products, mushrooms exposed to UV light, and cod liver oil. In some cases, your doctor may recommend vitamin D supplements to help boost your levels.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 25, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/4-real-risk-factors-for-heart-disease-you-need-to-know/,4 Real Risk Factors For Heart Disease You Shouldn’t Ignore,"The world is full of information. It’s also full of misinformation. Sometimes it’s hard to know which is which, especially when evidence arises that contradicts conventional wisdom. (Updated Sept 20, 2024)

Whom do you trust? Diet fads, scientific theories, and experts come and go–but Nature remains. When it comes to what you eat, getting as close to her as possible always seems the safest bet.

Arterial Plaque Causes Heart Disease, Not Cholesterol.

Cholesterol doesn’t cause heart disease. Consuming fats doesn’t cause heart disease. The accumulation of gunk in your artery walls is what causes heart disease. Arterial plaque–like dental plaque–is a sticky accumulation of waste that gets stuck in your arteries:

“Risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, infections and smoking cause damage to the artery walls. As the body attempts to repair these injured spots, plaque forms. It’s a misnomer that plaque is just fat; it’s a graveyard of dead red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, cholesterol from those dead cells, and numerous different organisms including bacteria and viruses. That’s what is in the plaque–not just fat and cholesterol.”

Medical Director of Northwestern Wellness Center Larry Kaskel, MD is a lipidologist who believes the conventional wisdom around saturated fat, cholesterol, and heart disease is misdirected. Its focus is on symptoms, not cause.

He believes the primary risk factor of heart disease is inflammation in the artery walls, even going so far as to suggest that it’s an infectious disease caused by inflamed plaque scabs. Makes sense, since we know that inflammation in the body causes many other chronic conditions and disease like rheumatoid arthritis, Chron’s disease, and asthma.

If there are unhealthy bacteria and viruses stuck in the goo, we can see how the accumulation of plaque could cause not only arterial restriction but manifest any number of symptoms.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 20, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/mineral-to-remove-age-spots/,The #1 Mineral To Remove Age Spots,"Today, we’ll explore the crucial role of zinc, the most important mineral for combating age spots, which are especially common in people over 50. We’ll then build on this by looking at three natural remedies that can help reduce these unwanted blemishes, and share a simple, homemade recipe to promote clearer, healthier skin.

As you get older, your skin changes in many ways. One of the most noticeable changes is the appearance of age spots, also known as liver spots or sunspots. These spots are not just a cosmetic issue; they’re a sign that your skin is reacting to years of sun exposure.

When your skin is exposed to the sun for a long time, it produces too much melanin, the pigment that gives your skin its color and protects it from the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiation. If your skin is also lacking in zinc, it can’t repair itself properly, making age spots more noticeable and affecting your skin’s overall health.

But, what exactly is the connection between age spots, melanin, and zinc deficiency?

Understanding this link is crucial for removing age spots and maintaining healthy skin.

First, let’s clear up a common myth. Liver spots have nothing to do with your liver’s health. The name “liver spot” comes from an outdated idea that these spots were linked to liver problems because of their color. But that’s not true.

In reality, liver spots or age spots, are a form of hyperpigmentation, which occurs when the skin produces excess melanin, leading to darkened patches or spots. This is a natural reaction to years of sun exposure, as well as changes that occur in the skin as you age.

Let’s explore melanin a bit more, so you understand how age spots actually form.

You see, increasing melanin production is actually your skin’s defense mechanism. When you’re out in the sun, melanin absorbs harmful UV rays, which helps prevent DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer.

Now, the special cells in your skin that make melanin are called melanocytes. As you get older, you might have fewer of these cells, but the ones you have left, can actually start working harder in certain areas. This means they produce excess melanin, which can clump together and form age spots in these areas. At the same time, having fewer melanocytes in other areas can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, making it more prone to damage.

So, what causes your skin to produce too much melanin?

There are several triggers, including UV radiation, oxidative stress (from air pollution, smoking, alcohol consumption, chemicals, poor diet, and lack of sleep), glycation (such as when glucose in your bloodstream binds to collagen in your skin), diabetes, some medications, chronic stress and hormonal changes.

Knowing these triggers is important for keeping your skin healthy and glowing. By understanding what leads to age spots, you can take proactive steps to protect your skin. A natural approach that includes essential nutrients, can be highly effective in reducing age spots, and managing melanin overproduction.

This involves limiting your sun exposure to short periods for your skin to produce vitamin D, managing stress, and eating a balanced diet rich in antioxidants and essential minerals.

In particular, zinc stands out as a crucial mineral that plays a significant role in skin health and melanin regulation.

Zinc is a vital mineral present in various organs, including the skin, liver, and kidneys, and it plays an essential role in numerous bodily functions. To maintain optimal health, a daily intake of zinc is necessary.

One of zinc’s key roles is supporting immune function by helping the body fend off infections. Zinc is also crucial for skin repair processes. Specifically, it promotes cell regeneration and repair, which is crucial for healing and maintaining a youthful appearance. Moreover, zinc contributes to collagen production, supporting skin elasticity and firmness.

Zinc regulates melanin production by inhibiting the enzyme tyrosinase. This regulation helps prevent excessive melanin production, which can lead to age spots and uneven skin tone. Furthermore, zinc possesses anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe irritated skin and reduce acne outbreaks.

Unfortunately, zinc deficiency is common in the population, often due to inadequate dietary intake or absorption issues. This can lead to various skin problems, including an increased risk of infections and slower wound healing.

To avoid these issues, ensuring adequate zinc intake is important. The recommended daily dosage is around 11 mg for men and 8 mg for women. Excellent food sources of zinc include oysters, beef, crab, chickpeas, and cashews.

In addition to zinc, three other essential nutrients also play a critical role in preventing age spots.

First, selenium is another mineral that helps maintain skin health and reduce melanin production. It works by supporting glutathione, a powerful antioxidant that protects skin cells from damage and premature aging. Selenium also shields the skin from UV stress, which can cause age spots. You can get selenium from foods like Brazil nuts, fish, turkey, and grass-fed beef.

Second, vitamin C is particularly beneficial, as it not only brightens the skin, but also aids in collagen production, and helps to inhibit melanin synthesis by blocking tyrosinase.

Third, antioxidants are crucial in combating oxidative stress, which can lead to premature aging and pigmentation issues. Incorporating antioxidant-rich foods into your diet, such as berries, nuts, and green leafy vegetables, can enhance skin health from within.

Additionally, consider topical creams containing these natural ingredients to provide targeted support for reducing aging spots. Check out our recommended age spot solution at this link.

By embracing these natural remedies, you can foster healthier skin and diminish the appearance of pigmentation, promoting a more even skin tone and overall radiance.

Next, let me share a simple recipe for removing age spots.

To create a simple paste for treating age spots, you’ll need baking soda and lemon juice.

Start by mixing two tablespoons of baking soda with one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice in a small bowl until a thick paste forms. Next, apply the paste directly to the age spots using a cotton ball or your fingertips, gently massaging it into the skin. Leave it on for about 10-15 minutes before rinsing with warm water. For larger areas, simply adjust the ingredient quantities accordingly to ensure full coverage.

It is generally recommended to use this treatment 1-2 times a week to avoid over-exfoliating the skin. Alternatively, you can use it daily for a short period, such as 15-30 days, and then take a break for the same duration before repeating the treatment.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 17, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/real-cause-of-hypertension/,The REAL Cause of Hypertension Revealed,"Today, we’re going to explore the root causes of hypertension and how to manage it naturally. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a serious health issue that often signals underlying problems rather than being the main cause. If not managed well, it can lead to severe health problems, which is why it’s crucial to address the root causes rather than just treating the symptoms.

Unfortunately, many people focus on symptom management, which can result in poor health outcomes. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other serious issues, while also affecting daily life with symptoms like tiredness, shortness of breath, and a lower quality of life.

Since essential hypertension, which makes up 90-95% of cases, often has no clear cause, managing it can be challenging. But by understanding the contributing factors like lifestyle, genetics, and diet, you can make informed choices to reduce your hypertension risk and boost your overall health.

In this video, we’ll explore the six key factors contributing to high blood pressure, and share practical tips to help you reduce your risk and improve your overall well-being. So let’s get into it.

First, let’s talk about vitamin D and its impact on blood pressure.

Did you know that a vitamin D deficiency is closely linked to high blood pressure? It’s because vitamin D plays a crucial role in regulating the body’s water pressure control system, which manages blood volume and pressure. When vitamin D levels are low, your kidneys hold onto more sodium, leading to water retention, which in turn raises blood pressure by putting extra pressure on your blood vessel walls.

And since sunlight is a primary source of vitamin D, seasonal variations in sunlight exposure – especially during those dark winter months – can significantly impact your vitamin D levels, increasing your risk of hypertension. So, it’s important to maintain adequate vitamin D levels to support your cardiovascular health and keep your blood pressure in check.

Some studies back this up, showing that taking vitamin D supplements can actually help lower blood pressure in people who are deficient in it. However, vitamin D’s impact on blood pressure is complex and can be influenced by other factors, which we’ll get into later.

Next, the second essential nutrient that affects blood pressure is potassium.

Potassium plays a crucial role in balancing out sodium levels in your body, which is important for keeping your kidneys healthy and flushing out excess sodium that can lead to high blood pressure. But here’s the thing: many people aren’t getting enough potassium because they’re not eating enough fruits and veggies. This makes them more sensitive to sodium and more likely to develop high blood pressure.

So, what can you do? Start loading up on potassium-rich foods like bananas, avocados, sweet potatoes, spinach, potatoes, tomatoes, oranges, beets, and Swiss chard. And avoid or reduce your intake of processed foods, which are often the single source of excess sodium. By doing this, you’ll counteract the effects of sodium on your blood pressure, and support your overall heart health.

The third root cause of high blood pressure is genetics.

Did you know that your genetic makeup can play a significant role in both high blood pressure and vitamin D absorption issues? It’s true – some people have genetic variations that make it harder for their bodies to absorb vitamin D, which is crucial for maintaining healthy blood pressure levels. Even if you’re doing everything right with your diet and lifestyle, your genetic makeup could still be affecting your vitamin D levels and increasing your risk of hypertension.

But here’s the good news: genetic testing can give you valuable insights into your genetic makeup and help you make informed decisions about your diet, supplementation, and overall health management. For example, if you have a genetic variation that affects vitamin D absorption, you might need to take higher doses of vitamin D supplements or make specific dietary changes to ensure you’re getting enough.

Next, let’s look at the impact of insulin resistance on blood pressure.

Insulin resistance is a condition where your body’s cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels and a host of other problems, including high blood pressure, obesity, and abnormal cholesterol levels. This is also called metabolic syndrome. The thing is, insulin resistance is often triggered by lifestyle choices, like eating too many refined carbs and sugars, and carrying excess weight around the midsection.

So, take a step back and think about your own diet – are you fueling your body with whole, nutritious foods, or are you relying on processed and sugary snacks? The good news is that by making some simple changes to your diet, you can improve your insulin sensitivity and reduce your risk of hypertension. Focus on whole foods, fiber, and healthy fats, and try to limit your intake of refined carbs and added sugars.

Next, let’s talk about the fifth factor that can affect your blood pressure: magnesium levels.

Magnesium plays a crucial role in supporting vitamin D metabolism and regulating blood pressure. But here’s the thing – if you’re not getting enough magnesium, it can actually make hypertension worse by disrupting normal vascular function and blood pressure control.

So, take a closer look at your diet. Are you getting enough magnesium-rich foods like leafy greens, nuts, seeds, whole grains, dark chocolate, avocados, and legumes? If not, you might need to consider supplements like magnesium glycinate to meet your daily requirements.

Low magnesium levels can also impede vitamin D’s effectiveness, which is essential for calcium absorption and cardiovascular health. The good news is that by getting enough magnesium, you can boost vitamin D function and improve blood pressure management – a win-win for your overall cardiovascular health.

The sixth major factor that influences blood pressure is calcium intake.

Calcium is essential for bones, but here’s the thing: too much of it can cause problems. Excess calcium can stiffen arteries and increase blood pressure, and without enough vitamin K2, it can even lead to calcification of your blood vessels, impairing blood flow.

To achieve this balance, you can follow these simple steps: focus on getting calcium from whole food sources, like dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified foods. Also, include vitamin K2-rich foods like fermented cheeses, natto, sauerkraut, kefir, and egg yolks in your diet.

As for calcium supplements, it turns out that they may not provide the expected benefits and could even increase the risk of heart disease. Studies have shown that calcium from food sources is more effective for building bone density than supplements. Consider adding alternative sources into your diet, such as sardines and anchovies, which are not only rich in calcium but also provide healthy omega-3 fatty acids.

Next, let’s explore some natural alternatives that can help manage blood pressure.

You might be surprised to learn that magnesium and vitamin D can be awesome additions to your conventional hypertension medications.

Magnesium is like a natural calcium channel blocker. It helps relax your blood vessels, improving blood flow and lowering blood pressure levels. Vitamin D, on the other hand, acts like a natural beta blocker. It regulates your heart function and blood pressure, keeping everything running smoothly.

So, have you considered adding magnesium and vitamin D to your hypertension management plan? It could be a great way to boost vascular health and reduce cardiovascular risk. Just be sure to chat with your healthcare provider first – they’ll help you figure out if it’s safe and right for you, considering your individual needs and any meds you’re already taking.

Next, here are a few simple strategies to incorporate in your daily routine to keep your blood pressure in check.

First, consider taking a daily vitamin D supplement – usually between 1,000 to 2,000 IU – as recommended by your healthcare provider. This can help support your cardiovascular health and keep your heart happy.

Next, focus on eating a balanced diet that’s rich in potassium, magnesium, and other essential nutrients. Think leafy greens, fruits, and whole grains. These anti-inflammatory foods can help lower your blood pressure and keep your heart healthy. Get your free anti-inflammatory diet plan at the link below.

Regular physical activity and stress management techniques can also make a big difference. Whether it’s going for a walk, practicing yoga, or simply taking a few deep breaths, finding ways to relax and move your body can help keep your blood pressure in check.

By combining these strategies with a better understanding of what contributes to hypertension, you can take proactive steps to improve your health and reduce your risk of cardiovascular complications. Remember, it’s all about making small changes that add up to big benefits over time. So, start making healthy changes today and take control of your blood pressure!",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 13, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-to-heal-knee-pain-and-boost-cartilage/,Top 10 Foods to Heal Knee Pain and Boost Cartilage,"Today, we’re going to discuss something crucial for your overall health: foods that can help maintain healthy and strong joints. The cartilage in your joints, particularly in your knees, acts as a cushion, enabling smooth and pain-free movement. However, as you age, suffer injuries, or follow a poor diet, this cartilage can begin to deteriorate, leading to issues like osteoarthritis. This can result in pain, stiffness, and difficulty performing everyday tasks.

To better understand this issue, let’s delve deeper into what cartilage is. Cartilage is a flexible yet strong connective tissue that covers the ends of bones in joints, serving as a cushion to prevent friction and wear during movement. It is composed of a dense network of collagen fibers and proteoglycans, which allows it to withstand pressure and provide smooth, seamless movement.

Unfortunately, the loss of cartilage can have severe consequences. Cartilage deterioration can have a devastating impact on your quality of life, making everyday activities a struggle. Common joint diseases associated with cartilage deterioration, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, can lead to bone-on-bone contact, chronic pain, and limited mobility. Imagine being unable to walk, run, or even bend without experiencing sharp pain in your joints.

However, there is hope. The good news is that you have the power to take control of your joint health. In fact, making simple dietary changes can make a significant difference. In this video, we will explore the top 10 nutrient-rich foods that can help support and promote knee cartilage health.

Age-related dementia and the increase in the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease in the elderly have prompted scientists to take a closer look at the causes of cognitive decline. (Updated Sep 8, 2024)

There is a correlation between diet, lifestyle, toxins in the environment and brain health. There are things you can do to keep your brain (and the rest of you) healthy by paying attention to your bodily needs. Getting enough sleep and exercise goes without saying.

Specifically, vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and healthy gut flora are part of a normal diet and optimizing these will help maintain cognitive faculties. Additionally, there are three foods that you may not be getting any or enough of that have been shown to prevent cognitive decline.

1. Coconut oil

Once dismissed as having too much fat, it turns out this is one of the healthiest things you can eat and it doesn’t take much (one to two tablespoons a day) of this versatile oil to reap its nutritional benefits. It tastes good, too!

Coconut oil keeps your brain healthy as its medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are a source of energy to maintain an adequate fuel supply. Make sure the coconut oil is raw and organic.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamins-for-hip-arthritis/,Top 3 Vitamins for Hip Arthritis – Say Goodbye to Hip Pain,"Today, I’m going to share a number of natural tips to prevent hip osteoarthritis. Over the last 30 years, there’s been an epidemic of people experiencing arthritic changes in the hip. The elderly are at the greatest risk, but those who eat poorly, are overweight, or take excessive medication are also vulnerable. In fact, one of the biggest issues is ignoring symptoms and pursuing completely incorrect treatments.

Understanding Hip Osteoarthritis

Cartilage is a robust and viscoelastic connective tissue found in the joints. It resembles a foil covering your bones and is very firm, smooth, and moist. The building blocks of cartilage include collagen, elastin, water, and other components.

When you have hip osteoarthritis, the main problem is the wear and tear of the cartilage. Unfortunately, very few people understand what happens after the onset of hip osteoarthritis, and even fewer know how to treat this condition naturally. As the cartilage deteriorates, you’ll experience more pain, stiffness, and difficulty with mobility. After many years of hip damage, you may be at significant risk of needing surgery.

Now, you can halt these inflammatory processes in natural ways. Vitamins play a key role in protecting your hip.

Three Vitamins to Protect Your Hip

Vitamin C plays a vital role in the production of collagen, the main building block of cartilage. It aids in healing connective tissue and is essential for forming strong, healthy cartilage. Consuming adequate amounts of vitamin C daily is crucial to support this process and prevent issues like osteoarthritis. Foods rich in vitamin C include citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes, red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe. So, make sure to consume adequate amounts of vitamin C daily.

Another essential vitamin for your hip joint is Vitamin D. Over 70% of people have a chronic deficiency of vitamin D. It is extremely important for immunity, metabolism, nerves, and crucially, for bones, joints, and cartilage. Without vitamin D, these structures decay more quickly. That’s why you should expose yourself to sunlight whenever possible, for 30-60 minutes each day. However, many people don’t do this because they spend most of their time indoors and miss out on the main source of vitamin D, which is the sun. If you can’t get enough sunlight, take vitamin D from foods or supplements daily.

The third key vitamin for hip protection is Vitamin K. It comes in two forms, K1 and K2. Our body needs calcium to build and maintain bones. When it metabolizes calcium, vitamin K2 activates a protein that helps the mineral bind to our bones. While research is ongoing, studies show that a higher intake of K2 improves bone density and reduces the risk of osteoarthritis.

Additional Nutritional Supplements

Additionally, apart from collagen, your cartilage is made up of substances called glucosamine and chondroitin. If you have hip osteoarthritis, you should take glucosamine and chondroitin most of the year, especially glucosamine sulfate. These can be easily purchased at a pharmacy or health food store. When you start taking these substances, pain, swelling, and stiffness decrease rapidly.

I have a few more extraordinary nutritional supplements that can significantly help: SAM-e, MSM (active sulfur), and turmeric with piperine (1000-3000 mg daily). Another important natural anti-inflammatory is astaxanthin. Take it most of the year.

Lifestyle Changes

Be sure to practise “intermittent fasting“, which is excellent for hip health.

Regular gentle exercise is just as important as diet. It strengthens muscles that support the joints, improves flexibility, balance, and mood, and can relieve pain significantly.

Being overweight puts undue strain on weight-bearing joints such as your knees, spine, hips, ankles, and feet. Losing weight can ease symptoms of arthritis.

A good night’s sleep will help you cope with the pain and stress of arthritis. Try going to bed at the same time every night and remove distractions from your bedroom.

By taking the right supplements, you can expect much better hip health. Please pay attention to these tips, especially if you are over 50 years old.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 6, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/nighttime-signs-of-diabetes/,15 Nighttime Signs of Diabetes You Shouldn’t Ignore,"Diabetes can manifest in various ways, especially at night. It is crucial to recognize these nighttime signs to prevent further damage to your organs, particularly the kidneys. In this article, we will explore the common nighttime symptoms of diabetes and provide insights into their causes and potential remedies.

1. Frequent Nocturia

One of the most common nighttime signs of diabetes is frequent urination, known as nocturia. This occurs when there is too much sugar in the blood, and the kidneys filter it out, leading to dehydration. The body naturally tries to eliminate this excess sugar, which is toxic, and in doing so, also loses fluids, making you dehydrated.

2. Excessive Thirst

Diabetics often experience excessive thirst due to dehydration. The body retains sodium when blood sugar levels are high, leading to a feedback loop where you drink more water, urinate excessively, and become dehydrated again. This cycle also results in the loss of essential minerals like potassium, magnesium, and calcium.

3. Restless Leg Syndrome

Restless leg syndrome is another symptom, often caused by a deficiency in vitamin B1 and magnesium. Consuming high amounts of refined carbs or sugars can lead to these deficiencies, causing lactic acid buildup in the muscles, leading to fatigue and restlessness.

4. Peripheral Neuropathy

Peripheral neuropathy involves pain, numbness, or burning sensations in the lower feet. This condition worsens at night due to increased blood pooling and pressure on damaged nerve endings. A combination of B vitamins and alpha-lipoic acid can help alleviate these symptoms.

5. Leg Cramps

Leg cramps are related to magnesium deficiency, which is common in diabetics. When magnesium levels are low, calcium builds up inside the cells, leading to muscle contraction rather than relaxation. Magnesium glycinate is recommended to help with both cramps and sleep.

6. Excessive Sweating

Excessive sweating at night, particularly in the face, neck, or upper body, can be a sign of diabetes. This is due to the body being in a state of fight or flight mode, activating adrenaline and leading to increased sweating.

7. Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a condition where there is not enough oxygen due to air obstruction in the throat or sinuses. This is often linked to insulin resistance, where the body tries to protect itself from too much glucose, leading to weight gain.

8. Hypoglycemia

Low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, can cause you to wake up in the middle of the night with stress hormone activation. This is due to high insulin levels trying to push blood sugars down.

9. Delayed Sleep

High sugar levels can delay the release of melatonin, making it difficult to fall asleep. Adopting a low-carb diet can help correct this issue.

10. Gastric Reflux

Gastric reflux or GERD can be exacerbated by blood sugar issues affecting the autonomic nervous system, which controls the valves in the body, including the stomach valve. A low-carb ketogenic diet and eating earlier in the day can help manage this symptom.

11. Nightmares and Vivid Dreams

Nightmares and vivid dreams can be related to neurotransmitter problems, often due to a deficiency in vitamin B1. Consuming too many carbs or being diabetic can deplete B1 levels.

12. High Blood Pressure

Non-dipping blood pressure, where blood pressure does not decrease at night, is common in diabetics. This can lead to feeling awake and alert during the night.

13. Palpitations

Palpitations can occur due to a lack of electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium. Using a good electrolyte powder can help alleviate this symptom.

14. Teeth Grinding

Teeth grinding is a result of the activation of the fight or flight mechanism, leading to stress and jaw muscle activation during sleep.

15. Morning Headaches

Morning headaches are often due to dehydration and a lack of electrolytes. Drinking water and replenishing electrolytes can help prevent these headaches.

Understanding these nighttime signs of diabetes is crucial for early detection and management. By recognizing these symptoms and making appropriate lifestyle changes, such as adopting a low-carb diet and managing blood sugar levels, you can significantly improve your health and prevent further complications.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 5, 2024"

https://dailyhealthpost.com/drink-wheatgrass-everyday-to-keep-gray-hair-away/,Watch What Happens To Gray Hair When You Start Drinking Wheatgrass Every Day,"Gray hair can make you look a lot older than you really are. Although there’s nothing wrong with having a little gray in your mane, many people prefer to hide it under an expensive dye job. Gray hair is inevitable as you age, but recent studies suggest that you may be able to delay it by adding more wheatgrass into your diet. (updated Sep 5 2024)

Why Does Hair Turn Gray ?

Pigment cells located at the base of each hair follicle are responsible for the color of your hair. As you grow older these cells begin to die, leaving your hair gray. Naturally occurring hydrogen peroxide can also build up in the hair, bleaching the color (1).

In some people, gray hair can be a sign of nutritional deficiency (B-12) or thyroid problems. However, in Traditional Chinese Medicine, hair pigmentation is influenced by the quality of blood and the strength of the kidneys (2).

What is Wheatgrass ?

As its name suggests, wheatgrass is the young grass of the wheat plant. It’s typically sold in natural health foods as a powder, capsules or as seeds that are grown, harvested and juiced.

Wheatgrass is said to be good for the blood because it’s high in chlorophyll.

Chlorophyll is used by plants to trap light and create energy. It’s fat-soluble, so it needs to be taken with healthy fat, like coconut oil, in order to be properly absorbed into the bloodstream (3).

How Wheatgrass Prevents Gray Hair

Research suggests that chlorophyll decrease oxidative damage induced by chemical carcinogens and radiation. It’s currently being studied as a chemopreventive agent for liver cancer (4). It’s also believed to directly fight tumors (2).

The College of International Hollistic Studies explains that protects the liver and the blood by neutralizing toxic substances like cadmium, nicotine, strontium, mercury, and polyvinyl chloride (2).

Additionally, it’s believed that these mechanisms prevent cell aging, including the aging of hair pigment cell. It contains antioxidants that fight the natural aging process associated with the production of free radicals.

Also, the molecular structure of chorophyll is remarkably similar to that of hemoglobbin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This might explain its capacity to improve blood quality and oxygen transportation to the scalp.

How To Use Wheatgrass

Wheatgrass promotes blood flow and packs a nutritional punch of vitamins and mineral that feed hair follicles and the hair shaft.

To use, it’s recommended that your drink 1-2 fluid ounces of fresh-squeezed juice daily or take 1 tablespoon wheatgrass powder a day (2).

You can use it as a conditioner by pouring 1-2 ounces of fresh juice on clean, wet hair. Let it sit for 5 minutes and rinse thoroughly. Follow up with a vinegar rinse and style as usual.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/cancer-dies-when-you-eat-these-10-foods/,Cancer Dies When You Eat These 10 Foods – Discover the Top Cancer-Fighting Foods,"Understanding how to combat cancer through diet begins with recognizing what fuels cancer cells. Cancer cells have a unique way of generating energy that gives them a survival advantage. This is known as the Warburg effect, where cancer cells predominantly rely on glycolysis—a process that breaks down glucose for energy—even in the presence of oxygen. This preference for glucose allows cancer cells to proliferate rapidly, especially in environments with high blood sugar levels.

Additionally, factors like chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and a weakened immune system can further promote cancer growth.

Many people mistakenly believe that a single “superfood” can cure cancer. However, this approach overlooks the complexity of cancer metabolism and the need to address multiple contributing factors. To effectively combat cancer, it is crucial to adopt a holistic dietary strategy that not only starves cancer cells of their preferred fuel but also strengthens the body’s natural defenses.

Incorporating specific foods into your diet can help starve cancer cells and support overall health. Here are the top 10 foods that can play a crucial role in combating cancer:

1. Avocados: Rich in healthy fats, avocados do not raise blood sugar levels.
2. Leafy Greens: Packed with nutrients, these vegetables support overall health without increasing glucose.
3. Non-Starchy Vegetables: These vegetables are low in carbohydrates, making them ideal for reducing glucose intake.
4. Extra Virgin Olive Oil: A source of healthy fats that supports heart health and reduces inflammation.
5. Butter: Provides healthy fats without raising blood sugar.
6. Coconut Oil: Known for its healthy fats, it is a staple in ketogenic diets.
7. Meat, Fish, and Chicken: When sourced naturally (grass-fed, wild-caught, pasture-raised), they provide essential nutrients without high carbs.
8. Nuts and Seeds: Low in carbs and high in fiber, they help maintain stable blood glucose levels.
9. Mushrooms: Contain beta-glucan, which stimulates immune function.
10. Berries: Rich in antioxidants, they help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation.

Combating Cancer with Anti-Inflammatory Foods

Chronic inflammation is a known driver of cancer. Incorporating anti-inflammatory foods into your diet can help mitigate this risk. Garlic, turmeric, and ginger are rich in anti-inflammatory compounds. Fatty fish, high in omega-3s, also help regulate inflammation naturally.

Detoxifying Carcinogens and Supporting Liver Health

The liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying carcinogens. To support liver function, it’s important to limit sugar and alcohol intake. Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli contain glucosinolates, while tomatoes provide lycopene, both aiding liver detoxification. Garlic and eggs supply sulfur compounds and choline, respectively, essential for liver health.

Boosting the Immune System with Nutrient-Rich Foods

A strong immune system is vital in fighting cancer. Foods like garlic, ginger, and mushrooms enhance immune function. Bell peppers, rich in vitamin C, support the immune system without the high sugar content found in citrus fruits.

Maintaining Hormonal Balance

Hormonal imbalances, particularly involving estrogen and insulin, can contribute to cancer risk. A low-carb diet helps maintain healthy insulin levels, crucial for hormone regulation. Broccoli, which contains indole-3-carbinol, aids in balancing estrogen levels. Healthy fats from fatty fish and olive oil also support hormonal health.

Reducing Oxidative Stress with Antioxidants

Oxidative stress can create an environment conducive to cancer. Natural antioxidants found in berries, dark chocolate, green tea, turmeric, tomatoes, and pomegranates help neutralize free radicals.

Promoting Gut Health

Gut health is linked to immune function, inflammation, and hormone balance. Fermented foods like sauerkraut and yogurt, along with prebiotics such as asparagus and garlic, support a healthy gut microbiome.

Avoiding Processed Foods

Processed foods high in sugar and white flour can increase cancer risk by raising blood sugar and driving inflammation. They also contain chemicals that may disrupt hormonal balance and compromise gut health. Prioritizing whole, natural foods is essential for cancer prevention.

By understanding and implementing these dietary strategies, you can support your body’s natural defenses against cancer. Emphasizing whole, nutrient-rich foods while minimizing processed options creates a holistic approach to cancer prevention and overall health.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 4, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/connection-between-acute-kidney-injury-and-dementia/,Scientists Uncover an Alarming Connection Between Acute Kidney Injury and Dementia in Older Adults,"A recent study has shed light on a potential new risk factor for dementia: acute kidney injury. Researchers from the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have found that individuals who experience acute kidney injury are at a significantly higher risk of developing dementia, particularly Lewy body dementia or Parkinson’s disease-related dementia.

Understanding Acute Kidney Injury and Dementia

Acute kidney injury occurs when the kidneys suddenly stop functioning correctly. This condition can have severe consequences, including a higher risk of mortality and potential disruption of the blood-brain barrier.

Dementia, on the other hand, affects cognitive abilities, leading to memory loss, loss of language skills, and emotional issues. It is caused by changes in certain brain regions that cause neurons and their connections to stop working

The Study’s Findings

The study analyzed data from around 300,000 adults aged 65 and older, with a median follow-up of 12.3 years. The researchers found that individuals who had acute kidney injuries had a 49% higher chance of developing dementia compared to those who did not have an acute kidney injury.

The severity of the acute kidney injury also played a role, with more severe cases or those requiring hospitalization associated with a higher dementia risk.

Implications and Recommendations

The study’s findings could lead to significant changes in clinical practice. Jason Krellman, PhD, an associate professor of Neuropsychology in Neurology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, noted that the study identifies individuals with acute kidney injury as a population that should be monitored for dementia and cognitive decline

Krellman recommended that patients with acute kidney injury should lower their vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes, by adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle.

Sham Singh, MD, a psychiatrist at Winit Clinic in Santa Monica, CA, emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary care approach. He suggested that regular cognitive assessments could become a standard part of follow-up care, enabling early detection of potential dementia.

These findings are published in the journal Neurology.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 4, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/two-ages-when-your-body-starts-to-decline-sharply/,Scientists Uncover the Two Ages When Your Body Starts to Decline Sharply – 44 and 60,"A recent study has shed new light on the aging process, challenging the long-held belief that aging is a slow and steady process. Researchers have discovered that humans experience two significant bursts of aging, one at 44 and another at 60, which have profound implications for our understanding of aging and age-related diseases.

The Study’s Groundbreaking Findings

The study, published in the journal Nature, analyzed data from over 4,000 people aged 20-80 and found that the aging process is not a gradual decline, but rather a series of sudden and dramatic changes. The researchers used a combination of machine learning algorithms and biological data to identify the two key milestones in the aging process.

The First Burst: 44 and the Onset of Middle Age

The first burst of aging occurs at around 44, marking the beginning of middle age. At this stage, the body’s physiological systems start to decline, leading to a range of age-related changes, including weight gain, decreased physical strength, and reduced cognitive function. This milestone is characterized by a significant increase in the expression of genes associated with aging, inflammation, and cellular stress.

The Second Burst: 60 and the Onset of Old Age

The second burst of aging occurs at around 60, marking the beginning of old age. At this stage, the body’s physiological systems experience a further decline, leading to a range of age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cognitive decline. This milestone is characterized by a significant increase in the expression of genes associated with cellular senescence, a state in which cells become damaged and are no longer able to function properly.

Implications for Aging Research and Age-Related Diseases

The study’s findings have significant implications for aging research and the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases. By understanding the two key milestones in the aging process, researchers can develop targeted interventions to prevent or delay the onset of age-related diseases. Additionally, the study’s findings highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management, to mitigate the effects of aging.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/oil-to-remove-dark-spots/,One Miracle Oil to Remove Dark Spots “Overnight”!,"In this article, I’ll share with you how to naturally and safely remove age spots using the best oil to remove dark spots. Read till the end to learn about the worst methods for removing age spots and the biggest mistakes you might be making.

Understanding Age Spots

Age spots are flat, dark areas on the skin that often appear in people over the age of 50. While they are usually harmless, they can sometimes indicate more serious health issues. The primary causes of age spots include a lack of vitamin C and zinc, excessive sun exposure, and the accumulation of lipofuscin in the body. Lipofuscin is an accumulated waste product that manifests on the skin. In other words, age spots can signal an excess of toxins and free radicals in your body.

The Best Oils for Age Spot Removal

**Rosehip Oil**: The first oil you’ll need is rosehip oil. This oil is extracted by cold-pressing the seeds from rosehip fruits. It is a rich, golden-red oil of exceptional quality. Rosehip oil is quickly absorbed by the skin, leaving no greasy residue, and it nourishes while forming a protective layer to prevent dehydration. It’s rich in vitamin A and essential fatty acids, making it effective for treating visible signs of aging, stretch marks, acne scars, and inflammation. Rosehip seed oil is considered a “dry oil,” meaning it absorbs quickly into the skin.

**Wild Rose Oil**:The second oil you need is wild rose oil. This oil is obtained by cold-pressing carefully dried wild rose fruits, often from Rosa canina and R. rubiginosa. Wild rose oil is known as a treasure trove of antioxidants and serves as a rich moisturizing balm that can reduce wrinkles and heal scars. It contains a high concentration of retinoic acid, a natural precursor of vitamin A, which has been clinically proven to restore damaged tissue. This makes it excellent for reducing acne scars, injuries, and burns. It’s also recommended for acne care due to its ability to speed up the healing process. The vitamin C in rosehip oil brightens and evens out the complexion, making it a fantastic natural treatment for reducing hyperpigmentation.

**Vitamin E Oil**: Known for its antioxidant properties, vitamin E oil is essential for skin health. When combined with rosehip and wild rose oils, it creates a powerful emulsion that can help reduce age spots. Ensure you purchase high-quality oils from reputable manufacturers.

DIY Emulsion Recipe

To create a natural emulsion for age spots, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a 30 ml glass container with a lid.
2. Add 20 ml of wild rose oil, 10 ml of rosehip oil, and 20 drops of vitamin E oil.
3. Mix well to create the emulsion.
4. Apply this mixture to age spots 2-3 times a day for 30 days, followed by a 30-day break.

Oral Supplement: Grape Seed Extract

For internal support, I recommend Grape seed extract. Grape seed extract, derived from the seeds of grapes (Vitis vinifera), is packed with compounds like tannins, oligomeric procyanidins, catechins, epicatechins, vitamin E, and linoleic acid. Taking grape seed extract in capsule form can help remove accumulated toxins and reduce free radical damage.

Lifestyle Changes: Diet and Exercise

An important aspect of skin health is maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise. One effective dietary approach is intermittent fasting, which I have practiced for over 5 years. This method can rejuvenate the body and help remove age spots.

Conclusion

To sum up, use the special emulsion made from these oils on your skin, take grape seed extract capsules, and practice intermittent fasting. This regimen will help make your age spots disappear. However, if you continue to eat poorly, smoke, drink alcohol, and maintain an unhealthy lifestyle, your age spots will likely worsen, and no oil will help. You must make an effort to live a healthy life if you want to get rid of age spots. Remember, nothing comes easily in life, but with exceptional effort, you can achieve great results.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 2, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/common-supplement-mistakes/,Top 11 Common Supplement Mistakes You’re Probably Making – Discover the Truth,"Taking supplements is a common practice, but there are 11 mistakes that many people make. Let’s start by addressing a common belief: some people think they don’t need supplements because they can get all the necessary nutrients from their diet. However, it’s nearly impossible to get enough vitamin D from food alone. Additionally, certain foods, especially refined carbs, can actually deplete your body of essential nutrients.

Common Mistake #1 When Taking Supplements: Timing

Timing is crucial when it comes to taking supplements. You might want to consider taking most of your supplements in the morning. This ensures that these nutrients are available when you need more energy throughout the day. However, timing can vary from person to person, so feel free to experiment to find what works best for you.

It’s also important to avoid taking electrolytes right before bed, as they can cause your body to lose fluids. While some people find that taking vitamin D in the morning works best, others prefer taking it before bed to help with sleep. Also, avoid taking calcium supplements right before meals, as calcium can neutralize stomach acid and interfere with digestion.

Mistake #2: Taking Too Many Supplements at One Time

Swallowing too many supplements at once can be difficult and even dangerous. Consider taking your supplements with a meal to help them go down easier. If you’re trying to address a specific health issue, introduce supplements one at a time to see which ones are effective.

Mistake #3: Introducing Too Many Supplements at Once

When you’re trying to solve a health problem, introducing multiple supplements simultaneously can make it hard to determine which one is working. Always add them one at a time, especially when targeting a specific issue.

Mistake #4: Poor Diet

Relying on vitamins to make up for a poor diet is a mistake. If you’re consuming too many carbs, you might experience bloating, and vitamins won’t solve that problem. It’s crucial to ensure you’re getting enough protein, particularly at breakfast. Without a balanced diet, you’ll likely still feel tired, no matter how many vitamins you take.

Mistake #5: Going for the Cheapest Vitamin Possible

Opting for the cheapest vitamins, like “one-a-day” types, can be problematic. These often contain ingredients like calcium carbonate, similar to what’s found in cement. Many of these vitamins are made from petroleum and chemicals. Some vitamin companies are owned by chemical companies, big pharma, or junk food brands, which often use the cheapest ingredients. For instance, synthetic antioxidants like beta carotene can have side effects and may even increase cancer risk.

Mistake #6: Drug Interactions

If you’re on medication and consider taking a supplement with a similar effect, it might worsen the problem. For example, combining a high blood pressure medication with a supplement that also lowers blood pressure could result in dangerously low levels. Always consult your doctor before adding supplements to your regimen.

Mistake #7: Vitamin and Mineral Interactions

Certain vitamins and minerals can interact negatively. For instance, taking high doses of vitamin D3 without magnesium can be problematic, as magnesium is essential for vitamin D’s effectiveness. Similarly, long-term high zinc intake can lead to copper deficiency. Minerals often work in pairs, like sodium and potassium, so consuming a lot of salt without potassium can be an issue.

Mistake #8: Taking Advice from Unqualified Sources

Be cautious about taking advice from people who offer opinions on vitamins without proper evaluation. There’s limited time in school to fully grasp biochemistry, so it’s crucial to seek opinions from experienced individuals in the field.

Mistake #9: Not Taking High Enough Doses

You might not be taking sufficient doses of certain vitamins to achieve a therapeutic effect. Genetic factors can make it harder to absorb some nutrients. For example, many people have genetic issues with absorbing or converting vitamin D, necessitating higher doses. Vitamin B1 is another nutrient often taken in insufficient amounts, as the RDAs are too low for therapeutic benefits.

Mistake #10: Not Supplementing If You’re Vegan

If you’re vegan, you’re missing out on animal-based nutrients and need to supplement your diet. Essential supplements include B12, D3, omega-3 fatty acids, iron, zinc, iodine, and calcium.

Mistake #11: Incorrect Dosing

Proper dosing is critical, especially for vitamin D, which should be taken daily. Vitamin D is vital for your immune system, and its half-life is about 24 hours.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/1-vitamin-to-eliminate-swollen-legs-and-ankles/,#1 Vitamin to Eliminate Swollen Legs and Ankles,"Are you tired of dealing with pitting edema, swollen legs, and a round face that hints at underlying blood sugar issues? These symptoms can be frustrating and often linked to various health problems such as liver, kidney, or heart issues. You might even be worried that you’re consuming too much sodium. These concerns can be overwhelming and confusing.

I can understand the anxiety of not knowing the root cause of your edema, and the fear of relying on medications like blood thinners or diuretics that come with unwanted side effects. You might feel trapped, unsure of how to effectively address the problem and worried about the long-term impact on your health.

But what if I told you there’s a simple, effective way to tackle pitting edema without resorting to harsh medications? I’ve been in your shoes, and I’ve found a solution that can help you resolve these issues quickly and easily. By applying the method I’m going to share with you, you can address the root cause of your edema, improve your health, and say goodbye to swollen legs and blood sugar worries.

Understanding Edema

Now, swollen legs are called edema. If you look this up, it’ll say that it’s a liver problem, a kidney problem, or a heart problem. Maybe you’re consuming too much sodium, but that’s not always the case. There’s something else way more common, and I’m going to share that with you today. This is totally easy to fix. When you apply what I’m going to show you, you will fix this very fast without taking a blood thinner or some type of diuretic to push the fluid out. I mean, those come with side effects.

When you have fluid retention, especially in your lower legs and ankles, this boils down to a problem with these little tiny pumps that are not working in your cells. You have millions and millions of these little tiny pumps that push fluid in and out of the cell. The specific pump that’s not working in this case is called the sodium-potassium pump.

The Sodium-Potassium Pump

There are some really interesting things about this pump. It uses like 30 to 40% of all the energy that is given to that cell. But if that pump goes bad, like in our house when the pump went bad, we had about a foot of water in our basement. If the pump goes bad in your body, you’re going to have a lot of fluid that is not going to be in the cells; it’s going to be outside the cells, and that’s called interstitial fluid retention.

Glycation and Blood Sugar

What’s really going on in your lower ankles is you’re getting a condition where your sugar in the blood is too high. All that sugar is connected to the protein in the blood called hemoglobin. What happens when this sugar connects to the protein in your blood is called glycation. This is a term used when you hear of the A1C test, which measures how much sugar is stuck to your blood protein and gives you an average over about three months, as red blood cells survive about three months.

When this sugar gets stuck to the blood protein, it doesn’t come off; it’s stuck there permanently until that blood cell dies. So, when you eat more sugar, you get more sugar stuck to this protein until this protein can’t work anymore. The name for this is that the protein is glycated. The main takeaway is that when you eat sugar, you destroy the ability for the blood cell to carry nutrition to the body and oxygen. This glycated protein molecule now plugs up your circulation, leading to a lack of blood flow and pooling in the lower parts of your body, causing swelling.

The Role of Sodium and Potassium

This also destroys the inside of your arteries and creates a leakiness outside the cell. The fluid that was supposed to be inside your vessels can now escape. Another thing that happens when you eat a lot of sugar is that it creates sodium retention. Not to mention, the other mineral called potassium gets locked up in the sugar. Wherever the sodium goes, the water goes. Over time, this will affect the nerves in the bottom of the feet, leading to numbness and tingling, known as peripheral neuropathy.

So yes, when you look at a diabetic, you see a lot of fluid in the ankles, but even people who are not diabetic or pre-diabetic but are heading in that direction also have fluid retention.

Essential Nutrients to Correct Edema

There is a very important vitamin to correct this, but there are two other minerals you need to get from your diet. The obvious one is potassium. The problem with potassium is that it’s not easy to get from the diet because we need so much. An average person needs 4700 milligrams. Think about what that means: if you were to eat one banana, that’s like 300 milligrams. So how many times does 300 go into 4700? You’d have to consume 15.6 bananas every day just to get your potassium, but that’s hard and a lot of sugar.

Instead, you might be better off eating avocados, more salads, and even more fruits like berries. You can get a lot of potassium from these sources. The other mineral, magnesium, is behind something called ATP, which is the energy currency of the body. Yes, you’ll get cramps if you have magnesium problems, but you’ll also have a lack of energy.

Sources of Magnesium

To get magnesium, you probably need to consume more pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds, as well as leafy greens. You don’t need 4700 milligrams like potassium; you need about 420 milligrams of magnesium. You can also get both of these from a good electrolyte powder, but make sure the electrolyte powder is high quality and doesn’t have hidden sugars.

The Importance of Vitamin B1

So, that will fix the pump, but the very reason why the pump went bad is what we want to talk about next: a deficiency of vitamin B1. When you eat sugar in the body, it has to be broken down into a smaller sugar molecule called glucose. Then it has to enter the mitochondria to be turned into energy. In order for it to go from this step to this step, this one little enzyme, transketolase, requires vitamin B1. If you don’t have enough, you will not be able to use that as energy.

The number one cause of a B1 deficiency is consuming too many carbohydrates in the refined form. For example, if you eat all this refined sugar without B1, the body has to pull from its reserves—from different tissues, organs, and glands. Eventually, you’ll be deficient. B1 is also very important as an antioxidant to protect the nerves. This is why, when you run out of B1, you get peripheral neuropathy, which is tingling, numbness, and burning on the bottom of your feet.

The point is that B1 is so important in carbohydrate metabolism and protecting you against a lot of carbohydrates. When I say protection, I’m talking about protection against glycation—this sugar connecting to the protein. B1 keeps these apart so you don’t destroy your blood cells and you have good circulation. As soon as that sugar connects to the protein, it’s permanent; it’s not coming off.

Conclusion

Magnesium, potassium, and B1 are the solutions to swollen ankles. But you also have to get the sugar out of your diet because as soon as you go back to eating refined carbohydrates, the swelling comes back.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 31, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/improve-vision-naturally/,Top 5 Drinks To Improve Vision Naturally,"Are you experiencing worsening vision, itchy eyes, or that gritty feeling like there’s sand in your eyes? Do you struggle with night vision, dry eyes, or even headaches? If you have concerns like cataracts, glaucoma, myopia, or just tired eyes, this video is for you!

These symptoms suggest your eyes need some extra care. Many people believe declining vision is just an inevitable part of aging, but that’s not true. By adopting certain habits and incorporating the drinks we’ll reveal today, you can significantly reduce your risk of eye issues.

These drinks are packed with essential nutrients recognized by the American Ophthalmology Association—healthy fats, antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and zinc. These nutrients are vital for preventing age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, and night blindness, and are supported by numerous scientific studies.

Today, we’ll explore five incredible drinks that can transform your vision and eye health. Plus, I’ll share two powerful habits to boost your eye care routine, so let’s get started

Let’s start with our fifth drink, the Avocado Smoothie.

Avocados are one of the best fruits for your eyes, thanks to their rich content of lutein and zeaxanthin. These powerful carotenoids help reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and cataracts.

So, how do they work? They accumulate in the macula, which is located at the center of the retina, the back of your eye that helps you see. The macula is responsible for central vision and fine detail, and by accumulating there, these antioxidants protect your eyes from harmful free radicals and blue light, which can cause digital eye strain and damage.

Blue light is emitted by electronic screens, LED lighting, and even natural sunlight. It can cause oxidative stress, potentially leading to macular degeneration and cataracts. Avocados also contain healthy, monounsaturated fats that can help people with glaucoma.

Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, often due to high pressure in the eye, and can cause vision loss or blindness. Macular degeneration affects the macula, leading to loss of central vision. Meanwhile, cataracts cloud the lens in the eye, causing vision loss if left untreated.

Research shows that consuming one avocado per day can increase macular pigment density (MPD) in older adults, leading to better cognitive performance and a reduced risk of ARMD.

To enjoy these benefits, blend half an avocado with milk or water, and do not use refined sugar. Choose natural sweeteners like honey or dates instead. Enjoy your smoothie and give your eyes the nourishment they deserve.

Next, our fourth drink is, Lemon Juice.

Lemon juice is rich in vitamin C, a powerhouse nutrient for your eyes. Vitamin C protects your eyes by combating oxidative stress and repairing the damage caused by it. Think of oxidative stress like a kind of rust that can damage your eyes over time. Vitamin C helps to neutralize that rust and keep your eyes healthy.

Inside your eyes, there’s a liquid called aqueous humor, which has a remarkably high concentration of vitamin C. In fact, the amount of vitamin C in the aqueous humor is approximately 25-30 times higher than in your blood. This highlights just how important vitamin C is for your eyes.

What happens if we don’t get enough vitamin C? Without it, you’re at a higher risk of cataracts, optic nerve damage, and glaucoma. Vitamin C keeps your eye’s blood vessels healthy by maintaining collagen, a protein that helps keep the cornea clear and blood vessels strong.

Fresh lemon juice is a great way to get more vitamin C. It’s a lower-calorie option compared to orange juice, and people tend to drink it in moderation due to its sour taste. Simply add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to your water or tea, or mix it with other juices for a refreshing and healthy drink.

Next, our third drink today is Almond Milk.

Homemade almond milk is a great choice for supporting eye health, thanks to its rich content of essential nutrients. Almond milk is an excellent source of vitamin E, which shields your eye cells from damage and supports healthy blood circulation in the eyes. By doing so, vitamin E helps slow down the progression of sight loss conditions and keeps your eyes healthy.

Almonds also contain some selenium, which protects the eyes from oxidative damage, and are rich in vitamin E, and monounsaturated fats (from which almond milk is made), that help reduce the risk of macular degeneration and other sight loss conditions.

Now, you may be wondering how to make almond milk at home, and it’s actually quite simple. Just soak a cup of almonds in water for 8-24 hours, blend them with 4 cups of fresh water, and strain the mixture through a nut milk bag or cheesecloth. That’s it – a quick and easy way to support your eye health with a delicious and nutritious beverage.

Avoid commercial almond milk as they often contain very little actual almond and may have added sugars.

Moving on to our second drink, we have Papaya Juice.

Similar to avocados, papayas are a rich source of lutein and zeaxanthin, two antioxidants that protect your eyes. Since your body can’t produce them, it’s essential to get them through your diet. These antioxidants act like a sunscreen for your eyes, shielding the macula and retina from damage caused by solar radiation and blue light. Without enough of these antioxidants, you’re more likely to develop cataracts, experience premature aging of the eye, or even lose your vision.

Papayas also contain other essential nutrients like beta-carotene, vitamin C, and trace amounts of zinc. These nutrients work together to maintain the health of the lens, reducing the risk of cataracts, combating free radicals, and preventing premature aging of the eyes.

And finally, we have our first juice, Spinach Juice.

Spinach is rich in beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A that supports eye health. Not only does it protect the cornea and enhance vision in low light conditions, but it also plays a crucial role in supporting proper eye lubrication and preventing dry eyes.

Additionally, spinach contains zinc, which helps delay the aging of your eyes and reduces the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Zinc also maintains the health of the retina and protects the light receptors in your eyes responsible for night vision.

So, if you find it hard to see in the dark or experience dry, irritated eyes, a deficiency in vitamin A or zinc might be the issue.

In addition, spinach is packed with other eye-healthy nutrients like lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamin C, and quercetin. These nutrients work together to provide comprehensive support for your eye health.

Now, I know what you’re thinking – spinach juice might not be the tastiest option. But don’t worry, you can easily mix it with other foods to enhance the flavor. Try blending it with lemon, papaya, carrots, or avocado; the possibilities are endless. But keep it natural by avoiding refined sugar.

And if you’re not a fan of spinach juice, that’s okay. Simply add chopped spinach to your meals – it makes the nutrients more easily absorbed by your body.

There you have it! The top 5 drinks that help improve your vision and eye health. If you’re looking for a supplement that contains all the eye health nutrients we’ve mentioned – lutein, zeaxantin, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, zinc, selenium, quercetin and more, click the link below at the end of this video.

Now that we’ve talked about spinach juice, let’s move on to two essential habits that will help you take care of your eye health.

First, drinking water is crucial for your eyes. Aim to drink at least 30 ml of water per kilogram of body weight per day, spread throughout the day. This will keep your body and eyes healthy. Just avoid drinking water during meals, as it may disrupt your digestion.

Next, getting some sunlight is vital for your eyes. Natural light regulates your sleep-wake cycle and improves your overall health. Open your window in the morning to let the sunlight in, and try to get outside during the early morning or late afternoon to nourish your retina and improve your vision. Just be sure to avoid looking directly at the sun.

By incorporating these habits into your daily routine, you’ll be taking a big step towards protecting your vision and keeping your eyes healthy for years to come.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 28, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/drinks-that-harm-circulation/,Top 5 Drinks That Harm Circulation…Clogs Your Arteries & Veins,"Today, we’ll explore the five worst drinks for your circulation. Consuming these beverages can significantly increase your risk of developing serious health issues, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver disease, high cholesterol, and ultimately, heart attack, stroke, liver problems, and kidney problems. What’s alarming is that these diseases often progress silently, causing substantial damage before symptoms even appear.

High blood pressure is a prime example of a condition that often has no symptoms. People may only discover they have it when they experience kidney damage or heart failure. This is because high blood pressure puts excessive strain on the artery walls, overloading the heart and arteries. This can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a condition in which the heart muscle thickens, reducing its pumping efficiency and potentially leading to heart failure, kidney damage, and other complications if untreated.

Moreover, high blood pressure can cause small cracks in your arteries, leading to atherosclerosis. In this condition, arteries become clogged with plaque, which causes them to narrow and harden, thereby restricting blood flow. If a plaque ruptures, it can trigger a clot, which can block the artery and lead to a heart attack or stroke. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis.

In addition, poor circulation can also cause blood to move too slowly through your veins, leading to clot formation and blockages. This can lead to symptoms such as leg pain, swelling, varicose veins, leg cramps, skin discoloration, and the feeling of heaviness in the limbs. If a blood clot in your legs breaks loose and travels to the lungs, it can cause a blockage in one of the arteries in the lungs, a serious condition known as a pulmonary embolism.

Now, the problem with drinks is that we often consume them without thinking. We grab a drink with lunch, dinner, or when we’re hot, without much thought about what we’re putting into our bodies. However, some of these drinks are not as harmless as they seem. In this video, we’ll look at five drinks that people with high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, liver problems, kidney problems, and especially those with circulation problems should avoid.

Circulatory problems are the leading cause of death globally, and account for the majority of heart attacks and strokes that claim millions of lives every year, so we need to be cautious about these drinks.

Let’s begin with our Number 5: “Sugary Drinks”.

Our fifth drink to avoid today is sugary drinks. These drinks include soda, iced tea, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, and even some flavored waters. What makes them so unhealthy? They contain a lot of added sugar, such as high-fructose corn syrup, and artificial sweeteners, as well as high levels of sodium.

Consuming added sugar has serious health consequences, including weight gain, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, insulin resistance, and fat in the liver. This is why it is crucial to limit your intake of sugary drinks.

Research has consistently shown that regular consumption of sugary drinks significantly increases the risk of heart disease and neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

A study published in the journal Circulation, which tracked 40,000 men over two decades, revealed that daily consumption of one sugary beverage increased the risk of heart attack or death by 20% compared to those who rarely consumed such drinks.

Furthermore, another study in the same journal found that consuming one or more soft drinks per day was associated with a nearly twofold higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to consuming less than one serving per week.

The problem with sugary drinks is that they can cancel out the benefits of other healthy habits. For instance, let’s say you have a nutritious lunch, like a grilled salmon fillet seasoned with lemon and herbs, accompanied by a colorful mix of roasted vegetables, such as bell peppers, zucchini, and sweet potatoes, and a small serving of quinoa or wild rice. This meal is nutritious, providing lean protein, fiber and vitamins, and complex carbohydrates.

However, if you decide to drink 2 liters of soda because it is hot outside, you are essentially undoing all the good of that healthy meal. What is the point of eating well if you are drinking something that is going to harm you, which is full of sugar?

So, what are the alternatives? Water, tea without sugar, and sparkling water with squeezed lemon are excellent choices. You can also consider homemade iced tea, smoothies made with unsweetened almond or coconut milk, and herbal teas like ginger, hibiscus, and rooibos.

Next, let’s discuss alcohol. Number 4 is “Excessive Alcohol”.

While it is widely known that excessive alcohol consumption is harmful, moderate alcohol consumption has been linked to benefits for heart health and circulation, particularly when it comes to red wine. In fact, many of us may know elderly individuals who consumed 1-2 drinks daily and lived hale and hearty to a ripe old age.

However, it is important to note that any amount of alcohol can harm the health of your liver and intestines, making your intestines more porous and increasing the risk of leaky gut syndrome, inflammation, and food intolerance. This, in turn, raises the risk of cancer.

Furthermore, alcohol consumption can contribute to increased blood pressure, damage to the heart muscle, and atherosclerosis, leading to conditions such as alcoholic heart disease. It also increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that heightens the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.

Alcohol also interferes with the absorption of essential nutrients, such as B vitamins (particularly B1, B9, and B12), vitamin C, and minerals like zinc, magnesium, and calcium.

Given these risks, moderation is key when it comes to alcohol consumption. Moderation is generally defined as up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.

Some people may claim they only drink on Saturday, but then they consume a couple of bottles. That is excessive, and concentrating excess drinking in just one day can be just as dangerous as spreading those doses throughout the week.

Therefore, if you choose to drink, do so in moderation and be aware of the risks to protect your health.

Next, at Number 3, we have “Fruit Juices”.

Let’s talk about our third drink of the day that many people consider healthy. Fruit juices, especially the commercial kind, are often perceived as healthy, but they can cause high blood sugar levels due to the concentrated carbohydrates and lack of fiber.

This issue arises because when you drink juice, you’re not consuming the whole fruit, including the pulp and peel, which are rich in fiber. As a result, this leads to a rapid absorption of sugar, causing a spike in blood glucose levels, which is harmful to your health.

Commercial juices like orange juice are a prime example of this problem. They are rich in vitamin C but lack fiber and often contain added sugar, making them an unhealthy option. Therefore, the best alternative is to consume the fruit in its natural state, eating it whole, or juicing with the skin and pulp to benefit from both the fiber and the juice.

At Humber 2, we have “High-Caffeine Drinks”.

The second type of drink we should limit or avoid is those with high caffeine content. Specifically, energy drinks contain significantly higher levels of caffeine compared to other caffeinated beverages, including caffeine-enriched drinks, strong or espresso-style coffee, and certain types of tea, such as green tea, black tea, and yerba mate.

Consuming excessive amounts of caffeine can increase blood pressure, which may be temporary in some individuals but can lead to sustained hypertension in those who are more sensitive. For example, a person who is particularly sensitive to caffeine but still consumes coffee daily may experience a cumulative effect of caffeine on blood pressure. This is especially true since many people don’t just drink one cup of coffee; they consume multiple cups throughout the day.

Furthermore, adding sugar to coffee can amplify its negative effects, similar to energy drinks that combine high levels of caffeine with large amounts of sugar. This can lead to arrhythmias, or heart rhythm disorders, that can affect your sleep. Poor sleep, in turn, can have a ripple effect on cardiovascular health, increasing the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart problems.

Given these risks, the options are clear: it is best to avoid energy drinks, especially those loaded with sugar. If you are sensitive to caffeine, consider switching to decaffeinated coffee or teas that are naturally caffeine-free, such as chamomile tea, rosemary tea, and hibiscus tea.

Before we reveal the number one drink that harms your circulation, let’s take a moment to address a related issue that may be affecting you right now.

Are you suffering from foot or leg pain? If so, there’s a safe and natural therapy that can provide fast relief in just 15 minutes. In fact, it’s possible to fix painful, swollen legs for good in less than 30 days. Check out the details below at the end of this video.

And finally at number one, we have “Drinks With Artificial Sweeteners”.

The first drink that can harm your circulation is one that contains artificial sweeteners, such as zero-calorie soda, diet soda, energy drinks, and iced tea that uses sucralose or aspartame. These drinks are often marketed as healthier alternatives to regular sugary sodas, appealing to those who want to reduce their sugar intake or manage their weight.

However, research suggests that artificial sweeteners can impact your body’s metabolism and alter the balance of good bacteria in your gut. This can have a ripple effect on various bodily functions, as these beneficial bacteria play a crucial role in keeping you healthy. Changes in gut bacteria have been linked to an increased risk of insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and heart disease.

Just because a drink doesn’t contain sugar or calories doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Zero-calorie soda and artificially sweetened drinks are definitely NOT healthy options. To substitute with healthier sweeteners, consider stevia and monk fruit.

There you have it The five drinks that you should avoid because they can wreak havoc on your circulation, contributing to the clogging of your arteries and veins.

For those of you who have health issues, such as poor circulation, diabetes, high cholesterol, anxiety, high blood pressure, or trouble sleeping, it is important to recognize that these problems are linked to your daily habits. If you do not address the root cause of these issues, taking medication, getting tested, or even talking to a doctor, will not solve the problem.

If you have hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, or are overweight, you need to change your habits and daily behaviors, as they are the source of the problem. The origin of your fatty liver, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar is what you eat, your lack of physical activity, smoking, drinking, and getting anxious or stressed about everything.

That is what causes these problems, and if you do not change what is causing them, there is no point in trying to manage the symptoms or prevent further health complications.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 23, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-herbs-for-liver/,5 Herbs Your Liver Wished You’d Start Eating More Often (Or At Least Try!),"Good healthy herbs for liver function is essential. The liver is the largest solid organ in our bodies. It can be adversely affected by poor diet and lifestyle choices, alcohol consumption, acetaminophen, non-prescription pain killers, and the myriad of toxins in our environment. It is responsible for filtering blood from toxins and converts waste products from metabolic functions into urea to be eliminated by urine. It creates bile to help digest fats and carbohydrates. (Aug 23, 2024)

It also filters out toxins from the blood stream and synthesizes glutathione, the master antioxidant that also helps recycle other spent antioxidants. It also helps balance blood sugars and creates red blood cells. As our liver goes, so goes our overall health. A poorly functioning liver can push one into diabetes. Acute liver dysfunction includes hepatitis A, B, and C, which are considered infectious, viral inflammations caused by interpersonal contact, sexual contact, or blood.

Not everyone agrees to the viral aspect of hepatitis, especially hepatitis C, but everyone agrees that inflammation is the issue. Cirrhosis of the liver is usually from too much alcohol consumption. But the latest large surge in liver disease comes from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Mainstream medicine is quick to jump on serious interventions, such as liver transplants, if they perceive too much damage for the liver to recover.

Fortunately, under the right conditions, the liver can remain very healthy or be healed regardless of the affliction because it can self-repair cell damage. There are a lot of good herbs for liver to be strong and healthy.  The doctors may not mention them but if you research your herbs, you will find many beneficial herbs.

The more serious the liver problem is, the more of these herbs can be utilized. For maintaining liver health, one or two are worth considering.

1. Milk Thistle (Silymarin)

When it comes to good herbs for liver, this is the most recommended herb of all for liver ailments and/or protecting a normal liver from daily toxins. Milk thistle is available in capsules or extracts, sometimes it’s called silymarin, which is the active ingredient that’s in the seeds.

Milk thistle is a flowering plant of the daisy family indigenous to Europe, North Africa, and the Mid-East. It has been clinically proven to improve liver function and repair liver damage. Standardized 80 percent silymarin is recommended in either pill or extract form with dosage amounts ranging from 100 to 1,000 mg.

It’s common for people with liver issues to take 300 mg three times daily. Whether the liver needs healing or protection, milk thistle can be used for as long as someone wants. It’s best to use milk thistle seeds for DIY tinctures.

2. Dandelion

This is another safe liver herb sometimes mixed with milk thistle in capsules, an excellent combination. Some prefer extracts or even teas made from dandelion. Those weird looking weeds with small yellow flowers that many complain about when they pop up in their lawns are dandelions.

In addition to being a good source of most major vitamins, the plant provides iron, potassium, and zinc. Its most cherished function is stimulating the production of bile and its flow between the gall bladder and liver to improve liver function and overall health.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 23, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/drink-banana-and-cinnamon-for-better-sleep/,What Happens When You Drink Banana And Cinnamon One Hour Before Going To Sleep,"Sleep disorders are extremely prevalent all over the world. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine published an article specifically about insomnia in March of 2014(1). The organization estimated that about 30% of young adults suffer from transitory episodes of insomnia. Approximately 10% of them experiences habitual insomnia no less than 3 days each week! (updated Aug 18 2024)

Consequences of Sleep Loss

The physiological changes caused by sleep loss can result in serious complication and disease. Some of these include a propensity in obesity, diabetes, and cardiac conditions. Psychological risks involve immunodeficiency, depression, and severe lethargy.

Sleep loss causes a reduction in:

Glucose Tolerance
Appetite Suppression Hormones
Cognitive Functions
Behavioral Alertness
Concentration & Focus

It causes an increase in:

Appetite Stimulation Hormones
Risks for Obesity
Negative Coronary Events
Cognitive Confusion
Misjudgments Resulting in Injury
Hypertension
Inflammatory Markers
Cortisol/Stress Hormone
Sympathetic Activation
Delicious Help from Nature
Potassium

A sleep study conducted by the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California-San Diego showed that potassium supplementation could be a potential treatment for sleep disorders (2). It is said to increase the efficiency of sleep in the human body.

Cinnamon

The Department Of Pharmacology at M.S Ramaiah Medical College published another trial in which they observed the physiological effects of cinnamon on various systems (3). It was found that cinnamon counteracts many of the negative aspects associated with sleep deprivation.

Cinnamon extract has been proven to reduce insulin resistance as well as increase glucose use by the brain. This is good news for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease respectively. It also has microbial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties among many other medicinal benefits.

The components of cinnamon have been documented as being both lipid lowering and cardio protective.

Chamomile

Chamomile has been used for its multi-medicinal values since ancient times. It is perhaps one the oldest herbs to have been documented for its benefits (4).

There have been numerous studies to test these health claims. Subjects who simply inhaled its pleasant smell in studies experienced noticeable decrease in stress levels. It was found to deliver benzodiazepine mimicking actions for patients who ingested an extract of chamomile.

How To Make Your Own ‘Sweet Dreams’ Tonic

Ingredients:

3 cups of filtered or spring water
1 organic banana peeled and sliced (rich in potassium)
2 tablespoons of dried, organic chamomile flowers
1/8 teaspoon of organic, powdered cinnamon

Instructions:

In a saucepan bring the water to a boil and add the banana.
Let it sit for 3 minutes and remove from heat.
Add the organic chamomile flowers and allow to steep for at least 10 minutes.
Strain the mixture in a tea cup.
Sprinkle the cinnamon.

The best results are delivered by drinking this tonic approximately one hour before retiring to bed.

Adding Cherry To The Recipe

A trial conducted by the School of Life Sciences at the Northumbria University demonstrated the effectiveness of tart cherry juice to promote sleep.

Cherries contain high concentrations of melatonin (5). This phytochemical is a critical molecule of the sleep-wake cycle regulation within the human body. Significant elevations of melatonin in subjects was observed after they drank tart cherry juice every day for 1 week.

The above recipe may be altered by reducing the water at the beginning of the preparation to 2 cups. Once the tonic has been prepared add 1 cup of organic tart cherry juice. The yield results will be the same; however, the benefits are significantly increased.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/one-shot-to-unclog-your-arteries/,One Shot To Unclog Your Arteries,"Are you tired of living with the constant fear of heart attack, stroke, dementia, and cancer looming over you? Do you want to live better and longer, but feel like your heart health is holding you back?

Your heart works hard every day to keep you alive. However, if your arteries are clogged, it’s like trying to drive a car with a blocked fuel line. This can lead to high blood pressure, thrombosis, coronary artery disease, and other conditions that can silently damage your cardiovascular system.

If you don’t take steps to protect your heart health, you may be setting yourself up for a lifetime of medication, hospital visits, and a reduced quality of life.

The good news is, there’s a simple way to take control of your heart health and reduce your risk of these serious diseases. In this video, I’ll share a powerful ‘One Shot’ recipe featuring four key ingredients that have been shown to help unclog arteries and increase blood flow.

These four ingredients address a primary underlying cause of cardiovascular disease: the inability of the inner lining of blood vessels (endothelium) to dilate fully.

They achieve this by increasing the production of nitric oxide in the endothelial cells, which then utilize it to signal the smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel walls to relax, allowing for improved blood flow and reduced blood pressure.

This natural solution makes far greater sense than simply thinning the blood with aspirin or other prescriptions to help it pass through narrower and increasingly clogged arterial spaces.

Although this “One Shot” recipe is backed by science, it’s not a magic pill. To prevent heart attack and stroke, and to ward off other diseases, you’ll also need to adopt certain lifestyle habits.

So, stay tuned until the end of this video to learn eight important lifestyle tips that will help you achieve optimal heart health and live a longer, healthier life.

So, our first principal ingredient is “Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)”.

Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is a fundamental component of the Mediterranean diet, renowned for its numerous benefits in promoting heart and artery health. Rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly oleic acid, EVOO plays a pivotal role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

EVOO is an abundant source of antioxidants, including polyphenols and vitamins, which protect cells from oxidative stress-induced damage. This harmful process, triggered by free radicals, can lead to premature cell death and contribute to aging.

The high polyphenol content in EVOO is preserved through minimal processing, involving cold pressing without heat or chemical solvents. This ensures that the antioxidant properties of EVOO are retained, providing maximum benefits for heart and artery health.

In addition to its antioxidant properties, EVOO acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, reducing inflammation in blood vessels. This has been shown to lower levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) and triglycerides, increase levels of good cholesterol (HDL), and prevent atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty plaque, cholesterol, and other residues in the arteries.

Overall, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of EVOO contribute to vasodilation, improving blood flow and reducing blood pressure, while also enhancing artery flexibility and overall cardiovascular health.

Next, our second key ingredient is chia seeds.

Chia seeds are a nutrient-dense ingredient that offers numerous health benefits. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory properties, chia seeds help reduce inflammation and improve blood vessel function, which can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Chia seeds are also an excellent source of both soluble and insoluble fiber, which complements their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The soluble fiber in chia seeds serves as a prebiotic, feeding the beneficial bacteria in the gut, which is essential for maintaining a healthy gut microbiome.

A healthy gut microbiome is closely linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, as it helps regulate inflammation, improve blood vessel function, and lower levels of harmful lipids and blood pressure.

In addition to their gut health benefits, chia seeds have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, making them a valuable ingredient in managing diabetes, a common cause of poor circulation and heart disease.

The high fiber content in chia seeds also contributes to feelings of satiety, aiding in weight loss efforts and supporting overall metabolic health, which in turn helps prevent heart disease and stroke.

Next, our third primary ingredient is turmeric.

Turmeric plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy arteries. The powerful compounds in turmeric, known as curcuminoids, which includes curcumin, offer numerous benefits for blood vessel health.

Curcuminoids in turmeric help make blood vessel walls more flexible by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability, thus protecting against atherosclerosis, or clogged arteries. This protective effect is enhanced when combined with regular exercise, highlighting the importance of physical activity for overall health.

In addition, turmeric offers additional benefits for individuals with diabetes. Turmeric has been shown to improve blood flow and strengthen blood vessel walls by enhancing the composition of collagen and elastin. This is crucial because diabetes can weaken artery walls and make them more prone to damage, leading to serious conditions such as aneurysms, heart disease, and peripheral artery disease.

Furthermore, turmeric’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may help prevent or manage other conditions associated with diabetes, such as kidney disease, nerve damage, and vision problems, by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.

Also, turmeric’s ability to promote cellular longevity, especially in the muscle cells of the heart, known as cardiomyocytes, makes it a valuable ally in promoting healthy circulation. This is especially important for individuals with diabetes, who are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

As an alternative to turmeric, curry powder can be used. Curry powder typically contains a blend of herbs, including clove, coriander, turmeric, cumin, garlic, ginger, onion, and red pepper. These herbs work together to dilate arteries and promote healthy blood flow.

Next, our fourth primary ingredient is black pepper.

Black pepper, our final ingredient, not only enhances the absorption of turmeric but also offers its own benefits for circulation. This anti-inflammatory spice contains a compound called piperine, which acts as a vasodilator, promoting the dilation and relaxation of blood vessels. By relaxing blood vessels, piperine helps to improve blood flow and reduce blood pressure.

In addition, black pepper’s ability to enhance nutrient absorption extends beyond turmeric. It also improves the uptake of other essential nutrients, including vitamins C and E, which help protect blood vessels from oxidative stress and damage, iron, which plays a crucial role in transporting oxygen to tissues and organs, and beta-carotene, which helps maintain healthy blood vessel walls and prevent atherosclerosis.

Next, let’s go over the recipe for our daily dose.

To prepare it, you’ll need a small glass or cup. Start by adding a tablespoon of olive oil and half a tablespoon of chia seeds. Allow the mixture to soak for about 15 minutes, giving the chia seeds time to absorb the oil and expand. Next, add a pinch of turmeric and a pinch of black pepper, OR a pinch of curry powder – don’t worry too much about exact measurements.

Once the mixture is ready, you can consume it in various ways. You can drink it raw, and while it may not be particularly tasty, it’s not unpleasant either. Alternatively, you can add it to a salad, use it as a topping for rice or vegetables, or substitute it for butter on bread. The key is to incorporate it into your meals in any way you prefer, as long as you consume it daily.

Each ingredient in this mixture offers significant health benefits, which contribute to a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke.

Always check with a healthcare provider before beginning this daily routine, especially if you are on any medications.

While this “One Shot” recipe can help clean your arteries, it’s not a standalone solution.

To prevent heart attack and stroke, you’ll also need to adopt healthy lifestyle habits, which I’ve outlined below.

Avoid Inflammatory Foods: Limit or avoid processed foods that promote inflammation, including:

Sugary drinks, such as soda, sports drinks, and sweet tea
Fast and fried foods, such as French fries and greasy takeout
Baked goods and refined grains, such as cookies, cakes, and white bread
Processed meats, such as hot dogs, sausage, and deli meat

These foods are high in unhealthy ingredients, including high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, trans fats, GMOs, gluten, excessive sodium, and other chemicals. Instead, focus on eating heart-healthy, nutrient-dense whole foods, such as fatty fish, grass-fed beef and organ meats, nitrate-rich vegetables like spinach and arugula, nuts and seeds, citrus fruits, and berries.

Practise Fasting: Intermittent fasting helps keep arteries clear and lowers the risk of heart disease by reducing oxidation, inflammation, and insulin resistance, while also promoting the removal of damaged cells and plaques through apoptosis and autophagy.

Get Regular Exercise: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day to increase metabolism and reduce inflammation, which helps keep your blood vessels healthy.

Get Enough Sunlight: Vitamin D, obtained through sunlight, is crucial for healthy circulation as it stimulates nitric oxide production and reduces inflammation. Aim for 15 minutes to 2 hours of midday sun exposure daily, depending on your skin tone, to achieve adequate vitamin D levels.

Reduce Toxins: Reduce your exposure to toxins from air pollution, pesticides, mold, heavy metals, and chemicals by using natural products, avoiding smoking, and drinking plenty of water to help flush out toxins, reduce inflammation, and protect your blood vessels from damage.

Get Enough Sleep: Adequate sleep can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease, with benefits comparable to a significant drop in blood pressure. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night.

Reduce Stress: Chronic stress can contribute to inflammation and cardiovascular disease by increasing cortisol levels and blood pressure. Manage stress with techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. Regular exercise and adequate sleep also help reduce stress levels.

Supplement As Needed: Certain supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and vitamin K2, can help reduce inflammation and support heart health.

By incorporating these 8 tips along with the ‘One Shot’ recipe, you can proactively maintain healthy arteries and reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 17, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/drinking-coffee-on-an-empty-stomach-is-bad/,See What Happens When You Drink Coffee On An Empty Stomach,"There are many health benefits to drinking good quality coffee. But drinking it first thing in the morning isn’t the best way to go about it. Instead it is recommended to wait at least one hour and a half after waking up before drinking coffee and for good reasons! Here’s what drinking coffee on an empty stomach will do to you: (Aug 14, 2024)

1. Low Levels of Serotonin

Very few people know about this but coffee is a strong appetite suppressant. People who drink coffee first thing in the morning sometimes end up skipping breakfast.

Skipping your first meal of the day can take a toll on your body’s ability to make serotonin (a neurotransmitter responsible for making you feel happy and calm). In addition, serotonin is very important for a good night’s sleep. Your body transforms serotonin into melatonin at dusk. And low levels of melatonin usually leads to insomnia problems.

So if you like drinking coffee, make sure to always have it with-or after breakfast!

2. Bad Digestion

Caffeine on an empty stomach disrupts digestion, leading to a bloated feeling and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome like pain and irregularity. How?

Caffeine stimulates your adrenal glands, which produce stress hormones called cortisol and adrenalin. These hormones trigger a “fight or flight” response, great when you are being chased by a wild animal, but not necessary when you are sitting  at your desk or breakfast table.

When these hormones flood your body, they increase your heart rate and blood pressure, and your liver starts releasing blood sugar to provide energy to muscles so that you can run away. Your digestive system also shuts down to divert energy to where it is needed most.

Healthier Alternatives

It’s important to drink water when you wake up. You can have either lemon water or ACV and honey water to start your day. Both these drink stimulate your digestive system and help flush out toxins.

If you’re the type of person who absolutely needs coffee to start their day, then this trick will prove useful to you.

Doing this will help reduce the harmful effects of drinking coffee on an empty stomach: simply add a little coconut oil or butter in your coffee.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 14, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/increase-leg-circulation/,One Drink to Quickly Increase Leg Circulation,"Are you among the millions of people worldwide who suffer from poor circulation? Do you experience swelling in your feet, pain in your legs when walking, or a feeling of heaviness in your legs? Do you struggle with varicose veins? If so, you are not alone. Poor circulation is a serious health issue that can significantly impact your quality of life, causing fatigue, limited mobility, and discomfort, ultimately affecting your overall well-being.

However, what’s even more frustrating is that poor circulation is often the result of certain lifestyle choices, such as consuming excessive refined carbohydrates, which can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol plaque in arteries, and neglecting regular exercise and healthy weight management, creating a vicious cycle that can worsen circulation.

But what if I told you that there is a simple way to break free from this cycle? What if I showed you a remarkable juice recipe that can improve your circulation in just a few minutes a day? This drink contains only three ingredients and can help improve circulation quality by opening up your blood vessels and promoting healthy blood flow. The best part is that you can make it at home in under five minutes. In this video, I will share with you how to do it, so you can start experiencing the benefits of improved circulation today.

However, keep in mind that this isn’t a magic solution. To get lasting results, you’ll need to adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes eating an anti-inflammatory diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight. Stick with me until the end of this video, and I’ll also share some simple exercises you can do to improve circulation in your legs and feet.

So the first ingredient in our circulation-boosting juice recipe is “beetroot”.

When it comes to food, there’s no denying that beetroot juice is the best way to boost nitric oxide production. So, what is nitric oxide? It’s a molecule that promotes vasodilation, which means the widening of your blood vessels, allowing for more blood to flow through them. This increased blood flow occurs throughout your entire body, not just in your legs and feet.

When you have narrow arteries, it’s a problem. Less blood flow reaches your feet, legs, and other parts of your body, which can lead to fluid retention. Fluid retention, also known as edema, can cause swelling, pain, and stiffness in your legs and feet, as well as more serious problems like skin ulcers and infections.

So, what causes narrow arteries in the first place? The major culprit is atherosclerosis, a condition in which plaque builds up in the endothelium, the inner lining of the arteries, causing them to narrow and harden over time. This condition often results from a combination of factors, including high levels of small, dense LDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, type 2 diabetes, and a diet high in carbohydrates, vegetable oils, and trans fats.

Beetroot juice is rich in nitrates that stimulate the production of nitric oxide in the endothelium. The endothelium converts the nitrates from beetroot juice into nitric oxide, which then signals the smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel walls to relax and dilate.

This vasodilation not only improves blood flow and reduces blood pressure, but also helps to prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries. That’s why I’ve chosen beetroot as the first ingredient in our juice. Do you like beetroot juice? Have you ever tried it before?

The second ingredient in our juice recipe is “lemons”.

I’ve chosen lemons because they are an excellent source of vitamin C, an antioxidant that plays a crucial role in collagen production, which is essential for maintaining healthy blood vessel walls.

As an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, lemons help combat oxidative stress and inflammation, two major factors that contribute to poor circulation by damaging blood vessels and disrupting blood flow. By supporting collagen production, lemons also provide blood vessel walls with the strength, elasticity, and firmness they need to function properly, and help prevent conditions like atherosclerosis, aneurysms, and varicose veins, which can lead to blood vessel damage and rupture.

In short, lemons play a significant role in maintaining overall cardiovascular health.

Finally, the third ingredient in our juice recipe is “honey”.

This natural sweetener boasts several medicinal properties that make it an excellent addition to our circulation-boosting remedy. Rich in antioxidants such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids, honey is also anti-inflammatory, helping to reduce damage to blood vessels. It also stimulates the production of nitric oxide, which contributes to vasodilation, thereby improving circulation and controlling blood pressure – a significant risk factor for poor circulation.

Next, here’s how you can make this drink to boost circulation in your legs and feet.

You’ll need a glass of beetroot juice (about 3/4 of a beetroot), a teaspoon of honey, and a whole lemon, blended with the peel and all. You can also add ice cubes and water if you prefer a more refreshing drink.

To start, slice a piece of beetroot into pieces and remove the skin. Add it to a blender, along with a whole lemon, including the peel (be sure to remove the white part to avoid bitterness).

Next, add a teaspoon of honey to the blender. If you can’t use honey, feel free to substitute another natural sweetener. Blend the mixture until it’s smooth, and add a little ice if you like.

Once you’ve blended the juice, drink it slowly. If you find the taste of beetroot too strong, you can dilute it with one to two glasses of water. Alternatively, you can make beetroot tea by boiling a few pieces of beetroot in water for 5 to 10 minutes, and then adding lemon and honey.

The key is to consume the beetroot, preferably raw, to reap its benefits. You can take this drink at any time of day – morning, lunch, or night – to enjoy the benefits of improved circulation. With its simple ingredients and easy preparation, there’s no reason not to give this juice a try.

You can also boost your nitric oxide levels by 650% in less than 20 minutes by dissolving a lozenge on your tongue. This lozenge is made from a blend of beetroot powder, vitamin C, Hawthorn Berry, L-arginine, and vitamin B12 – five nitric oxide-boosting nutrients that improve blood flow, lower blood pressure, and increase energy. To learn more about this recommended lozenge supplement, click the link below.

In addition to the drink recipe, incorporate simple exercises into your daily routine to help strengthen your leg muscles and enhance circulation.

One such exercise is ankle pumping, which involves lifting one foot off the ground and moving it up and down while seated. This motion contracts and relaxes the muscles in your lower legs, effectively pushing blood upwards towards the heart.

Then, rotating your foot clockwise and counterclockwise will contract your leg muscles, exerting pressure on the veins and facilitating blood return to the heart. This exercise also helps reduce swelling in the feet.

Another exercise you can try is toe wiggling. Simply wiggle your toes back and forth, spreading them as far apart as you can and then bringing them back together. This will help to contract and relax the muscles in your feet and toes, which can help to improve circulation.

For a slightly more intense workout, try calf raises by standing on the edge of a stair or step with your heels hanging off the edge. Slowly raise up onto your tiptoes and then lower back down to contract and relax the muscles in your calves, promoting improved circulation.

When lying down, elevate your feet to utilize gravity to your advantage. By putting your feet up, the accumulated blood and fluid in your legs will flow back down towards your heart, reducing swelling and enhancing circulation.

Doing physical activity is essential for people with poor circulation. It’s just as important as eating a healthy diet. If you have a circulation problem, you need to improve your diet and increase your physical activity.

I encourage you to start walking a little more, even if you have knee or hip pain. Simply lifting and moving your feet can make a big difference in your circulation.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 10, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/nutrients-to-unclog-your-liver/,Top 8 Nutrients To UNCLOG Your Liver,"Do you feel constantly tired? Are you dealing with brain fog, skin issues, or unexplained weight gain? These symptoms might seem unrelated, but they could all point to a common issue: your liver might be clogged, overworked, and crying out for help.

Your liver is an incredible organ, performing over 500 essential functions, including detoxifying your body, regulating hormones, and producing vital proteins.

It helps maintain healthy cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood sugar levels, aids in digestion by producing bile, and supports metabolism by processing nutrients into energy. Despite its importance, the liver often doesn’t get the attention it deserves until something goes wrong.

Think of your liver as a high-efficiency dishwasher. Over time, without proper care, it can get clogged with all sorts of “gunk”—toxins from processed foods, pollutants, and even stress. This buildup can lead to a host of problems, from chronic fatigue and skin issues to more severe conditions like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cirrhosis.

Ignoring these signs can make you feel older and more worn out than you should be, robbing you of your energy and vitality. However, most people, and even some doctors, overlook these warning signs until it’s too late.

But here’s the good news: your liver has an amazing ability to heal and regenerate if you give it the right tools. In today’s video, we’ll look at how a clogged liver can age you faster, and I’m going to share with you the top 8 nutrients that can help unclog your liver, boost its efficiency, and restore your youthful energy.

From antioxidant-rich foods to powerful herbal supplements, these nutrients will support your liver’s natural detox processes and help you feel better than you have in years.

So watch till the end to learn how you can give your liver the care it deserves and start feeling vibrant and healthy again!

First, it’s important to understand how a clogged liver can age you both inside and out.

On the outside, it can lead to visible signs of aging like dry, itchy skin, unexplained rashes, and even age spots. You might also notice unexplained weight gain, especially around the belly area.

Inside, the effects can be even more profound. A sluggish liver struggles to perform its functions efficiently, which can result in fatigue, brain fog, and poor memory. It can disrupt your hormonal balance, leading to issues like low sex drive, irritability, and trouble sleeping. Your digestion and metabolism may slow down, making it harder to maintain a healthy weight.

Additionally, a clogged liver can’t effectively filter toxins from your blood, leading to a buildup of harmful substances in your body. This toxic accumulation can accelerate the aging process, affecting everything from your energy levels to your immune system.

A clogged liver could be draining you of energy in three important ways:
B Vitamin Deficiency: When your liver is clogged, it struggles to process and distribute B vitamins efficiently, leading to constant fatigue and low energy levels due to a deficiency in these essential nutrients.
Blood Sugar Imbalance: A sluggish liver can’t manage blood sugar levels effectively, causing unstable blood sugar, energy crashes, and persistent fatigue, even if you are eating a balanced diet. Your liver plays a crucial role in balancing blood sugar levels by storing excess glucose as glycogen and releasing it when needed.
Triglyceride Buildup: A clogged liver can’t convert triglycerides into energy efficiently, leading to their buildup in your blood. This buildup drains your energy levels and makes it harder for your liver to keep you feeling sharp and active.

In essence, when your liver is clogged, it’s as if your body’s internal “dishwasher” isn’t cleaning properly, leaving you feeling and looking more tired and older than you should.

Now, let’s explore the eight key nutrients that can revitalize your liver, enhance its performance, and rejuvenate your energy levels.
First, we have Liver-Protecting Nutrient #8: Glycyrrhizin.

Glycyrrhizin, a potent compound found in licorice root, supports liver health through its antioxidant and detoxifying properties. Research demonstrates its ability to protect the liver from toxins, reduce inflammation, and improve liver enzyme levels. In one study, patients with liver issues saw an 88% improvement in liver enzyme levels and an 86% reduction in symptoms after four weeks of daily glycyrrhizin intake. Additionally, glycyrrhizin supports insulin function, glucose transport, and overall circulation.

Next, we have Liver-Protecting Nutrient #7: Phosphatidylcholine.

Phosphatidylcholine (PC), a powerful compound found in lecithin-rich foods like soybeans, sunflower seeds, mustard, and eggs, is best known for its memory-protecting effects.

PC helps the brain produce neurotransmitters essential for understanding and memorizing new information. While it preserves memory and sharpens cognitive function, PC also benefits the liver by shielding it from harmful toxins and breaking down accumulated fats and toxins that can impair liver function.

Studies show that PC can significantly reduce liver damage by promoting liver cell regeneration. In one study, rats given PC after partial liver removal experienced rapid regeneration within 30 hours.

Moving on, we have Liver-Protecting Nutrient #6: Quercetin.

The next nutrient is quercetin, a powerful antioxidant found in a variety of foods, particularly in fruits (such as apples, berries, and citrus fruits), vegetables (such as red onions, kale, and broccoli), and beverages (such as green tea, black tea, and red wine). It supports liver health by reducing inflammation, balancing gut bacteria, and improving bile production.

Studies show quercetin can help with conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It may even help cells live longer; one lab test showed that it extended cells’ life span by a whopping 60%.

Next, we have Liver-Protecting Nutrient #5: N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC).

Another compound that can help unclog liver cells is N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC).

NAC is a powerful nutrient that helps protect your liver by boosting the production of glutathione, your body’s “master antioxidant.” This increase in glutathione supercharges your liver’s ability to detoxify harmful toxins and free radicals.

NAC is not directly found in foods but can be obtained through supplements. However, its precursor or building block, cysteine, is present in various high-protein foods, such as chicken, turkey, pork, beef, fish (like tuna), yogurt, cheese, eggs, sunflower seeds, and legumes.

Studies show that NAC can improve blood flow to the liver, ensuring it gets the nutrients it needs to stay healthy and prevent damage. By enhancing glutathione levels, NAC not only supports liver health but also helps recycle other antioxidants in your body, providing a cascading effect of protection against oxidative stress.

Moving on, we have Liver-Protecting Nutrient #4: Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA).

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a powerful antioxidant that reduces liver inflammation and scarring, restores antioxidants like vitamins C and E, and aids in weight control. It is found in various foods, such as red meats, organ meats (like liver and kidney), spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, peas, potatoes, yams, beets, carrots, and Swiss chard.

Studies show ALA boosts the liver’s ability to regenerate and repair itself, making it effective for conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver damage.

Next, we have Liver-Protecting Nutrient #3: Milk Thistle.

Milk thistle, particularly its key ingredient silymarin, enhances the liver’s ability to regenerate and repair itself. Silymarin acts as an antioxidant, reduces inflammation, and detoxifies the liver, protecting it from toxins like alcohol and drugs.

Studies show silymarin improves liver function in conditions like cirrhosis, hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by reducing inflammation and promoting cell repair. Additionally, silymarin has a positive effect on blood sugar, helping to normalize fasting blood glucose levels in several randomized, controlled trials.

Coming up, we have Liver-Protecting Nutrient #2: Agaricus.

The next nutrient is Royal Agaricus (Agaricus blazei Murill), a safe medicinal mushroom with powerful effects on the liver. It protects liver and immune cells from free radicals and shields the liver from toxins.

In one study, rats injected with the liver toxin carbon tetrachloride and given Agaricus daily for eight weeks showed significantly less liver damage and normalized enzyme levels compared to those given a placebo. Agaricus also helps unclog liver cells, has antiviral properties, and inhibits melanin production, reducing age spots and blemishes.

And finally, we have Liver-Protecting Nutrient #1: Selenium.

Selenium, an essential trace mineral found in soil, is crucial for liver and skin health. It protects the liver from oxidative stress and inflammation caused by heavy metals and toxins, aiding in tissue healing and reducing liver disease risk.

Studies show that low selenium levels are linked to poor liver function, while higher levels reduce liver problems. Additionally, selenium enhances the activity of glutathione to protect the skin from UV damage.

Foods that are high in selenium include Brazil nuts, seafood, organ meats, and fortified cereals.

So there you have it: eight powerful nutrients that support optimal liver health and help you look and feel younger with more focus and energy. Instead of hunting down these nutrients individually, get them all together in one supplement. See our recommended Liver Support supplement at the link below.

Remember, your liver has an amazing ability to heal itself when given the right support. In addition to these nutrients, simple lifestyle changes like eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, and limiting alcohol consumption can go a long way in supporting your liver health and helping you feel younger and more energetic.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 3, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-peripheral-artery-disease/,10 Warning Signs of Clogged Arteries in Your Legs – Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD),"Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) often flies under the radar compared to more well-known cardiovascular conditions. Yet, it distinguishes itself with significant impacts on mobility and quality of life. This condition’s hallmark is its ability to disrupt the simple pleasures of walking or climbing stairs without pain, setting it apart in the broader landscape of vascular diseases.

PAD is primarily characterized by symptoms such as leg cramps, numbness, and a noticeable temperature difference in the lower extremities. Key manifestations of PAD include the classic symptoms of claudication, changes in skin color and texture, and slower healing of wounds on the legs and feet. Each symptom not only signifies the presence of PAD but also offers insight into its severity.

Furthermore, unique forms of PAD affect the limbs differently, with varying implications for the individual’s health and lifestyle. Delving deeper, each symptom and sign of PAD opens a window into the underlying causes, such as atherosclerosis, and potential complications like critical limb ischemia. This exploration will extend into the nuances of diagnostic approaches, modern treatment modalities, and effective prevention strategies.

The subsequent sections aim to enrich the reader’s understanding of PAD, shedding light on how to manage this condition and highlighting its significance in the broader context of cardiovascular health.

What is Peripheral Artery Disease

Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the narrowing or blockage of peripheral arteries, predominantly affecting the legs. The primary culprit behind PAD is atherosclerosis, a condition where fatty deposits accumulate in the arterial walls, impeding blood flow. This diminished circulation can manifest in various symptoms, from leg pain during physical activities to more severe complications such as critical limb ischemia.

PAD not only compromises an individual’s mobility and quality of life but also elevates the risk of stroke and heart attack, highlighting its importance in cardiovascular health. Early detection and management of PAD are crucial to mitigate its impact, emphasizing the need for awareness and understanding of this condition.

Symptoms of Peripheral Artery Disease

The symptoms of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) manifest in a spectrum, from subtle signs to more pronounced physical discomforts. A common symptom is cramping in the legs following activities such as walking or climbing stairs, a condition known as claudication. Individuals may also report persistent leg numbness or weakness, indicative of diminished blood circulation.

One particularly telling sign is when a lower leg or foot feels colder than its counterpart, signaling reduced blood flow to the area. Other symptoms include non-healing sores on the feet or legs, noticeable color changes in the skin of the legs, and an increased rate of hair loss on the feet and legs. Moreover, patients may observe that their toenails grow more slowly, and their legs appear shiny and smooth, both reflective of compromised skin health due to poor circulation.

Additionally, erectile dysfunction in men can be a symptom, underscoring the systemic nature of PAD. Early recognition of these symptoms is pivotal for prompt diagnosis and management, highlighting the critical role of awareness and proactive health measures.

Cramping after activities like walking or climbing stairs

Cramping in the legs, particularly after activities such as walking or climbing stairs, is a hallmark symptom of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). This discomfort, known as claudication, arises from diminished blood flow to the muscles and typically eases with rest.

Persistent leg numbness or weakness

Persistent numbness or weakness in the legs signals a significant reduction in blood circulation, a concerning symptom of PAD. This condition affects both the sensory and motor functions, leading to a noticeable decline in limb performance.

Lower leg or foot feels colder than the rest

A colder lower leg or foot compared to other parts of the body or the opposite limb is indicative of PAD. This symptom is a direct result of decreased blood flow, leading to a reduction in warmth in the affected areas.

Non-healing sores on lower extremities

Non-healing sores on the feet and legs are critical signs of PAD. These ulcers, resulting from poor blood flow, highlight the body’s struggle to heal and regenerate tissue efficiently.

Noticeable color changes in the skin of legs

Color changes in the skin of the legs, ranging from paleness to bluish tints, are symptomatic of PAD. These alterations are due to compromised circulation, affecting the skin’s appearance and health.

Increased hair loss on feet and legs

Increased hair loss on the feet and legs points to PAD, as poor blood flow adversely affects hair follicle health and growth capability.

Toenails grow more slowly

Slower toenail growth is a subtle indication of PAD, reflecting how reduced blood flow can impact the normal growth rate of nails.

Legs appear shiny and smooth

The shiny and smooth appearance of the skin on the legs is characteristic of PAD. This symptom is a manifestation of the skin texture changes due to decreased blood supply and nutrient delivery.

Erectile dysfunction, especially in men

Erectile dysfunction in men may also be a symptom of PAD, arising from diminished blood flow to the pelvic region, which can impair sexual function.

Signs and symptoms of PAD in the hands

Though less common, PAD can also manifest in the arms and hands, leading to symptoms akin to those experienced in the legs, such as activity-induced pain, numbness, and differences in temperature. Recognizing these signs is essential for comprehensive PAD management.

Causes of Peripheral Artery Disease

The onset of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is chiefly linked to atherosclerosis, a process where fatty deposits accumulate in the arterial walls, leading to the narrowing or obstruction of these vessels. This accumulation is the primary barrier to adequate blood flow, especially affecting the legs. Beyond atherosclerosis, several other factors contribute to PAD.

Blood vessel inflammation, limb injuries that compromise the integrity of blood vessels, congenital vascular malformations, and the adverse effects of radiation exposure are notable causes that can disrupt normal blood circulation, paving the way for PAD. Recognizing these causes is vital for pinpointing risk factors, facilitating early detection, and guiding effective disease management strategies.

Atherosclerosis as the primary cause

Atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits within arterial walls, is the foremost cause of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). Studies suggest that over 90% of PAD cases are associated with atherosclerosis, highlighting the critical role of lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and smoking in its development. Managing these factors can significantly reduce the risk of PAD.

Blood vessel inflammation

Blood vessel inflammation, or vasculitis, contributes to PAD by causing the blood vessel walls to thicken, narrow, and scar. Conditions such as giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis are examples of vasculitis that can lead to PAD. Blood tests measuring inflammation markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) can help detect this condition.

Limb injuries that damage blood vessels

Limb injuries that cause damage to blood vessels can also lead to PAD. Traumas such as fractures, muscle injuries, or even surgeries can increase the risk of PAD by damaging the vascular system. Prevention tips include using protective gear during high-risk activities and seeking immediate treatment for limb injuries.

Congenital vascular malformations

Congenital vascular malformations, which are irregularities in the blood vessels present from birth, can increase the risk of PAD. Conditions like arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) disrupt normal blood flow and can lead to PAD. Regular monitoring and, in some cases, surgical intervention can help manage these malformations.

Radiation exposure effects

The effects of radiation exposure, especially from treatments for cancer and other medical conditions, can induce PAD. Radiation therapy to the pelvis, abdomen, or lower limbs can damage blood vessels over time, leading to PAD. Patients undergoing radiation therapy should have regular vascular assessments to monitor for early signs of PAD.

Complications of Peripheral Artery Disease

Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) can lead to severe health complications, significantly affecting an individual’s quality of life. One of the most critical complications is Critical limb ischemia, characterized by drastically reduced blood flow resulting in tissue loss, non-healing wounds, and potentially necessitating amputation in severe cases. Additionally, PAD elevates the risk of stroke and heart attack, conditions linked to the atherosclerosis that not only narrows peripheral arteries but can also compromise blood vessels leading to the heart and brain.

These complications highlight the vital need for early detection, diligent management, and proactive preventive strategies to minimize the health risks associated with PAD.

Critical limb ischemia leading to tissue loss

Critical limb ischemia, a dire consequence of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), occurs when blood flow diminishes to a point that leads to tissue damage and potential tissue loss. Symptoms can include severe pain, non-healing sores, or even gangrene, indicating a critical need for medical intervention. Without timely and effective treatment, the severe restriction of blood flow may necessitate amputation to prevent further health complications.

Increased risk of stroke and heart attack

PAD significantly elevates the risk of stroke and heart attack due to the atherosclerosis that underpins both PAD and these cardiovascular events. Atherosclerosis involves the narrowing and blocking of arteries, affecting not just the limbs but also those arteries that supply blood to the heart and brain. This shared condition underscores the importance of managing PAD not only to preserve limb health but also to mitigate the risk of life-threatening cardiovascular events.

Treatment for Peripheral Artery Disease
Medications

Medications play a crucial role in managing Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), targeting various aspects of the condition to improve patient outcomes. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the types of medications commonly used:

Medication Type	Purpose	Common Side Effects
Statins	Lower cholesterol to prevent plaque buildup in arteries	Muscle pain, headache, risk of diabetes
Antiplatelet agents	Prevent blood clots, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke	Bleeding, gastrointestinal issues
Antihypertensives (e.g., ACE inhibitors)	Lower blood pressure to reduce strain on arteries	Cough, dizziness, elevated potassium levels
Cilostazol	Improve symptoms of claudication	Headache, diarrhea, palpitations
Pentoxifylline	Improve blood flow	Nausea, dizziness, headache
Surgeries or other procedures

For advanced cases of PAD where medications and lifestyle changes are insufficient, surgical interventions may be necessary. Here’s an overview of common procedures:

Procedure	Description	Indications	Recovery Time
Angioplasty and stenting	A balloon catheter is inserted to open the artery, and a stent is placed to keep it open.	Severe artery narrowing or blockage	1-2 weeks
Graft bypass	A graft (from another part of the body or synthetic) is used to reroute blood around a blocked artery.	Extensive artery blockages	Several weeks to months
Graft bypass

Choosing between a synthetic tube and a section of another vessel for a graft bypass depends on various factors, including the location and severity of the blockage, patient’s overall health, and the size of the artery being bypassed.

Lifestyle and home remedies

Lifestyle modifications are essential for managing PAD and improving overall health. Here are specific recommendations:

Diet: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins; limit vegetable oils and sugar.
Exercise: Start with supervised exercise programs; walking is particularly beneficial.
Foot care

Proper foot care is vital for individuals with PAD to prevent complications. Key practices include:

Inspection: Check feet daily for cuts, blisters, or infections.
Hygiene: Keep feet clean and dry to prevent infections.
Footwear: Wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes to protect feet from injuries.
Prevention of Peripheral Artery Disease

Preventing Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) centers on a proactive approach to maintaining cardiovascular health and minimizing risk factors. Smoking cessation is paramount, as smoking drastically elevates the risk of developing PAD and exacerbating its complications. Equally critical is the management of cholesterol and blood pressure levels, utilizing both lifestyle modifications and medications to keep these factors in check.

Embracing a heart-healthy diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while reducing vegetable oils and processed foods, is essential for arterial well-being. Incorporating regular exercise into one’s routine boosts circulation and enhances overall cardiovascular fitness. These preventive measures not only aim to stave off PAD but also pave the way for a healthier, more vibrant lifestyle.

Smoking cessation as a critical measure

Smoking cessation stands as a pivotal action in the prevention of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). Smoking accelerates the process of atherosclerosis and significantly increases the risk of developing PAD and its severe complications. Quitting smoking offers a profound benefit to cardiovascular health, markedly reducing these risks.

Managing cholesterol and blood pressure levels

Effectively managing cholesterol and blood pressure levels is essential for PAD prevention. Elevated cholesterol contributes to plaque buildup in arteries, while high blood pressure can cause arterial damage. Implementing lifestyle modifications and, when necessary, medication can help keep these critical health indicators within a healthy range, thereby diminishing the risk of PAD.

Goal	Strategy	Details
Lower LDL Cholesterol	Diet & Medication	Reduce intake of vegetable oils; consider statins if recommended by a healthcare provider.
Maintain Healthy Blood Pressure	Lifestyle & Medication	Limit sugar intake, regular aerobic exercise, and medication if prescribed.
Adopting a heart-healthy diet

Adopting a heart-healthy diet that emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, and limits intake of vegetable oils and sugar, is crucial for maintaining arterial health and preventing PAD. Such dietary habits not only aid in weight management but also play a significant role in reducing the likelihood of atherosclerosis.

Food Group	Foods to Include	Foods to Avoid
Fruits and Vegetables	Berries, leafy greens, apples	Canned fruits with heavy syrup
Whole Grains	Oats, brown rice, whole wheat bread	White bread, sugary cereals
Proteins	Fish, poultry, legumes	Red meat, processed meats
Fats	Avocados, olive oil	Trans fats, saturated fats
Regular exercise to improve circulation

Regular exercise is key to enhancing circulation and boosting cardiovascular fitness, which are vital components in staving off PAD. Engaging in physical activities such as walking, cycling, and swimming can improve blood flow, strengthen the heart, and lower the risk of developing arterial diseases.

Activity Type	Frequency	Duration
Walking	Daily	30 minutes
Cycling	3-5 times a week	30-60 minutes
Swimming	3 times a week	30 minutes",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"July 26, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/improve-circulation-in-legs-and-feet/,Top 10 Foods to Improve Circulation in Legs and Feet,"Today, we’re going to talk about the foods you should eat if you’re dealing with poor circulation. If you feel like your circulation isn’t what it used to be—maybe your legs are swollen, you’re always exhausted, your hands and feet are cold, or you’re struggling with high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart issues, or varicose veins—or if you just want to boost your circulation, this information is for you.

These symptoms can be red flags for circulatory problems, indicating that your blood vessels aren’t working as they should. If you neglect your circulation, it can result in serious cardiovascular issues down the road that could ultimately cause a heart attack or stroke.

In this video, I’m going to share some easily available, common foods that can help protect your circulation and improve blood flow. Many people think that circulatory problems are just a normal part of aging, but that’s not true. The habits and foods we’re going to talk about can significantly lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. So, without further ado, let’s get into it.

Let’s begin with Number 10. “Avocado”.

Our first recommended food is avocado. This nutrient-dense fruit is high in monounsaturated fats that help promote healthy blood circulation.

Studies show that eating two or more servings of avocado per week can decrease harmful LDL cholesterol levels, potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Avocados are rich in potassium, which helps combat high blood pressure by enabling the elimination of excess sodium from the body.

They are also loaded with magnesium, which acts as a natural calcium blocker to help relax and improve blood vessel function, while also boosting the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that keeps blood vessels healthy and regulates blood pressure.

Avocados also contain vitamin E, a potent antioxidant that protects cells and maintains heart health by preventing LDL cholesterol oxidation.

Furthermore, the high fiber content in avocados aids in weight management, blood sugar control, and improved cholesterol profiles. These properties make avocados beneficial in combating obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol, all of which can impact circulation.

Avocados can be enjoyed in many ways, such as eaten plain, in smoothies, as guacamole, or spread on bread. However, it’s important to avoid adding sugar to these preparations to maintain their health benefits.

Our next food is Number 9. “Apples”.

The age-old adage “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” is essentially true.

Apples contain two important compounds that benefit cardiovascular health: quercetin and pectin. Quercetin, a potent antioxidant, acts as a vasodilator, improving blood flow and circulation to all parts of the body. It also reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, potentially lowering the risk of heart disease and hypertension.

Pectin, a soluble fiber in apples, aids digestion and helps lower cholesterol levels. It forms a gel in the intestines that binds to cholesterol and bile acids, reducing their absorption and promoting their elimination through feces. This process also stimulates the liver to convert more cholesterol into bile acids to replace the loss, thereby lowering overall cholesterol levels in the body.

Even though dietary cholesterol usually has a small impact on blood cholesterol for most people, pectin’s ability to lower cholesterol supports overall heart health, which in turn improves blood circulation to the legs.

Moving on, our Number 8 is “Lemons”.

Our next recommendation is lemons and other citrus fruits. In addition to containing vitamin C, which is essential as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory agent, and a substance necessary for the production of collagen (a protein required to maintain the structure and elasticity of blood vessels), lemons also contain flavonoids such as hesperidin and eriocitrin. These flavonoids have been shown to improve blood flow and strengthen blood vessel walls. They can help reduce inflammation and swelling associated with varicose veins, alleviating discomfort in the legs.

To maximize the intake of these beneficial compounds, we recommend making “whole lemon water” by blending the entire lemon, including its peel and white pith, with water. This method ensures you get the highest concentration of flavonoids, as they are found in greater amounts in the peel and pith. Use organic lemons to avoid pesticides and thoroughly wash the fruit before blending.

When preparing this drink, avoid adding sugar, as excessive sugar intake can negatively impact circulation. Instead, enhance the flavor with stevia or add frozen berries for additional nutrients that support vascular health.

The next food is Number 7. “Spinach”.

The next recommended food is spinach. Spinach is high in iron, which plays a crucial role in red blood cell production, helping to prevent iron deficiency anemia and improve oxygen delivery to leg muscles, which can reduce leg fatigue and pain.

Another important component of spinach is folate, which helps reduce homocysteine levels in the blood. This is significant because high homocysteine can damage the endothelium, the inner layer of blood vessels. By aiding in homocysteine metabolism, folate protects against this damage, supporting overall cardiovascular health.

Spinach is also rich in vitamins A and C, both essential for maintaining blood vessel integrity. Vitamin A supports the endothelium and regulates coagulation processes, which can help prevent blood clots in legs. Vitamin C, on the other hand, aids in collagen synthesis and acts as an anti-inflammatory antioxidant. Additionally, vitamin C promotes nitric oxide production, which improves circulation.

The high fiber content spinach provides further helps lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, contributing to better overall circulation and improved metabolic function.

Moving on next, our Number 6 is “Kale”.

Kale is one of the richest sources of vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone. Vitamin K1 plays a crucial role in blood clotting by participating in the synthesis of coagulation proteins, ensuring that blood flows smoothly through the vessels without unnecessary clot formation that can impede circulation.

This is important for leg circulation, as proper blood flow can help reduce the risk of varicose veins and alleviate leg pain.

Vitamin K1 is essential for activating clotting factors such as prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X. Without sufficient vitamin K1, our coagulation is compromised, leading to an increased risk of bleeding and worse scarring.

Kale is also rich in antioxidants, fiber, and anti-inflammatory substances, all of which contribute to healthier blood vessels and improved circulation throughout the body.

At Number 5, we have “Ginger”.

The next recommended food is ginger, a powerful circulatory stimulant that can significantly improve blood flow. Its bioactive compounds, including gingerol, shogaol, and paradol, exhibit strong anti-inflammatory properties and help combat oxidative stress in blood vessels.

Ginger promotes better leg circulation through several mechanisms: it stimulates the release of nitric oxide, which dilates blood vessels, allowing for increased blood flow to the extremities.

Additionally, ginger’s compounds help reduce blood pressure and prevent plaque buildup in arteries, further enhancing circulation.

The spice also has mild blood-thinning effects, which can help prevent clot formation and improve overall blood flow.

These combined effects make ginger particularly beneficial for those experiencing poor circulation in their legs, potentially alleviating symptoms such as coldness, numbness, or discomfort.

Moving on, our Number 4 food is “Onion”.

The next food for those with circulation issues is the onion. Like apples, onions contain quercetin, a vasodilator that reduces blood pressure, improves blood flow, and reduces inflammation. Onions are also rich in antioxidants and fiber, and they contain vitamin C, which has anti-inflammatory properties.

Chronic inflammation contributes to artery clogging, so onions are an excellent food choice. Preferably, consume red onions because they have more nutrients and antioxidant substances. However, white onions are also beneficial and can help as well.

And at Number 3, we have “Garlic”.

The next food, commonly found in most homes, is garlic. This powerful ingredient contains allicin and ajoene, substances that offer multiple cardiovascular benefits. These compounds help reduce blood viscosity, improve circulation, and prevent clot formation.

Additionally, garlic has been shown to lower blood pressure, control cholesterol levels, and regulate blood glucose. These combined effects make garlic an excellent dietary choice for individuals with circulation problems, contributing to overall cardiovascular health and potentially reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Coming into Number 2, we have “Cayenne pepper”.

Cayenne pepper helps improve leg circulation through its active compound, capsaicin. Capsaicin triggers the release of vasodilators like nitric oxide. This allows easier blood flow, lowering blood pressure and enhancing circulation.

Capsaicin also strengthens blood vessels, reduces plaque buildup, and has anti-inflammatory properties. These effects make cayenne pepper an effective natural remedy for improving circulation, enhancing oxygen and nutrient delivery, and reducing cardiovascular risks.

And our Number 1 food is, “Extra virgin olive oil”

Regular consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) supports overall cardiovascular health and improves leg circulation.

Its main component, oleic acid, lowers LDL cholesterol and raises HDL cholesterol, promoting healthier blood vessels. EVOO is rich in polyphenols like oleocanthal and hydroxytyrosol, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that protect blood vessels from damage.

Olive oil also boosts nitric oxide production, relaxing and widening blood vessels. This helps deliver oxygen and nutrients to the legs, preventing issues like varicose veins and discomfort while walking.

For those with circulation problems, lifestyle change is the most important factor.

The root causes of circulation issues are high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, excess weight, lack of exercise, weak leg muscles, alcohol consumption, smoking, and an inflammatory diet.

However, simply adding foods like beetroot, onion, ginger, or garlic won’t solve the problem if your overall diet and lifestyle are poor. If you don’t eat fruits and vegetables, consume an adequate amount of protein, engage in physical activity, or if you drink excessively, smoke heavily, sleep poorly, or are constantly stressed, these foods alone won’t be effective.

To address the root causes of poor circulation, you need to change your habits, as it was your habits that created these problems in the first place.

You must eat well and consume the foods mentioned earlier. At the same time, you need to avoid harmful foods such as sugar, refined carbohydrates, and vegetable oils like soybean oil, canola oil, and corn oil because they harm your circulation.

Instead, you should consume olive oil and drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated. All of these changes will be essential for improving your circulation.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"July 20, 2024"

https://dailyhealthpost.com/improve-leg-circulation-and-blood-flow/,Top 5 drinks to INSTANTLY improve leg circulation and blood flow,"Today, we will discuss five drinks that can help improve poor circulation, varicose veins, and leg pain. If you have heart issues, have ever had blood clots in your veins or arteries, deal with high blood pressure, or any other condition affecting your blood vessels or heart, this video will be very helpful for you.

It is especially beneficial if you experience leg pain or feel that your legs are heavy after walking a short distance. I will show you some easy, inexpensive, and effective ways to boost your circulation with these five drinks that are readily available.

Let’s begin with our first drink. Number 5 is “Beet Juice”.

Beet juice is a powerful ally in the fight against poor circulation, varicose veins, and leg pain. This vibrant red drink is loaded with nitrates, which your body converts into nitric oxide, a key vasodilator.

When you drink beet juice, the nitrates are first converted into nitrites by bacteria in the mouth. These nitrites are then further converted into nitric oxide in the stomach and bloodstream, helping to widen your blood vessels, giving blood more room to flow, and boosting overall circulation.

The recommended daily intake of beet juice is between 8 and 16 ounces (240 to 470 ml). Making it at home is super easy—just blend raw beets with a little water, and you’re all set. This simple drink can do wonders for your vascular health because of its high nitrate content.

However, it’s important to be aware of some precautions. As a natural vasodilator, beet juice can lower your blood pressure, which is great for those with high blood pressure but could be an issue for people with low blood pressure. If you’re on blood pressure medication, you might need to adjust your dosage under medical supervision when adding beet juice to your diet.

Side effects are usually mild, with some people experiencing slight discomfort or gas, especially if they drink a lot of it. For diabetics, the effects can vary. While many diabetics can drink beet juice without significant changes in blood sugar levels, others might see spikes. It’s crucial to monitor your own response and talk to a healthcare provider if you have any concerns.

The next drink is Number 4. “Hibiscus Tea”.

Hibiscus tea, known for its vibrant red color and tart flavor, is a powerful drink that can greatly benefit your circulation. Packed with flavonoids like quercetin, hibiscus tea acts as an antioxidant, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation—both of which are harmful to circulation.

Furthermore, quercetin acts as a vasodilator, meaning it helps widen blood vessels. This property allows hibiscus tea to effectively lower blood pressure and improve circulation. Studies have shown that quercetin can reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, making hibiscus tea a beneficial choice for those looking to manage their blood pressure naturally.

The ideal dose of hibiscus tea is about one to two cups per day. Preparing it is simple: boil 8 to 10 ounces (240 to 300 mil) of water, add a handful of hibiscus flower petals, and let it steep for 5 to 10 minutes until the water takes on a rich color. This process ensures that the tea extracts all the beneficial properties of the hibiscus.

However, hibiscus tea does come with some precautions. It can interact with blood pressure and diabetes medications. Additionally, due to its diuretic effect, it should be consumed in moderation if you are taking diuretic medications to avoid excessive fluid loss. Some people might also experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort.

It’s best to enjoy hibiscus tea earlier in the day as its diuretic properties mean it might disrupt your sleep.

Moving on, the next drink is Number 3. “Lemon Balm Tea”.

Lemon balm tea is a calming drink that can boost circulation and fight off harmful substances in your body. The beneficial compounds in this sweet-smelling tea, such as flavonoids and rosmarinic acid, work synergistically to improve blood circulation. They achieve this by widening blood vessels, decreasing inflammation, and shielding the circulatory system from damage caused by free radicals.

To make lemon balm tea, use 1 teaspoon of dried leaves or 2 tablespoons of fresh leaves per cup. Pour boiling water over the leaves and let it steep for 5-10 minutes. Then strain and enjoy. You can have 1-3 cups a day for optimal results. Adding honey or lemon can enhance the flavor.

While lemon balm tea is generally safe, exercise caution if you are taking medications that cause drowsiness, as the tea may increase this effect. Pregnant women should also consume it in moderation. In rare cases, some individuals might experience a mild rash.

As with any herbal remedy, consult your doctor before making it a regular part of your routine, especially if you have health issues or are on medication.

Next, at Number 2 we have, “Garlic Tea”

Our next drink is another tea—garlic tea. This powerful brew boosts circulation and heart health by preventing blood clots and lowering high blood pressure, leading to better overall blood flow.

Garlic’s health benefits stem from compounds like allicin, which work in multiple ways to improve cardiovascular health. These compounds help prevent blood clots by reducing platelet clumping, effectively thinning the blood naturally.

For those with high blood pressure, garlic can significantly lower both systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number) readings by several points.

Moreover, garlic can slow the hardening of arteries by reducing plaque buildup and improving the flexibility of blood vessels, slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.

You’ll want to aim for 2 grams of garlic a day, whether that’s in tea, capsules, or just eating it. Making garlic tea is a breeze—just boil some water, toss in some garlic, and let it sit for a bit before drinking.

However, there are a few things to watch out for with garlic tea. It can interfere with some blood-thinning medications, especially those like warfarin. If you’re on these medications, check with your doctor before incorporating garlic tea into your routine.

As for side effects, it might upset your stomach if you drink too much. And fair warning—it could make you smell like garlic. Some folks enjoy that garlic aroma, but it might not be the best personal fragrance for many others.

Before we reveal our Number One, if you’re interested in a convenient way to boost blood flow for better circulation, eliminate excess plaque for clearer arteries, and balance cholesterol and blood pressure levels, consider drinking a cup of our innovative blend containing 10 of nature’s mightiest nutrients. To learn more, and get a special discount, click the link below at the end of this video.

And at Number 1, we have, “Horsetail tea”

Our last drink, which is also a tea, is horsetail tea. This popular herbal tea is rich in flavonoids, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains silica, which can contribute to strengthening veins and improving circulation by boosting collagen production and making blood vessels more flexible.

The ideal amount of horsetail tea to consume is 1 to 4 grams per day. To prepare it, simply boil water, add the horsetail, and let it steep.

However, there are some important precautions to consider. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid horsetail tea due to its silica content. Additionally, horsetail tea has diuretic properties, which means it can interact with medications that have similar effects. Side effects may include allergic reactions or gastrointestinal irritation.

There you have it! The five drinks that can improve leg circulation and blood flow.

It’s important to understand that treating circulation problems requires more than just drinking a cup of garlic tea or horsetail tea daily. While these teas can support circulation, they are not standalone solutions.

Poor circulation typically develops over many years as a result of unhealthy lifestyle habits, including a poor diet, lack of regular exercise, and excess weight or obesity. To truly improve your circulation, you need to adopt a healthier lifestyle.

This means eating a balanced diet, staying physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Managing stress and anxiety, as well as ensuring adequate sleep, are also vital.

By controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, you can significantly enhance your circulation. For instance, managing diabetes can prevent blood vessel damage caused by high blood sugar levels, thereby improving overall blood flow.

So while beetroot juice and teas are beneficial, they should be part of a broader strategy that includes lifestyle changes to effectively address and improve poor circulation.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"July 16, 2024"

https://dailyhealthpost.com/chew-2-cloves-daily/,"Chew 2 Cloves Daily, See What Happens To Your Body","Cloves are the aromatic flower buds of the clove tree, which originates from the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. This versatile spice can be used to season pot roasts, add flavor to hot beverages, and bring spicy warmth to cookies and cakes. You may have tasted cloves in mulled wine, chai tea, pumpkin pie, or gingerbread cookies.

Although cloves are best known as a sweet and aromatic spice, they are also used in traditional medicine. The medicinal properties of cloves are due to their nutritional profile.

Cloves are an excellent source of manganese, and they also contain significant amounts of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, including vitamin K, vitamin C, calcium, and magnesium. Additionally, cloves are exceptionally rich in antioxidants, including flavonoids, beta carotene, thymol, and eugenol.

In traditional Chinese medicine, cloves are used for various purposes, including supporting digestive function, warming the body, and boosting energy. Meanwhile, studies in modern Western medicine have shown that the organic compounds in cloves help relieve pain (analgesic), reduce inflammation (anti-inflammatory), and fight harmful microorganisms (antimicrobial).

In today’s video, we look at 11 health benefits of chewing two cloves daily, supported by scientific research. From combating tooth decay to potentially warding off chronic diseases, this small daily habit may just be one of the smartest moves you can make for your well-being.

In no particular order, our Number 11 benefit is “Promote oral health”.

Chewing cloves daily can significantly improve oral health by reducing gum inflammation and targeting bacteria that lead to dental decay and bad breath. A human study published in the Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology found that an herbal mouthwash containing cloves effectively reduced oral bacteria responsible for dental plaque, cavities, and gum disease. Additionally, a clinical study showed that a homemade gel made with clove oil was as effective as benzocaine in numbing gums before dental procedures.

The next benefit is Number 10. “Promote gut health”.

The eugenol content in cloves plays a significant role in promoting overall gut health. Although human studies are limited, animal research provides compelling evidence. A study on rats demonstrated that clove extract could protect against stomach ulcers by enhancing mucus production in the stomach lining, which acts as a protective barrier against gastric acids. This helps prevent ulcer formation and promotes healing for those with leaky gut. Additionally, cloves stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes, which can improve digestion and alleviate issues such as bloating and gas.

Moving on, we have Number 9. “Protect against infections”.

The antimicrobial properties of cloves make them a powerful ally in fighting off a variety of infections, including bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. A test tube study reported in Tropical Life Sciences Research found that clove extract could effectively treat urinary tract infections, targeting bacteria in the bladder, urethra, and kidneys.

Additionally, cloves have shown efficacy against common foodborne pathogens like E. coli and S. aureus. The antifungal properties of cloves are also impressive, with studies demonstrating their ability to combat Candida albicans, which causes yeast infections. Furthermore, some studies suggest that clove extract may have antiviral effects, potentially aiding in the fight against herpes simplex virus.

The next benefit is Number 8. “Regulate blood sugar”.

For those managing diabetes, cloves can be a natural ally in regulating blood sugar levels. In a 2019 study, people with and without prediabetes who took 250 milligrams (mg) of clove extract daily for 30 days showed significantly lower blood glucose levels after meals. Similarly, a 2017 animal study found that nigricin, a compound in cloves, increased the uptake of sugar from the blood into cells, boosted insulin secretion, and improved the function of insulin-producing cells in mice. These studies suggest that consuming cloves, either by chewing them or taking them as an extract, may offer a natural approach to help manage blood sugar levels.

Up next, we have Number 7. “Suppress a cough”.

While modern science is still catching up, traditional Chinese medicine has long harnessed the soothing properties of these aromatic flower buds to calm irritated throats and quiet persistent coughs. Their natural compounds work to suppress the cough reflex, offering sweet relief from nagging respiratory woes. So the next time a cough threatens to disrupt your day (or night), start chewing cloves – it may just be the secret weapon your medicine cabinet’s been missing.

Moving on to Number 6, we have “Protect against cancer”.

Several intriguing laboratory studies have shown that clove oil and its compounds could have cancer-fighting properties. For instance, one study discovered that clove extract not only boosted cancer cell death but also slowed down tumor growth. However, it’s important to remember that these studies used highly concentrated amounts that would be toxic to humans, so more research is needed to understand the effects of regular clove consumption, like chewing cloves. Nonetheless, the potential is there, making cloves an exciting area of study in the fight against cancer.

And at Number 5, we have “Promote liver health”.

Cloves contain compounds that support liver function. Research in animals has revealed that eugenol in cloves acts as a powerful antioxidant shield for liver cells, potentially warding off harmful free radicals that can lead to liver diseases. In one study, rats with fatty liver disease showed marked improvement when given clove oil or eugenol solutions – their liver function rebounded, inflammation decreased, and oxidative stress plummeted.

Another animal study found that eugenol could even reverse signs of liver cirrhosis. While human studies are still limited, one small trial hinted at the liver-protective effects of eugenol, by lowering levels of an enzyme linked to liver disease. However, high doses of clove extract can be harmful to the liver, so moderation is key.

Getting into Number 4, we have “Ease the effects of aging”.

The antioxidant properties of cloves may contribute to slowing down the aging process. Research indicates that cloves have potent antioxidant effects, with some studies suggesting they are more powerful than vitamin E in combating oxidative stress and free radical damage, which are key contributors to age-related tissue damage. While antioxidants cannot entirely prevent aging, they may help reduce the progression of age-related diseases and maintain cellular health.

The Number 3 benefit is “Relieve pain and stress”.

The eugenol in cloves acts as a natural pain reliever and stress reducer. While most studies focus on clove oil, chewing cloves may also help relieve muscle and joint pain associated with conditions like arthritis. Furthermore, chewing cloves can help reduce toothache and oral pain, headaches, and migraines, and provide stress relief. These benefits are supported by eugenol’s analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties.

Next is the Number 2 benefit, “Enhance bone health”.

Cloves pack a powerful punch when it comes to supporting strong, healthy bones. Their impressive manganese content—over 50% of the daily recommended value in just one teaspoon—plays a crucial role in bone formation and maintenance. While research specifically on cloves and bone health is still emerging, studies indicate that manganese-rich foods like cloves may help ward off osteoporosis. Beyond manganese, eugenol and other bioactive compounds in cloves have shown promise in animal studies for preserving bone mass.

And the Number 1 benefit is, “Improve brain health”.

Cloves may support brain health through their rich antioxidant content. Studies on Alzheimer’s disease models have shown that eugenol can help improve cognitive function in several ways. It reduces the loss of brain cells and decreases the buildup of harmful amyloid-beta proteins. Additionally, eugenol fights brain inflammation and protects against damage caused by oxidative stress. However, more research is needed to confirm these effects in humans.

There you have it! Eleven health benefits of chewing 2 cloves daily. While these benefits are promising, more human studies are needed to fully understand the effects of daily clove consumption.

Lastly, while consuming 1-2 cloves daily is generally considered safe for most adults, there are some potential risks and side effects to be aware of.

The eugenol in cloves may increase the risks of bleeding with blood thinners, and interact with diabetes medications. Some people may experience allergic reactions or irritation. Consult a healthcare provider before adding cloves to your routine, especially if you have any existing health conditions or are taking medications.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"July 11, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-you-need-to-detox/,15 Signs Your Liver is NOT Taking Out the Trash (a.k.a. Toxins),"Your liver is responsible for cleaning all the crud out of your body and breaking it down to a form that can be expelled through the skin, urine, or feces. Toxin overload, evidenced by one or more of the symptoms below, may be telling you that your liver needs a little help.

Nutrients Needed for Natural Liver Detoxification
How to Cleanse: Liquid/Powder/?

Some people swear by liquid cleanses. These will surely clean you out but there are two things to consider: 1) if it’s too harsh you could be hurting yourself and 2) you’ll be hungry and may end up falling off the cleansing wagon. Proteins are toxins’ escorts so cutting back on these while trying to detoxify may be self-defeating. A short-term fast of 1-3 days may help you feel lighter and cleaner but a 3-week deal is probably too much and may result in nutrient deficiency, which is contrary to the healthifying objective.

You may opt for a whole-food cleanse to support your liver and the rest of your digestive system to do what comes naturally. A regular nutritionally-sound diet obviates the need for detox; by cutting out all the toxins you can and eating to support optimal cell function, everything runs smoothly–including your liver.

If you change your diet and eliminate the obvious offenders but still feel sluggish or experience some of the signs above, then a more aggressive regimen may be indicated (you should always consult a certified healthcare provider before embarking on a traditional cleanse). Your body is exceptionally adept at telling you what it needs; you simply have to pay attention.

Best Liver Detox Foods

Beets – uniquely formulated to thin bile, beets loosen up the flow. After toxins leave the liver, they are dunked in bile; if bile flow is sluggish (a common situation), it doesn’t work as well. Eating beets is like adding washing soda to the machine. Raw is best for detoxification: shred some and try a slaw with apple cider vinegar, olive oil, and salt.

Fresh fruit – vitamin- and fiber-rich with nutritious phytonutrients, all fruit is good fruit. Those highest in vitamin C are especially good for the liver: grapefruit, orange, papaya, pineapple, kiwi, and berries.

Milk Thistle – The vibrant antioxidants in this spiky plant have been shown to reverse effects of liver cancer, inflammation, cirrhosis, and “fatty liver”. You can get it in a pill or tea–we like the tea.

Proteins – For detox, reduce/change animal proteins and increase the plant proteins. Animal muscle proteins are very complex and hard to break down, requiring a certain set of amino acids to do so. Ease up (but not out) on the kind of protein you are feeding your liver.

“Non-inflammatory” proteins of fish, eggs, quinoa, cultured dairy, beans, and–ironically–organ meats are supportive of liver detox, providing the necessary nutrition without having to work as hard to break down a steak, for instance. Bone broth is a good source of protein, easy and inexpensive to make, and versatile.

Water – Pure, filtered, fluoride-free water. Lots of it.

A bath in Epsom salts also promotes liver function by infusing your body with magnesium and stimulating glutathione production. Calming and soothing, too–who wouldn’t use that?

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stretches-to-get-rid-of-foot-pain/,Get Rid of Foot Pain in Minutes With These 6 Effective Stretches,"In Reflexology, the feet are the center of the body: all energy meridians used in acupuncture flow through the feet. And it makes sense too, when your feet hurt, often the pain originates from elsewhere in your body: it may come from your calves, hips, or even upper back. (Updated July 10, 2024)

Feet are pretty complex and there can be many reasons why your feet ache throughout the day. There are thirty-eight bones in a foot; they and their connective tissue are susceptible to excess stress for obvious reasons. It takes a lot of work to hold you up and keep you moving every day.

On top of that, feet are prone to blisters, nail fungus, ingrown toenails, bunions, corns, athlete’s foot, arthritis, and other conditions that leave your feet prone to pain. Keeping your feet healthy and flexible requires a little bit of care and special attention, especially if you suffer from diabetes or circulatory conditions (1).

Keeping your Feet Strong

Below are six ways  you can stretch your feet to relieve pain and keep them in tip-top shape.

1. Ankle Stretch (starts at 0:45)

Your ankle and foot support each other. Strengthening your ankles will enable them to work harder, taking pressure off the feet.

Sitting on the ground, place your foot through the loop of a resistance band so that the bottom of your foot is resting against it. Bend your toes towards the ground. Hold the position for a few seconds and return to the starting position. Repeat fifteen times.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"July 10, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/nutrients-to-reduce-knee-osteoarthritis-pain/,Top 6 Nutrients To Reduce Knee Osteoarthritis Pain,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease affecting millions of adults worldwide. It is marked by the breakdown of cartilage in the knee joint due to aging, overuse, or injury. As the cartilage starts to wear out, crack, or become damaged, the bones in the knee joint rub against each other, causing inflammation. This leads to pain, swelling, and stiffness in the knee.

So, what is cartilage?

Cartilage is a flexible yet strong connective tissue found in various parts of the body, including the bone ends in joints (articular cartilage). It acts as a protective cushion, allowing bones to glide smoothly over each other without friction. However, cartilage isn’t as hard as bone, and this makes it more prone to damage over time.

Now, it’s important to understand that when cartilage is damaged, the chances of natural repair are practically zero. Cartilage is a tissue that essentially cannot regenerate on its own, due to its lack of blood supply and low cell turnover rate.

However, certain key nutrients can improve cartilage health and reduce the pain, swelling, and stiffness associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

In today’s video, we look at six nutrients that support cartilage health and reduce joint discomfort. To reduce joint discomfort and OA symptoms, joint nutrients have to address three factors:

The first factor is “Decline in Collagen”.

Collagen is a major part of the extracellular matrix in cartilage, which acts like scaffolding to give your joints strength and structure. Type II collagen, which makes up approximately 90-95% of the collagen in articular cartilage, forms a network within the matrix, helping cartilage trap other important molecules and stay strong.

However, modern lifestyle factors such as poor diet, being overweight, hormonal changes with age, and overuse and misuse of joints can cause collagen levels to drop over time. By age 40, our bodies often produce less than half the collagen they did when we were younger. This decline leads to weaker cartilage and changes in the matrix, resulting in less cushioning for our joints. These changes can cause joint pain, stiffness, and worsen symptoms of OA.

The second factor is “Attacking Enzymes”.

When enzymes known as MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) are too active—often due to the modern lifestyle factors mentioned earlier—they destroy cartilage faster than the body can rebuild it. This is like having more demolition workers than builders. This leads to further collagen and cartilage reduction, causing more joint damage and inflammation. Overactive MMPs can make OA worsen quickly.

The third factor is “Drying Out of Synovial Fluid”.

Hyaluronic acid is the key component of synovial fluid, acting as a lubricant and shock absorber in joints. As cartilage decreases in conditions like OA, both the quantity and quality of this fluid diminish. This leads to increased friction between joint surfaces, causing more wear and tear, pain, and stiffness. If left unchecked, this process can cause serious joint damage and accelerate OA progression.

These three factors are interconnected and can create a vicious cycle in OA progression:

The decline in collagen weakens the cartilage structure, making it more vulnerable to damage.
Overactive MMPs break down the already weakened cartilage more rapidly.
The drying out of synovial fluid increases friction and wear on the cartilage, further accelerating its breakdown.

Now that we’ve covered the three factors that lead to joint discomfort and OA, let’s look at the nutrients that can address them.

First, we have to mention glucosamine and chondroitin, the two most common nutrients used in joint supplements. They are naturally present in human cartilage. However, research has shown mixed results for their effectiveness in treating OA.

A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that six months of supplementation with these compounds was no better than a placebo for reducing joint discomfort. Having said that, if you have gotten good results using glucosamine and chondroitin, do share in the comments below.

Now, let’s look at the 6 nutrients that target cartilage health and joint discomfort.

The first nutrient is Number 6. Undenatured Type II Collagen (UC-II).

Collagen is the structural protein found in skin, tendons, and bones, with type II collagen specifically present in the cartilage lining the joints. A special patented form of type II collagen, known as UC-II, is derived from the breastbone of chickens. UC-II works very differently from popular collagen supplements, as it engages the immune system in the repair of joint cartilage.

Among the published studies on UC-II, one in the International Journal of Medical Sciences demonstrated that a daily dose of 40 mg of UC-II was significantly more effective at reducing joint discomfort and improving overall joint function compared to glucosamine and chondroitin.

Next, at Number 5, we have “Boswellia Serrata”.

Boswellia serrata is a plant extract that has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries to treat inflammatory diseases. It targets and inhibits MMP enzymes, helping maintain collagen levels and reduce joint discomfort.

A 2020 review of seven trials with 545 patients, found that Boswellia serrata extract significantly relieved pain and stiffness and improved joint function in OA patients.

To treat OA specifically, take 100-500 mg of a standardized extract 2-3 times daily.

Moving on, the Number 4 nutrient is “Hyaluronic acid”.

With both aging and osteoarthritis, your joints’ ability to produce hyaluronic acid deteriorates, affecting not only synovial fluid but also other tissues like skin, contributing to joint discomfort, dehydrated skin, and wrinkles.

To get hyaluronic acid from food, bone broth is the best direct source. It’s made by simmering animal bones and connective tissues for an extended period, which releases nutrients including hyaluronic acid, collagen, glucosamine, and chondroitin into the broth.

Organ meats, especially liver, kidney, and tongue, are another good direct food source of hyaluronic acid.

You’ll also want to eat magnesium-rich foods like leafy green vegetables (kale, spinach) and nuts and seeds (almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds) as magnesium aids in hyaluronic acid production.

For supplementation, a patented form of hyaluronic acid called Mobilee® has been shown to be 5 times more powerful and effective than other forms of hyaluronic acid, significantly reducing activity-related joint flare-ups in OA.

Instead of taking these 3 nutrients separately, choose a supplement which contains all three, like the one we recommended. Click the link below to learn more.

In addition to these 3 nutrients, ensure you get enough of these 3 vitamins that support bone and cartilage health.

At Number 3, we have “Vitamin C”.

Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is essential for collagen production, which helps maintain bones, teeth, and cartilage. It acts as a powerful antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals and reducing the risk of inflammation and disease. Adequate vitamin C intake is particularly important for those with knee cartilage issues, as a deficiency could contribute to cartilage problems.

A daily intake of at least 500 mg is recommended. This can be easily achieved through a diet rich in fruits and vegetables such as red bell peppers, kiwifruit, papaya, strawberries, oranges, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, pineapple, grapefruit, and tomatoes.

Moving on, we have Number 2. “Vitamin D3”.

Vitamin D is essential for bone and tooth health, as it facilitates calcium absorption in the body. While some studies suggest that higher vitamin D levels may slow cartilage loss in knee OA patients, and vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased OA risk, it doesn’t seem to provide significant relief for OA pain.

Sunlight exposure (10-30 minutes at midday) is the most effective way for your body to produce vitamin D3. Excellent food sources of vitamin D3 include salmon, cod liver oil, and mackerel.

For supplementation, take 1,000 to 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day, depending on the severity of your deficiency.

And at Number 1, we have “Vitamin K2”.

Your body needs calcium to build and maintain bones. When calcium is broken down in your body, vitamin K2 activates a protein (osteocalcin) that helps the mineral bind to your bones to do its job. Studies have shown that increasing vitamin K2 intake can improve bone density and lower the risk of bone fractures, though research is still ongoing.

For optimal absorption, consume vitamin K2 with healthy fats like olive or coconut oil. Vitamin K2 is essential for activating matrix Gla protein, which helps prevent calcium from accumulating in the arteries. This protein depends on vitamin K to function properly.

The richest food source of vitamin K2 MK-7 is natto (fermented soybeans), followed by sauerkraut and hard cheeses.

For supplementation, take 150-180 mcg of vitamin K2 MK-7 per day along with vitamin D3 to help your body use calcium effectively, promoting bone health and preventing arterial calcification.

It is caused by bacteria (usually E.coli) and the problem is ten times more common in women than men.[1] If you recover from a UTI and then experience another episode within a six-month period, there are some things you can do to prevent more bacteria from growing in the urinary tract.

You can use the following tips to help reduce your risks of recurring UTI:

1. Don’t use scented bath products.

Any scented bath washes, bubble baths, soaps, and shower gels can irritate the urinary tract opening. Use mild, unscented bath products and remember to rinse the area well with clean water after bathing.

2. Wear clothing that breathes.

Keep the genital area clean and dry by wearing cotton undergarments and loose-fitting clothing that breathes (natural fibers like cotton, hemp, silk, and linen). You should avoid wearing tight pants, pantyhose, and underwear made from synthetics because these retain moisture, providing an environment conducive to bacterial growth.

3. Use unscented feminine hygiene products.

Tampons and sanitary napkins should be unscented. Scented feminine hygiene products can cause severe irritation in the genital area–aggravating the urethra–and should be avoided. Opt for pads rather than tampons when you can, as tampons can push bacteria directly into your body.

4. Wipe from front to back.

It is important for women to wash and wipe their genital area from front to back when showering or after urinating or defecating. This will help prevent spreading bacteria from the anus into the urethra.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"July 2, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/ginger-oil/,"Homemade Ginger Oil To Replace Pain Pills, Cough Syrup, Antibiotics And More!","It’s almost impossible to list all the benefits and uses of ginger. This highly medicinal rhizome is a potent anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, anticancer, analgesic, antioxidant spice. Making ginger oil is simple and increases ginger’s versatility while prolonging shelf life. Read on to find out how to make your own ginger oil and why you should give it a try. (Updated June 30, 2024)

Why Try Ginger Oil?

Perhaps ginger’s best-known application as a medicine is for digestive woes. It doesn’t stop there, however: there’s much more to it than that. Preparing ginger oil allows you to easily use it topically, as well as internally.

You can combine herbs with the ginger oil to target a wider variety of health conditions:

bergamot – reduces anxiety and relieves stress; reduces blood pressure and heart rate
frankincense – reduces inflammation; relieves pain; neuroprotective
neroli – relieves anxiety and depression; promotes healthy digestion; relieves insomnia
sandalwood – relieves a headache; promotes circulation
ylang-ylang – calming and soothing; promotes relaxation and balances hormones

Ginger contains dozens of healing phytochemicals, including mono- and sesqui- terpenoids 1,8-cineole, nerol, geraniol, B-bisabolene, B-sesquiphellandrene, zingiberene, linalool, α- and β-pinene, borneol, camphene, gingerol, and y-terpineol. These aromatic chemicals lend ginger not only its scent and flavor but its analgesic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.

Ginger has been clinically shown effective for the many ailments that “folk remedies” have used it for thousands of years. (1)

Uses for Ginger Oil

Ginger oil is more useful than you think

1. Chronic Disease

In general, ginger is used for so many different ailments because its nutritional profile is exceptional. A precursor to almost every chronic disease is inflammation and ginger arrests it. Antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer properties in ginger kill a slew of potential pathogens. (2)

A recent study of over 4600 adults tested the effect of daily ginger consumption on various common chronic diseases: diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), hyperlipidemia (high concentration of fats in the blood), cerebrovascular (brain and its blood vessels) disease, fatty liver, anemia, and cancer.

Researchers concluded: “…ginger has a potential preventive property against some chronic diseases, especially hypertension and CHD, as well as its ability to reduce the probability of illness…the probability of illness (hypertension or CHD) decreased when the level of daily ginger intake increased.” (3)

2. Food Poisoning

Since this very unpleasant condition is caused by bacteria and ginger is a potent antiseptic, it’s a no-brainer remedy. In fact, ginger has been proven to kill the common bacteria that contaminate food. (4)

When using ginger oil for bacterial infection, use linseed as the carrier oil, as these work synergistically to bring out the best in ginger. (5)

3. Heart Health

Ginger reduces cholesterol levels in the blood, thereby preventing the development of atherosclerosis and reducing lesions caused by heart disease. (6) The way that ginger does this is by way of its anti-inflammatory antioxidant compounds. (7)

4. Hypertension

Metabolism in the body works through electrical pathways and signals. Ginger reduces blood pressure by blocking the electricity in calcium channels to promote normal levels between cells. (8) It can reduce blood pressure and heart rate in heart-healthy people. (9) People taking heart or blood pressure medication should consult their healthcare providers before using ginger as a supplement.

5. Malaria, Dengue, and Yellow Fever

These insect-borne diseases are caused by a parasite (malaria) or virus (dengue and yellow fevers) that infects the mosquito that bites you. Ginger is effective at killing the offending parasite and stopping the progression of the viruses that cause these sometimes life-threatening illnesses. (10, 11)

6. Pain Relief

Ginger is an effective pain reliever, whether taken internally or applied topically. (12) One of the ways it works is by inhibiting prostaglandins, which are fatty acids that act like hormones. Prostaglandins are important for healing tissue damage but can also cause inflammation and muscle constriction, which are often the source of pain. (13)

Ginger has been shown to be especially effective for reducing symptoms of PMS and easing menstrual cramping. (14)

Additionally: “Topical ginger treatment has the potential to relieve symptoms, improve the overall health, and increase independence of people with chronic osteoarthritis.” (15)

Mix 2-3 drops of ginger oil with 2 tablespoons of carrier oil (almond, avocado, coconut, olive, jojoba, etc.) and rub into sore muscles and joints to relieve pain and stiffness and improve circulation. Alternatively, add 10-20 drops of ginger oil to a hot bath or a few drops to a clean cloth for a hot or cold compress.

7. Respiratory Problems

Ginger breaks up phlegm, reduces inflammation and irritation, and relieves cough. Ginger has been used to treat chronic conditions like asthma and bronchitis. (16) It’s also anti-viral, which will help the immune system to combat colds and flu.

Place 2-3 drops of ginger oil in a diffuser, vaporizer, or a bowl of steaming hot water. Inhale the steam to absorb into the lungs to clear them; ease irritation of the nose, throat, and lungs; and promote a general feeling of revitalization. You can do this any time for a burst of ginger energy.

8. Stomach, Bowel, and Digestive Issues

Ginger relieves flatulence, diarrhea, upset stomach, nausea, and motion sickness. (17) Ginger can even ease nausea that follows chemotherapy, according to a 2009 study. (18) It also increases appetite.

To use against gas and digestive issues, apply a drop or two to the lower abdomen and gently massage into the skin.

How to Make Ginger Oil

You can make a batch that’ll last up to 6 months so you always have some on hand. Be sure to store the oil in a dark, cool, dry place.

You’ll Need:

Oven-safe bowl
Cheese grater
Cheese cloth
1 cup fresh ginger, whole and unpeeled
1 ½ cups olive oil, organic extra virgin

Directions:

Rinse the ginger thoroughly and allow to air dry (it’ll take a few hours).
When the ginger is dry, preheat the oven to 150°F/65°.
Pour the olive oil into an oven-safe bowl.
Shred the ginger with a cheese grater. Add to the olive oil and mix well.
Put the mixture in the oven and leave it to cook for at least 2 hours.
When cool enough to handle, pour the oil into another (glass or ceramic) bowl or large glass measuring cup through an unbleached cheese cloth to filter out the solid bits of ginger. Squeeze out the oil from the cheese cloth into the bowl/cup so you don’t waste one precious drop.
Pour the ginger oil into clean vials or bottles with lids and store in a cool, dry place.
Cautions When Using Ginger Oil
Ginger oil can make your skin sensitive to the sun, so avoid exposure within 24 hours of application.
If it’s your first time using ginger oil, test a drop on a small spot (the inside of the elbow works well) and wait 24 hours to check for any skin reaction.
Because it’s concentrated, if you take ginger oil internally, it can cause stomach upset. Use sparingly and mix with a carrier oil or food.
If you are taking any medication, consult your healthcare provider before using ginger oil in any way. It’s powerful stuff.
Safe use during pregnancy is not definitive; most studies found no or few minor side effects. Some even found that ginger oil can reduce morning sickness during the first trimester. (19) Best to check with your midwife first.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/best-meal-to-remove-plaque-from-your-arteries/,#1 Best Meal To Remove Plaque From Your Arteries,"In a world where heart disease is the leading cause of death, a groundbreaking solution may lie not in the latest pharmaceutical wonder drug, but in simple foods that people have consumed since ancient times.

Scientists are uncovering mounting evidence that some natural foods possess a remarkable ability to combat atherosclerosis—the buildup of deadly plaque in the arteries—yet their potential remains largely untapped and unrecognized.

So, what are these artery-unclogging foods, and what happens if we combine them into one meal? In today’s video, we explore eight nutrient-dense foods that you can combine into one optimal meal to prevent artery hardening and reduce plaque buildup, offering a powerful, natural approach to cardiovascular health.

Let’s begin with our Number-8 food: “Wild Fatty Fish”.

Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, sardines, and herring, as well as shellfish like oysters and shrimp, are among the most heart-healthy foods you can consume. These seafood are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which support heart health by reducing inflammation, lowering triglycerides, preventing blood clots, and lowering blood pressure.

A 2019 study showed that omega-3 fatty acids from seafood help slow down the buildup of calcium and fatty deposits (called plaque) in the coronary arteries. In another 2021 study, individuals with heart disease who consumed at least two servings of fatty fish per week reduced their risk of heart attacks, strokes, and even death by nearly 20%. Furthermore, consuming fish could also help reduce the risk of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AFib).

Opt for wild-caught fish over farm-raised, as they typically have fewer contaminants. When preparing fatty fish like salmon, add flavor and increase heart health benefits by seasoning with herbs and spices. Try a rub of garlic, ginger, turmeric, and cayenne pepper, or a marinade with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and fresh herbs like dill, parsley, or thyme. Aim to eat two servings of fatty fish weekly for optimal nutrition.

The next food is Number 7. “Avocados”.

Avocados are one of the tastiest foods that can help improve heart health. A 30-year study of over 110,000 health professionals found that those who ate at least two servings of avocado each week had a 16% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 21% lower risk of coronary heart disease compared to those who rarely or never ate avocados.

This nutrient-dense fruit is high in healthy fats and other bioactive compounds, which have been found to lower small, dense LDL cholesterol particles that are particularly prone to oxidation and promote plaque buildup in arteries.

Avocados are an excellent food that contains both vitamins C and E. According to one scientific study, the combination of these two vitamins can help slow down artery blockage in people with high cholesterol.

Furthermore, avocados also contain fiber, potassium, and magnesium that help protect your heart by improving cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, gut balance, blood sugar, and overall heart function.

You can enjoy avocados several times a week by adding them to your salad or eating them on their own. Avocado oil is a good alternative to olive oil for cooking, although consuming the whole fruit provides the most benefits.

Coming up next is Number 6, “Nitrate-rich Vegetables”.

A 2021 Australian study found that eating one cup of raw (or half cup of cooked) nitrate-rich vegetables daily, like leafy greens and beets, can reduce cardiovascular disease risk by 15-26%. The benefits include lower blood pressure and decreased risks of heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure.

Nitrate-rich vegetables include beets, spinach, bok choy, arugula, kale, dandelion greens, collard greens, Swiss chard, and watercress. These root and green vegetables are not only packed with essential vitamins and nutrients such as fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, chlorophyll, magnesium, and potassium, but they also contain high amounts of nitrates.

When you consume these vegetables, your body converts the nitrates into nitric oxide, a crucial molecule for cardiovascular health. Nitric oxide helps open up your blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily and lowering your blood pressure. Normalizing blood pressure reduces stress on artery walls, decreasing damage and inflammation, which in turn makes it harder for plaque to form and accumulate.

Vitamin C, found abundantly in leafy green vegetables, plays a crucial role in protecting arteries against damage. It helps prevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, which promotes plaque formation in the arteries. Additionally, vitamin C supports the production of collagen, which is essential for maintaining the structure and elasticity of arterial walls.

By regularly eating leafy green vegetables, you can reduce inflammation in your body and slow the progression of atherosclerosis.

When purchasing vegetables, choose organic whenever possible. Eat a large side salad of leafy greens with your daily meals. Or make beet-rich salads using ingredients like olive oil, lemons, capers, and anchovies.

Moving on, the Number 5 food is, “Extra Virgin Olive Oil”.

A comprehensive study published in 2020, which involved more than 90,000 men and women over twenty-four years, found that adding more than half a tablespoon of olive oil to their daily diet lowered their risk of cardiovascular disease by 15% and coronary artery disease by 21%.

These benefits are attributed to the high levels of antioxidants and monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, found in this cardio-protective oil. To experience the full benefits of olive oil, you should opt for extra-virgin, first cold-pressed olive oil in a dark bottle, as this represents the highest-quality option.

Drizzle extra virgin olive oil on your salad and use it to cook your fish.

Coming into Number 4, we have: “Garlic”.

Garlic is one of nature’s most powerful protections against heart disease, diabetes, and many other serious illnesses.

A 2016 study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that aged garlic extract (AGE) reduced the progression of coronary artery calcification in people with metabolic syndrome. This effect is due to garlic’s ability to lower cholesterol, widen blood vessels, reduce inflammation, and fight oxidative stress.

A review of 17 studies published in 2015, showed that garlic supplements (garlic powder, aged garlic extract, and garlic oil) effectively reduced blood pressure compared to a placebo. The primary sulfur compound in garlic, allicin, is believed to have anti-inflammatory properties, that help lower cholesterol and blood pressure.

Add 5 to 10 cloves of chopped or crushed garlic to your daily meals.

Next, the Number 3 food is “Pomegranate”.

A 2004 study in Clinical Nutrition found that daily pomegranate juice consumption significantly reversed carotid artery plaque in atherosclerosis patients. Over one year, those drinking 50mL daily saw a 35% reduction in carotid artery wall thickness, while the control group’s increased by 9%.

This effect is due to pomegranate’s rich antioxidants, which combat oxidative stress and inflammation, key drivers of atherosclerosis. Drinking pomegranate juice for one year lowered markers of cell damage by 19% and increased overall antioxidant levels by 130%. The juice also enhanced the activity of a helpful enzyme (paraoxonase), making it work 83% better at protecting against LDL oxidation.

Drink a cup of 100% pure pomegranate juice daily with your meal, or add pomegranate fruit to your leafy green salad.

Coming into Number 2, we have: “Nuts and Seeds”.

Nuts and seeds are nutritional powerhouses that offer a wealth of cardiovascular benefits. Packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, plant sterols, and fiber, they can lower inflammation and harmful cholesterol levels, potentially reducing the risk of coronary heart disease by up to 23%. Each variety provides a unique blend of vitamins, amino acids, and minerals, including vitamin E, L-arginine, and magnesium, all of which play crucial roles in heart health.

Vitamin E has been shown to inhibit plaque development in arteries and decrease stroke risk, while L-arginine converts to nitric oxide in the body, helping to lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Magnesium contributes to maintaining a steady heart rhythm and normal blood pressure.

To maximize these benefits, opt for fresh, organic nuts and seeds without added ingredients, such as walnuts, almonds, chia seeds, flaxseeds, hemp seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and pistachios. You can easily add these to your salad. For better nutrient availability, consider soaking most nuts and seeds overnight before consumption.

And the Number 1 food is, “Fermented Foods”.

Recent studies have revealed a compelling link between gut health and heart health, specifically focusing on how gut bacteria imbalance (dysbiosis) can contribute to increased plaque and hardening of coronary arteries. This connection, known as the gut-heart axis, highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy gut microbiome for cardiovascular well-being.

A 2023 study published in Circulation found that certain oral bacteria, particularly Streptococcus, were associated with inflammation and plaque buildup in the coronary arteries of nearly 9,000 middle-aged participants. This research builds upon a 2018 European Heart Journal study that first established a connection between less diverse gut bacteria and stiffer arteries in middle-aged twins.

Fortunately, eating fermented foods can help you improve gut health and reduce arterial plaque. These foods contain both probiotics (beneficial bacteria) and prebiotics (food for probiotics), which promote a healthy gut microbiome. Here’s how these fermented foods can benefit your arteries:

Natto: This Japanese fermented soybean dish contains nattokinase, an enzyme that can break down blood clots and reduce artery plaque. It’s also the single food that is richest in vitamin K2, which helps prevent calcification in arteries.

Kimchi: This Korean fermented cabbage has been shown to reduce fatty streak formation in the aorta, an early sign of atherosclerosis. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties contribute to heart health.

Miso: This fermented soybean paste contains isoflavones (plant compounds) that can lower cholesterol levels and prevent arterial plaque formation.

Tempeh: Another fermented soybean product, tempeh helps lower LDL cholesterol and prevents its oxidation, thereby reducing plaque buildup.

Sauerkraut: This fermented cabbage is rich in probiotics that improve gut microbiota and reduce inflammation, potentially benefiting heart health.

By adding a fermented food to your meal as a soup or side dish, you can greatly improve your gut health and your heart health.

The crux of the matter is that we refuse to proactively think about prevention because we reactively commit to treating the symptoms of underlying health problems. This is the allopathic model. We want the quick fix so we can continue our poor lifestyle and dietary habits. (Updated June 24, 2024)

It doesn’t have to be this way, but it is. We can blame doctors, the medical institutions and healthcare systems all we want, but self-responsibility is our only recourse if we are ever to surface from this mess.

Of the over 4 billion prescriptions written every year, the United States and Canada make up more than 80% of the world’s prescription opioids (psychoactive medications). Between 1997 and 2012 prescription opioids increased in dosage by almost 500%. Pharmaceuticals and medical errors are now a leading cause of death. Painkillers are the leading cause of accidental death.

Prescriptions for pain, cholesterol reduction, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, antacids, antipsychotics, diabetes and antibiotics make up 100% of the most prescribed drugs. Check out these 7 most commonly prescribed drugs and the best natural remedies to treat and prevent disease.

1. HYDROCODONE (Acetaminophen/Vicodin/Oxycontin)

Use: For Pain


Currently the single most prescribed drug in the world. More and more doctors are getting huge payouts from pharmaceutical companies to promote these hydrocodone, especially generic drugs. They make up more than 20% of the top prescribed medications.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told Fox News that doctors are handing out narcotics like candy. Some doctors are giving patients prescriptions for narcotics for even minor injuries.

How it Works: It is an orally psychoactive compound that works as a narcotic and analgesic. It is biotransformed by the liver into several metabolites. It is highly dependent on metabolism by the Cytochrome P450 pathway.

Consequences: Respiratory depression; bradycardia; coma; seizures; cardiac arrest; liver damage; and death. Inherited genes such as the Cytochrome P450 affects metabolic pathways–some cannot process it at all, whereas a smaller percentage can get even more strength from it than usual.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/reduce-foot-and-ankle-swelling/,Reduce Foot And Ankle Swelling [Top 9 Causes],"If you’re dealing with foot and ankle swelling, it’s crucial to identify the cause before attempting any treatment. In today’s video, we look at nine causes and how to address them effectively.

The first cause is Number 9. “Trauma”.

If you’ve recently sprained or broken your ankle or foot, the swelling is your body’s normal inflammatory response to the injury. When soft tissues are damaged, the body sends extra blood and fluids to the area to remove debris and start repairing the injury, leading to swelling, redness, pain and warmth around the trauma site.

In the case of a broken bone, there is also internal bleeding that can pool in the area and cause significant swelling and bruising. The swelling helps stabilize the fracture but makes it difficult to walk or even get a shoe on.

To treat swelling caused by acute soft tissue injuries like sprains or trauma to the ankle or foot, use the PRICE method:

“Protect” the area by avoiding walking on it if it hurts and using crutches if necessary;
“Rest” by giving your ankle a break;
“Ice” by applying a cold pack that conforms to your ankle to reduce swelling and inflammation;
“Compress” using an ACE wrap to prevent fluid buildup, but not wrapping it too tightly;
and “Elevate” by keeping your ankle elevated, preferably using a leg wedge for comfort.

Also take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication if approved by your doctor.

However, the most important treatment is time, as depending on the severity and location of the trauma, it could take six months or more for the swelling to fully subside, and some may persist permanently due to lymphatic or vascular damage.

The next cause is Number 8. “Infection”.

If you have an infection in your foot or ankle area, such as cellulitis, swelling will likely occur because your body sends extra blood and inflammatory cells to the infected site to fight off the invading bacteria. This swelling is usually accompanied by redness, warmth, pain, and sometimes fever or chills if the infection is severe.

Treating the underlying infection with antibiotics, whether oral, topical, or intravenous, is crucial. However, don’t forget to also utilize the RICE method—rest, ice, compression, and elevation—to manage the swelling itself, as reducing swelling can help your body combat the infection more effectively.

Infections like cellulitis can cause significant swelling and require prompt medical treatment to address this condition properly.

Moving on to Number 7, we have “Venous Insufficiency”.

Problems with the veins in the legs are a very common cause of swollen feet and ankles. Your venous system is responsible for carrying deoxygenated blood from your legs, extremities, and organs back to the heart. Unlike arteries that use the pumping force of the heart, your veins rely on the movement of muscles and physical motion to push blood flow back towards the heart.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) occurs when the one-way valves in leg veins become weakened or damaged, allowing blood to flow backwards and pool in the lower legs. This pooling of blood leaks fluid into the surrounding leg tissues, causing swelling, skin discoloration, varicose veins, and sometimes leg ulcers.

The swelling is usually worse at the end of the day after being upright and improves somewhat after lying down for a while. If you have a sedentary lifestyle with little physical activity or spend long periods standing, your risk of developing vein problems increases.

Wearing compression stockings can help improve venous return from the legs and reduce swelling. Other methods include leg elevation to drain pooled blood, calf muscle exercises to promote circulation, and weight loss if overweight. In severe cases, procedures to remove, close, or bypass damaged veins may be required.

Coming up at Number 6 is, “Blood Clot In The Deep Veins”.

One major cause of chronic venous insufficiency is deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A DVT or blood clot in the leg, which can sometimes form after surgery, can cause significant swelling in just that leg or foot.

As the clot blocks normal return of blood to the heart, fluid is trapped in the leg’s tissues and causes swelling, pain, warmth and redness. While treating the clot with blood thinners or clot busters is necessary, the swelling may persist as your body develops new veins around the clot area. Some permanent swelling is common after a DVT.

It’s crucial to seek immediate medical attention if you suspect a blood clot, as it can lead to serious complications like pulmonary embolism. This means that a piece of clot breaks off and travels to the lungs where it causes a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries. If you experience swelling in just one leg, especially with pain or discoloration, you need to get it evaluated immediately.

The next cause is Number 5. “Lymphedema”.

Lymphedema is a chronic condition that occurs when the lymph system is damaged or impaired, often due to lymph node removal, radiation treatment, injury or infection. This causes a backup of protein-rich lymph fluid that leaks into the surrounding tissues. In lymphedema, the swelling is most commonly seen in an arm or leg and may also cause a heavy, achy feeling, restricted movement, and thickening of the skin over time.

This condition is usually treated with compression garments, although they may not be enough. Specialized lymphatic massage, exercise and other therapies are often required to encourage lymph drainage. To see our recommended supplement to reduce lymphedema or leg swelling, click the link below.

Next, we have Number 4. “Medication Side Effects”.

Many common medications can cause fluid retention and swelling in your feet and ankles as a side effect. Calcium channel blockers used to treat high blood pressure are one such group of drugs that can lead to this issue.

Additionally, steroids such as prednisone, antidepressants, diabetes medications, hormone drugs like birth control pills, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also contribute to swollen feet and ankles. This swelling happens due to the medication’s impact on your kidneys, blood vessels, or your body’s ability to regulate fluid.

If the swelling becomes excessive or causes significant discomfort, discuss this side effect with your doctor. They may adjust the dosage or switch you to an alternative medication to alleviate the swelling in your feet and ankles.

The Number 3 cause is, “Heart Failure”.

Heart failure is a chronic condition in which your heart muscle becomes too weak or stiff to pump blood properly throughout your body. This can happen gradually over time, or suddenly after a heart attack or other serious heart problems. One common symptom is fluid buildup and swelling in your legs and ankles, typically affecting both legs rather than just one side.

When your heart’s pumping ability is impaired, it cannot efficiently pump blood back from your legs, causing fluid accumulation in your lower extremities. The swelling may be accompanied by fatigue, shortness of breath, and weight gain.

Treating the underlying heart condition is crucial to reduce leg swelling. The methods include medications like diuretics and ACE inhibitors to remove excess fluid and improve heart function, regular aerobic exercise to promote circulation, and joining a cardiac rehabilitation program. Even with treatment, you may need to wear compression stockings and elevate your legs to prevent fluid accumulation.

At Number 2 we have, “Kidney Disease”.

The kidneys play a vital role in regulating the body’s fluid balance, but when they aren’t functioning properly due to kidney disease, excess fluid accumulates and gets trapped in the body’s tissues, especially the legs and feet, leading to swollen feet and ankles.

There are two main reasons behind this swelling: firstly, with impaired kidney function, the body cannot effectively remove excess fluid, leading to its buildup in tissues; and secondly, in severe kidney disease, protein can leak out of the blood and into tissues, attracting more fluid through a process called osmosis. This swelling due to kidney failure is often accompanied by other symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and changes in urination patterns.

Treating the underlying kidney issue with the help of a nephrologist is crucial to address swelling. Recommended measures include following dietary restrictions for kidney disease, limiting salt, fluid, and potassium intake, frequently elevating the legs, wearing compression stockings, and taking diuretic (water pill) medication as prescribed.

And at Number 1, we have “Liver Disease”.

Both liver disease and malnutrition can contribute to swollen feet and ankles by reducing levels of important blood proteins that help keep fluid inside the blood vessels. The liver produces many of these proteins, including albumin.

Albumin helps maintain oncotic pressure, which is the force that pulls fluid back into the blood vessels from the surrounding tissues through osmosis. When albumin and other protein levels drop too low, this pressure decreases, allowing fluid to leak out of the blood vessels and accumulate in the legs and ankles due to gravity, causing edema. This leg swelling, often accompanied by abdominal swelling (ascites), is commonly seen in people with liver failure.

To manage this condition, a combination of treatments is often required. This includes addressing the underlying liver condition, adhering to a low-sodium and high-protein diet, wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs, and taking prescribed diuretics or fluid pills as recommended by healthcare providers.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 21, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/reasons-to-eat-more-eggs/,What Happens When You Eat 3 Whole Eggs Every Day…You’ll Be Surprised What It Does To Your Body!,"Why eat more eggs?  A few years ago, health organizations issued a warning about the cholesterol contained in eggs. Like many other foods such as coconut oil or avocados, eggs were mistakenly thought to be bad for your health. (Updated June 21, 2024)

While the average large egg delivers between 180-186 mg of cholesterol, your liver produces anywhere between 1,000 mg to 2,000 mg each day on its own.

Basically, when you consume foods that contain cholesterol, your liver adjusts itself by decreasing its own production. This means that eating eggs doesn’t increase the existing amounts of cholesterol in your body, you’re simply replacing one type with another.  So would it be a good thing to eat more eggs?

Today, a closer look at this yummy breakfast food really shows 7 reasons why it’s worth incorporating more of it into your diet.


1. Nutrients

When it comes to nutritional value, eggs really give you the best bang for your buck. Loaded with vitamin A, E, B6 and B12, thiamin, riboflavin folate, iron, phosphorous, magnesium, selenium and so much more, it’s hard to find other foods with such a varied nutrient profile (1).",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 21, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/nutrient-to-improve-gut-health/,No. 1 Nutrient To Improve Gut Health,"You’ve heard about probiotics and prebiotics, but have you heard about postbiotics? Postbiotics are just as crucial for your gut health as prebiotics and probiotics, yet they rarely get the same attention. In today’s video, you’ll discover what postbiotics are and how a powerful postbiotic called butyrate can significantly benefit your gut, body, and overall health.

In fact, gastroenterologists—experts on the gut—believe butyrate could be “the vitamin D of the next decade: the sunshine from within molecule,” highlighting its wide-ranging importance. Watch this video until the end to learn the THREE ways you can increase butyrate through your diet.

Before we get into what postbiotics are, you need to understand probiotics and prebiotics, especially if you have gut issues, as they all work together to support your gut health.

You have up to 300 trillion bacteria inside you, forming your gut microbiome, and outnumbering your own cells. Some of these bacteria are beneficial, while others can cause imbalance and disease.

To live long and well, your goal is to maintain a balanced gut microbiome with more beneficial bacteria.

Probiotics are the healthy bacteria in your gut. Their job is to support and maintain a balanced gut microbiome, which offers benefits like improved digestion, better immune function, healthier skin, enhanced mental health, reduced inflammation, and a lower risk of diseases.

You can get probiotics from foods like fermented vegetables, sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, yogurt, tempeh, and kombucha, or from supplements. However, if you have histamine intolerance, fermented foods can trigger symptoms like headaches, nausea, and cramps, so take note.

Probiotic supplements can benefit most people, especially those with digestive symptoms or gut microbiome imbalances. However, if you have SIBO, use spore-forming probiotics like Bacillus coagulans, as other bacteria can worsen symptoms by increasing bacterial overgrowth in your small intestine.

What most people don’t understand is that probiotics are useless without prebiotics, like a car without gasoline. Probiotics are healthy bacteria, and prebiotics are what probiotics eat to get the “fuel” to do their job.

Prebiotics are dietary fibers in plant-based foods that your body can’t digest. They pass through your small intestine undigested and reach your colon, where they are fermented by the probiotics in your gut. This process produces nourishing nutrients like short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, acetate, and propionate), which support a healthy gut microbiome.

Foods high in prebiotic fiber include chicory root, garlic, onions, dandelion greens, Jerusalem artichokes, walnuts, and pistachios. While prebiotics offer many gut health benefits, such as increasing satiety, reducing food cravings, and promoting regular bowel movements, they may not be suitable for everyone.

Consuming too many prebiotics can cause gas, bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. If you have IBS, SIBO, or FODMAP intolerance, prebiotics can exacerbate your condition, so it’s best to limit or avoid them until your symptoms improve.

Next, let’s get into postbiotics and butyrate.

Postbiotics are bioactive compounds produced when probiotics break down and ferment prebiotics. These byproducts include short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), enzymes, and components of bacterial cells. One important short-chain fatty acid is butyrate, which has been well-studied to support digestive health, help control inflammation, and even aid in preventing disease.

Next, let’s look at six incredible benefits of butyrate.

The Number 1 benefit is “Strengthen The Gut Lining”.

Butyrate is the main energy source fueling the cells that form the lining of your colon (colonocytes). This intestinal lining helps your body absorb nutrients and protects it from harmful bacteria, yeast, and other pathogens, effectively acting as a gatekeeper.

However, when you don’t eat enough prebiotic foods, bacteria like those in the Firmicutes group cannot produce sufficient butyrate, and your gut lining weakens.

Consequently, toxins and pathogens can slip through holes, or ‘leaks,’ in the walls, potentially causing leaky gut syndrome. This condition can lead to a range of uncomfortable symptoms, including digestive distress and low energy

Butyrate can help repair the ‘leaks’ in your gut walls by tightening the ‘junctions’ that connect every cell.

The next benefit is, Number 2 “Prevent Gut Inflammation”.

Butyrate helps to stop inflammatory processes by increasing the production of glutathione, an antioxidant that neutralizes harmful free radicals and protects cells from damage.

Recent studies show that butyrate or butyrate-producing microbes can help protect against or reduce symptoms of many chronic inflammation-related conditions, such as allergies, IBS, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, high blood pressure, insomnia, anxiety, and type 2 diabetes. I have included links to the sources below.

Moving on is benefit Number 3, “Prevent Digestive Disorders”.

Butyrate may be beneficial in the management of digestive disorders, such as IBS and IBD. Both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, which are types of IBD, are associated with lower levels of a specific beneficial bacterium called Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, known to produce butyrate.

In a major 2015 study conducted in Spain, researchers examined the gut health of 113 people with digestive problems like constipation, diarrhea, and bloating, and compared them to 66 healthy individuals. They found that those with digestive issues had much lower levels of butyrate, while the healthy participants had higher levels of this beneficial compound. This suggests that butyrate levels may be a key factor in maintaining gut health and preventing digestive disorders.

The next benefit, Number 4 is “Protect Against Cancer”.

Bowel cancer, also called colorectal cancer, is a major health problem in the Western world, mainly because people don’t eat enough fiber. Without enough butyrate, the cells in your gut can’t work properly.

This allows harmful cells to grow and send out signals that cause inflammation and lead to cancer. Butyrate can make these harmful cells self-destruct, stopping cancer from developing.

And benefit Number 5, we have “Combat Diabetes and Obesity”.

When more short-chain fatty acids like butyrate are made in the colon, they trigger the release of gut hormones that help improve insulin resistance and keep blood sugar levels normal.

Additionally, butyrate has anti-obesity effects, such as reducing appetite and increasing satiety, which contribute to better weight management.

Furthermore, butyrate can be converted into ketones in the liver, benefiting liver health and supporting the ketogenic diet. The keto diet severely limits carbohydrate intake, forcing the body to use fat for energy in a state called ketosis. By helping to maintain ketosis, butyrate plays a crucial role in increasing fat burning and controlling appetite.

And the Number 6 benefit is, “Protect Your Brain”.

Butyrate affects many of the processes involved in diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, stroke, and autism, which means it can also help support brain health. In fact, a 2011 study in Germany found that butyrate could even improve mental function in aging mice.

Before we look at the THREE ways to increase butyrate in your diet, let’s review the factors that lower butyrate levels. These factors disrupt the balance of your gut microbiome, reducing the number of butyrate-producing bacteria:

A low-fiber diet, eating high-lectin foods, antibiotic use, chronic stress, poor sleep patterns, excessive alcohol consumption, eating too much sugar, consuming vegetable oils and trans fats, and lack of exercise.

So, the first obvious way to boost butyrate production is to eat a diet high in prebiotic fiber because it encourages the butyrate-producing bacteria in your colon to thrive. Here’s a list of prebiotic foods again: apples, garlic, onions, Jerusalem artichoke, chicory root, barley, oats, flaxseed, walnuts and pistachios.

One potential issue with increasing butyrate by consuming prebiotic-rich foods is that many of these foods are also high in lectins, which can trigger leaky gut and cause gas and bloating.

Nightshade vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplants also contain lectins. These are resistant plant proteins that can contribute to leaky gut by binding to the cells in your gut lining and causing inflammation.

To avoid the negative effects of lectins, you can either skip lectin-containing foods or make them more digestible by cooking, soaking, fermenting, or sprouting them first.

If you have IBS or IBD, an autoimmune condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or celiac disease, or experience symptoms like nausea or other types of digestive distress after consuming high-lectin foods, you should definitely consider avoiding lectins.

The second way to get more butyrate into your diet is by eating foods that already contain butyrate. These foods include butter—especially grass-fed butter—hard cheeses like Parmesan and Pecorino, and full-fat yogurt with live active cultures.

The third way to increase butyrate levels is to take a supplement. Ideally, this supplement should contain:

Spore-forming probiotic strains that can survive the acidic environment of the stomach, Prebiotics that do not cause gas and bloating, And butyrate that can make it to your intestines.

Such a supplement does exist, and it is our recommended natural solution to increase butyrate levels in your body. Click the link below to learn more.

Finally, other ways to increase butyrate levels or butyrate-producing bacteria include getting enough quality sleep, intermittent fasting, reducing stress, and regular exercise.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 20, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/blood-clots/,Everything You Need to Know About Blood Clots,"Clotting is a life-saving measure your body takes to prevent itself from bleeding out during an injury. Platelets and proteins in the plasma of your blood jump into action within the first second to minutes after your blood vessel is injured (1). (Updated June 14, 2024)

These clots form a barrier that temporarily seals off the site of injury to keep bacteria and matter out. When the blood vessel is healed, the clot naturally dissolves. When clots form inappropriately inside your blood vessels, however, it can be a recipe for disaster.

Up to 900,000 people develop vascular blood clots in the United States every year. If caught in time, blood clots can be safely dissolved. If not, they will gradually decrease blood flow throughout the body or even migrate towards the lungs, heart, or brain, where they can prove fatal. In fact, roughly 1 in 3 people to suffer from blood clots will die of the condition.

What you Need to Know About Blood Clots

The most important factor in increasing survival is to be able to recognize blood clots early on in their formation. Knowing why they occur is incredibly helpful too.

Common causes include:

Antiphospholipid syndrome
Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis
Certain medications, such as oral contraceptives, hormone therapy drugs, and some breast cancer medications
Factor V Leiden
Family history of blood clots
Heart arrhythmias
Hiatal hernia
Heart failure
Obesity
Peripheral artery disease
Polycythemia vera
Pregnancy
Prolonged sitting or bed rest
Smoking
Stroke
Surgery

Blood clots in the arms and legs can cause (2):

Swelling
Pain
Tenderness
A warm sensation
A pale or bluish discoloration

These clots can also be a sign of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), which occurs “…when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one or more of the deep veins in your body, usually in your legs.”

“Deep vein thrombosis can also happen if you don’t move for a long time, such as after surgery, following an accident, or when you are confined to a hospital or nursing home bed,” writes the Mayo Clinic (3). DVP typically presents itself a tender, cramp-like pain, muscle soreness or a charley horse.

Pulmonary Embolism Symptoms

A pulmonary embolism is a blockage of in one of the pulmonary arteries in your lungs, typically caused by a blood clot. This causes a fatal blockage of blood flow to the lungs (4).

Patients suffering from deep vein thrombosis are more likely to suffer from a pulmonary embolism. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and bloody or blood-streaked phlegm.

Other symptoms include:

Clammy or discolored skin (cyanosis)
Fever
Excessive sweating
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Lightheadedness or dizziness

All the symptoms above should be taken seriously and require emergency care.

Blood clots in the brain, which are just as deadly, can manifest themselves as the weakness of the face, arms or legs, difficulty speaking, vision problems, sudden and severe headache, and dizziness.

Prevention and Treatment

Once at the hospital, doctors can diagnose blood clots thanks to an ultrasound or MRI. A blood test may also be in order.

Your doctor may treat the condition with anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and/or surgery.

Preventing blood clots is much easier, and far less risky than treating them. To keep your vascular system healthy, exercise daily, quit smoking, maintain a healthy blood pressure and cholesterol, and visit your doctor regularly to check your blood pressure (5).

Women who are pregnant, on birth control, or taking hormone replacement therapy, as well as anyone with a family history of blood clots should discuss blood clot prevention with their doctor.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 14, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/nutrients-to-increase-blood-flow/,Top 10 Nutrients To Increase Blood Flow,"In today’s video, we’ll look at 10 nutrients that help increase blood flow for those with hardened arteries, clogged arteries, varicose veins, and swollen legs! We’ll also give you THREE important tips, and recommend the most impactful and affordable nutrients to take to reduce arterial plaque and increase blood flow. So, make sure to watch this video until the end.

First, a precaution that applies to all the supplements we’ll mention in this video: Always consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, to avoid any potential interactions with medications or underlying health conditions.

Let’s begin with Number 10. “Nattokinase”.

Nattokinase is an enzyme extracted from natto, a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans. It can help remove plaque buildup in the arteries by breaking down fibrin, a protein involved in blood clotting. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fatty substances, calcium deposits, cellular waste products, and fibrin.

By breaking down fibrin and other proteins, nattokinase reduces blood viscosity. This means your blood becomes less thick and sticky, allowing it to flow more smoothly and easily through your vessels. Moreover, this enzyme can dissolve existing blood clots, helping to clear blocked arteries and improve circulation, thereby preventing heart attack and stroke.

Some studies also suggest nattokinase can help lower blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels, further contributing to better blood flow.

While you can get plenty of this enzyme by eating natto, many people cannot get used to the slimy texture. To supplement, take 100-200 mg per day.

Next we have Number 9. “Vitamin K2”.

Vitamin K2 helps maintain healthy blood flow by preventing arterial calcification, in which calcium buildup on artery walls leads to plaque and hardening. This vitamin activates proteins, particularly matrix GLA protein (MGP), that help keep calcium in the bones where it belongs and out of the arteries.

In this way, vitamin K2 helps maintain the elasticity of the arteries, thereby improving blood flow and reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.

A 2021 JAMA study of over 50,000 Danish individuals found that higher vitamin K2 intake was associated with significantly lower risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is caused by plaque buildup in the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle.

You may be surprised to learn that natto is the richest overall source of vitamin K2, particularly the MK-7 form which lasts longer and is better absorbed by your body than MK-4.

While sauerkraut (fermented cabbage) is often touted as a good plant-based source of vitamin K2 MK-7, it actually has 100-200 times less MK-7 per serving than natto. On the other hand, animal products like goose liver paste, egg yolks, and hard cheeses contain the MK-4 form of vitamin K2, which is less bioavailable than MK-7.

The recommended dose of vitamin K2 is 90-120 mcg per day for adults. When supplementing with vitamin K2, it is important to ensure your body is not lacking in vitamin D3 and magnesium as these nutrients work synergistically. Vitamin D3 helps absorb calcium, which vitamin K2 then ensures is properly utilized in bones rather than soft tissues, while magnesium aids this process by activating vitamin D.

Moving on, we have Number 8. “Aged Garlic Extract”.

Several studies have shown that aged garlic extract can prevent and reduce both soft and calcified plaque buildup in your arteries, thereby helping to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease.

While the key compound in garlic, allicin, is known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects when crushed or cut, aged garlic is even more powerful for your body.

This is because the aging process, which involves storing sliced garlic in specialized containers for up to 20 months, concentrates and stabilizes garlic’s beneficial compounds, making them more bioavailable and effective for your system.

Aged garlic increases the production of nitric oxide in the endothelial cells lining the inside of your blood vessels. Nitric oxide is a signaling molecule that acts as a vasodilator to relax and widen your blood vessels, thus enhancing blood flow throughout your body.

A study involving individuals aged 40 to 75 found that aged garlic extract significantly reduced coronary artery plaque in participants with metabolic syndrome. The typical dosage of aged garlic extract used in studies ranges from 1200 mg to 2400 mg per day.

Coming up next is Number 7. “Pomegranate”.

Pomegranates are a rich source of powerful antioxidants called polyphenols that combat plaque formation in several ways.

First, these polyphenols, particularly punicalagins, stop the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, thereby preventing them from damaging artery walls and contributing to the formation of plaque.

Second, the polyphenols enhance the ability of enzymes associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to break down oxidized lipids in plaque.

Third, they reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the arteries, preventing plaque formation and growth. Finally, they help clear out dead cells from plaque, making the plaque more stable.

A one-year study found that drinking 50 ml of pomegranate juice daily reduced the thickness of carotid arteries by up to 30% and blood pressure by 21% in patients with atherosclerosis, or clogged arteries. The carotid arteries in the neck are responsible for more than 80% of blood flow to the brain, and narrowing of these major vessels is a major risk factor for stroke.

The next nutrient is Number 6. “Beets”.

Beetroot contains high levels of nitrates that are converted to nitric oxide in the body, thus increasing blood flow and lowering blood pressure.

However, the hypotensive (blood-pressure-lowering) effect is not solely from nitrates. The antioxidant, betalain, which give beets their vibrant red color, also play a role by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that constricts your blood vessels.

This is supported by a study showing beetroot juice reduced blood pressure more effectively than nitrate-rich beverages, suggesting compounds like betalains are involved. Furthermore, research funded by the British Heart Foundation showed that drinking beetroot juice daily lowered inflammation levels for those with heart failure. Chronic inflammation can lead to heart disease.

Coming up next is Number 5. “Niacin”.

Niacin, also known as Vitamin B3, increases blood flow by raising “good” HDL cholesterol, lowering LDL cholesterol, and reducing inflammation, which together help reduce arterial plaque buildup.

Specifically, niacin lowers the small, dense LDL particles in your blood, which are more likely to form plaque than larger, buoyant LDL particles. It shifts the distribution of your LDL particles from smaller and denser, to larger and more buoyant.

This is why some people with a high LDL number do not develop coronary artery disease. They have lots of large, buoyant LDL particles, which do not contribute much to plaque buildup.

The typical dosage range of niacin that has been studied and shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels is 1,000-3,000 mg per day. This is often given in an extended-release form to reduce the flushing reaction triggered by increased blood flow to the skin’s surface.

And at Number 4, we have “Vitamin C”.

Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, plays a crucial role in improving blood flow. First, it neutralizes free radicals that can damage blood vessels and contribute to plaque formation, through its potent antioxidant properties.

Second, vitamin C is essential for the production of collagen, a protein that fortifies the walls of arteries, making them less likely to develop plaque and other forms of damage. Third, it enhances the production and availability of nitric oxide to improve blood flow.

Even though fruits and vegetables like oranges, bell peppers, broccoli, and cauliflower are rich in vitamin C, eating these foods alone is not enough to meet the daily recommended intake for most people.

For supplementation, the recommended dosage of vitamin C is 500 to 1,000 mg per day, while up to 2,000 mg per day is considered safe without risking side effects such as digestive issues. You’ll get the most benefit by taking a food-based vitamin C supplement, and dosing throughout the day.

Moving on, we have Number 3. “L-Citrulline”.

L-Citrulline is an amino acid that gets turned into L-arginine primarily in your kidneys. L-arginine is like a building block for making nitric oxide. When there’s more nitric oxide, your blood vessels relax and widen, allowing blood to flow more easily. This makes it harder for plaque to build up in your arteries.

To naturally boost your citrulline levels, you can eat watermelon, cucumbers, and cantaloupe. However, for a more concentrated dose, supplement with 3–6 grams of L-citrulline per day.

So, why not take L-arginine directly? For older people, taking citrulline supplements raises arginine levels more than taking arginine itself, because citrulline doesn’t get broken down by the liver first.

The next nutrient is Number 2. “Magnesium”.

Many adults don’t get enough magnesium in their diet, which is problematic because low magnesium levels are closely linked to an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and irregular heartbeats.

Magnesium acts as a calcium blocker, preventing calcium from hardening the artery walls. It also regulates the turnover of proteins like collagen and elastin, which are essential for keeping arteries flexible and elastic, allowing for smooth blood flow. Furthermore, magnesium promotes the production of nitric oxide to increase blood flow throughout the body.

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for magnesium is 320-420 mg/day for adults. Some of the top sources of dietary magnesium are pumpkin seeds, spinach, cashews, quinoa, almonds, and dark chocolate.

While there are numerous forms of magnesium supplements, each with its own potential advantages, it is more important to focus on the adequate intake of magnesium through a balanced diet, and supplementation when needed.

And at Number 1, we have “Omega-3 Fatty Acids”.

Omega-3 fatty acids like EPA and DHA have anti-inflammatory effects that can calm down the inflammation driving the buildup of plaque in your artery walls. These healthy fats promote the formation of stable, fibrous plaque that is less prone to rupturing compared to the unstable, fatty plaque that can easily break off and cause a heart attack or stroke.

Moreover, omega-3s improve the function of your endothelial cells, allowing your arteries to dilate and widen properly for better blood flow. Additionally, the omega-3s in fish oil have a mild blood-thinning effect that can help prevent excessive clotting and improve your blood flow.

The recommended dose of Omega-3s for cardiovascular benefits varies across studies but typically ranges from 1-4 grams per day of combined EPA and DHA. You can obtain EPA and DHA from fatty fish like wild salmon, mackerel, sardines, trout, and shellfish like oysters.

When considering fish oil supplements, avoid cheap, big-box brand fish oils because they are likely to have oxidized and gone bad.

Finally, here are THREE important tips for improving arterial health and blood flow.

One. Physical activity and lifestyle changes like regular exercise, not smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight are the most proven and important treatments.

Two. It’s not just about adding supplements – avoiding inflammatory foods high in sugar and triglycerides that exacerbate plaque buildup is equally important.

Three. Instead of taking all 10 supplements, focus on the most important and affordable ones, along with an anti-inflammatory diet.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/functional-foods-kill-cancer-cells/,Top 10 Functional Foods In The World Which Fight Cancer Cells,"It’s rare to find an individual whose life has not been touched by cancer, which is why many may be surprised to find that the human immune system is already strong enough to conquer all cancer cells.  Did you know that some foods have the ability to kill cancer cells? (Updated June 4, 2024)

In fact, your body is constantly battling cancer cells every day. To do this, your body requires specific enzymes, proteins, and biological codes found in your foods.

Scientists have found that chemotherapy treatment can sometimes backfire in cancer patients by damaging healthy cells which then secrete the protein WNT16B, which boosts cancer cell survival (1).

While there’s still a lot of research to be done on cancer, adding certain foods to your diet can definitely help and these foods can kill cancer cells.

Top 10 Foods That Inhibit Tumor Growth

The following foods have all been found to contain powerful cancer-fighting elements. They have the remarkable ability to kill cancer cells or at least have a high chance of killing cancer cells and give you a fighting chance.  We highly suggest adding them to your daily diet to reduce inflammation and strengthen your immune system.

1. Green Tea

Green tea polyphenols actually inhibit an enzyme required for cancer cell growth. In addition to inhibiting cancer cells from growing, Polyphenols (GTP), has been found to kill cancer cells without affecting the healthy ones (2).

The amount of green tea intake necessary for anti-cancer effects has been suggested to be around 3 cups of tea a day (in cases such as early stage breast cancer). Women who had three cups of green tea had 57% fewer relapses than women who drank one cup or less per day (3)

2. Resveratrol and Grapes

Resveratrol, a known potent antioxidant found in a number of plants like grape skins, pomegranate, and raw cocoa has been found to have anti-cancer benefits. Resveratrol is also a powerful anti-inflammatory (preventing cancer as a result of excess inflammation), that has also been found to aid cancer treatment (4).

3. Tomatoes

Researches have found that eating tomatoes have the potential to protect men from prostate cancer. The fruit helps guard the DNA in your cells from damage that leads to cancer. Tomatoes are also high in antioxidants and aid your body in the absorption of lycopene, a cancer-fighting antioxidant (5). When regularly consumed, tomatoes can help lower your overall risk of cancer. By regulating hormones, releasing toxins, and reducing levels of cholesterol, it is a valuable addition to your daily diet (6).

4. Cannabis Oil

Despite the taboos associated with it, cannabis oil hosts an abundance of health benefits, particularly in the realm of fighting cancer.  Cannabis oil may be one of the strongest cancer-fighting food available,  due to the fact that they activate cannabinoid receptors in the body. Cannabinoids play a major role in immune system generation and regeneration, vital parts of battling cancer (7).",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 4, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-make-alkaline-water-to-fight-fatigue-and-cancer/,"How To Make Alkaline Water To Fight Fatigue, Digestive Issues And Cancer","Is alkaline water good for you? A healthy body should always be slightly alkaline. The majority of people today, however, tend to be more acidic (if not highly acidic). This is caused by stress, environmental factors and the foods they eat. (Updated June 4, 2024)

Why does this matter? Simple, the more acidic your body the more likely you are to experience fatigue, digestive issues and weight gain.

In addition, if the environment in our bodies is too acidic for too long, our otherwise healthy cells can become toxic and in the worst case scenario become cancerous.

Alkaline Water: How It All Works

The pH scale runs from 0 to 14 (0 being the most acidic, 14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral.)

Our bodies are designed to thrive in a slightly alkaline environment of 7.4.

Various organs and systems, however, thrive with different pH levels. For example, your saliva has a pH range from 6.5-7.0 (more acidic in order to help digest foods), your skin typically has a pH of 5 (although, according to a 2006 study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science, it should actually be lower—4-4.5—as this allows the bacteria required to help heal and fight off infections, live on your skin).

And, as you can imagine, the pH of your digestive tract can vary anywhere from 1.5-7.0, which is dependent on many things, but especially, the food you eat.

Why Alkaline Is So Important

We have known for a century that food can determine our overall pH levels, hence our overall health. In 1931, Dr. Otto Warburg, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery that 90-95 percent of all cancers are caused by an acidic environment and that cancer simply cannot grow or survive in an alkaline environment (your body) when your pH is around 7.36.

Since then, studies have determined the various pH levels of foods and drinks and how they react in the human body, either contributing to its alkalinity or acidity.

As Warburg pointed out almost 100 years ago, over-acidity (acidosis) is linked to not only the formation of cancer but as well heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis, and almost every chronic disease people typically suffer from today.

How Do You Know if Your Body is Too Acidic?

Basically, there are two very simple ways to determine if your body is acidic: you can use regular pH paper to do a saliva test, or, if you are suffering from the following chronic symptoms:

Muscle pain or cramping after walking short distances
Constant fatigue
Easily running out of breath
Often feeling like you can’t get enough air

When your pH level falls, your body naturally attempts to regulate itself (to create homeostasis) by capturing and storing excessively acidic substances in your organs such as your kidneys, liver and lungs, thereby maintaining an optimal pH of between 7.35-7.45.

These acidic substances, however, ultimately begin to attack your healthy cells, causing them to become toxic, damaged and sick.

Over time, if the issue is not addressed, these cells can metastasize—grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts or organs in your body.

Your Diet Is Too Acidic

One of the biggest reasons for chronic acidosis is our 21st-century diet consisting of sugar, caffeine, highly processed foods and alcohol. The additives, pesticides and growth hormones used to make and grow our food are also highly acidic to our bodies.

One of the best ways to counter this, however, (apart from changing your diet) is to flush your body with alkaline water.

Since your body is around 70% water, when you ensure that this water is alkaline, you are helping your body create homeostasis.

How to Make Alkaline Water

Ingredients:

1 organic lemon (it is important to use only organic lemons as they are pesticide-free)
2 L of purified water (an osmosis filter is good if you have one, but water that is free of all chemicals and additives is the goal)
1 tablespoon Himalayan salt (which you can find at most health food stores)
1 large glass jar (it must be glass as plastic contains chemicals and impurities that are acidic to your body)

Directions:

Fill the glass jar with the water
Slice the lemon and add it to the water. (do not squeeze out the juice)
Add the Himalayan salt.
Cover the jar and leave it at room temperature for 12-24 hours.

After the water has had time to sit, drink 3 glasses of this alkaline water on an empty stomach. It is always best to do this first thing in the morning before you start your day or put anything else in to your body.

You can also drink alkaline water throughout the day.

Over time, you will begin to see a difference in how you feel (more energy), your skin will become clearer, and your brain more alert—you will generally feel more alive.

If you couple this with a healthier diet, one in which you avoid processed foods, sugar and additives, it won’t be long before you begin to see a healthier (more alkaline) you.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-causing-cancer/,Top 14 Foods Causing Cancer,"Every year, almost 10 million people die from cancer. This statistic has prompted scientists to explore the potential link between diet and the disease. Their research has raised questions about how often certain foods can be consumed, and whether they should be avoided altogether.

While some headlines may suggest avoiding certain foods entirely, the truth is far more complicated. Some carcinogens, or cancer-causing compounds, originate from packaging materials rather than the food itself, while other foods pose no risk unless consumed in excessive amounts. Still, some foods do present a genuine cancer risk.

In today’s video, we look at the science-backed truth behind cancer-causing foods and drinks.

We begin with Number 14. “Too Much Sugar”

While it’s true that all cells in your body, including cancer cells, use sugar (glucose) from the foods you eat as an energy source, research shows that eating sugar does not necessarily lead to cancer.

However, this fact made people think that cutting back on sugar could “starve” cancer cells and stop them from growing. While this idea has some truth to it, sugar alone does not cause cancer.

The American Institute for Cancer Research says there is an “indirect link” between eating a lot of high-sugar foods and getting cancer.

This is because eating too much sugar can lead to weight gain and obesity. And studies show that being overweight or obese increases the risk of getting 12 types of cancers, including colon, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer.

So, while reducing sugar alone cannot directly “starve” cancer cells, it’s still important to reduce sugar intake to help prevent weight gain, obesity, and the associated increased cancer risk.

“Too much sugar” refers to eating a diet high in added sugar and refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, white rice, pasta, pastries, soft drinks, and fruit juices.

The next drink is Number 13. “Soda and Juice”

For many years, health experts have warned about the dangers of sugary drinks like soda. However, a 2019 French study from the NutriNet-Santé group provided shocking evidence linking even moderate soda drinking to higher cancer risk.

The study found that drinking just 4 ounces of soda per day – one-third of an average soda can – increased the overall risk of cancer by 18%. Surprisingly, the study also showed that 100% fruit juices with no added sugar were “significantly linked” to higher cancer rates, likely because their high sugar content (greater than 5%), is similar to soda.

Although juices contain some vitamins and fiber, the lead researcher Dr. Mathilde Touvier said their high sugar levels still increase risks like obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are known to raise cancer risk.

While juices performed slightly better than sodas, Touvier recommended drinking less than one cup per day to reduce these dangers.

And at Number 12, we have “Artificial Sweeteners”

Over the years, artificial sweetener ingredients have raised health concerns due to animal studies linking them to potential cancer risks.

According to the National Cancer Institute, studies showed saccharin may promote bladder cancer in animals. In addition, research from 2005 and 2021 noted aspartame encouraged leukemia and lymphoma in rats.

Food safety authorities like the FDA, and Food Standards Australia and New Zealand, claim that approved artificial sweeteners are safe for consumption based on their reviews.

These sugar substitutes continue to see widespread use in products like diet sodas, packaged foods, tabletop sweetener packets, pharmaceuticals, and yogurts to reduce calorie intake while still providing sweetness.

In general, it’s best not to put foreign chemicals into your body regularly. Healthier substitutes for artificial sweeteners include fresh or frozen fruits, small amounts of honey or maple syrup, and plant-based sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit.

Moving on, we have Number 11. “Vegetable Oils”

Vegetable oils–including corn, sunflower, palm, and soybean are not the best choices for cooking. Research from 2015 showed that heating these oils releases high levels of aldehydes, chemicals linked to cancer, heart disease, and dementia. Shockingly, frying foods in vegetable oils produced 100 to 200 times more toxic aldehydes than the safe daily limit set by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Recently, a 2019 study at the University of Massachusetts found that feeding mice food fried in canola oil increased tumor growth, worsened inflammation, and raised the risk of colon cancer in the animals.

For healthier cooking, it’s better to choose oils like coconut, avocado, and olive oil instead of most vegetable oils.

Up next is Number 10. “Processed Meats”

In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization, issued a warning that processed meats, such as those that are salted, cured, fermented, or smoked, may increase the risk of cancer.

This is because the preservatives and chemicals used in processing, such as nitrites and sodium, can damage cells and potentially lead to cancer.

This claim is well-supported by scientific evidence, including an analysis of data from 10 studies that found consuming 50 grams of processed meat per day raises the chances of developing colorectal cancer by 18%.

According to Cancer Research UK, processed red meat, like ham, bacon, salami, and hot dogs, poses the highest risk, with an estimated 3% of all cancers linked to its consumption.

Still, experts say that this is a reason to limit processed meat, not cut it out. The occasional hamburger in an overall healthy diet shouldn’t hurt you.

As for unprocessed red meat, the evidence linking their consumption to cancer risk, particularly colorectal cancer, is weaker and less conclusive, compared to processed meat.

Coming next is Number 9. “Charred Meat”

Do grilled meats pose a cancer risk? The research says: “possibly“. When meats are cooked at high temperatures, such as when frying or grilling, potentially harmful compounds called Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) can form. These compounds have been shown to increase cancer risk in animal studies.

While the evidence in humans is not conclusive, some research indicates that consuming large quantities of charred or well-done meats may be associated with a higher risk of certain cancers, particularly breast, prostate, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, likely due to higher levels of HCAs.

Also, when fat drips onto hot coals during grilling, it can produce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which may alter DNA and have been linked to skin, bladder, and lung cancers, according to the American Cancer Society.

To reduce the potential cancer risk from charred meat during grilling, you can marinate meats with vinegar or herbs, partially pre-cook meats, flip frequently, remove any charred bits before eating, and use leaner cuts of meat.

The next food is Number 8. “Milk”

Milk can be good for you, but consuming a lot of dairy products may increase the risk of getting breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers, because of the hormones and fat.

A large 28-year study called the Physicians Health Study followed over 21,000 people. It found that those who drank more than 2.5 servings of dairy each day were 34% more likely to get prostate cancer compared to those who drank little dairy.

Another large study in Sweden discovered that women who drank 2 or more glasses of milk per day had double the risk of “serous ovarian cancer”, compared to women who rarely drank milk.

And the Adventist study found that women who drank higher amounts of cow’s milk (full-fat and low-fat), had 50% increased risk of breast cancer.

The next drink is Number 7. “Alcohol”

You won’t get cancer from enjoying an occasional drink. However, heavy daily drinking can significantly increase your risk of developing six different cancers: esophageal, larynx, mouth and throat, colon and rectum, breast, and liver cancers.

This is because alcohol contains a chemical called acetaldehyde that can damage DNA and prevent it from repairing properly, allowing cancer cells to grow.

While the American Cancer Society recommends limiting alcohol intake to two drinks per day for men and one for women, even light drinking with just one serving per day may slightly raise the cancer risk, according to a 2019 study published in the journal CANCER.

Moving on, we have Number 6. “Microwave Popcorn”

While nothing inside popcorn poses a cancer risk, the lining inside the microwavable bag does. Research in 2013 found that these bags contain perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which resist grease and prevent leaking.

These chemicals are linked to increased risk of testicular and kidney cancer in animal studies. In human studies, PFAS exposure has been associated with higher risks of testicular, kidney, breast and ovarian cancers.

But will eating the popcorn increase PFAS? According to a 2019 study in Environmental Health Perspectives, participants who ate this popcorn had PFAS in their blood, where they remain for many years.

That’s why PFAS are commonly called “forever chemicals”. They are found in all sorts of everyday items like Teflon cookware, pizza boxes, and food wrappers. Most Americans already have detectable levels of PFAS in their blood.

To reduce cancer risk when making homemade popcorn, air-pop the kernels without any oil or butter.

And at Number 5, we have: “Some Peanuts”

Like popcorn, peanuts’ carcinogens come from the packaging, not the food itself. According to the National Cancer Institute, some peanut molds support the growth of aflatoxins, toxic compounds produced by certain molds that can grow on improperly stored crops, such as peanuts, corn, and grains. Aflatoxins are associated with a heightened risk of liver cancer.

But what happens when you consume peanuts without aflatoxin? Studies show that greater peanut intake is generally linked to lower risks of heart disease and cancer, including breast, colon, and lung cancer risk.

Next is Number 4, “Farm-Raised Salmon”

Salmon is a healthy omega-3 rich food. However, farmed salmon contains higher levels of pollutants like PCBs, dioxins, and pesticides compared to wild salmon. These pollutants accumulate from the contaminated fish meal and oil used in farmed salmon feed.

Regular consumption of farmed salmon may increase the risk of prostate and breast cancer, while wild salmon generally has lower pollutant levels, and is considered safer for frequent eating.

Coming into Number 3, we have “Dirty Fruits”

Many people worry about pesticides on fruits and vegetables from the grocery store, even though levels are usually within safety limits. Thus far, no studies have proven a direct link between pesticides on foods like apples and grapes, and increased cancer risk.

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, although research shows pesticide exposure is linked to several types of cancer, the evidence is mainly from farmers and workers with very high exposure.

Organic foods are not pesticide-free. They can also have some pesticide residues, as organic farming allows the use of natural pesticides. But they are generally at lower levels than conventional produce with synthetic pesticides.

To reduce pesticide intake, wash, scrub, or peel fruits and vegetables before eating to remove surface residues.

Next is Number 2. “Ultra-Processed Foods”

Ultra-processed foods (UPF), such as instant noodles, chicken nuggets, white bread, potato chips, French fries, and margarine, have long been linked to obesity, but recent research reveals their connection to cancer as well.

A 2023 study found that for every 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption, there was a staggering 19% increased risk of ovarian cancer, and a 16% increased risk of dying from breast cancer.

These industrial-made foods, containing five or more ingredients and high amounts of fructose, salt, and additives designed to mimic natural flavors, have been implicated in various cancers.

According to a 2006 study in the International Journal of Cancer, eating five slices of white bread per day doubles a person’s risks of kidney cancer.

Also, wheat grown in Western countries is widely sprayed with the herbicide glyphosate, which is classified as “probably carcinogenic to humans” by the World Health Organisation in 2015.

In 2022, the Hong Kong Consumer Council discovered that over 90% of margarine with vegetable oils contained the carcinogen glycidol.

In addition, brown, crispy potato chips and French fries contain acrylamide, a carcinogenic compound formed when certain foods are cooked at high temperatures, also found in cigarette smoke.

Animal studies have consistently shown that exposure to acrylamide increases the risk for several types of cancer.

Moreover, a British study analyzing data from over 470,000 individuals linked high salt consumption to a 40% higher risk of stomach cancer.

Consequently, limiting or avoiding these inflammatory ultra-processed foods is crucial not only for maintaining a healthy weight, but also for reducing the risk of various cancers.

And at Number 1, we have “GMO”

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) have been a topic of debate for years. While some studies suggest a potential link to cancer, the evidence isn’t conclusive and research is ongoing.

But GMOs are everywhere, including in most food derivatives made from conventional corn, soybeans, and canola. So, should you eat GMOs? Comment below.

Personally, I stay away from them, but you should make dietary choices that you’re comfortable with.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 29, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/nutrients-to-remove-age-spots/,Top 3 Nutrients To Remove Age Spots,"If you are dealing with age spots, or uneven skin tone, you are not alone. Like most people, you may think many of these dark spots are caused by the sun, when in reality, they could actually be signs of advanced aging.

According to a recent European study, age spots and uneven skin tone can make others think you’re up to 20 years older!

In today’s video, we’ll look at the root causes of age spots, and the top 3 nutrients that reduce this skin contrast.

Age spots are caused by TWO processes happening within your body at the same time, but most people only know about one of them. So, watch this video until the end, to learn how to effectively remove age spots from the inside out.

First, what are age spots?

Age spots, also called liver spots, solar lentigines, or sun spots, appear on areas of your body that are frequently exposed to the sun, like your face and the backs of your hands.

Sun spots can range in color from light tan to dark brown or black. And while small, their size can vary from as little as 0.2 centimeters, up to around 2 centimeters across.

From a medical standpoint, age spots are not dangerous at all. However, these “skin contrasts” can make you look older than your real age, and take away your true attractiveness MORE than wrinkles do. That’s why so many people are motivated to get rid of age spots!

Next, let’s look at what is happening in your body that causes these dark spots to form. Age spots actually result from the combination of two distinct processes that occur at the same time.

The first process is sun damage, also known as photodamage.

When the sun’s UV rays hit your skin, it causes your body to produce more melanin- the pigment that gives your skin its color. Making extra melanin is your body’s way of protecting your skin, and it happens in two ways.

First, melanin acts as a natural sunscreen to absorb and block the UV radiation so it can’t penetrate deep into the skin. Second, melanin acts like an antioxidant to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by UV rays, that can cause oxidative stress and damage to cells.

As more melanin is produced, the darker or more tanned your skin becomes. This results in a suntan. However, getting too much sun exposure over many years causes damage from the UV rays to build up. This disrupts how melanin normally spreads in the skin.

Instead of spreading smoothly across the skin surface, melanin begins to cluster irregularly in concentrated areas. These areas of uneven, excessive melanin show up as age spots or dark blemishes.

For most people, developing age spots and hyperpigmentation are an inevitable side effect of growing older. It is NOT a “mistake” caused by spending too much time in the sun.

Next, let’s talk about the second process that contributes to the formation of age spots – glycation.

Glycation is the chemical process that occurs when sugar molecules like glucose or fructose bind to structural proteins such as collagen and elastin in the skin. This reaction is similar to what happens when you char a steak, and the edges become dark and crispy.

In the body, the “crispy, darkened bits” that form are called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). When AGEs accumulate over time, they lead to visible signs of premature aging in the skin.

Some level of glycation happens naturally, but the sun’s rays significantly accelerate this glycation process. The UV radiation and high temperatures provide the perfect conditions for excess sugars to rapidly react with the skin’s proteins, generating AGEs at a faster rate.

This buildup of AGEs from the surge in glycation show up as wrinkles, fine lines, age spots, dull skin, and loss of elasticity in the skin over time.

It should be mentioned that glycation can happen in tissues and cells throughout the body, not just in the skin. When glycation persists, AGEs promote inflammation, and damage your organs, joints, and arteries over time.

With that said, do you know the number one factor that increases the production of AGEs inside your body?

This may surprise you, but high blood sugar levels over time is the leading factor that dramatically increase AGEs in your body. This is why type 2 diabetics often look older than their real age.

So, the first thing you must do to prevent and reduce age spots, is to cut down the amount of sugar in your diet, especially added sugars, and refined carbohydrates.

This means foods and drinks such as soda and other sweetened beverages, ice cream, white bread, pasta, and pastries.

As the glycation process requires sugar to create harmful AGEs, the less sugar you consume, even from fruit, the fewer dark spots you may develop. Natural sugar from fruit can contribute to glycation in the skin, due to fructose in fruit, but to a lesser extent compared to added sugar.

Now that we’ve covered sun damage and glycation, let’s talk about three amazing nutrients that can help reduce age spots and give you a fresher, glowing complexion- from the inside out.

These three nutrients – a plant compound, a vitamin, and a mineral – all share the special ability to block tyrosinase, the key enzyme involved in producing melanin.

By blocking tyrosinase activity, these nutrients reduce existing age spots by lowering melanin levels in those areas. Also, they prevent new age spots from forming by controlling how much melanin is made. And their ability to inhibit tyrosinase protects your skin from further pigmentation damage caused by too much melanin.

So, the first tyrosinase inhibitor is “Polyphenols.”

Polyphenols are powerful antioxidants found in plants with brightly colored fruits. They play a crucial role in the survival of these plants by protecting the fruits and seeds from the damaging UV radiation of sunlight.

Consuming a diet rich in polyphenols from plant-based sources, while limiting sugar intake, has proven benefits for reducing the appearance of age spots and uneven pigmentation in the skin.

This was reinforced by a 2020 Japanese study involving 244 healthy Japanese women aged 30-60 years. The researchers found that higher consumption of polyphenols, particularly from coffee and green tea, was associated with lower levels of facial pigmentation and fewer dark spots.

The foods richest in polyphenols, are herbs and spices like cloves, dried peppermint, star anise, oregano, celery seed, and dried sage; cocoa products like cocoa powder and dark chocolate; berries like blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries; nuts like hazelnuts and pecans; seeds like flaxseeds; as well as other fruits like plums, cherries, and pomegranates.

To minimize the glycation from fruit sugars, opt for low-sugar options like berries, citrus fruits (grapefruit, oranges), and melons (cantaloupe, honeydew). And avoid or limit high-sugar fruits like mangoes, grapes, bananas, pineapples, as well as dried fruits like dates and raisins.

What if there is a natural solution to get polyphenols into your skin…WITHOUT any of the sugar from consuming large amounts of polyphenol-rich foods? Not only would this reduce age spots and uneven pigmentation, it would make your skin younger and healthier. Click the link below to learn about this natural solution.

Next, let’s talk about how 2 nutrient deficiencies, when combined with sun damage and glycation, can increase age spot formation, but replenishing them helps age spots fade away.

So, the second tyrosinase inhibitor, is “Vitamin C.”

Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that protects your skin from sun damage, pollution, smoking, and other factors that increase oxidative stress and premature aging.

This essential nutrient is highly involved in the formation of collagen, a key structural component of the skin’s outer layer (epidermis). This protein is what keeps your skin smooth, firm, and elastic, and having enough can help prevent wrinkles, fine lines, and age spots.

As we age, vitamin C deficiency combined with the cumulative effects of sun damage and glycation can lead to age spots on the skin.

There are two main reasons why you may become deficient in vitamin C:

Not eating enough vitamin C-rich foods like vegetables (collard greens, cabbage, bell peppers, chili peppers, parsley), and fresh fruits.
Having insulin resistance, which is often caused by a diet high in carbohydrates, fructose, and eating frequent meals. Insulin resistance makes it harder for your body to absorb and use vitamin C, because it leads to high insulin levels that deplete vitamin C.

Since insulin resistance is the root cause of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, diabetics not only have to deal with high AGEs formation, but also not getting enough vitamin C.

Many polyphenol-rich foods are also abundant in vitamin C, such as berries, citrus fruits, bell peppers, broccoli, apples, and chilli peppers.

However, note that heating or pasteurizing foods can destroy and reduce their vitamin C content. So, you need to get enough of this water-soluble vitamin daily from foods, if you want to lighten age spots.

If you choose to supplement, take 500-1000 milligrams per day of a high-quality, natural vitamin C supplement, and not synthetic vitamin C made from ascorbic acid. The solution we recommend contains both natural polyphenols and vitamin C.

The third nutrient that inhibits tyrosinase, is “Zinc”.

Zinc is well-known for supporting the immune system, and for proper growth and development, but did you know a deficiency in zinc can lead to the formation of age spots?

This is because this essential mineral is needed to boost your skin’s antioxidant defenses, and for collagen production, just like vitamin C.

Since zinc is needed for collagen synthesis, a deficiency can lead to wrinkles, sagging skin, age spots from melanin clumping, and increase the risk of skin conditions such as eczema-like rashes and slow wound healing.

Unfortunately, zinc deficiency is fairly common, especially as we get older. Your body has no specialized storage system for zinc, so you need a regular dietary intake to meet your daily requirements.

Conditions like leaky gut syndrome that affect absorption can also lead to deficiency, even if you’re consuming enough zinc.

The best food sources of zinc are oysters, beef, and shellfish like crab and shrimp. Other lesser sources of zinc are legumes such as lentils and beans, seeds like hemp, pumpkin, and sesame seeds, as well as nuts like cashews and almonds.

When supplementing, choose a bioavailable form like zinc picolinate, and take 15–30 mg per day. If you’re taking higher doses of zinc, you may want to take a zinc and copper supplement together to prevent copper deficiency, since excess zinc can interfere with copper absorption.

By ensuring you’re getting enough zinc, you can support collagen production, boost your skin’s antioxidant defenses, and regulate melanin synthesis – all crucial factors in preventing and reducing age spots.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 21, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/reduce-swelling-in-feet/,Top 5 Nutrients to Reduce Swelling in Feet and Legs,"Are your feet and ankles swollen, puffy, or deformed? Do you see a finger depression when you press down on the area and release? If so, do not ignore your swollen feet and ankles. It could be a red flag signaling problems with your circulation, joints, heart health, or other underlying health conditions.

In today’s video, we’ll look at the root causes of swollen legs, ankles and feet, and the top 5 nutrients to reduce the swelling, so let’s get into it.

To understand the swelling in your feet and legs, known as edema, we need to look at where that excess fluid is coming from.

There are two primary sources – plasma from your circulatory system, and lymph fluid from your lymphatic system.

Plasma is the liquid part of your blood, and in some cases which we’ll mention later, it can leak through your blood vessel walls, and get trapped in the lower extremities due to gravity.

Lymph is a fluid containing white blood cells, and it can build up in the feet and legs when your lymph nodes are damaged or obstructed.

The lymphatic system helps your body fight off infections, and lymph nodes play a vital role by filtering lymph fluid, and trapping harmful bacteria, and abnormal cells like cancer cells.

When your lymph nodes are damaged, waste and bacteria cannot be filtered out of the lymph fluid, so they accumulate and enter the bloodstream.

This places an extra burden on the liver and kidneys to remove these unwanted materials from the blood.

Now, let’s look at what causes edema in the feet and legs. Some common lifestyle factors can be major culprits.

Standing, or sitting for too long, increases pressure on your veins, making it harder for blood to flow back up to your heart.

Your diet also plays a major role – eating a lot of highly processed foods can promote inflammation, weight gain, excess sugar, salt and vegetable oil intake, and nutrient deficiencies that contribute to swelling.

Being overweight or obese puts extra pressure on your veins, leading to built-up fluid.

During pregnancy, hormonal changes and increased blood volume can cause fluid retention, making your legs, ankles, and feet swell.

As you get older, the valves in your leg veins can weaken, allowing blood and fluid to collect in the legs, instead of flowing back up towards the heart.

Next, let’s look at 5 health conditions that can cause your legs and feet to swell.
Number 1. Lymphedema.

Lymphedema is the chronic swelling in the arms or legs caused by the buildup of protein-rich lymph fluid. Lymphedema can develop if lymph nodes are removed or damaged during cancer treatment, radiation, or infections, or when obesity blocks the flow of fluid.

Number 2. High Blood Pressure.

Uncontrolled high blood pressure over a long time, can damage the one-way valves in the veins of your legs, causing venous insufficiency, or leaky veins. The damaged valves allow blood to leak backwards and pool in the legs, instead of returning to the heart. In addition, hypertension also causes the body to retain too much sodium and fluid.

Number 3. Heart Failure.

Prolonged high blood pressure forces the heart muscle to overcompensate by thickening and enlarging, but when this eventually fails, it leads to heart failure. Blood backs up in the veins instead of being pumped properly, increasing pressure that causes fluid leakage and edema in the lower legs, ankles, and feet.

Number 4. Liver disease.

A sick liver, such as in cirrhosis, may not produce enough albumin, a protein that prevents fluid from leaking out of blood vessels. This leads to fluid pooling in your legs, ankles, and feet.

Number 5. Kidney disease.

In chronic kidney disease, damage to tiny kidney filters (nephrons) causes excessive albumin to leak into the urine. Without albumin, excess fluid from the blood vessels can seep into body tissues, resulting in swelling that manifests in the feet.

In addition, certain medications can cause swelling in the ankles and legs as a side effect, such as blood pressure drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, diabetes medications, hormonal treatments, some antidepressants, steroids, and cancer drugs.

As a result of a poor diet, health conditions, and medication, nutrient deficiencies can develop. The lack of these 5 nutrients can cause or worsen swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, but replenishing them can help alleviate the edema.

Three of these nutrients are vitamins, 1 is a mineral and the last one is a healthy fat – can you guess what they are?

Let’s begin with Number 5, “Vitamin B1”.

If you don’t get enough vitamin B1, also known as thiamine, it can cause swelling in your legs and feet in several ways.

First, a thiamine deficiency leads to fluid buildup around your heart, making it hard for your heart to pump blood properly. This causes blood to pool in your veins, resulting in leg swelling.

Lacking thiamine long-term may cause heart failure symptoms like hand or foot swelling. Studies show that up to 1 in 3 people with congestive heart failure have a thiamine deficiency.

Small randomized studies have found that giving adequate amounts of vitamin B1 supplements to heart failure patients, improved their heart function and reduced swelling, regardless of what originally caused their heart failure.

Next, beriberi, a disorder caused by severe thiamine deficiency, has a cardiovascular form called wet beriberi. It causes leg swelling, a fast heart rate, and shortness of breath.

Vitamin B1 is water-soluble; This means your body doesn’t store it for long. It gets used up or excreted quickly, so you need to replenish it regularly.

Great sources of thiamine include pork, fish (salmon, tuna), seaweed, seeds (sunflower seeds, flaxseeds), legumes (black beans, lentils), as well as whole grains, green peas, asparagus, macadamia nuts, and nutritional yeast.

In cases of thiamine deficiency, eating foods rich in vitamin B1, or taking supplements, can help reduce swelling effectively.

Supplemental doses of 5-30 mg 3 times daily, can help treat specific conditions like beriberi.

Next, at Number 4 is “Vitamin C”.

Vitamin C deficiency can make your legs and feet swell in a few key ways:

Your body needs vitamin C to make collagen, which keeps your blood vessels strong and healthy. When your vitamin C levels are low, your blood vessels get weak and fragile. This can cause fluid to leak out, leading to swelling.

Also, low vitamin C is linked to inflammation, which can contribute to fluid buildup and swelling. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant to help reduce inflammation.

Moreover, not getting enough vitamin C makes it harder for your body to heal wounds. In severe cases, old wounds may reopen, raising your risks of infection and more swelling.

Furthermore, your body needs vitamin C to form bones properly. Being deficient may increase your risk of fractures and osteoporosis, which could contribute to leg swelling.

Severe vitamin C deficiency can cause scurvy, a disease that makes your gums and legs swell and bleed.

To prevent swelling from vitamin C deficiency, eat plenty of vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, bell peppers, and greens like cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and spinach.

Or take supplemental doses of 500-1000 mg of vitamin C per day. Higher doses of 2-5 g per day in multiple doses may be required to target and reduce inflammation.

At Number 3, we have “Vitamin D”.

Vitamin D deficiency is common, and can lead to swelling in your legs and feet in a few ways:

Firstly, vitamin D helps control inflammation in your body. When your levels are too low, it can lead to more inflammation, which can cause fluid buildup and swelling, often in your lower limbs.

In addition, your body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium, which is crucial for keeping your bones strong. Being deficient may increase your risks of getting foot and ankle fractures.

A study found that 84% of patients diagnosed with bone marrow edema syndrome (BMOS) in the foot and ankle had low vitamin D levels. This suggests BMOS may be linked to vitamin D deficiency, though more research is needed.

Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency has been tied to a higher risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy, a condition that causes swollen feet.

To keep your vitamin D levels healthy, get regular sun exposure, eat foods rich in vitamin D like fatty fish, cod liver oil, pastured egg yolks, and consider supplements if you’re deficient.

For vitamin D deficiency, take a higher supplemental dose of 2,000 to 5,000 IU per day. This is more than the standard recommended daily amount of 800 IU for adults.

Next, we have Number 2. “Potassium”.

Most people don’t get enough potassium, an essential mineral that helps maintain the balance of fluids and electrolytes in the body.

As a result, low potassium levels (hypokalemia) disrupt the body’s fluid balance, causing excess fluid to accumulate and lead to swelling in the legs and feet. Here’s how it happens:

Your kidneys can’t remove excess fluid and salt effectively. So your body starts reabsorbing and holding onto too much water and salt.

That extra fluid has to go somewhere, and it ends up in your legs, causing them to swell up and become puffy.

There’s more. Low potassium also weakens your blood vessel walls. This allows even more fluid to leak out into the surrounding tissues, adding to the swelling.

To reduce swelling, eat potassium-rich foods to keep your levels in the healthy range. These include potatoes and sweet potatoes, avocados, beets, and leafy greens like spinach and broccoli.

The recommended daily intake of potassium is 3,400 mg for men, and 2,600 mg for women, according to multiple expert sources.

However, higher amounts of 6,000-8,000 mg per day may be needed to effectively reduce significant swelling. Be sure to consult your doctor first before you supplement with potassium, as high doses can cause side effects like nausea or diarrhea.

And at Number 1, we have “Omega-3 fatty Acids”.

Omega-3 fatty acids are well-known for their anti-inflammatory powers, which can be effective for reducing swelling in your legs and feet.

Unfortunately, many people on a standard American diet do not get optimal amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, especially the long-chain EPA and DHA forms found in fatty fish.

EPA and DHA in particular, have been shown to directly reduce inflammation and swelling. In addition, Omega-3s can also lower levels of unhealthy blood fats called triglycerides, which can contribute to fluid retention and swelling.

To get more EPA and DHA, eat fatty, oily fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring and sardines.

And if you’re considering omega-3 supplements, krill oil may be a better choice than fish oil for two reasons.

One. Krill oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA in the form of phospholipids. Your body can absorb these more easily compared to the triglyceride form found in regular fish oil. This makes krill oil a more potent option for fighting inflammation.

Two. Krill oil also contains astaxanthin, a powerful antioxidant that contributes to its anti-inflammatory effects. This makes krill oil especially useful not just for reducing inflammation, but also for supporting heart health and potentially easing joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.

Our recommended krill oil supplement has been proven to reduce swelling in the legs, ankles and feet; click the link below to learn more.

Most experts recommend taking 1,000 to 2,000 mg of combined EPA and DHA omega-3s per day for supplements. However, you may need higher doses up to 3,000-4,000 mg per day to specifically target inflammation.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/constantly-tired-try-these-10-adaptogenic-herbs/,Constantly Tired? Try These 10 Adaptogenic Herbs!,"Modern herbalists say adaptogenic herbs are plants with properties that exert a normalizing influence on the body, neither habit-forming, over-stimulating nor inhibiting normal body function, but rather exerting a generalized tonifying effect. They increase your resistance overall against physical, chemical and biological stressors. (Updated May 13, 2024)

Basically, adaptogenic herbs will give you sustained energy and vitality while allowing your mind to think freely, calmly and without excessive stimulation. Each herb can be taken on its own in the appropriate dosage depending on your specific requirements. Here are the top 10 adaptogenic herbs:

1. RHODIOLA

Rhodiola rosea (Golden Root, Roseroot, Aaron’s Rod) is effective for improving mood and alleviating depression. Its effects are potentially mediated by changes in serotonin and dopamine levels.

Used for centuries in Asia and Scandinavia, Rhodiola is still relatively new to the Western market, but its popularity is growing, in large part because of what an incredibly versatile — and relatively inexpensive.

2. MACA

Maca (Lepidium meyenii) is an annual plant native to the high Andes of Peru and Bolivia. It has been harvested and used by humans in the Andean Mountains for centuries.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/9-signs-of-a-leaky-gut-and-how-to-heal-it/,9 Signs of a Leaky Gut (and how to start healing),"The gut is the gateway to health. If your gut is healthy, chances are that you’re in good health. However, there’s a condition called leaky gut that can lead to a host of health problems. (Updated May 11, 2024)

What is a leaky gut?

The gut is naturally permeable to very small molecules in order to absorb these vital nutrients. In fact, regulating intestinal permeability is one of the basic functions of the cells that line the intestinal wall.

In sensitive people, gluten can cause the gut cells to release zonulin, a protein that can break apart tight junctions in the intestinal lining. Other factors — such as infections, toxins, stress and age — can also cause these tight junctions to break apart.

Once these tight junctions get broken apart, you have a leaky gut. When your gut is leaky, things like toxins, microbes, undigested food particles, and more can escape from your intestines and travel throughout your body via your bloodstream.

Your immune system marks these “foreign invaders” as pathogens and attacks them. The immune response to these invaders can appear in the form of any of the nine signs you have a leaky gut, which are listed below.

What causes leaky gut?

The main culprits are foods, infections, and toxins. Gluten is the number one cause of leaky gut. Other inflammatory foods like dairy or toxic foods, such sugar and excessive alcohol, are suspected as well.

The most common infectious causes are candida overgrowth, intestinal parasites, and small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

Toxins come in the form of medications, including NSAIDS like Motrin and Advil, steroids, antibiotics, and acid-reducing drugs.

They can also present in the form of  environmental toxins like mercury, pesticides and BPA from plastics. Stress and age also contribute to a leaky gut. If you suffer from any of the following conditions, it’s likely that you have a leaky gut.

9 Signs You Have a Leaky Gut

1. Digestive issues such as gas, bloating, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

2. Seasonal allergies or asthma.

3. Hormonal imbalances such as PMS or PCOS.

4. Diagnosis of an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, lupus, psoriasis, or celiac disease.

5. Diagnosis of chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia.

6. Mood and mind issues such as depression, anxiety, ADD or ADHD.

7. Skin issues such as acne, rosacea, or eczema.

8. Diagnosis of candida overgrowth.

9. Food allergies or food intolerances.

How do you heal a leaky gut?

The first step is to follow The Myers Way Comprehensive Elimination Diet, which removes the toxic and inflammatory foods for a certain period of time followed by a 4-R program to heal their gut. The 4-R program is as follows.

1. Remove.

Remove the bad. The goal is to get rid of things that negatively affect the environment of the GI tract, such as inflammatory and toxic foods, and intestinal infections.

2. Replace.

Replace the good. Add back the essential ingredients for proper digestion and absorption, such as digestive enzymes, hydrochloric acid and bile acids.

3. Reinoculate.

It’s critical to restore beneficial bacteria to reestablish a healthy balance of good bacteria.

4. Repair.

It’s essential to provide the nutrients necessary to help the gut repair itself. One of my favorite supplements is L-glutamine, an amino acid that helps to rejuvenate the lining of the gut wall.

If you still have symptoms after following the above recommendations, I would recommend finding a Functional Medicine physician in your area to work with you and to order a comprehensive stool test.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/nutrients-to-destroy-cancer-stem-cells/,Top 11 Nutrients To Destroy Cancer Stem Cells,"The foods you eat can have a profound impact on cancer stem cells, which are a particularly worrisome type of cancer cell. Cancer stem cells possess unique abilities that allow them to drive tumor growth, spread to new areas, and resist treatment, unlike regular cancer cells. These cancer stem cells can self-renew, transform into different cell types, and remain unaffected by normal growth signals or cancer treatments.

Targeting and eliminating cancer stem cells is crucial for successful cancer treatment and prevention. Conventional therapies may eradicate the main tumor, but leave behind the resilient stem cells that can cause the cancer to return and spread.

Fortunately, plant-based nutrients found in fruits, vegetables, and other foods can disrupt the mechanisms that enable cancer stem cells to thrive. These nutrients can help prevent and treat cancer by halting the ability of cancer stem cells to multiply, spread, and resist treatment.

In this video, you’ll discover 11 powerful nutrients that have been shown to destroy cancer stem cells. We’ll also give you 6 proven tips to fight cancer with food, so watch this important video till the end.

First up, our Number 11 nutrient is, “Beta-glucans”.

Mushrooms contain remarkable compounds that can target and destroy cancer stem cells.

The secret lies in the beta-glucans and other small molecules (mycochemicals) found in certain mushrooms. These nutrients have been shown to stimulate your immune system to attack cancer stem cells.

Mushrooms like Turkey Tail, Maitake, Shitake, and Reishi are especially rich in cancer-fighting beta-glucans. Combining extracts from Turkey Tail and Reishi mushrooms may also be highly effective for people with breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers.

While there is no recommended optimal amount, eating medicinal mushrooms daily can provide anti-tumor effects while inducing apoptosis, or cell death.

Coming up, we have Number 10. “Anthocyanins”.

You’ll be amazed to know that over 600 types of anthocyanins are found in plants, like berries (especially bilberries), grapes, eggplant, tea, and blood oranges.

These powerful compounds, that give deeply colored fruits and vegetables their rich hues, can fight cancer in amazing ways.

They support your genes to stop tumor growth in cancer stem cells. They also trigger cell death by manipulating the communication between cancer stem cells and tumors.

Anthocyanins give your body natural healing powers to treat colorectal cancer, reduce breast cancer tumors, and limit the spread of leukemia.

These dietary components can even control cancer stem cells. They do this by boosting tumor-suppressing genes, killing colon cancer cells, and disrupting leukemia cells.

Isn’t that incredible? Start eating fresh and frozen anthocyanin-rich fruits and vegetables to protect yourself from developing cancer and treat existing tumors.

The next nutrient is, Number 9. “Quercetin”.

You may not know it, but quercetin is a powerful antioxidant found in all kinds of delicious foods – vegetables, fruits, teas, even wine!

This superhero compound fights cancer by blocking the pathways that allow cancer cells to thrive. It also boosts your body’s production of other potent antioxidants that can scavenge the free radicals fueling cancer growth.

High doses of quercetin can even impair the genes that activate cancer cells, especially in leukemia. Remember that old saying about an apple a day? Turns out the peels are packed with quercetin!

Other great sources of quercetin include raspberries, green tea, red wine, capers, red onions, and dark tomatoes.

Many fruits are rich in both anthocyanins and quercetin: apples, berries (blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries), and grapes.

There’s no need to supplement with quercetin if you are eating a Rainbow Diet.

Number 8 is an important nutrient, “Vitamin D3”.

Your body produces around 10,000 cancer cells every day, and one of the main factors that can contribute to cancer is a lack of vitamin D3. To destroy cancer stem cells and slow the progression of cancer, it’s crucial to get enough vitamin D3 daily.

Studies show that a daily supplement of 20,000 IU of vitamin D3 can help slow cancer progression and reduce inflammation in your body. Vitamin D3 is also essential for the production of GcMAF, a protein that boosts your immune system’s natural response to treat cancer.

Unfortunately, many factors can decrease your body’s ability to absorb vitamin D, such as high doses of pharmaceutical drugs, lack of time spent outdoors, and decreased oxygen supply to your cells. This can create an environment that allows cancer stem cells to thrive.

To prevent or slow cancer, the recommended vitamin D3 dosage is: 20,000 IU per day OR 1,000-2,000 IU per 25 lbs of body weight. This helps achieve optimal vitamin D levels of 60-100 ng/ml.

The next nutrient is, Number 7. “Curcumin”.

The bright yellow spice, turmeric, contains a remarkable compound called curcumin, that is is a true powerhouse when it comes to battling cancer.

Curcumin is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. It can help prevent the chronic inflammation that often leads to cancer.

How? By interacting with the genetic pathways of cancer stem cells, regulating the factors that drive their growth and spread.

But that’s not all. Curcumin can also:

Control inflammation to stop tumor growth and invasion.
Hinder the proliferation of cancer cells.
Turn off the factors that suppress cell death.
Prevent the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), that feed tumors
Inhibit the spread of cancer.

Amazingly, curcumin has been shown to target cancer stem cells involved in a wide range of cancers, including breast, cervical, colorectal, pancreatic, lung, liver, prostate, ovarian, kidney, bladder, brain, rectal, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

So, how can you harness the power of curcumin? Start by adding more turmeric to your meals. Many experts also recommend taking curcumin supplements, typically 500-3,000 mg per day, split into 1-2 servings with food.

But there’s a catch – curcumin isn’t easily absorbed on its own. To get better absorption, always combine with black pepper – which contains piperine, a compound that has been found to target cancer stem cells in breast tumors, and take it with a fat-based meal.

However, getting all the curcumin you need from food alone is really hard. That’s why you should check out our recommended turmeric supplement at the link below. It’s been shown in human clinical trials to be 6.8 times better absorbed than curcumin extracts seasoned with black pepper.

Our next cancer-fighting nutrient is, Number 6. “Lycopene”.

You may not know it, but there’s a powerful compound hiding in your favorite red fruits and vegetables – lycopene!

This amazing nutrient has been shown to actually destroy cancer cells. It can disrupt the communication pathways that allow cancer cells to survive and thrive. In other words, lycopene can cause cancer cells to self-destruct!

Studies show lycopene may help protect against cancers of the prostate, lung, colon, and cervix. Sounds pretty amazing, right?

So, where can you find lycopene? Look for it in foods like tomatoes, watermelons, pink grapefruits, and red oranges. These vibrant red foods get their color from lycopene. When cooking with tomatoes, leave the skins on to maximize the lycopene.

You can also take lycopene supplements, especially when combined with vitamin E and selenium. Aim for 30-50 mg per day, which is about the same as 2 servings of organic tomato sauce.

The next nutrient is, Number 5. “Sulforaphane”.

Did you know your body can create powerful cancer-fighting compounds called isothiocyanates? One of the most potent forms is sulforaphane, found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and Brussels sprouts.

Sulforaphane is a true superhero when it comes to preventing and treating cancer. It can:

Stimulate pathways that block tumor formation
Boost your body’s production of powerful antioxidants like glutathione
Improve your gut health by reducing harmful bacteria linked to cancer
Reduce inflammation
Remove cancer-causing toxins from your body

In fact, sulforaphane has been shown to help protect against a wide range of cancers, including breast, stomach, spleen, prostate, and colon.

To get the most cancer-fighting benefits, aim to eat at least two servings of cruciferous vegetable sprouts daily. Broccoli and cauliflower sprouts are especially potent, containing up to 100 times more of the compounds needed to create sulforaphane.

Want an extra boost? Many experts recommend taking a sulforaphane supplement, typically 300-600 mg, 1-2 times per day. This can be especially helpful for hormone-sensitive cancers, as sulforaphane is a powerful mobilizer of estrogen.

Moving on to the next nutrient, Number 4 is, “EGCG”.

Green tea is packed with a powerful compound called EGCG. This antioxidant superstar has been linked to all kinds of amazing health benefits, including fighting cancer.

Studies show that drinking green tea regularly can actually reduce your risk of cancers like breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancer. How does it work? EGCG interrupts the signals that allow cancer cells to grow and spread.

The best way to get more EGCG is to sip on some green tea, especially in the morning. You can even use green tea as the base for your smoothies.

For an extra EGCG boost, try matcha green tea. It contains up to 10 times more of this cancer-fighting compound than regular green tea.

You can also take EGCG supplements, aiming for 400-800 mg per day. Just be sure to take them earlier in the day, as EGCG can be slightly stimulating.

One thing to keep in mind – green tea can reduce your body’s absorption of folate. To counteract this, make sure to eat plenty of folate-rich green vegetables in salads or juices.

At Number 3, we have, “Resveratrol”.

Resveratrol is a powerful plant compound found in grape skins and red wine. This natural phenol has an incredible ability to prevent and heal metabolic conditions, especially those related to cancer cells.

Resveratrol protects your cells’ ability to repair damage and extends their lifespan. It’s been shown to have protective properties against cancers of the prostate, liver, pancreas, colon, skin, and more.

For those battling cancer, experts recommend taking over 200 mg of resveratrol daily. Even if you’re healthy, a 20-100 mg supplement can provide optimal cancer-fighting benefits.

Next, the Number 2 nutrient is, “6-Gingerol”.

Ginger is a versatile spice that can elevate your meals and drinks. Simply add it to your tea, marinades, coleslaw, and salad dressings. This boosts the chemo-preventive properties of your food.

Ginger contains a compound called 6-gingerol. This phytonutrient reduces harmful free radicals that can damage your cells.

Thanks to 6-gingerol, ginger protects your cells from free radical harm. It also shields your nervous system. Plus, it enhances your antioxidant defenses against carcinogens and cancer.

Sip on a cup or two of ginger tea daily to reap its benefits. It soothes your senses and gives you a refreshing boost.

But don’t stop there! Add fermented ginger to your meals too. This Asian staple, found in dishes like sushi and kimchi, brings unique flavors and textures to your food.

Finally, Our Number 1 nutrient is, “Ursolic Acid”.

Ursolic acid is a mighty compound found in apples, holy basil, rosemary, oregano and thyme. This natural substance can fight various cancers, including colon, skin, breast, and lung.

Researchers are still uncovering how ursolic acid works its magic. But they know it can reduce inflammation and trigger cancer cells to self-destruct. This helps shrink tumors and prevent them from spreading.

To harness ursolic acid’s power, take a daily supplement. Experts suggest 150-300 mg, three times a day.

This is way more than you’d get from eating apple peels or holy basil. But keep enjoying these foods too – they contain other nutrients that support your immune system and overall health.

Next, here is an overview of changes you should make to your diet, if your goal is to fight cancer and live cancer-free:
Eliminate dairy, processed meats, soda, and sugary drinks, as these can promote inflammation and cancer growth.
Instead, focus on adding cancer-fighting berries to your daily routine – their antioxidants and phytochemicals help neutralize free radicals.
Eating 2 mushrooms per day is also recommended, as they contain immune-boosting beta-glucans.
Complement this with fresh, organic VEGETABLE juices that provide a concentrated dose of cancer-protective nutrients.
And be sure to fill your plate with a variety of organic, whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.
Lean meats, poultry, and fatty fish can be included, while high-consumption of red meat should be avoided.

By making these simple swaps, you can harness the power of nature to support your body’s ability to prevent and fight cancer.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 8, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/essential-oils-for-allergies/,5 Essential Oils That Stop Allergies Forever!,"Having a seasonal allergy is a royal pain. Itching, sneezing, coughing, congestion, headaches, and exhaustion it causes greatly affect your quality of life. When your body senses antagonistic invaders (allergens), it releases a kind of chemical called histamine that attaches to cells to make them swell and retain fluid in an effort to purge the allergen. Antihistamines block histamines from attaching to cells. (Updated May 8, 2024)

There are loads of over-the-counter and prescription pills and injectable antihistamine medications for treating allergies. However, these often leave you feeling tired, dizzy, and dry. Moreover, many have been linked to increased risk of neurological damage.

Also, it’s never a good idea to take medications of any kind for too long but if you suffer from seasonal allergies, but it’s hard to avoid seeking regular relief so you can get on with the business of living. Instead, why not try these essential oils for allergies?

5 Essential Oils for Allergies

Essential oils are the distilled essence of plants, distilled from leaves, fruit, flowers, and stems. They contain phytochemicals that can relieve symptoms of allergy, relieve congestion and headache, and promote solid sleep. Essential oils are sold in most health foods stores around the world.

Here are five essential oils for allergies that can counteract seasonal allergies, leaving you feeling relieved without all the side effects.

1. Basil Oil

Basil is rich in antioxidants (including vitamin C) and is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. The herb not only relieves symptoms of allergy but is, in fact, a potent anti-anaphylactic and antihistamine. (1)

“Different parts of [the basil] plant like stem, flower, seed, leaves, root etc are known to possess therapeutic potential and have been used, by traditional medicinal practitioners, as expectorant, analgesic, anticancer, antiasthamatic, antiemetic, diaphoretic, antidiabetic, antifertility, hepatoprotective, hypotensive and antistress agent. Tulsi has also been used in treatment of fever, bronchitis, arthritis and convulsion…results indicated the potent benefits of O. sanctum [holy basil] in the treatment of asthma and related conditions,” wrote a study in The Internet Journal of Pharmacology. (2)

You can inhale basil oil for instant relief and take food-grade basil essential oil orally under the direction of a naturopath. You can also increase your intake of the fresh herb for more relief.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 8, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/spot-these-10-warning-signs-of-a-stroke-one-week-before/,Spot These 10 Warning Signs Of A Stroke One Week Before,"Strokes are a serious health concern, with someone in the U.S. experiencing one every 40 seconds, and every 4 minutes, someone dies of a stroke. While your risk of having a stroke nearly doubles every 10 years after age 55, strokes can occur at any age. Researchers have even found that strokes are on the rise in younger people under 49.

Regardless of your age, it’s important to be aware of the early signs of a stroke, which can include sudden dizziness, a severe headache, or drooping face. These symptoms often occur quickly, but can develop over several hours or even days. Knowing the signs of a stroke and acting fast is crucial, as this potentially deadly condition requires immediate medical attention.

Today, we’ll explore what happens during a stroke, the 10 warning signs to watch for, the crucial steps to take if these signs appear, and important prevention strategies. We’ll also reveal the number ONE risk factor for stroke, so make sure you watch this video until the end.

A stroke happens when the blood flow to part of the brain is blocked; it’s like a heart attack, but for the brain. This can happen either because a blood clot blocks a blood vessel (ischemic stroke), or because a blood vessel in the brain leaks or bursts (hemorrhagic stroke).

Studies show that approximately 87% of strokes are ischemic strokes, while the remaining 13% are hemorrhagic strokes. Brain cells start to die if they go without oxygen and nutrients for just 3 to 4 minutes – and that’s exactly what happens during a stroke.

This brain damage continues to accumulate rapidly with each passing minute, at a rate of about 1.9 million brain cells lost per minute. After about 10 minutes without oxygen, the damage becomes severe and potentially irreversible. Without immediate medical attention, a stroke can cause permanent brain damage, disability, or even death.

Strokes often seem to occur without warning, but in some cases, your body may provide early signals. So, what are the signs to recognize, so you can seek medical help and hopefully prevent a full-blown stroke?

One potential warning sign is an unexplained headache.

A 2020 study of 550 adults found that a “sentinel headache” – a severe or unusual headache occurring within 7 days before a stroke – was experienced by 15% of participants who went on to have an ischemic stroke. These headaches often lasted until the stroke symptoms began.

Interestingly, the study also noted that those who had a sentinel headache were more likely to have a history of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder, compared to those who did not have a stroke.

Another possible warning sign of a stroke is a “transient ischemic attack” (TIA), also known as a “mini-stroke.” One study found that 43% of stroke patients experienced TIA symptoms at some point in the 7 days before their full stroke event. A TIA occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is temporarily interrupted, causing stroke-like symptoms that typically resolve within an hour without causing permanent damage.

However, even though the symptoms may disappear quickly, a TIA should never be ignored. In fact, research shows that around one-third of people who experience a TIA will go on to have a full-blown stroke at some point in the future.

That said, there is some good news – a recent study published in JAMA, found that the number of people having an acute stroke within 90 days of a TIA, has actually decreased in recent years. This suggests that the preventive measures taken after a TIA, such as medication, lifestyle changes, and close medical monitoring, have become more effective at staving off a subsequent major stroke.

It’s crucial to seek immediate medical attention if you or someone you know experiences signs of TIA, such as:

Paralysis, numbness and weakness on one side of the body, usually in the face, arms, or legs;
Having trouble speaking, or understanding speech;
Loss of balance or coordination, trouble walking;
Blurred vision in one or both eyes;
Confusion, dizziness;
and a sudden, severe headache with no clear cause.

When you see these TIA warning signs, try to get medical attention within 60 minutes. Seeking prompt medical care allows doctors to quickly identify the cause of the TIA and provide the right treatment. This is crucial, as research shows that up to 80% of strokes that occur after a TIA are actually preventable, as long as the TIA is diagnosed and treated in a timely manner.

Next, let’s break down what you should do in real-time if you suspect a stroke is occurring.

The “BE-FAST” model is a tool designed to help you remember the key symptoms of a stroke. Each letter stands for a specific symptom, and the last letter is a direct instruction on what to do. Here’s what “BE-FAST” stands for, and the actions to take:

Balance – Is there a sudden dizziness, loss of balance or coordination? If you notice someone suddenly stumbling or losing their balance, provide support to prevent a fall.

Eyes – Is there sudden trouble seeing out of one or both eyes? If someone complains of blurred or double vision, reassure them help is on the way.

Face Drooping – Does one side of the face droop, or is it numb? Ask the person to smile to assess if one side is drooping.

Arm Weakness – Is one arm weak or numb? Ask the person to lift both arms. Does one arm drift down? This could indicate muscle weakness.

Speech Difficulty – Is the speech slurred or impaired? Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence and listen. Does the person have difficulty repeating simple phrases?

Time – “T” stands for “time”, and “Time is Brain”. Call emergency services immediately, if someone shows any of these symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild or go away.

The sooner a stroke survivor receives medical treatment, the better their chances of full recovery. Remember that “Time lost, is brain lost”.

Next, there are important actions you can take while waiting for the ambulance, that can greatly benefit the outcome for the stroke survivor.

Encourage the person to lie down: If they are sitting or standing, gently encourage them to lie down on their side with their head elevated. This helps blood flow to the brain. But don’t move them if they’ve fallen. Loosen restrictive clothing to keep them comfortable.

Keep track of symptoms: Note the time the symptoms started, and any known medical conditions the person has, like high blood pressure or diabetes. This information will be vital for the hospital staff to make rapid treatment decisions.

Talk to the person: Ask about any medications they’re taking and any allergies they have. Write this down to share with the doctors later.

Perform CPR if needed: If the person becomes unconscious, check their breathing and pulse. If they’re not breathing, start CPR immediately. The ambulance call taker can guide you through it.

Stay calm: It’s a stressful situation, but try to remain calm. This will help you clearly communicate with the emergency responders.

Here are 4 things you should NOT do while waiting for emergency help:

Don’t let them sleep: Stroke survivors often report feeling extremely tired and sleepy when a stroke first occurs, but do not let them sleep, or talk you out of calling for emergency help.

Don’t let them drive: Do not drive yourself or someone else to the emergency room. Call and wait for the ambulance.

Don’t give medication: Do not give the person any medication, even something as common as aspirin. Strokes can be caused by blood clots or burst blood vessels, and the wrong medication can make the situation worse.

Don’t give any food or drink: Avoid giving the person anything to eat or drink. Strokes can cause muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing, which raise the risk of choking.

Remember, strokes are a medical emergency. The treatments that can help are most effective if given right after symptoms start. There’s a “golden hour” for stroke treatment, which is why noting the time when symptoms first appeared is so important. Emergency care can provide medications like clot-busters, which can minimize brain damage if administered quickly.

Next, what are the risk factors for stroke?

There are several risk factors for stroke, some of which can be controlled or treated, while others cannot. The main risk factors include:

High blood pressure, the leading cause of stroke, which damages and weakens blood vessels, making them more prone to bursting or becoming blocked.
Diabetes, which increases the risk of stroke by leading to a buildup of fatty deposits in blood vessels, blocking blood flow to the brain.
Heart diseases, such as atrial fibrillation, which can lead to the formation of clots.
Smoking, which damages blood vessels and can lead to clot formation.
Age, as the risk of stroke increases with age.
And Family history of stroke.

For people who have both high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, the risks are even higher. Studies show the combination of these two conditions can more than quadruple a person’s chances of having a disabling or fatal stroke, compared to those without either condition.

Next, what can you do to reduce your risk of a stroke?

While you can’t completely prevent a stroke, there are several lifestyle changes you can make to significantly lower your risk. Here are the key steps to take:

Keep your blood pressure within a healthy range through diet, exercise, supplements, or medication if prescribed.
Get your cholesterol levels checked regularly and keep them in a healthy range. Click the link below, to see our recommended supplement to effectively reduce blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol.
If you have diabetes, closely monitor and manage your blood sugar levels.
Quit smoking; smoking greatly increases your chances of having a stroke.
Aim for a moderate, healthy weight through diet and exercise; excess weight strains your cardiovascular system.
Try to get physical activity most days of the week; regular exercise lowers many stroke risk factors.
Eat an anti-inflammatory diet that’s low in processed foods, and rich in whole foods like fruits, vegetables. grass-fed meat and wild fish.
Limit alcohol consumption, as excessive drinking can lead to high blood pressure.
Get regular check-ups and work with your healthcare provider to monitor your health.

Remember, taking proactive steps to manage your health is the best defense against stroke.

Finally, let’s summarize the 10 warning signs that a stroke is happening:
Face Drooping;
Slurred Speech;
Loss of Arm Movement;
Blurred Vision;
Sudden, Severe Headache;
Confusion, and Dizziness;
Balance Issues, and Difficulty Walking;
Paralysis, Numbness, and Weakness on One Side of the Body;
Difficulty Swallowing;
Loss of Consciousness.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 1, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/cutting-edge-mrna-vaccine-kicks-off-landmark-phase-3-trial-for-deadly-skin-cancer/,Cutting-Edge mRNA Vaccine Kicks Off Landmark Phase 3 Trial for Deadly Skin Cancer,"Imagine a world where a vaccine could be tailored to fight your cancer – a treatment designed just for you. That’s the promise of the latest medical breakthrough we’re exploring today: an mRNA vaccine for skin cancer, which is now entering a landmark Phase 3 trial. This isn’t just any vaccine; it’s a personalized weapon against one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer: melanoma.

Key Takeaways
The groundbreaking Phase 3 trial of an mRNA skin cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157/V940, has commenced, offering new hope in the fight against melanoma.
This vaccine is personalized to target specific cancer neoantigens, making it a potential game-changer in oncology.
mRNA-4157/V940 is being tested in combination with Keytruda, a therapy that has already shown promise in treating melanoma.
Success in this trial could revolutionize the way we prevent cancer relapse, significantly impacting patient survival rates.
The trial is a pivotal step in cancer treatment, potentially setting a new standard for personalized medicine.
Inside the Phase 3 Trial: A Closer Look

Let’s get into what this trial means. Scientists have developed a vaccine, mRNA-4157/V940, that’s designed to work with the body’s own immune system to fight cancer cells. The trial will test the effectiveness of this vaccine when combined with Keytruda, an existing cancer therapy. Together, they could form a powerful duo to prevent cancer from returning in patients who have had high-risk melanomas surgically removed.

How the Trial Works and What’s at Stake
trial participant

So, how does the trial work? Participants who have had melanoma removed are given Keytruda, an approved treatment that helps their immune system do a better job of destroying cancer cells. The twist is that some participants will also receive the mRNA vaccine, which is designed to target specific proteins on their cancer cells, known as neoantigens. These proteins are like red flags that help the immune system spot and destroy cancer.

The stakes are high. If successful, this vaccine could drastically reduce the chance of cancer coming back. It’s a beacon of hope for many, and the trial is being watched closely by the medical community and patients alike.

Personalizing Medicine: Neoantigen Targeting

Personalization is key. The vaccine isn’t one-size-fits-all; it’s custom-made for each patient. Scientists sequence the DNA of the patient’s tumor to identify unique mutations. They use this information to create a vaccine that teaches the patient’s immune system to recognize and attack those specific mutations. It’s a bespoke approach to medicine that could change the landscape of cancer treatment.

Because it’s designed to attack only the cancer cells, it could potentially have fewer side effects than treatments that damage healthy cells as well. Therefore, the success of this trial could pave the way for vaccines against other types of cancer, too.

Evaluating the Impact: Potential Benefits of the Vaccine

The benefits of a successful mRNA vaccine for skin cancer are immense.

Preventing Relapse: The Ultimate Goal

The primary goal of the vaccine is to prevent the relapse of skin cancer. By training the immune system to recognize and fight off cancer cells more effectively, the vaccine could help keep patients in remission after their initial treatment. It’s like giving the immune system a detailed map of the enemy, empowering it to defend the body more efficiently.

Life after the Vaccine: What Success Could Look Like

Success in this trial could mean a world where skin cancer, once a dreaded diagnosis, becomes a manageable condition. It could mean fewer invasive treatments and more focus on recovery and wellness. For patients, it could mean peace of mind, knowing that their bodies are equipped with the tools to fight off cancer should it ever dare to return.

Navigating Challenges: Addressing the Hurdles Ahead

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. While the potential is thrilling, there are hurdles to overcome. One of the biggest challenges will be manufacturing and distributing the vaccine. Each dose is personalized, which means it’s not as simple as mass-producing a one-size-fits-all vaccine. This will require innovation in how we produce and deliver treatments.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 26, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/people-who-constantly-correct-grammar-are-pretty-much-jerks-study-reveals/,"People Who Constantly Correct Grammar Are Pretty Much Jerks, Study Reveals","In a groundbreaking study that is sure to ruffle some feathers, a team of leading researchers has uncovered a startling truth about the behavior of self-appointed grammar police. Their findings show that individuals who habitually point out others’ minor linguistic slip-ups are, in fact, pretty much jerks.

(skulldog06/Flickr)

The study, published in the prestigious PLOS One journal, analyzed the personality traits and social interactions of people who can’t resist the urge to correct every typo or grammatical error they encounter. The results paint a clear picture – those who derive a sense of superiority by nitpicking others’ language are often perceived as arrogant, condescending, and generally unpleasant to be around.

“This is the first study to conclusively demonstrate that a person’s tendency to police grammar is directly linked to their personality,” explains lead researcher Dr. Emily Wilkins. “The data shows that less agreeable and more conscientious individuals are far more likely to get riled up by minor linguistic mistakes.”

The researchers recruited 83 participants and asked them to evaluate email responses that contained either no errors or a mix of typos and grammatical issues. Those who scored lower on agreeableness and openness were found to judge the flawed emails and their writers much more harshly, rating them as less intelligent and friendly.

“It turns out the need to constantly correct people’s grammar is a telltale sign of deeper insecurities and a lack of emotional intelligence,” Dr. Wilkins adds. “These individuals tend to derive a sense of superiority by putting others down, rather than building genuine connections.”

The study’s conclusions have sent shockwaves through the language-policing community, with many grammar enthusiasts struggling to come to terms with the harsh truth. However, the researchers hope their findings will encourage a more empathetic and inclusive approach to communication.

“Language is a beautiful, ever-evolving thing,” says Dr. Wilkins. “Instead of nitpicking, we should celebrate the diversity of expression and focus on understanding each other, not putting each other down.”

So the next time you’re tempted to correct someone’s spelling or grammar, consider whether you might be coming across as a jerk. The scientists have spoken – it’s time to let go of the red pen and embrace a more compassionate approach to language.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 26, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/drinking-alcohol-actually-helps-you-speak-foreign-languages-better/,Study Reveals Drinking Alcohol Actually Helps You Speak Foreign Languages Better,"A study by the University of Liverpool, in collaboration with Maastricht University and King’s College London, found that individuals who had consumed a low dose of alcohol had better pronunciation in a foreign language compared to when they were sober.

The study focused on German-speaking students who had recently learned to speak, read, and write in Dutch. Each participant was given either a low dose of alcohol or a control beverage with no alcohol, and then asked to engage in a conversation in Dutch. The results were clear: those who had a bit of alcohol were rated higher by native Dutch speakers in their language skills.

Sipping on Confidence: How Alcohol Affects Pronunciation

But how does this happen? Most importantly, alcohol is known to lower inhibitions and increase self-confidence. This could mean that with a bit of alcohol in your system, the fear of making mistakes decreases, and you’re more likely to try speaking the new language without the usual reservations. This doesn’t mean you suddenly know more vocabulary or grasp grammar better. Instead, you may simply be more willing to use what you already know, and that can make all the difference.

Therefore, if you’re learning a new language and looking for ways to improve your speaking abilities, understanding the role of alcohol could be a part of your strategy. But, because there’s a fine line between a confidence-boosting sip and overindulgence that muddles speech, it’s essential to approach this method with caution and responsibility.

Understanding the Alcohol-Language Connection

So, what’s happening inside our brains when we take that sip of courage? Alcohol has a depressant effect on the brain, which can reduce our tendency to overthink and worry about the details. This can be particularly helpful when speaking a foreign language, as it might allow for more fluid communication, free from the constraints of self-doubt and perfectionism.

Breaking Down the Science

At its core, the connection between alcohol and language skills hinges on the delicate balance of cognitive functions. Alcohol, in moderate amounts, can lower social inhibitions and allow a person’s innate language ability to shine through without the dampening effect of anxiety. It’s a bit like loosening a tight muscle – a small amount of alcohol acts as a linguistic lubricant, easing the flow of conversation.

The Anxiety Reduction Hypothesis

“Our study shows that acute alcohol consumption may have beneficial effects on the pronunciation of a foreign language in people who recently learned that language,” says Dr. Inge Kersbergen, from the University of Liverpool.

This quote encapsulates the Anxiety Reduction Hypothesis, suggesting that the social lubricant effect of alcohol may lower the psychological barriers to speaking a second language. It’s not that the alcohol is making you more knowledgeable; rather, it’s making you less afraid to use what you know.

Therefore, if you’re studying a new language and find yourself tongue-tied, a small amount of alcohol might help lower those barriers. But remember, this isn’t about drinking more; it’s about optimizing the level of relaxation to enhance your existing language skills.

Drinking too much can have the opposite effect, leading to slurred speech and impaired memory, which are definitely not conducive to language learning. The key is to find that sweet spot where a small amount of alcohol can ease anxiety without impairing cognitive function.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/over-40-work-three-days-week/,"People Over 40 Should Work Only Three Days a Week, Study Concludes","If you were required to work 3 days a week for full pay at your place of business, would you complain? Probably not. In the corporate culture in North America, such an idea is preposterous. What employers may not realize—and what psychological research is confirming—is that people are more productive if they work less than 5 days a week.

A 2016 study at the University of Melbourne (Australia) focused on how much time is regularly spent at a paying job and its effects on cognitive function of people age 40 and over. Researchers administered 3 tests to demonstrate cognitive ability and compared it to the number of hours worked:

Backward Digit Span (reading a string of single numbers sequentially, then repeating the same numbers backwards)
Symbol Digits Modalities (substituting numbers for geometric figures)
25-item version (short form) of the National Adult Reading Test (an inventory that estimates intellectual ability)

Almost 80% of the people who participated in the study were employed outside the home for 35 hours per week or more. Cognition testing found that subjects’ abilities increased to a threshold of 25 working hours a week; after that, test results fell in proportion to the number of working hours over that number. Fifty-four percent of the approximately 6500 participants in the study were female, however, results reflected no difference between the sexes. 

The object of the study was to determine the validity of the premise “use it or lose it”, referring to the idea that if we aren’t intellectually and socially engaged at a job, our cognitive functions decline as we age. Researchers concluded:

“Work can be a double edged sword, in that it can stimulate brain activity, but at the same time, long working hours and certain types of tasks can cause fatigue and stress which potentially damage cognitive functions. Thus, the degree of intellectual stimulation of work may depend on the required task and working hours, that is, the quality and the quantity of work.” (1)


The answer then is “use it too much and lose it”! 

The Five-day Work Week

Because of the increased life expectancy realized over the last century, many countries are planning or contemplating raising the age of retirement. This is good for Americans who choose to work past age 65 but can be a hardship if you want to retire but won’t receive full pension benefits until later. Currently, workers in North America retire much later than in Russia, China, Australia, and Japan. (2)

In North America, Mexicans top the worldwide list of annual hours worked. Out of all the industrialized countries in the world only 9 have an average of annual working hours higher than the U.S. (3) A typical week requires 40 hours of work, leaving not a lot of waking time for much else, especially if regular overtime is required.

Historically, working 40 hours a week was a drastic reduction for manufacturers who were working 100 hours at the turn of the 20th century. In the first 4 decades, the 5-day, 40-hour workweek became the standard across industries in the U.S.

It’s important to keep in mind that this was at a time when a) the world’s population was much smaller than today; b) war economies required that people work to support the efforts and many men in their primes were overseas; c) unemployment was a concern after 1929 and putting more people to work at fewer hours each was more economically and socially desirable. (4) None of those situations are current economic factors in North America.

Work-life Balance

Many employers give lip service to a desire to allow their employees a work-life balance. In fact, most people who work at a management level are routinely required to work much more than 40 hours each week—most often without additional pay. (5) Telecommuting has become increasingly popular across industries; while doing so is a time- and money-saver, being able to work remotely means that you can (and are often expected to) work outside of business hours. (6)

The importance of not working can’t be over-estimated. Working full-time with few or no breaks for 45 years or more will eventually take its toll. “Burn-out” is what happens when you hit the wall. Over-work is associated with chronic stress and its related health problems, including heart disease and cancer. Life outside of work has its unavoidable stressors; workplace stress on top of that (often with no easy relief) can make you age faster and push you over the edge.

How do you know if you’re overworked?  Here are some signs to watch out for:

You often use alcohol or drugs to relax.
You normally work long hours but show little to no concrete results for it.
You don’t sleep enough and feel fatigued throughout the day.
You feel general anxiety, sadness, or depression.
You regularly work overtime.
Sore/strained eyes and body aches.
Interpersonal relationships are an increasing challenge to forge or maintain in a healthy and loving way.

It is possible to die from over-work. (7) Chronic over-work can lead to serious illnesses and eroded mental health. (8, 9)

Adjusting for 21st-century Life

In an effort to attract and retain skilled employees, some employers are becoming more flexible with work schedules. Research indicates that small allowances can provide huge benefits to workers:

employees beginning work at times suitable to their natural rhythms – starting work at 10:00 a.m., for example
shortened work week – more hours per day but fewer days
in France, employers are legally banned from emailing workers outside of business hours (10)
an estate management firm in New Zealand tested moving to a 4-day work week and found that productivity was at least the same as a 5-day week (11); this is in accordance with some school districts in the U.S. who have moved to a 4-day school week 
depending on the industry and workforce, a 6-hour work day can be significantly more productive and effective than an 8-hour day (12)
providing time off in lieu of pay for overtime
increasing the number of vacation days given to the workforce: Americans receive the least amount of vacation days and Canadians are third from last of all economically advanced nations (13)

Research has shown that office workers are actually productive only about 3 hours a day—there really is a limit to how long you can focus on a task and how many tasks you can complete in any given day. (14)

Take Care of Yourself

It becomes even more critical to be cognizant of your daily habits and health if you work full-time for all or most of your adult life. Fill your time away from work doing things you enjoy with people you care about. Practice self-care. It’s been said that no one on a deathbed has ever said, “I wish I had worked more!” You won’t get the past back but you can make the best of your present and your future by keeping your work life in perspective and taking advantage of any flexibility your employer may offer.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/these-common-foods-are-secretly-causing-your-stinky-flatulence/,These common foods are secretly causing your stinky flatulence – you’ll never guess the surprising culprits!,"Let’s face it, everyone experiences gas. But when it turns into a room-clearing event, it’s time to look at what’s on your plate. You might be surprised to learn that it’s not just the usual suspects like beans causing the commotion, but a whole host of foods could be the culprits behind that smelly gas.

Common Misconceptions About Foods and Flatulence

First off, let’s bust a myth. While it’s true that beans are famous for making people gassy, they’re not alone. In fact, many other foods that are part of a regular diet can also cause smelly gas. It’s not necessarily about the amount of gas, but the odor that can become a cause for concern—and embarrassment.

Another common misconception is that only unhealthy foods cause gas. This isn’t the case. Even some healthy foods can lead to a bout of smelly flatulence. It’s all about the compounds they contain and how our bodies process them.

Breaking Down the Science of Scent

Understanding why certain foods can cause foul-smelling flatulence is a matter of breaking down the science of scent. Foods high in sulfur, such as meats, dairy, and certain vegetables, can lead to more potent smells. For more insights into how diet affects digestion and inflammation, consider reading about gut inflammation foods.

The main culprit behind the notorious smell of gas is sulfur. Foods rich in sulfur, when digested, interact with the natural bacteria in our gut. This interaction produces various gases, including hydrogen sulfide, which is well-known for its rotten egg scent. The more sulfur-rich foods you eat, the more likely you are to notice an unpleasant smell when you pass gas.

But why does this happen? It’s all down to how our bodies break down certain foods. Proteins, for example, can be particularly pesky. They contain amino acids, like methionine, which is sulfur-based. When our gut bacteria get to work on these proteins, the result is often that notorious smell.

Now, let’s get into into the specifics and uncover which foods might be turning your digestive system into a miniature gas factory.

Unexpected Gassy Foods List

While beans and legumes have long held the reputation for being gas-inducing, they’re not the only foods that can cause your stomach to bloat and give way to smelly gas. Here’s a list of some unexpected foods that can cause these symptoms:

Beef and pork

Red meats like beef and pork are high in the amino acid methionine, which contains sulfur. When this amino acid is broken down by gut bacteria, it produces hydrogen sulfide, a gas with a distinctive rotten egg smell. Since meat takes longer to digest, it has more time to ferment in the gut, which can increase the odds of producing smelly gas. To maintain a healthy digestive system, it may be beneficial to consider foods to heal your heart, which also impacts your overall gut health.

Garlic and onions

These kitchen staples belong to the Allium family and are rich in fructans and sulfur compounds. While they add flavor to our meals, they can also lead to the production of malodorous gas. This happens when bacteria in the intestines ferment the undigested compounds, releasing a pungent aroma in the process.

Poultry

Similar to red meats, poultry also contains sulfur-rich amino acids that can contribute to smelly gas when digested. While poultry like chicken, duck, goose, and turkey are often considered a healthier meat option, it can still be a source of foul-smelling flatulence due to its protein content.

Artificial sweeteners

Sugar substitutes like sorbitol and xylitol are often found in “sugar-free” products. However, these sweeteners can be difficult for the body to absorb completely. The result is fermentation by gut bacteria, leading to the production of gas that can be quite smelly.

High-fiber foods

While fiber is essential for digestive health, too much of it can be a problem. Foods high in fiber, such as broccoli, cabbage, and beans, can cause gas because they’re broken down by bacteria in the large intestine, which releases hydrogen sulfide in the process.

Why Some Foods Make Us Gassier

The reason some foods make us gassier than others boils down to how they’re digested and what they’re made up of. Foods high in sulfur and certain carbohydrates can lead to the production of smelly gas when they’re broken down by bacteria in the gut.

Moreover, the speed of digestion matters. Foods that take longer to digest, like fatty meats, spend more time in the digestive tract. This allows bacteria more time to ferment these foods, which can lead to an increase in both the volume and odor of gas produced.

Fermentation and the Human Gut

When we eat, our food travels to the large intestine after it’s been partially digested in the stomach and small intestine. Here, gut bacteria get to work, fermenting any undigested food. This process of fermentation produces various gases, including methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide — the latter being responsible for the foul smell.

The Role of Sulfur in Digestion

Sulfur is a mineral found in every cell of our body, playing a critical role in the synthesis of proteins and enzymes. However, when sulfur-containing foods are digested, they produce hydrogen sulfide gas. It’s this gas that’s primarily responsible for the unpleasant smell associated with flatulence.

Making Smarter Choices to Curb the Odor

While we can’t (and shouldn’t) eliminate all the foods that cause gas, we can make smarter choices to reduce the odor. Here’s how:

Foods to Enjoy in Moderation

To minimize smelly gas, consider reducing the intake of high-sulfur foods like meat, garlic, and onions. Instead, balance your diet with lower-sulfur vegetables and fruits that are less likely to cause offensive odors.

Combinations That Could Spell Trouble

Combining certain foods can exacerbate gas production. For instance, eating a steak with garlic mashed potatoes might be a recipe for smelly gas due to the high sulfur content. Be mindful of food combinations, especially during meals that precede social events.

Eat slowly to reduce the amount of air swallowed.
Drink plenty of water to aid digestion.
Exercise regularly to help move food through the digestive system.
Try digestive enzymes to help break down difficult-to-digest foods.

Remember, everyone’s digestive system is different. What causes smelly gas for one person might not for another. Pay attention to your body’s reactions and adjust your diet accordingly.

Alternatives for a Less Troublesome Tummy

If you’re looking to reduce smelly gas, consider these alternatives:

Substitutes for Common Culprits

Instead of red meat, opt for leaner proteins like fish or plant-based alternatives. Use herbs and spices other than garlic and onions to flavor your food. When it comes to sweeteners, try using natural options like stevia or honey in moderation.

By making these adjustments, not only can you reduce the likelihood of smelly gas, but you may also find improvements in your overall digestive health.

Substitutes for Common Culprits

Let’s talk about swaps. If your gut is sending SOS signals every time you indulge in a steak, it might be time to switch to leaner proteins like chicken or turkey. These are easier on your stomach and less likely to cause smelly gas. And for those who love the punch of flavor garlic and onions provide, try experimenting with herbs like basil, oregano, or thyme which are gentler on your digestive system.

When it comes to sweeteners, natural alternatives such as honey or maple syrup may be kinder to your gut. However, it’s important to use them sparingly, as they can still contribute to gas when consumed in large amounts. For dairy lovers, consider lactose-free options or plant-based milks like almond or soy to keep your digestive system running smoothly.

Gut-Friendly Snacks for Better Digestion

Integrating gut-friendly snacks into your diet can significantly improve digestion and overall gut health.

If you’re looking for snacks that won’t upset your digestive tract, think fresh. Fruits like bananas and berries are excellent options that provide nutrients without the excess gas. Nuts and seeds, in moderation, can also be a great snack that provides healthy fats and proteins without the unwanted side effects.

For those times when you crave something more substantial, whole grain crackers with avocado spread or hummus are satisfying choices that are less likely to cause smelly gas. And don’t forget about yogurt, especially those with probiotics, which can help maintain a healthy gut flora balance and aid in digestion.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Is it unhealthy to hold in gas?

Let’s clear the air on this one. Holding in gas occasionally won’t cause serious harm, but it’s not something you should make a habit of. When you hold in gas, you’re potentially causing discomfort and bloating. If you find yourself needing to pass gas frequently and it’s causing social anxiety or discomfort, it’s worth looking into dietary changes or speaking with a healthcare provider.

Can drinking water help with digestion?

Absolutely. Staying hydrated is key for a smoothly operating digestive system. Water helps to break down food so that your body can absorb the nutrients. It also helps to soften stool, which can prevent constipation and the buildup of gas. Aim to drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially before and after meals.

Do probiotics reduce gas and bloating?

While some people report relief from bloating and gas after taking probiotics, others may experience increased discomfort in the beginning. For a more in-depth look at the effects of certain foods on digestion, consider reading about the surprising foods that cause foul-smelling flatulence.

Probiotics are often hailed as the superheroes of gut health. These beneficial bacteria can help balance your gut flora, which in turn can reduce gas and bloating. You can find probiotics in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut, or you can take them as supplements. However, it’s important to note that they might cause a temporary increase in gas as your body adjusts to them.

Are there any natural remedies to prevent gas?

Indeed, there are several natural remedies that can help prevent gas. Peppermint tea is known for its soothing properties and can help ease digestion. Ginger is another great option that can help reduce bloating and gas. And don’t underestimate the power of regular exercise, which can help stimulate digestion and keep your bowels moving regularly.

How long do foods typically take to cause flatulence after eating?

Understanding the digestion process is key to knowing how long it takes for certain foods to cause flatulence. While this varies from person to person, knowing the best time to eat and the types of food that may contribute to gas can help manage this common issue.

The time it takes for food to cause flatulence can vary. Generally, it takes about six to eight hours for food to pass through your stomach and small intestine. Then, it can take an additional 25 to 50 hours to fully move through the large intestine. So, you could experience gas anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days after eating certain foods, depending on your digestive system.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 25, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/scientists-find-microplastics-lodged-in-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries/,Scientists find microplastics lodged in more than 50% of plaques from clogged arteries,"Imagine for a moment your body as a complex network of rivers and streams. These rivers – your arteries and veins – are essential for transporting life-sustaining blood to every corner of your body. Now, imagine finding out that these vital waterways are polluted, not with chemicals or waste, but with something as mundane as plastics. That’s exactly what recent studies are suggesting – our arteries may be clogged with the same materials used to make our water bottles and grocery bags.

It’s a revelation that’s as concerning as it is surprising. Over 50% of arterial plaques, the blockages that can lead to heart attacks and strokes, are now found to contain plastic particles. These aren’t large pieces, but microplastics, so tiny they can travel through our bloodstream and embed themselves deep within our bodily tissues.

Recent Study Reveals Startling Data

A landmark study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has catapulted the issue of microplastics into the limelight of public health concerns. The study, which followed hundreds of patients, found that a staggering 60 percent had microplastics lurking within the plaques of their arteries.

The Ubiquity of Plastics and Human Health

We live in an age where plastics are virtually inescapable. They are in our homes, our workplaces, and even in the food we eat and the air we breathe. It’s no wonder then that these materials are making their way into our internal systems. But what does this mean for our health?

Understanding the Health Impact

Before we dive into the gritty details, let’s get one thing clear: the plastics we’re talking about are not the kind you can see. Microplastics are microscopic particles that, once they enter the body, can cause a cascade of health issues. They can trigger inflammation, which is a known precursor to a multitude of diseases, including atherosclerosis – the hardening and narrowing of the arteries.

When our arteries are compromised, blood flow is restricted, and the risk of heart attacks and strokes skyrockets. The connection between microplastics and cardiovascular disease is still being explored, but the evidence is mounting, and it’s pointing towards a relationship we cannot afford to overlook.

How Microplastics Enter the Body

Let’s break down how these microplastics are getting into our systems. It’s a multifaceted problem, with numerous sources contributing to our daily intake of these tiny particles. They can come from a variety of everyday activities that may impact our blood circulation and overall health.

The breakdown of larger plastic items in the environment.
Microbeads found in personal care products like exfoliants and toothpaste.
Synthetic fibers released when washing clothes made from materials like polyester and nylon.
Plastic packaging that can shed particles into the food it contains.
Airborne dust from the degradation of plastic items in our surroundings.

Because these particles are so small, they can penetrate the body’s natural defenses and find their way into our bloodstream. From there, it’s a short journey to the heart and the arterial walls, where they can become part of the plaques that spell trouble for cardiovascular health.

Therefore, understanding the various pathways through which microplastics enter our bodies is essential. It’s the first step in taking control of our exposure and, in turn, our health.

Associations with Cardiovascular Illness

When we talk about cardiovascular illness, we’re referring to a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. Microplastics are now suspected to be a silent contributor to these diseases. They can set off inflammation, which is known to damage the delicate inner lining of blood vessels, leading to the buildup of plaques. These plaques can narrow arteries and, if they rupture, can cause clots that may lead to heart attacks or strokes.

It’s not just about the physical presence of plastics in the arteries, but also about the chemicals they leach. These substances can disrupt the body’s hormonal balance and have been linked to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension – all risk factors for heart disease. This makes the conversation about microplastics not just an environmental concern, but a pressing health issue.

Unveiling the Study’s Findings
Over 50% of arterial plaques in patients studied contained microplastics.
The most common plastics found were polyethylene (used in packaging) and PVC (used in pipes and building materials).
Patients with microplastics in their plaques had a higher incidence of heart attacks and strokes.

The study in question followed patients over a period of 34 months, revealing a correlation between the presence of microplastics in arterial plaques and the occurrence of serious cardiovascular events. While correlation does not imply causation, this association is a red flag that signals the need for further research and immediate public health action.

The findings are a wake-up call, urging us to re-evaluate our relationship with plastic materials and their pervasive role in our daily lives. We now know that our exposure to these materials can have direct implications for our heart health.

Analysing the Italian Research Results

The Italian research that brought these findings to light was a comprehensive analysis that meticulously tracked the presence of microplastics in patients with clogged arteries. The study’s methodology was robust, involving prospective, multicenter research to ensure the findings were not isolated to a specific region or group of people.

Relation Between Microplastics and Artery Plaques

The relation between microplastics and artery plaques is not merely incidental. Plaques are made up of fats, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When microplastics enter the bloodstream, they become part of this mix, contributing to the size and potentially the stability of the plaques. Unstable plaques are more likely to break apart and cause blockages, leading to heart attacks or strokes.

This discovery is particularly troubling because it suggests that our exposure to plastics could be directly influencing the progression of arterial diseases. It also raises questions about the long-term effects of microplastics on our vascular health and the potential for these particles to contribute to other diseases.

Examining the Culprits

It’s important to identify the types of plastics that are most commonly found in these arterial plaques. This knowledge can help us target the biggest offenders and reduce our exposure to them.

Common Sources of Microplastics

Everyday items are the main culprits when it comes to microplastic pollution. Here are some of the most common sources:

Single-use plastics, like water bottles and shopping bags, which break down into smaller pieces.
Clothing made from synthetic fibers that shed microplastics with each wash.
Beauty products with microbeads, although many countries are now banning these.
Food packaging, which can shed microplastics that contaminate our food.
Industrial processes that release plastic dust into the air.

These sources are so ingrained in our daily routines that avoiding them entirely can be challenging. However, by being aware of them, we can start to make more conscious choices that can help reduce our overall exposure.

The Role of Polyethylene and PVC in Plaques

Specifically, polyethylene and PVC have been highlighted as the most prevalent plastics found in arterial plaques. Polyethylene is the most commonly produced plastic and is used in a wide array of packaging materials. PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, is used in everything from pipes to building materials and can release harmful phthalates – chemicals that have been linked to a range of health issues.

The Path to Better Health

While it’s nearly impossible to eliminate all exposure to plastics, there are effective strategies we can adopt to minimize our risk.

Preventative Measures to Minimize Plastic Exposure

To start reducing our plastic footprint and its potential health risks, consider the following:

Choose glass or stainless steel containers over plastic ones, especially for food and drink storage.
Opt for clothing made from natural fibers rather than synthetic ones to reduce the release of microfibers during laundry.
Support and advocate for environmental policies that aim to reduce plastic waste and improve recycling programs.
Be mindful of plastic use in your daily life and seek out alternatives whenever possible.
Participate in community clean-up efforts to help reduce the amount of plastic that can break down into microplastics.
Implementing Healthier Lifestyle Choices

Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, getting regular physical activity, and finding ways to manage stress can all help keep your arteries clear and your heart strong. A heart-healthy lifestyle is your best defense against the myriad of threats facing our cardiovascular system today.

FAQ

It’s natural to have questions about microplastics and their impact on our health. Here are some answers to the most commonly asked questions:

What Are Microplastics and How Do They Affect Health?

Microplastics are tiny plastic particles, usually smaller than 5 millimeters, that can come from a variety of sources, including larger plastic debris that breaks down, microbeads in personal care products, and synthetic fibers from clothing. They can enter the human body through ingestion or inhalation and have been found in various organs, including the heart and brain. In the body, they may cause inflammation and contribute to the development of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease.

How Can I Reduce My Exposure to Microplastics?

To reduce exposure to microplastics:

Avoid single-use plastics and opt for reusable alternatives.
Choose products with natural ingredients and without microbeads.
Wash synthetic clothes less frequently and use filters to capture fibers.
Filter tap water, especially if you live in an area with high plastic pollution.
Support and participate in environmental conservation efforts.

These steps can help you limit the amount of microplastics you come into contact with and potentially ingest.

What Foods or Products Are Known to Contain Microplastics?

Microplastics have been found in a variety of foods and products, including:

Seafood, especially shellfish, as they can ingest microplastics from the ocean.
Bottled water, which can contain microplastics shed from the packaging.
Table salts, particularly sea salts that may be contaminated with microplastics.
Beer and other beverages that may be contaminated during the production process.
Personal care products like facial scrubs and toothpaste that contain microbeads (though many countries have banned these).

Being aware of these sources can help you make more informed choices about the products you consume and use daily.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 24, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/10-unusual-signs-your-blood-sugar-is-constantly-too-high/,10 Unusual Signs Your Blood Sugar Is Constantly Too High,"Type 2 diabetes is often referred to as a “silent killer” because its early warning signs can be incredibly subtle and easy to miss. Or the symptoms it does cause, can be so unexpected, that you’d never think to connect them to high blood sugar levels.

In today’s video, we’ll look at 3 classic symptoms of high blood sugar, and then we’ll explore 10 lesser-known, or more unusual symptoms, so let’s get into it.

First, it’s important to understand that diabetes and high blood sugar exist on a spectrum, and there’s no clear line where you suddenly develop problems. The optimal range is 70 to 80 mg/dL during the day, and HbA1C below 5.5%.

But as soon as your blood sugar levels start rising beyond that healthy range, you’ve entered the diabetes risk zone, and opened the door to the potential damage that elevated blood sugar can cause over time.

“Borderline” high blood sugar and prediabetes – defined as fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL and HbA1C 5.7-6.4% – should not be taken likely, as the harm to your heart, blood vessels, and other organs is already underway, even without a full-blown diabetes diagnosis. In fact, research shows around two-thirds of Emergency Room heart attack patients, already had prediabetes.

So, if you’ve received a prediabetes or metabolic syndrome diagnosis, don’t assume there’s nothing to worry about until your blood sugar reaches the full diabetic range. The reality is, the risk of heart attack and stroke, rises with any blood sugar elevation beyond the normal range.

Now, let’s first look at three common symptoms of Type 2 diabetes.

One. You feel extra thirsty and urinate more than usual.

One of the more common, yet often overlooked, signs of high blood sugar is increased thirst and urination.

When glucose levels in your bloodstream rise too high, your kidneys have to work overtime to try and flush out the excess sugar, leading to a condition called polyuria, or excessive urination. This increased urination naturally results in greater thirst, and the frequent trips to the bathroom can also leave you feeling dizzy or lightheaded.

In this situation, it’s important not to reach for sugary drinks or fruit juices, as these will only exacerbate the problem by further spiking your blood sugar. While thirst and urination can be caused by a variety of factors, such as your environment, exercise routine, dehydration, diet, or medication, if these symptoms are occurring regularly, it may be a sign of diabetes.

Two. You feel hungry all the time.

Uncontrolled high blood sugar can cause an insatiable hunger, also known as polyphagia. When the body struggles to effectively regulate blood sugar, its levels tend to spike and then crash, causing shakiness, hunger, and irritability – a state referred to as the “hangries.” This can lead to cravings for more carbs or sugary foods, and many people mistakenly think that eating these is the best way to relieve the blood sugar crash.

However, this only perpetuates the vicious cycle of fluctuations that can further raise blood sugar levels over time. The actual best approach to stabilize blood sugar is to focus on low-carb foods and higher-protein, healthy fats instead. This helps eliminate the “hangries” and avoids the glucose ups and downs, breaking the cycle of blood sugar spikes and crashes.

Three. You feel tiredness and fatigue constantly.

Fluctuating blood sugar levels can wreak havoc on your energy levels. Simply put, when your body is not processing insulin properly or it doesn’t have sufficient amounts of insulin, the sugar is staying in your blood rather than getting into your cells to be used for energy. This lack of available glucose for your cells leaves you feeling fatigued and drained.

In addition, the frequent urination that often accompanies high blood sugar can lead to dehydration, which is another contributing factor to the overwhelming sense of tiredness.

Now, let’s look at 10 less obvious, or more unusual symptoms of diabetes:

Number 10. “You are overweight, or unexpectedly losing weight”.

Weight gain, is one of the common symptoms of diabetes, but not all people with this condition are overweight, or obese. In fact, unexplained weight loss can actually be one of the first signs of high blood sugar.

Even though you’re constantly hungry and eating more than usual, you may paradoxically start losing weight without trying. This is because when your body can’t properly utilize glucose for energy due to the high blood sugar levels, it’s forced to break down muscle and fat stores instead. You may also notice muscle weakness and an increased risk of falls along with the weight loss.

Number 9. “You feel irritable or depressed”.

Some evidence suggests that sudden changes in blood sugar levels, which are common in diabetes, may contribute to mood changes. That’s because too much sugar and starch can disrupt the sensitive microbiome in the gut, which produces a large portion of serotonin – a brain chemical that plays a key role in regulating mood and promoting feelings of happiness and calmness.

A 2017 review found that post-meal blood sugar fluctuations caused anxious and depressive moods in people with type 2 diabetes. The researchers also noted that these post-meal blood sugar changes may negatively impact cognition, including attention and focus.

Number 8. “You experience tingling and numbness in your hands or feet”.

High blood sugar levels can start causing complications long before you’re even aware you have diabetes. One of the earliest signs is a type of mild nerve damage that can lead to numbness or tingling in the hands and feet. This happens because the excess glucose damages the small blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the peripheral nerves.

A common early symptom is a persistent “pins and needles” sensation in the extremities, which signals that nerve damage is already underway, even if your blood sugar isn’t yet at diabetic levels. This nerve damage is extremely serious and requires prompt attention, as it can progress to a complete loss of sensation. Without feeling in the hands and feet, you become more prone to injuries, slow healing, and infections – all of which raise the risk of eventual amputation if left unchecked.

Number 7. “You have sores that heal more slowly than usual”.

Uncontrolled blood sugar can significantly impair the body’s ability to heal cuts, scrapes, bruises, and other wounds. Diabetes causes nerve damage and affects circulation, especially in the lower legs and feet, which can delay the healing process because there isn’t enough blood flow to the area.

Even minor wounds are more prone to infections in those with diabetes, which can become very serious and even result in amputations of the foot if left unchecked. You may notice drainage seeping onto your socks or an unpleasant smell if you develop a foot ulcer, which is a clear sign that the wound is not healing properly.

Number 6. “You have a yeast or urinary tract infection”.

Higher than normal levels of sugar in the body can also feed yeast infections like Candida, along with certain pathogenic bacteria.

Candida organisms thrive on glucose, so the foods and drinks you consume may be inadvertently encouraging a Candida overgrowth. Candida normally live in a person’s digestive tract and vagina, but are typically kept in balance. However, an out-of-control Candida infection is usually an indicator that your body’s immune system, and possibly your blood sugar levels, are out of whack.

The excess glucose in the urine also provides a prime breeding ground for bacteria and yeast that would not normally survive. Recurrent urinary tract infections, combined with frequent, or ongoing yeast infections, is a good reason to get checked out by a medical professional.

Number 5. “You have blurry vision”.

Even before high blood sugar levels start to damage the blood vessels in the eye, causing diabetic retinopathy, vision can become blurry in the early stages of diabetes or pre-diabetes.

This is because elevated glucose levels can cause the blood to thicken and build up in the eye, temporarily changing its shape and making it harder to focus. This blurriness can be a chronic, ongoing issue, but it can also occur more acutely after consuming a high-carb meal, sugary drink, or dessert.

If left untreated, these vision problems can continue to worsen over time. You may even start to see dark floating spots or streaks in your field of vision.

The good news is that this type of vision impairment can be resolved once blood sugar is brought under control and stabilized, though it may take 3 to 6 months for the eye to fully recover.

Number 4. “You have swollen or bleeding gums”.

Gum disease is a common complication of diabetes that can also make the condition harder to control.

This is because the body’s response to infection, such as gum disease, is to release more glucose into the bloodstream. If you have diabetes, your saliva contains higher levels of glucose, providing more fuel for the bacteria that combine with food to form plaque and cause gum disease.

Symptoms can start with red or inflamed gums, but if left unaddressed, they can progress to periodontitis, in which the gums pull away from the teeth, the appearance of pus or ulcers, and even tooth loss.

To prevent this damage to your gums and teeth, get your blood sugar under control, and see a dental professional for preventive care and treatment of any gum issues that arise.

Number 3. “You have blisters, dry skin, or other skin changes”.

When your blood sugar levels are not well-controlled, you may notice the development of small, extra skin tags in the folds and creases of your body, especially if you’re trying to manage your weight.

Another common sign is the appearance of dark, thick patches of soft skin, known as acanthosis nigricans, which often form on the neck, hands, armpits, or face – this can indicate insulin resistance.

Other potential diabetes-related skin issues include dry and itchy skin, painless blisters, thick, stiff patches of skin, yellow bump-like growths, and large, painful sores.

Number 2. “You start to experience hearing loss”.

Fluctuating blood sugar levels can significantly increase the risk of hearing loss, as the condition impacts the inner ear in multiple ways.

Long-term high blood sugar can damage the small blood vessels and nerves, impairing the inner ear’s ability to properly transmit sound signals to the brain. Conversely, prolonged low blood sugar can also disrupt how the inner ear sends nerve signals.

This explains why individuals with diabetes are about twice as likely to experience hearing loss compared to those without the condition.

Number 1. “Your breath starts to smell fruity”.

Fruity breath is a common symptom of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious diabetes complication. This occurs when your body lacks sufficient insulin to move glucose into your cells, causing your liver to instead break down fat for energy.

This fat breakdown process releases ketones, which are acids that increase the acidity of your blood – a life-threatening condition if left untreated. One of these ketones, acetone, is responsible for the distinctive fruity odor in the breath of people experiencing DKA.

Now, all of the symptoms we have discussed can be attributed to other health issues as well, so there’s no need to panic if you experience things like fatigue, irritability or increased thirst for a short period of time. The same goes for any of the other potential diabetes warning signs.

However, if these symptoms become persistent and are accompanied by other diabetes red flags, it’s time to get checked out by your doctor.

Your doctor will run blood tests to assess your A1C levels, which provide a snapshot of your blood sugar stability over the previous 3 months. They may also do a fasting glucose test. You will want to request an insulin level test as well, as insulin levels often start rising long before blood sugar becomes elevated.

To reverse type 2 diabetes and prediabetes, making the right dietary and lifestyle changes is critical. A diet rich in antioxidants, organic vegetables and fruits, and naturally-raised meats, poultry and fish, combined with certain targeted natural supplements, can help stop the progression of diabetes and reduce the damage it does to your body.

If you are struggling with type 2 diabetes or have been told you are “prediabetic”, then you’ll definitely want to check out this supplement at the link below. It contains 5 key nutrients that help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/the-first-sign-of-a-magnesium-deficiency/,The First Sign Of A Magnesium Deficiency Is…,"When it comes to maintaining a healthy balance in your body, magnesium is a bit of a superhero. It’s involved in over 300 biochemical reactions, from keeping your heart rhythm steady to supporting your immune system. But, like any silent guardian, its absence is felt more profoundly than its presence. That’s why it’s crucial to recognize the first sign of a magnesium deficiency – it’s often a whisper before it becomes a shout.

The Telling Tale: First Indicators of Low Magnesium

The first sign of a magnesium deficiency can often be fatigue. You may just feel a bit more tired than usual, a little less sparky. It’s easy to brush off, but it’s your body’s way of waving a red flag. Magnesium is crucial for energy production, and without enough of it, you simply won’t have the same get-up-and-go.

So, what does this fatigue feel like? It’s not just feeling sleepy after a poor night’s rest. It’s a pervasive sense of exhaustion that doesn’t improve with sleep. If you’re finding that your energy levels are consistently low, it could be time to take a closer look at your magnesium intake.

Besides fatigue, your body might send other subtle SOS signals. You might experience muscle weakness, those unexplained twitches in your eyelid, or even spasms known as charley horses. Numbness or tingling in your extremities, loss of appetite, or a sudden wave of nausea can also be your body’s way of hinting at a magnesium deficit.

And while these symptoms might seem minor, they’re the early whispers of your body telling you it needs more of this essential mineral. Ignoring these signs can lead to more pronounced symptoms over time, which is why catching them early is so important.

Magnesium Regulates Muscle and Nerve Functions

Magnesium plays a pivotal role in regulating nerve impulses and muscle contractions. When levels drop, you may notice a tremor in your hands or a sense of restlessness in your legs. These are more than just annoying symptoms; they’re indications that your body’s electrical system is crying out for balance. Magnesium works as a natural calcium blocker to help muscles relax. Without it, muscles may contract too much and lead to discomfort or even cramps.

Common Culprits: What Leads to Magnesium Deficiency?

Understanding what depletes your body’s magnesium is just as important as recognizing the deficiency signs. Common dietary culprits include excessive intake of soda, salt, and caffeine. But it’s not just about what you consume; it’s also about what you may not be getting enough of. A diet lacking in leafy greens, nuts, and whole grains can leave you deficient in this essential nutrient.

Everyday Habits That Drain Magnesium

Most importantly, certain lifestyle choices can accelerate the loss of magnesium. High levels of stress, for instance, can increase magnesium excretion. Alcohol consumption is another factor; it can inhibit magnesium absorption and increase its excretion through the kidneys. Even heavy sweating from intense exercise can deplete your body’s magnesium stores, so athletes, listen up!

Medical Conditions Impacting Magnesium Levels

Some medical conditions can also interfere with magnesium absorption. Gastrointestinal disorders like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease can limit the body’s ability to absorb magnesium from food. Kidney diseases can lead to an increased loss of magnesium in urine. Therefore, if you have a chronic health condition, it’s especially crucial to monitor your magnesium levels.

Preventive Measures: How to Maintain Healthy Magnesium Levels

So, how do you keep your magnesium levels in check? The answer lies in a combination of diet, lifestyle adjustments, and, when necessary, supplements. Let’s delve into the specifics of each to ensure you’re giving your body what it needs to thrive.

Integrating Magnesium into Your Daily Diet

Eating a variety of magnesium-rich foods is the most natural way to maintain healthy levels. Here’s a simple list to get you started:

Spinach and other leafy greens
Seeds and nuts, especially pumpkin seeds and almonds
Whole grains like brown rice and quinoa
Legumes such as black beans and chickpeas
Avocados, bananas, and dark chocolate (in moderation!)

By incorporating these foods into your meals, you’re not just getting magnesium; you’re also taking in a wealth of other nutrients that work synergistically to bolster your health.

When to Consider Supplements

While diet should always be your first line of defense, there are times when supplements may be necessary. If you’re dealing with chronic stress, have a medical condition that affects absorption, or you’re an athlete who loses a lot of magnesium through sweat, a supplement may be a good idea. But remember, more isn’t always better. It’s crucial to stick to the recommended daily allowance, as too much magnesium can lead to adverse effects.

Course of Action: Addressing Magnesium Deficiency

If you suspect a magnesium deficiency, it’s essential to take a methodical approach. Start by evaluating your diet and lifestyle choices. Are you consuming magnesium-rich foods regularly? Are you engaging in habits that might deplete magnesium levels? Once you’ve made necessary adjustments, observe if your symptoms improve.

Review your diet and lifestyle for potential magnesium drains.
Consider incorporating more magnesium-rich foods into your meals.
Evaluate the need for a magnesium supplement, especially if you’re at risk for deficiency.

If you’ve made these changes and still experience symptoms, it’s time to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis.

Getting Proper Diagnosis

Getting a proper diagnosis for magnesium deficiency can be tricky since most magnesium is stored in bones and soft tissues. A blood test can measure serum magnesium levels, but it may not reflect total body magnesium accurately. That’s why it’s crucial to discuss your symptoms with a healthcare professional who can guide you through the best diagnostic approach and treatment plan.

Natural Sources vs. Supplements: Making an Informed Decision

When faced with a magnesium deficiency, the decision between natural sources and supplements is critical. If you’re generally healthy and looking to prevent deficiency, focus on dietary sources of magnesium. They come with additional nutrients and benefits that supplements can’t match. However, if you’re at risk of deficiency due to a health condition or other factors, supplements can be a practical solution to restore your levels quickly and effectively. Remember, always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen.

The daily recommended intake of magnesium varies by age, gender, and life stage. For adults, men require about 400-420 mg per day, while women need 310-320 mg. Children and teens have lower needs, depending on their age. It’s worth noting that pregnant and breastfeeding women may need more magnesium. Always aim to meet these requirements through a balanced diet and consider supplements only if necessary. For more information on maintaining a healthy diet, check out these foods to detox your kidneys, which are also rich in magnesium.

A simple way to remember magnesium-rich foods is to think “greens, beans, nuts, and seeds.” These are your go-to options for a magnesium boost. Also, don’t forget about whole grains and certain fruits like avocados and bananas. These foods not only provide magnesium but also a host of other nutrients that contribute to overall health.

Keep in mind that your body can only absorb so much magnesium at once, so it’s better to spread out your intake throughout the day. This can be as easy as adding a handful of almonds to your morning snack and tossing some spinach into your lunchtime salad.

Can taking too much magnesium be harmful?

While magnesium is essential, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Excessive magnesium intake, particularly from supplements, can lead to diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramping. In severe cases, it can cause an irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest. The upper limit for supplemental magnesium is 350 mg per day for adults. Stick to this limit unless advised otherwise by a healthcare professional.

Which foods are high in magnesium?

Foods rich in magnesium are readily available and can be easily integrated into your diet. Here are some top choices:

Leafy greens like spinach and Swiss chard
Nuts, especially almonds and cashews
Seeds, with pumpkin seeds being a standout
Whole grains such as brown rice, oats, and quinoa
Legumes, including black beans and lentils
Avocado, banana, and dark chocolate for a treat
Can I test for magnesium deficiency at home?

While home testing kits are available, they may not provide an accurate measure of your body’s magnesium status since most magnesium is stored inside cells and bones, not in the blood. These tests typically measure serum magnesium, which can be normal even when a deficiency exists. If you suspect a deficiency, it’s best to consult with a healthcare provider who can offer more reliable testing methods and interpret the results correctly.

What are the long-term effects of untreated magnesium deficiency?

Ignoring early signs of magnesium deficiency can lead to more serious health issues down the line. Chronic magnesium deficiency is linked to hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and migraines. In the long term, it can also contribute to mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Therefore, addressing a deficiency promptly is not just about feeling better now; it’s about protecting your future health.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 24, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/can-intermittent-fasting-double-your-risk-of-dying-from-a-heart-attack/,Can Intermittent Fasting Double Your Risk of Dying from a Heart Attack?,"A study making headlines recently has caused quite a stir, suggesting that intermittent fasting could be linked to a whopping 91% increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s break down what this observational study actually says.

It analyzed survey data from more than 20,000 adults over a long period and compared the health outcomes of those who practiced time-restricted eating to those who did not. While the findings may raise eyebrows, it’s critical to note that the study does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. It simply points to an association between intermittent fasting and heart health risks.

Critical Analysis of the Data

So, what does this mean for you? Well, it’s important to critically analyze any study before changing your lifestyle based on its findings. This particular study has its limitations. For instance, it relies on self-reported data, which can be unreliable. People might not remember exactly what they ate or when they ate it. The study also doesn’t account for the quality of the diet during the eating periods or other lifestyle factors that could influence heart health.

Most importantly, the study’s results are preliminary and have not yet been peer-reviewed. That’s an essential step in the scientific process, as it ensures that other experts have examined the research and agree with the conclusions drawn. Until then, we should be cautious about making any drastic changes to our diets based on this study alone.

In short, there’s a lot more to consider than the headline-grabbing percentage. For more insights on this topic, read the analysis by experts on the matter here and here.

Quick Facts on Intermittent Fasting and Heart Health
What Is Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting isn’t just a diet; it’s a pattern of eating. It’s about cycling periods of eating with periods of not eating. This could mean eating all your meals within an eight-hour window and fasting for the remaining 16 hours of the day. It’s not about which foods to eat, but rather when you should eat them. The idea is that this timing can trigger certain biological processes that may benefit your health.

How Might Fasting Affect the Heart?

When you fast, your body undergoes several changes. Blood levels of insulin drop, which facilitates fat burning. The body also initiates important cellular repair processes and changes hormone levels to make stored body fat more accessible. These changes are thought to potentially benefit heart health by improving blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control. However, the heart is a complex organ, and how it’s affected by fasting can vary greatly from one person to another.

Understanding Your Heart Risk
Risk Factors for Heart Disease

When it comes to your heart, several risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing heart disease. These include high blood pressure, high abnormal cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking. Besides that, factors like a family history of heart disease, age, and pre-existing conditions like diabetes also play a role. It’s essential to know where you stand with these risks before considering intermittent fasting or any significant change in your eating patterns.

Does Fasting Increase These Risks?

The big question is whether fasting can increase these risks. The short answer is: it depends. For some, intermittent fasting may help manage weight, reduce inflammation, and improve metabolic health—all of which are beneficial for heart health. But, if fasting leads to extreme eating patterns, nutrient deficiencies, or stress, it could potentially worsen heart health. Therefore, it’s critical to approach fasting with a balanced perspective and personalized advice from a healthcare provider. If you plan to start intermittent fasting, take these tips into consideration:

Intermittent Fasting Methods
Popular Fasting Schedules

There are several intermittent fasting methods, each with its own rules. The 16/8 method involves fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window. The 5:2 method entails eating normally for five days and restricting calories to 500-600 for two non-consecutive days. And then there’s the ‘Eat-Stop-Eat’ method, which involves a 24-hour fast once or twice a week. Each method has its advocates and can be effective, but the key is finding one that fits your lifestyle and doesn’t cause undue stress.

Choosing the Right Method for You

Choosing the right fasting method is a personal decision and one that should be made with consideration of your lifestyle, health goals, and any existing health conditions. If you’re someone who enjoys routine and can stick to a strict eating schedule, the 16/8 method might be a good fit. If you prefer more flexibility, the 5:2 approach could work better. It’s about what feels sustainable for you, because the best diet is the one you can stick to long-term.

How to Fast Safely
Starting with a Plan

Before you begin intermittent fasting, it’s important to have a plan. Start by defining your goals and understanding your health status. If you have any chronic conditions or take medications, discuss fasting with your doctor. Next, choose a fasting method that aligns with your goals and lifestyle. Plan your meals to ensure you’re getting all the necessary nutrients within your eating window. And remember, hydration is key, so keep water on hand during fasting periods. For more guidance on meal planning and ensuring a balanced diet, consider reading about the best time to eat nuts for weight loss, which can be a healthy addition to your eating window.

When to Break the Fast

Listen to your body. If you feel unwell, lightheaded, or overly fatigued, it’s time to break the fast. Intermittent fasting should enhance your well-being, not detract from it. Eating nutrient-dense foods to break your fast can help replenish your body and maintain balanced energy levels. Include a mix of protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates to support your body’s needs. And if fasting ever feels too challenging, it’s okay to adjust your approach or seek guidance from a nutrition professional.

What Is the Best Time to Start and End Your Fast?

Deciding when to start and end your fast is a personal choice that should align with your daily routine and energy needs. Many people find success with beginning their fast after dinner, around 8 PM, and breaking it around noon the next day. This schedule fits well with sleep patterns and can be easier to manage. However, the best timing is the one that you can consistently maintain and that causes the least disruption to your lifestyle and well-being.

Can You Exercise While Fasting?

Yes, you can exercise while fasting, but the intensity and type of exercise should be considered. Light to moderate activities like walking or yoga can be done while fasting. However, if you’re planning a high-intensity workout or strength training, it might be best to schedule it during your eating window when you have more energy and can refuel afterward. Always listen to your body and adjust your exercise routine as needed during fasting periods.

It’s also important to stay hydrated and be aware that your performance may not be at its peak when you’re fasting. If you feel weak or dizzy, it’s a sign to stop and consider breaking your fast.

Remember, the goal is to enhance your health, not push it to the brink. If you’re unsure about exercising while fasting, start slow and see how your body responds.

How Long Before You See Benefits from Intermittent Fasting?

The time it takes to see benefits from intermittent fasting can vary. Some people report feeling more energetic and focused within the first week, while others may take a few weeks to notice changes. Weight loss, improved metabolic health, and better blood sugar control are benefits that often require consistency over several weeks or months. It’s important to set realistic expectations and understand that benefits can be gradual and vary from person to person.

What Are the Signs That Fasting Isn’t Right for You?

Intermittent fasting isn’t for everyone, and there are signs to watch out for that suggest it may not be right for you. If you experience severe hunger, irritability, or fatigue that interferes with your daily life, it may be time to reassess. Other signs include poor sleep, anxiety about eating times, or if you have a history of disordered eating. It’s essential to prioritize your mental and physical health over any diet trend.

If you have any medical conditions, particularly those related to blood sugar regulation, it’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before starting intermittent fasting. They can provide guidance based on your individual health needs.

Do You Need to Fast Every Day to See Benefits?

No, you don’t necessarily need to fast every day to see benefits. Some intermittent fasting methods, like the 5:2 diet, involve fasting only a couple of days a week. The key is consistency with the method you choose and ensuring that it fits into your lifestyle in a sustainable and healthy way. It’s about creating a pattern that works for you and can be maintained over the long term for lasting health benefits.

Moreover, the quality of your diet during non-fasting periods is just as important as the fasting itself. Eating a balanced diet rich in whole foods will support your health goals and contribute to the benefits of intermittent fasting.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 15, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/remove-plaque-from-your-arteries/,7 Nutrients To Remove Calcium Plaque From Your Arteries,"While many people think that eating too much saturated fat and cholesterol from animal products causes coronary artery disease (CAD), this is simply not true. The real issue behind CAD is actually coronary artery calcification (CAC) – a sign of ongoing inflammation and repair in the coronary arteries that wrap around the outside of the heart. In fact, calcification is present in all individuals with heart disease, and is not just a random occurrence.

First, let’s look at how CAD happens:

Coronary artery disease develops when calcium starts building up in the arteries, often as early as age 40, rather than staying in the teeth and bones where it belongs.

This calcification is directly linked to the inflammation and injury occurring in the blood vessels, with over 90% of men and 67% of women having some degree of coronary artery calcification by age 70.

While the buildup of calcium is most common in the coronary arteries, it can also occur in the arteries of the legs, kidneys, neck, and the main aorta artery leading from the heart.

This calcium buildup is a key part of atherosclerosis, a condition where plaque made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other waste materials develops and causes the arteries to stiffen and narrow over time. While some plaque hardens and calcifies, other plaque remains soft.

As the arteries become increasingly blocked, the heart muscle weakens, potentially leading to life-threatening heart failure. Alternatively, if the plaque ruptures and creates a clot, it can block blood flow and cause a heart attack or stroke.

Unfortunately, calcification does not show any symptoms, and the only sure way to know is to get a coronary calcium scan. The good news is that you can start reversing this calcium buildup by addressing the underlying inflammation.

Here are 7 nutrients that can help remove calcium plaque from your arteries, so let’s get into it.

First, the most important thing to do, in order to reverse calcification, is to reduce levels of “plaque protein” in the blood.

This brings us to our first nutrient. Number 7 is, “Vitamin K2.”

When you have high levels of the protein “uncarboxylated matrix Gla-protein”, (ucMGP), which we’ll refer to as “plaque protein”, it can lead to calcified arteries. Plaque protein, is the inactive form of matrix Gla-protein (MGP), which normally helps prevent calcium buildup in blood vessels. However, for MGP to work properly, it needs to be activated first, and this requires vitamin K2, also known as menaquinone.

Now, many people do not get enough vitamin K2 in their daily meals, because of dietary habits. As a result, plaque protein builds up to high levels, and triggers inflammation and calcification in arteries. So, the first thing to do to reverse calcification, is to lower levels of plaque protein in your blood.

To do that, you need to get enough vitamin K2, especially in the form of MK-7, from foods or supplements. Why MK-7? Because it is the form of vitamin K2 that is well-absorbed by your body, and works longer, compared to another form, MK-4.

Two food sources with the highest concentration of vitamin K2 as MK-7, are the fermented foods, natto and sauerkraut. Other rich sources of MK-7 are fermented dairy products, like kefir and yogurt, and certain aged cheeses, such as Gouda and Camembert cheese. Animal foods, like beef liver, goose liver, pork chops, and pastured egg yolks contain vitamin K2 as MK-4.

There is a substantial body of evidence demonstrating vitamin K2 can help reduce vascular calcification. One clinical study found that a patented form of vitamin K2 as MK-7 is highly effective at reducing harmful plaque protein levels in the body.

In the study, 243 men and women were split into two groups – one group took the vitamin K2 as MK-7, while the other took a placebo. The vitamin K2 MK-7 group had 527% less of this plaque protein, and their arterial flexibility improved by an impressive 300%.

So, in short, make sure you get enough vitamin K2, to prevent calcium from building up and hardening your arteries. For supplementation, research suggests the minimum effective dose of vitamin K2 is between 90 to 360 micrograms per day.

Next, we look at another type of deficiency that leads to calcium deposits in the arteries: low nitric oxide levels.

Nitric oxide is a crucial molecule that helps keep your arteries healthy and flexible. It’s produced in the endothelium, the thin layer of cells lining the inside of your arterial walls.

When nitric oxide levels are optimal, it improves blood flow, lowers blood pressure, and prevents calcification from occurring in the arteries. That’s because nitric oxide activates signaling pathways that actually stop the cells from turning into calcified deposits.

Unfortunately, many people have low nitric oxide levels due to factors like aging, poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.

When nitric oxide is deficient, its protective effects are disrupted. This allows the calcification process to progress, leading to the hardening and narrowing of your arteries, and significantly increasing your risk of developing heart disease. Multiple studies have shown that low nitric oxide can directly contribute to and worsen the buildup of calcium in the arteries and aortic valve.

To maintain healthy endothelial function and high nitric oxide levels, you can try breathing exercises, stay physically active, and consume nitric oxide-boosting foods and supplements.

This brings us to our next nutrient. Number 6 is, “Natural Nitrates.”

Consuming nitrate-rich vegetables like beets, spinach, kale, arugula, and cabbage is an excellent way to naturally boost your body’s levels of nitric oxide. The nitrates in these veggies get converted into nitrites by the bacteria in your saliva, which are then further transformed into beneficial nitric oxide within your body.

And the antioxidants present in these foods help prevent free radicals from breaking down the nitric oxide, allowing it to be more readily available and effective. To support optimal nitric oxide production, try to incorporate 2-3 servings of nitrate-rich foods like beets into your daily diet.

For added convenience, you can also take a beetroot extract supplement – studies show that just 2-3 teaspoons of beetroot powder per day can significantly increase your plasma nitric oxide levels.

And while they don’t contain natural nitrates, other foods like garlic and citrus fruits can also help stimulate your body’s nitric oxide production.

Our next nutrient deserves special mention. Number 5 is, “Pomegranate Juice.”

While pomegranates may not contain as much nitrate as beets, they make up for it with their impressive polyphenol content. These polyphenols, including powerful compounds like punicalagins, can provide a significant boost to your body’s nitric oxide levels and improve how nitric oxide works. Plus, the polyphenols in pomegranates have also been shown to help prevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, which can worsen calcification in the arteries.

Pomegranates also contain urolithin A, a compound produced when gut bacteria break down substances found in pomegranate. Urolithin A has been found to actually help reverse harmful calcification in the body.

In fact, a 2004 study published in the American Journal of Cardiology discovered that drinking pomegranate juice daily for 3 years reduced artery wall thickness by up to 30%, compared to a control group where it increased by 9%. This significant reduction in arterial plaque correlates with a lower risk of atherosclerosis, a major cause of heart disease.

Our next nutrient is Number 4. “Magnesium.”

A lack of magnesium can really put a strain on your heart. Without enough of this essential mineral, you’re at risk of developing high blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms, an enlarged heart, and a dangerous buildup of calcium deposits in your arteries. Magnesium deficiency can also lead to issues with abnormal cholesterol levels and trouble controlling your blood sugar.

In fact, it’s estimated that between 53% and 75% of the population isn’t getting enough magnesium in their diet, which is why making sure you get enough is so crucial for maintaining a healthy heart. The good news is that people with higher magnesium levels tend to have more nitric oxide production and less calcification, especially in the coronary arteries around the heart.

Foods like spinach, pumpkin seeds, almonds, dark chocolate, and avocados are all excellent sources of magnesium that can help boost your nitric oxide levels. The recommended daily amount of magnesium for adults is 400-420 mg, so be sure you’re getting enough of this vital nutrient.

The next key nutrient is, Number 3. “L-citrulline.”

L-citrulline is an amino acid that gets efficiently converted into L-arginine in the kidneys, and this arginine then helps produce nitric oxide. Interestingly, research has shown that taking L-citrulline supplements can actually increase nitric oxide levels even more effectively than taking arginine supplements directly.

This is because citrulline can bypass the digestive process and get into the bloodstream faster, making it a more potent booster of arginine and nitric oxide compared to arginine supplements alone. The recommended daily dosage of L-citrulline is 2-6 grams, and you can find good natural sources of this amino acid in foods like watermelon, Casaba melons, cucumbers, and cantaloupes.

Coming in at Number 2, we have, “Hesperidin.”

Hesperidin is a beneficial plant compound found naturally in citrus fruits like oranges and lemons. Research has shown that hesperidin is effective at stopping the buildup of calcium in the arteries. This is because hesperidin helps lower oxidative stress and inflammation, which are major contributors to the development of atherosclerosis.

And our Number 1 nutrient is, “Vitamin C.”

Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that protects your arteries from the damage that can lead to plaque buildup and calcification. It also plays a key role in keeping your endothelium healthy and functioning properly. Studies have shown that high doses of vitamin C, up to 4 grams per day, can actually stop the progression of calcification in the coronary arteries.

But vitamin C’s benefits for arterial health don’t stop there – it also supports the production of collagen, which directs calcium into your bones instead of allowing it to accumulate in your arteries. It even activates a hormone called osteocalcin, that helps move calcium out of your bloodstream and into your bones.

Remarkably, vitamin C can even counteract the calcification-promoting effects of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

To get more of this essential antioxidant, look to tart cherries, pomegranate juice, blueberries, strawberries, and citrus fruits.

Now, instead of having to track down all these individual nutrients from various foods, you can now get them all conveniently combined into a single supplement – click the link below to see our recommended product for removing calcium plaque from your arteries.

Other than getting these nutrients, here are a few lifestyle tips to help reverse calcification: Avoid eating ultra-processed foods; stay physically active, get enough sunlight, reduce toxin exposure, and get 7 to 8 hours of quality sleep every night.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-d-shuts-down-cancer-cells/,Canadian Researchers Discover New Evidence That Vitamin D Shuts Down Cancer Cells,"Researchers at McGill University have discovered a molecular basis for the cancer preventive effects of vitamin D, whereby its active form essentially shuts down cancer cells. People with higher blood levels of vitamin D live significantly longer than people who have low blood levels of the vitamin. (Updated April 10, 2024)

The team, led by McGill professors John White and David Goltzman, of the Faculty of Medicine’s Department of Physiology, discovered that the active form of vitamin D acts by several mechanisms to inhibit both the production and function of the protein cMYC.

cMYC drives cell division and is active at elevated levels in more than half of all cancers. Their results are published in the latest edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

For the past several years, there has been considerable interest in the role vitamin D plays in improving health and preventing disease. Previous finding show that low levels of vitamin D have been directly associated with various forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Stephen B. Kritchevsky, PhD, Professor of Internal Medicine and Transitional Science at the Wake Forest School of Medicine found a signficant correlation.

“We observed vitamin D insufficiency (defined as blood levels <20 ng/ml), in one third of our study participants. This was associated with nearly a 50 percent increase in the mortality rate in older adults,” said Kritchevsky. “Our findings suggest that low levels of vitamin D may be a substantial public health concern for our nation’s older adults.”

Although vitamin D can be obtained from limited dietary sources and directly from exposure to the sun during the spring and summer months, the combination of poor dietary intake and sun avoidance has created vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in large proportions of many populations worldwide.

It is known that vitamin D has a wide range of physiological effects and that correlations exist between insufficient amounts of vitamin D and an increased incidence of a number of cancers. These correlations are particularly strong for cancers of the digestive tract, including colon cancer, and certain forms of leukemia.

“For years, my lab has been dedicated to studying the molecular mechanisms of vitamin D in human cancer cells, particularly its role in stopping their proliferation,” said Prof. White. “We discovered that vitamin D controls both the rate of production and the degradation of cMYC. More importantly, we found that vitamin D strongly stimulates the production of a natural antagonist of cMYC called MXD1, essentially shutting down cMYC function”.

The team also applied vitamin D to the skin of mice and observed a drop in the level of cMYC and found evidence of a decrease in its function. Moreover, other mice, which lacked the specific receptor for vitamin D, were found to have strongly elevated levels of cMYC in a number of tissues including skin and the lining of the colon. The finding suggests that topical vitamin D may be just as effective as ingested to prevent cancer.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 10, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/fibromyalgia-diet/,The Fibromyalgia Diet: 7 Foods to Help You Manage Your Symptoms Naturally,"Fibromyalgia isn’t the most talked about disease, but it’s truly a difficult condition to live with. This is especially true since the illness is hard to diagnose: not every medical practitioner is familiar with the condition, and you may have to consult different specialists in order to get a proper diagnosis. If you suffer from fibromyalgia, you’re not alone. (Updated April 10, 2024)

According to Web MD, fibromyalgia is the most common musculoskeletal condition after osteoarthritis (1). In fact, “more than 12 million Americans have fibromyalgia. Most of them are women between ages 25 and 60. Women are 10 times more likely to get this disease than men.” Sticking to a personalized fibromyalgia diet is one of the ways you can manage the pain and get more out of life.

What is Fibromyalgia?

Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes musculoskeletal pain as well as dysfunctions in sleep, memory, and mood. Modern medicine believes that it affects the way your brain processes pain signals, amplifying painful sensations (2).

Fibromyalgia can be triggered by physical trauma, such as surgery, injury, or infection; or intense psychological stress. However, in some cases, it can begin to occur with no known trigger.

Symptoms of fibromyalgia typically occur together, and include (3):

Pain (deep muscle pain, painful tender points)
Anxiety
Concentration and memory problems
Depression
Fatigue
Headaches
Irritable bowel syndrome
Morning stiffness
Painful menstrual cramps
Sleep problems
Numbness, and tingling in hands, arms, feet, and legs
Urinary problems

The most obvious symptom of the condition is the muscle pain that can occur all over the body, including the joints and ligaments. This pain is often described as tender, aching, throbbing, sore, burning, and gnawing.

Although stiffness varies from person to person, people suffering from fibromyalgia typically experience arthritis-like stiffness in the morning, upon waking. This pain can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, or even all-day long. What’s more, the pain and stiffness make sleep light and interrupted. This creates a cycle of extreme fatigue, impaired body regeneration, and more pain (4).

Managing Fibromyalgia Naturally

When it comes to pain, most people visit the nearest pharmacy and buy whatever pill that can help them cope. But these short-term solutions are terrible for your liver, and only mask your symptoms instead of truly treating your condition.

However, there are a few drug-free ways to treat your body right and manage your condition (5).

Get more sleep: Make sure to improve your sleep routine by taking a nice bath or drinking soothing tea to help you relax and unwind before bed. The better your sleep quality, the more your body will regenerate and heal.

Exercise: Although you may feel tired, exercise is the best remedy for fibromyalgia because it works your body and gets it used to healthy muscle response.

Adapt your work: If you work a very stressful job or spend most of the day on your feet, it may be time to find a more low-impact option to minimize the stress your body goes through every day.

Look into complementary therapy: Alternative therapies such as acupuncture, massage, yoga, and meditation can all benefit sufferers of fibromyalgia (6).

Eat well: Most sufferers find that certain foods trigger fibromyalgia flare-ups. While they vary from person to person, processed foods, which are pro-inflammatory, aren’t part of the solution. Avoiding these foods and following a tailored fibromyalgia diet is the best way to get lasting relief.

The Fibromyalgia Diet

In addition to cutting out processed foods, manage your fibromyalgia by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables (7). If possible, remove dairy and meat products from your diet too and get playful with your spice choice (8). Each person if different, so experiment with your fibromyalgia diet and see what works for you.

1. Figs

These fun fruits are packed with malic acid, a key nutrient for fibromyalgia. It reduces inflammation, pain, and tenderness. Figs also contain other beneficial nutrients such as magnesium and manganese (9). Plus, the fruit contains ficin, an enzyme that improves digestion.

Fresh and dried figs work really well with salty foods such as goat cheese and cured meats, but they can also be used to make jam and pie filling. For best results, eat plenty of malic acid daily for at least 2 months (10).

2. Buckwheat

This gluten-free grain is another great source of malic acid, which helps soothe tired and sore muscles (11). Replace regular flour with buckwheat flour for homemade pancakes and serve them with malic acid-rich granny smith apples. You can also use buckwheat groats to replace rice.

3. Spinach

Researchers are well aware that there’s a connection between low magnesium levels and fibromyalgia symptoms. In fact, the digestive and urinary issues linked to the condition can cause magnesium deficiency. In turn, getting too little magnesium leads to muscle spasm and weakness, agitation and anxiety, restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep disorders, and menstrual pain: all fibromyalgia symptoms (12).

Spinach, kale, swiss chard and other leafy greens are a great source of magnesium. Other sources include:

Legumes
Whole grains
Wheat bran
Brazil nuts
Soybean flour
Almonds
Cashews
Blackstrap molasses
Pumpkin and squash seeds
Pine nuts
Black walnuts
4. Peppers

Chili peppers, like cayenne and other peppers, contains capsaicin. This compound improves muscle pain temporarily in people with fibromyalgia as well as arthritis (13). To use, apply a homemade cayenne ointment to sore joints and muscles 3-4 times a day and incorporate peppers into your diet a few times a day. If you have stomach acid issues such as heartburn or gastric ulcers, you may want to skip this one.

5. Pineapple

This fruit is an amazing food for people with fibromyalgia mainly thanks to its bromelain content. This enzyme works just as well as NSAIDs in reducing joint pain and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (14). Pineapple also contains manganese, which boosts collagen production and reduces menstrual cramps.

Bromelain can interact with antibiotics, blood thinners, and sedatives, so make sure to avoid pineapple if you take any of these medications. Bromelain may also negatively impact pregnant and breastfeeding women.

6. Mushrooms

Mushrooms are a great dietary source of vitamin D, which can improve pain in people with fibromyalgia. In fact, a study of women with fibromyalgia who had low vitamin D levels found that 20 weeks of vitamin D supplementation greatly reduced sensations of pain (15).

7. Cannabis

This medicinal herb has long been used by people with fibromyalgia, even long before its legalization. Actually, the National Pain Foundations issued a survey in 2014 which found that “cannabis was considered the most effective pain medication by fibromyalgia patients who were willing to experiment with the herb.”(16)

“Sixty-two percent who have tried cannabis said it was very effective at treating their fibromyalgia symptoms. Another 33% said it helped a little and only 5% said it did not help at all.”(17)

Plus, human trials have found that cannabis has a beneficial effect on nerve pain in people with multiple sclerosis and diabetic neuropathy (18,19). To use, make your own cannabis oil and ingest it or juice fresh marijuana leaves and drink regularly.

Other great foods to try include chia seeds, apricots, cauliflower, alma berries, cherries, strawberries, ginger, and much more!

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition, so there’s no quick fix. Add the foods above to your fibromyalgia diet, stay active, and most of all, get plenty of sleep. Over time, your pain should diminish, your energy levels will stabilize, and your quality of life will improve.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 10, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/low-potassium-symptoms/,Low Potassium Symptoms? Top 8 Signs You Need To Boost Potassium,"Potassium is a crucial mineral for your heart health and overall well-being, yet it’s all too often forgotten in your daily diet. This nutrient is truly the quiet hero of your body, playing a vital role in keeping your heart beating steadily, and your muscles moving smoothly.

Many of us don’t fully realize just how essential this mineral is, until we learn about the myriad ways it supports our bodily functions.

In today’s video, we’ll explore the role that potassium plays in your health, and what happens to your body when your potassium levels are too low. We’ll also look at why so many people are deficient in potassium, and the best foods you can eat to boost your potassium levels.

Knowing about potassium can make a BIG difference to your health, so keep watching till the end.

First, did you know that 50% to 98% of people are not getting the recommended three thousand five hundred to four thousand seven hundred milligrams of potassium per day? This widespread deficiency is making medical professionals concerned, as the number of cases of people with low potassium levels, or hypokalemia, are on the rise.

This is happening, mainly because people are eating too many ultra-processed foods, which are seriously lacking in essential nutrients, like potassium. To make these processed foods last longer on the shelves, and taste better, manufacturers often add extra salt. The problem is, extra salt can cause you to lose even more potassium from your body.

Now, to understand why potassium deficiency is problematic, you need to know how potassium keeps your body functioning at its absolute best.

First, potassium acts as a natural pacemaker, helping to keep your heart beating at a steady rate and rhythm. It also helps keep your blood pressure in check, by acting as an electrolyte along with sodium, to balance the fluids in your cells.

Potassium is also a key player in nerve signaling, allowing your brain and nerves to communicate seamlessly. And it’s indispensable when it comes to powering the muscle contractions that enable your movement.

Furthermore, this mineral helps to make proteins and break down carbohydrates for energy. In short, potassium helps your body operate at peak performance across the board. Now, what are the consequences if you are deficient in potassium?

Let’s look at the EIGHT signs and symptoms of low potassium levels, or hypokalemia.

Hypokalemia is defined as a potassium level below 3.5 millimoles per liter, with severe cases occurring when levels drop below 2.5 millimoles per liter.

The first symptom is, Number 8. “Muscle Weakness and Cramps.”

When your body’s potassium balance drops too low, the first telltale sign is often a creeping sense of muscle weakness – which causes difficulty when walking or holding objects.

Also, your muscles can twitch or cramp up unexpectedly. These painful spasms, often referred to as “charley horses,” tend to strike most frequently in the legs.

For athletes who sweat out massive amounts of electrolytes during intense workouts, a lack of potassium can make it harder for the muscles to contract properly, and reduces blood flow to the muscles. In severe cases, this electrolyte depletion can trigger a dangerous condition called rhabdomyolysis, where your muscle tissue starts to rapidly break down, often resulting in kidney damage.

The next sign is, Number 7. “High Blood Pressure.”

Striking the right balance between potassium and sodium is crucial for your heart health.

When you indulge in too many salty, processed foods, your sodium levels get too high, and your potassium levels fall too low. This puts immense strain on your blood vessels and sends your blood pressure soaring – increasing the risk for stroke.

Experts recommend aiming for a sodium-to-potassium ratio of around 1 to 3, with potassium intake about three times higher than sodium. Potassium acts as a natural diuretic, flushing excess sodium from your body, and counteracting its heart-damaging effects. Plus, potassium has a relaxing effect on your blood vessel walls, which helps to lower your high blood pressure.

The next sign is, Number 6. “Irregular Heartbeat.”

If your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, throbbing, or racing, it could be a sign of a potassium deficiency.

While the occasional heart palpitation is common and usually harmless, a moderate to severe imbalance in this essential mineral can trigger a dangerous irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrhythmia – especially for those with pre-existing heart conditions.

In fact, research reveals that 7 to 17% of cardiovascular patients also suffer from hypokalemia.

Don’t ignore erratic changes in your heartbeat – see a doctor immediately. Irregular rhythms can be extremely dangerous, as they can potentially lead to cardiac arrest- a life-threatening condition where the heart suddenly stops pumping blood, causing you to lose consciousness.

Coming in at Number 5, we have, “Unexplained Fatigue.”

Every cell in your body requires the right amount of potassium to function optimally. When your potassium levels fall out of balance, it can result in an overwhelming feeling of fatigue. This can leave you feeling weak, sluggish, and completely drained of energy.

Now, fatigue can stem from a wide array of potential causes, such as dehydration, medication, or certain health conditions, so it’s challenging to pinpoint the exact cause.

But if you’re getting plenty of rest and sleep, yet still find yourself struggling to muster the motivation to tackle your daily tasks, there’s a good chance your potassium levels are the culprit. The first step is to examine your diet and ensure you’re consuming enough potassium-rich fruits and veggies.

The next symptom is, Number 4. “Digestive Problems.”

Potassium is essential for relaying signals from the brain to the muscles lining your gut, stimulating the powerful contractions that propel food through your digestive tract (peristalsis).

But when potassium levels are too low, the brain’s seamless communication with these muscles starts to break down, and your digestive system cannot do their job properly. This can result in weaker contractions, slower food movement, and issues like constipation.

In severe potassium deficiency, the intestinal muscles may stop working entirely, resulting in more serious problems such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, bloating, and abdominal pain.

Next, at Number 3 we have, “Tingling and Numbness.”

When your potassium levels plummet, the delicate nerve pathways that allow you to feel, move, and function with ease, become weakened and disrupted.

This can lead to a persistent, prickling sensation of tingling and numbness, that creeps into your hands, arms, legs, and feet; this condition is known as paresthesia.

Now, the occasional tingle after sitting in an awkward position is nothing to worry about. But if these aggravating sensations linger on, it’s best to seek attention from a medical professional.

The next symptom is, Number 2. “Frequent Urination.”

If you are constantly low in potassium, it can trigger a cycle of kidney-related issues:

The electrolyte deficiency impairs your kidneys’ ability to concentrate urine. As a result, your kidneys produce larger volumes of diluted urine. This causes you to urinate more frequently, a condition known as polyuria.

This water loss then triggers an unquenchable thirst, leading you to drink more fluids, which further increases urination. Left untreated, this cycle of polyuria and electrolyte imbalances can impair kidney function, and potentially result in kidney failure, especially for those with pre-existing kidney disease.

And at Number 1, we have, “Breathing Difficulties.”

If potassium deficiency becomes severe, it can affect your breathing in three ways:

First, potassium helps relay the signals that stimulate your lungs to contract and expand properly. If potassium levels drop low enough, this signaling is disrupted, and your lungs cannot function normally; this leads to shortness of breath.

Second, hypokalemia can weaken the very muscles responsible for powering your respiration, including the diaphragm, making it more difficult to breathe normally.

Third, low potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat, which reduces oxygen delivery to the body; this contributes to breathing difficulties.

In especially severe cases, dangerously low potassium levels, could potentially stop the lungs from functioning altogether, leading to fatal consequences.

Next, if potassium is so important, why don’t we hear more about it?

This is because potassium often gets overshadowed by its well-known counterpart, magnesium.

While magnesium receives a lot of attention for its muscle, nerve, and heart health benefits, the reality is that potassium and magnesium work together as a dynamic duo to maintain a steady and strong heartbeat. Magnesium helps potassium enter your heart cells, and without magnesium, potassium would not be able to do its job properly.

This close relationship between the two minerals is highlighted by the fact that, 50% of people with a potassium deficiency also have a magnesium deficiency. And, magnesium deficiency can also cause potassium deficiency.

Which brings us to the next question: What causes potassium deficiency?

It’s important to note that hypokalemia is usually not due to NOT getting enough potassium in the diet alone.

There are often other factors involved, like:

Excessive fluid loss, such as from severe diarrhea, vomiting, or excessive sweating;
Malnutrition, whether due to poor dietary intake or malabsorption issues;
Conditions that cause shock, such as severe bleeding or sepsis;
Certain medications, including diuretics, laxatives, and some antibiotics;
Medical conditions, that affect the kidneys and adrenal glands.

If your blood potassium level drops below the 3.5 millimoles per liter threshold, it’s important to address the root cause immediately to prevent potentially serious complications.

Next, how can you check your potassium levels?

To get a comprehensive understanding of your body’s potassium levels, a simple blood test will not give a complete picture. Standard lab tests can only provide a general snapshot. This is because 90% of the body’s potassium is found within the cells themselves, rather than circulating in the bloodstream.

To really see what’s going on, doctors need to look at the potassium levels inside your actual cells, by doing a intracellular potassium measurement test. By assessing your intracellular potassium, your doctor can detect deficiencies earlier and more accurately than standard serum testing alone.

Next, how can you treat hypokalemia?

If you have moderate to severe hypokalemia, your doctor will suggest oral supplementation, or intravenous therapy to restore your potassium levels, and also check your magnesium levels.

For mild hypokalemia, eating potassium-rich foods can help restore your potassium levels. But if you have a medical condition, or are taking certain medications, your doctor may recommend a potassium supplement.

Next, what are the potassium-rich foods that can help reduce blood pressure?

To get the recommended 4,700 milligrams of potassium per day, the best way is to load up on a variety of fruits and vegetables. While bananas are a classic potassium-rich food, there are plenty of other great options too.

You can find plenty of potassium in whole, natural foods like Swiss chard, spinach, avocado, sweet potato, bok choy, potato, white beans, beets, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, watermelon, tomato, salmon, beef, blueberries, mushrooms, okra, pistachio, almonds, cashews, milk, yogurt, and lentils.

Eating a mix of potassium-packed foods throughout the day is a delicious and nutritious way to meet your daily needs.

Finally, let’s summarize the TEN health benefits of getting enough potassium in your diet:

One. Helps maintain healthy sodium levels – This balance is key for blood pressure regulation.

Two. Supports converting carbs into energy – Potassium powers your cells to use carbs efficiently.

Three. Keeps your heart beating steadily – Adequate potassium reduces your risk of irregular heartbeats and stroke.

Four. Lowers your blood pressure naturally – Potassium counteracts the effects of sodium to bring your levels down.

Five. Builds and protects your bones – Potassium helps prevent bone loss and osteoporosis.

Six. Nourishes your nervous system – This mineral is essential for proper nerve and muscle function.

Seven. Prevents painful kidney stones – Potassium helps stop the formation of stones.

Eight. Reduces water retention and cramps – This electrolyte regulates fluid balance in your body.

Nine. Supports overall muscle health – Potassium keeps your muscles working at their best.

Ten. Helps prevent type 2 diabetes – By improving insulin sensitivity.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure/,Top 5 Foods To Avoid If You Have High Blood Pressure,"High blood pressure, often called the “silent killer,” affects 30% of people around the world. It is the top risk factor for heart disease, the number one cause of death in developed countries.

High blood pressure is “silent”, because it can cause damage to your body for years without any noticeable symptoms, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia.

Unfortunately, more than half of people with high blood pressure, struggle to control it effectively, often because they do not know which foods to avoid.

In today’s video, we’ll go over five types of common foods you should avoid, IF you have high blood pressure, or hypertension. This means, your blood pressure reading is consistently 140 over 90 millimeters of mercury, or higher.

These delicious foods are laden with added sugar, salt, vegetable oils, and other additives, that can harm your arteries, causing them to narrow, stiffen, and weaken, which can make your hypertension worse.

Salt is well known for increasing blood pressure – especially in people with already high levels. But sugar is also a major contributor to high blood pressure, and is a leading cause of it.

If you or someone you care about has high blood pressure, it’s important to pay attention to this list of foods, so keep watching till the end.

First, let’s talk about salt. Number Five is, “High Added-Sodium Foods.”

If you are living with hypertension, avoid getting too much sodium in your diet, AND choose the right type of salt.

Salt and sodium are not the same; salt is composed of 40% sodium, and 60% chloride in its chemical makeup.

Too much sodium leads to water retention, which raises your blood pressure, and potentially increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.

Certain groups, such as people with high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, older adults, and African Americans, are particularly sensitive to the blood pressure-raising effects of sodium.

However, it’s important NOT to go too far in the other direction, and get too little sodium.

Your body needs a moderate amount of sodium to regulate fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction, so a healthy intake is important.

The American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day for most people, with an ideal limit of no more than 1,500 milligrams per day for those with high blood pressure.

This recommendation is based on the fact that many Americans consume far too much sodium – around 3,500 milligrams daily, with nearly 70% coming from processed, or restaurant foods.

In contrast, people in countries like China, get up to 75% of their sodium from adding salt in the process of cooking.

This brings us to an important point: your choice of salt can affect your blood pressure.

Table salt is a common household item, but it is a highly refined product that has been chemically processed, and stripped of any beneficial minerals that are naturally present.

It often contains additives such as dextrose (sugar), anti-caking agents to prevent clumping, and artificially-added iodine. Worse still, table salt can be exposed to pollutants like microplastics during processing.

Refined salt is widely used in packaged and processed foods, to extend shelf life, and to enhance taste and flavor, along with sugar, fats, and other additives.

If you have high blood pressure, avoid table salt, as it can raise blood pressure more than natural salt.

Switch to natural salt, such as sea salt and Himalayan salt, which has less sodium per teaspoon compared to table salt.

Also, these unrefined salts retain beneficial minerals, such as magnesium, calcium, and potassium, and are free from harmful additives, or pollutants.

Look for a trusted brand that sources their salt from toxin-free origins.

Now, let’s look at the list of processed foods with high sodium content, that people with high blood pressure should avoid.

These foods can easily exceed your recommended daily sodium intake, especially when they’re combined.

One. Canned foods, such as tomato sauce, corn, baked beans, fruits, and chicken noodle soup.

Just half a cup of marinara sauce contains over 400 milligrams of sodium, while canned beans can pack over 1,000 milligrams of sodium per serving.

Two. Processed and deli meats, like turkey, salami, ham, roast beef, hot dogs, and sausages, that are pre-cooked or cured, then sliced, and served cold or hot.

Just three slices of turkey can easily add up to 1000 milligrams of sodium, and a single serving of salami contains 910 milligrams of sodium.

When you build a sandwich with mustard, pickles, cheese, and whole wheat bread, each item can add an additional 200 to 400 milligrams of sodium.

Three. Pre-packaged foods, such as frozen pizza, frozen pies, and frozen vegetarian foods, like chicken nuggets.

A regular 12-inch frozen pepperoni pizza can easily exceed 1,500 milligrams of sodium, the recommended daily intake.

Four. High-sodium snacks, like potato chips, salted nuts, cheese slices, instant noodles, and pickles.

A medium-sized pickle alone can supply up to 800 milligrams of sodium.

While a pack of instant noodles contains up to 1,820 milligrams of sodium, along with MSG and TBHQ that can raise blood pressure.

Five. Condiments, such as mustard, mayonnaise, salad dressing, hot sauce, ketchup, teriyaki sauce and soy sauce.

A tablespoon of ketchup has 160 milligrams of sodium, teriyaki sauce nearly 700 milligrams, and soy sauce is the highest with 1,500 milligrams of sodium per tablespoon.

You do not want to get your daily salt from ultra-processed foods, whether or not you have high blood pressure.

Eat potassium-rich, fresh fruits and vegetables daily, to balance out any excess sodium.

Next, let’s talk about sugar. Number Four is, “High Added-Sugar Foods.”

Research from 2014, published in Open Heart, argues that added sugar, especially fructose, is worse for blood pressure than salt.

Note that the researchers are NOT talking about naturally occurring sugars in the form of whole foods, like fresh fruit. Natural sugars in fruit tend not to affect blood pressure because of the fiber.

Rather, the researchers are talking about added sugar, such as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), commonly found in ultra-processed foods- which also contain added sodium.

According to the study, participants who consumed high-sugar meals for a period of two weeks, showed a significant increase in both systolic, and diastolic blood pressure levels.

For people with high blood pressure, the researchers recommend focusing on reducing sugar intake, rather than solely restricting sodium, as getting too little sodium can also be detrimental to health.

To cut back on added sugar, limit, or avoid ultra-processed foods, like candy, milk chocolate, soda, fruit juice, energy drinks, and highly-refined carbs like donuts, and baked goods, such as cakes, cookies, muffins, pastries, and sliced white bread.

Doing this will significantly lower BOTH added sugar, and added sodium, which will help hypertensive people manage their blood pressure better.

The American Heart Association, recommends limiting added sugar intake to no more than 6% of daily calories.

This translates to about 6 teaspoons for women, and 9 teaspoons for men.

However, the average American adult consumes about 17 teaspoons of added sugar per day, which is around 15% or more, of total daily calories.

This excessive added sugar consumption poses a bigger threat to blood pressure and heart disease, than salt alone.

In a 2011 study, scientists at Imperial College, London, looked at nearly 2,700 people who drank soda. They found that those who had more than one sugary drink per day had higher blood pressure. And the more soda they drank, the higher their blood pressure.

The researchers identified the main culprits as glucose, fructose, and salt that are commonly used as sweeteners and preservatives in soda.

A regular 12-ounce can of soda contains a whopping 39 grams of sugar. That’s the equivalent of about 10 teaspoons of sugar, which easily exceeds the AHA recommended daily limit.

So, how does added sugar, including from table sugar (sucrose), lead to high blood pressure?

The short answer is: through the effects of insulin.

When you consume a diet high in added sugars, especially from sugary drinks and refined carbs, it leads to constantly elevated blood sugar levels. This prompts your pancreas to overproduce insulin in an effort to lower your blood sugar.

Over time, the excess insulin causes your cells to become resistant to insulin’s effects, a condition known as insulin resistance. As a result, your pancreas has to work even harder, leading to even higher insulin levels in your bloodstream (hyperinsulinemia).

This excessive insulin has FOUR consequences that can raise your blood pressure:

One. High insulin levels cause your kidneys to reabsorb more sodium; this increases your blood volume and puts greater pressure on your blood vessels.

Two. Too much insulin blocks the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that helps keep your blood vessels flexible, and able to expand. When there’s not enough nitric oxide, blood vessels lose flexibility, and this leads to high blood pressure, inflammation in the vessels, and atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the vessel walls), a key risk factor for heart disease.

Three. Insulin ramps up your sympathetic nervous system, which manages things like heart rate and blood vessel constriction. This causes your blood vessels to narrow, and your blood pressure to rise.

Four. Insulin messes with the careful balance of ions, like sodium and potassium, moving in and out of cells, which can contribute to high blood pressure.

Furthermore, a 2017 study focused on older women, found that consuming a lot of added sugars can actually increase your sensitivity to salt. This means the blood-pressure-raising effects of sodium get amplified, when you’re ALSO eating a diet high in added sugars.

Also, insulin resistance can lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, all of which are closely linked with an increased risk of hypertension.

Now, a lot of people turn to artificial sweeteners, thinking they’re a healthier alternative to sugar, but research shows that this may not be the case.

A 2017 study from the Canadian Medical Association found that artificial sweeteners, like aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose, can actually increase your blood pressure. They’re also linked to other health problems like heart disease, stroke, obesity, and diabetes.

Stevia is often perceived as more “natural”, but it still requires processing and extraction to be used as a sweetener.

Food companies add artificial sweeteners to many processed foods and drinks, like diet soda, baked goods, ice cream, and yogurt, so remember to check the food labels.

The next food to avoid, is Number Three, “Fried Foods.”

Fried foods are never healthy, but they’re more dangerous for people with high blood pressure.

They include donuts, French fries, corn dogs, fried cheese curds, fried chicken, and fried fish.

A 2019 study showed that the more fried foods you consume, the higher your blood pressure can rise, with those eating fried food daily having a 14% increased risk of heart disease.

Another 2018 study, suggested that a Southern American diet rich in fried foods elevates blood pressure by as much as 17%.

The high temperatures in deep frying can lead to the formation of harmful substances called Advanced Glycation End Products, or AGEs, when protein or fat combine with sugar.

When eaten, the high amount of AGEs in fried foods increase inflammation and oxidative stress in your blood vessels. This is why consuming a lot of fried items can make it hard to manage your blood pressure.

Also, the vegetable oils often used in fast food restaurants for frying, are oxidized and become rancid during refining.

Prolonged consumption of these refined oils, can trigger inflammation, and the accumulation of plaque in your arteries, which can worsen your high blood pressure.

The vegetable oils to avoid include soybean, cottonseed, corn, safflower, grapeseed, and canola oil.

Instead cook with unrefined oils, like macadamia oil, extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, and sesame oil.

The next drink to avoid is, Number Two. “Alcohol.”

When it comes to alcohol and blood pressure, it’s clear that alcohol consumption increases blood pressure.

A 2023 review of 15 controlled studies, shows that reducing alcohol intake can lead to a decrease in blood pressure; and the more you cut back on alcohol, the better your blood pressure results. Conversely, if you drink more, your blood pressure is likely to go up.

If you have high blood pressure, and choose not to stop drinking entirely, limit alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day, whether it’s wine, beer, whiskey, or mixed drinks.

And at Number One, avoid “Highly-Caffeinated Drinks.”

When you drink a cup of coffee, the caffeine enters your bloodstream and stimulates your nervous system. This can cause a temporary spike in blood pressure, even in people without hypertension.

Energy drinks are particularly concerning, as they often contain 2 to 6 times more caffeine than coffee, and should be avoided.

A 2019 study by the American Heart Association found that drinking 32 ounces of an energy drink can increase blood pressure and heart rate within 30 minutes.

The researchers warn that those with high blood pressure should avoid energy drinks, as they increase the risk of a dangerous heart condition, called ventricular arrhythmia.

However, when it comes to coffee, the long-term effects of caffeine on blood pressure are less clear.

Some studies have shown that regular coffee drinkers, may become less sensitive to the impact of caffeine on blood pressure.

Also, Harvard researchers found no link between heart disease and coffee, even in heavy coffee drinkers.

So, if you have hypertension, but feel fine after drinking coffee, you can likely continue to enjoy it in moderation.

But if you notice your blood pressure increases after consuming coffee, it’s wise to cut back.

9 Coriander Seed Oil Benefits

1. Aphrodisiac

Coriander seeds have been used since ancient times as an aphrodisiac.

Egyptians used it in love potions, as it was said to increase potency and desire.

The vehicles by which these works are complex: its antioxidants improve circulation by regulating cholesterol, boost testosterone levels, increase libido, and improve nutrient absorption. (2) Phytoestrogen chemicals support potency and desire.

In addition, coriander is an effective mercury detoxifier; heavy metals are known to impede libido and sexual function. (3)

2. Boosts Weight Loss

Coriander seed extract has been found to regulate blood sugar and insulin levels and reduce LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein – “bad” cholesterol). (4)

Moreover, coriander enhances the breakdown of lipids (fats) and decreases blood uptake of fats. (5) It’s also a potent diuretic. (6)",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 28, 2024"

Everything from the air you breathe to the food you eat and even the products you put on your skin can cause your body to become overrun with toxins and heavy metals. (Updated Mar 24, 2024)

This makes your liver work overtime to try to clean your blood as much as possible. When this task becomes too much to bear, the organ diverts toxins into your fat cells, making you fat and sick.

If you’ve been feeling under the weather lately or you live in a town with high air or water pollution, try the following 5 herbs. Your liver will thank you for it.

1. Milk Thistle

Milk Thistle is a respected treatment for alcoholic hepatitis, viral hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis. The herb also improves liver function and increases survival in people with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. It even protects the liver from toxins, mushroom poisoning and drugs like acetaminophen.

One compound found in this thistle, silymarin, stops cancer cells from dividing and reproducing, shortens the lifespan of cancer cells and reduces blood supply to tumors (1).

2. Chicory Root

This root has extensive medical history in ancient Roman, Persian, Arabian, and Indian tradition. It was commonly used to help cure jaundice, gallbladder and liver stones and protect the liver. It’s also used to fight inflammation, cancer urinary stones, constipation, indigestion, depression, and headaches (2,3).

3. Blessed Thistle

Blessed thistle is a bitter tonic often used to prevent gas and bloating caused by fatty meals. It promotes detoxification by increasing urine and sweat production. It also helps the liver repair itself and supports the liver’s own detoxification and regeneration processes (4).

4. Watercress

Watercress feeds your liver with vitamin A, K, D, E and several B vitamins, iron, potassium, protein, calcium, Omega-3 Fats, iodine and fiber (5).

One study from the University of Illinois discovered that glucosinates, a compound found in watercress and other dark leafy vegetables, allows the liver to detoxify cancer-causing carcinogens (6).

5. Sheep Sorrel

This herbs is used for its laxative effects, with occur through an increase of mucous and water into the intestine. This effect can also increase nutrient absorption and reduce inflammation.

When something isn’t quite right with our skin, we can feel and see it, and others can too. (Updated Mar 21, 2024)

We can spend a great deal of money and time to care for our skin. No matter how much we lavish, however, when cold weather sets in, our skin seems to forget all that we’ve done for it and we can quickly develop a dry skin rash.

The reasons for this are a perfect storm, as it were: lower temperatures mean lower humidity in the air and dry indoor heat sucks it up even further. This causes the water normally stored in the top layers of skin to evaporate. (1)

What is a Winter Rash?

When the skin becomes overly dry, it can become irritated and develop into a winter rash. This is common and can occur every year as winter sets in. Symptoms of dry skin rashes differentiate them from basic dry skin.

They include:

redness
swelling
itching
flaking
sensitivity
bumps
blisters
scaly red patches
cracks in the skin

These signs are often found on the extremities but can appear anywhere on the body, causing irritation and discomfort. Areas affected can be large or small, with dry patches on the skin here and there.

People with the following existing conditions are more prone to winter rash (2):

eczema – a chronic inflammatory, painful skin condition that results in rashes and/or blisters with dry, cracked, scaly patches. There in no one cause of eczema but it is a known symptom of a compromised immune system.
rosacea – a bacterial infection of the skin that appears red with pus-filled bumps (3)
dermatitis – a term for a group of inflammatory dry skin rashes including eczema, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and radiodermatitis (4)
allergies
asthma
sensitive skin
diabetes
hypothyroidism

If you combine the reduction in environmental humidity that occurs during colder months with other triggers, you become more susceptible to a rash from dry skin:

sensitivity to personal care, household, and environmental chemicals
bacterial or viral infection
latex allergy
stress
fatigue
sunburn (snow reflects up to 80% of sunlight)
hot showers

If your carnal envelope is lovely and supple in warmer months but turns into dry itchy skin when it gets cold, the problem is most likely a case of moisture loss. If you experience the visible signs of skin rash, however, special care is required. Fortunately, we have some great remedies to share.

12 Home Remedies For A Dry Skin Rash – Say goodbye to itchy skin and a painful dry skin rash!
1. Coconut Oil

“Xerosis” is the medical term for dry skin. A 2004 study tested the efficacy of coconut oil versus mineral oil as a moisturizing treatment for xerosis. It found that coconut oil is more effective than its counterpart in hydrating the skin and increasing skin lipid (fat) levels with no adverse side effects. (5)

This is excellent news, as mineral oil is a petroleum product that uses harmful chemicals in its distillation and is a known carcinogen.

Coconut oil is light and gentle enough to even soothe a dry skin rash on your face.

Best of all, the oil is easy to find and easy to apply: simply scrape a little out of the jar (use a separate jar for your skin than you do for cooking) and rub it in as often as you like. Hydrating effects will last quite a while. Click here for a guide on different varieties of coconut oil and what to look for.

2. Olive Oil

Olive oil is exceptionally nutritious, whether applied topically or ingested. In fact, studies have shown it to be an effective prevention against radiodermatitis. (6) In addition, the phenolic compound oleocanthal in olive oil offers anti-inflammatory properties to soothe dry skin and reduce irritation. (7) This fruit oil has been used since ancient times to treat a variety of skin conditions, including many types of rashes, wounds, and burns. (8) Lastly, it’s worthy of note that oleocanthal kills cancer cells in less than an hour. (9)

To use olive oil to treat winter dry skin: eat at least 2 ounces of unheated organic, cold pressed, extra virgin olive oil a day to get at inflammation from within and apply topically to moisturize and prevent precious water from evaporating from your skin.

3. Neem Oil

Neem is a herb found in the Near East and is used extensively in Ayurvedic medicine for skin health, and maintenance of the gums. Its extract has antibacterial properties and is known to relieve boils, blisters, and acne. (10) Even chronic skin conditions respond to neem, as it is effective in the treatment of psoriasis, eczema, ringworm, and warts. (11)

Neem oil conditions skin and locks in moisture. They contain the phytochemicals nimbin and nimbidin are part of the limonoid family of compounds, which are antioxidant, antibacterial, and contain natural steroids that calm the immune system, stopping itch and reducing inflammation. (12, 13)

Some people are sensitive to neem, so dab a little on the inside of your elbow and wait 24 hours to monitor any reaction before applying more widely.

To use neem:

Crush a few neem leaves, mix them with 1 tablespoon of turmeric powder and apply it to your skin.
Mix neem oil with a carrier oil (such as coconut or olive) using a ratio of 1-3 drops of neem to 1 teaspoon of carrier. Apply to the affected area 3-4 times daily.
4. DIY Dry Skin Body Oil Recipe

This recipe includes hemp seed oil, which has been found to significantly improve atopic dermatitis. Its omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids nourish, moisturize, heal, and promote moisture retention in the skin. (14) This oil is great for all types of rashes.

Ingredients:

4 oz.hemp seed oil
1 ½ oz.argan oil
2 oz.jojoba oil
½ oz.rosehip seed oil or tamanu oil
¼ teaspoon vitamin E oil
1/8 teaspoon rosemary extract
½ teaspoon of essential oil of choice, optional

Directions:

Weigh the carrier oils for this recipe using a digital kitchen scale. Pour into a glass container with a lid.
Using a different pipette for each oil, measure out the vitamin E and rosemary extract. Add to the container of oils.
If desired, you can also add up to ½ teaspoon of your favorite essential oil(s). Stir and store in a cool, dark place.
5. Oatmeal Bath

Oatmeal isn’t just an anecdotal remedy for skin rashes—it’s a proven winner.

It contains:

polysaccharides (long-chain sugars) that keep moisture in the skin.
Fats that act as an emollient and form a protective barrier, relieving an itch.
antioxidants and anti-inflammatories that nourish your skin and speed healing. (15)

The easiest way to apply oatmeal all over is by taking an oatmeal bath. Grind up 1 cup of raw oats in a blender or food processor until they are a fine powder, then slowly pour it into the bathtub as it fills with water (not too hot, which can add to dryness and irritation!). Soak for 15 minutes or so, pat dry and apply the body oil of your choice (try #4 above!) to retain moisture.

6. Milk Bath

It’s said that one of Cleopatra’s beauty secrets was regular bathing in milk. Fats in milk help your skin retain moisture, while lactic acid helps to break down and remove dead skin cells. Its proteins, vitamins, and minerals nourish the skin and promote healthy cell growth.

Ingredients:

1 cup whole milk (goat, cow, rice, soy, or coconut)
1/4 cup non-GMO oats, finely ground
1/4 cup baking soda
3-5 drops of essential oil of your choice (try a soothing oil such as chamomile or lavender)

Directions:

Combine the milk, oats, and baking soda in a large glass container. Put the lid on and shake the jar until completely mixed.
Remove the cap and add the essential oil. Re-cap the jar and shake to combine.
To use, pour into your bath under warm running water.  Lie back and relax!
7. Apple Cider Vinegar Bath

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) contains a wealth of nutrients and can be used to fix a plethora of skin ailments. ACV moderates immune system response while beta carotene stimulates new healthy skin growth. Potassium balances skin’s pH, reducing irritation.

ACV is also antibacterial, which will get rid of any harmful organisms that may be causing or exacerbating your skin problem. Make sure to use organic, raw, unfiltered ACV to get the full nutrient powerhouse. (You may wonder why it’s important to use organic products on the skin. In answer, remember that anything you put on your skin is absorbed directly into the bloodstream.)

Pour 1-2 cups of ACV into your bath as it fills with warm (not hot) water. Option: add 1/3 cup coconut oil that’s been warmed on the stovetop to melt. Soak in the bath for 15 minutes and gently pat your skin dry.

8. Homemade Dry Skin Soap

Making your own soap isn’t as intimidating as it may sound. Soap takes some time to fully set but it’s worth it. True soap is made from saponified oils as opposed to detergent, which is usually made from synthetic materials. Healthy oils are what you need to soothe and heal your skin. Harsh chemicals will only make matters worse.

You can use this soap at any time of year and variations are many, so feel free to experiment and adapt for each the season.

Ingredients:

cocoa butter
9 oz. shea butter
6 oz. palm (fruit) oil
7 oz. 76° melt point refined coconut oil
2 oz. soybean oil
6 oz. avocado oil
9 oz. hemp seed oil
6 oz. sweet almond oil
6 oz. olive oil
28 fluid oz. distilled water
9 oz. lye (100% sodium hydroxide)
2 oz. essential oil of choice

Directions:

Practice soapmaking safety and wear rubber gloves and goggles. Keep vinegar on hand to neutralize any lye that may spill on surfaces and water to flush lye that may land on the skin.
Start by measuring out your distilled water in a pitcher.
Weigh out your lye and slowly pour it into the water in a well-ventilated area or outside. Stir with a clean stick and set aside in a safe place.
Now weigh out your butters and oils into a large non-aluminum pot. Place on the stove top and heat over medium heat until thoroughly melted.
Turn off heat and set aside to cool to about 100°F.
While you wait, line soap molds with a bit of oil to make the soap easier to remove once set.
Slowly pour the lye-water into the oil and mix with a stick blender.
Mix in the essential oils that you have chosen.
Once thoroughly mixed, pour your soap into the molds. Then cover the molds and insulate with bath towels for twenty-four hours.
Once set, unmold your soaps and immediately cut them into bars or set them aside to cure for at least three weeks before use.
9. DIY Winter Cream

This rich cream is thick, penetrating, and protective. Anything that bees make is remarkable and beeswax is no exception: it is the stuff that hives are made of. Full of nutrition and emollients, beeswax adds a very delicate scent. Avocado oil is made from the avocado tree and contains much of the same nutrient value that the mighty avocado fruit does, including monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids to moisturize; vitamins and minerals to nourish; and antioxidants to speed healing.

A little of this cream goes a long way.

Ingredients:

1/8 cup grated beeswax
1/3 cup organic coconut oil
1/4 cup organic sweet almond oil
1 cup organic, unrefined shea butter or organic cocoa butter
A few drops of the essential oil of your choice such as lavender or grapefruit (only use with shea butter)
1 tablespoon organic honey (only use with cocoa butter)
1 tablespoon aloe vera gel (only use with  cocoa butter)

Directions:

Add all the ingredients except essential oils, honey and/or aloe vera in a double boiler on the stove over medium heat until the beeswax, coconut oil and butter melt. Stir and heat until well combined and liquid.
Remove from heat and place the bowl in a larger bowl of cold water to cool the mixture. Make sure that the water and cream do not mix.
Add the essential oils, honey and/or aloe vera and stir until completely dissolved in the mixture.
As the cream becomes more opaque and spoon into a clean jar with a lid.
Place it in the fridge until it chills and hardens.
Store in a cool, dry, dark place.
10. Use a Humidifier

Since low ambient humidity is a major contributor to dry skin rashes, adding moisture back to the air is the simple solution. An indoor humidity of 45-55% is optimal to prevent skin from drying out and to help to maintain its moisture. However, higher humidity can promote mold formation. (16)

Additional moisture in the air will also help your respiratory system from getting dry and raw from central heat. It’s important to regularly clean out a humidifier to keep mold and mildew from growing—wipe daily with a cloth soaked in hydrogen peroxide to disinfect. Clean and let dry between uses.

11. Wear Natural Fabrics

Synthetic fabrics are more likely to cause or increase skin irritation. When fighting dry winter skin, opt for soft, natural, breathable fibers, such as cotton, merino wool, silk, linen, and hemp. In addition, wearing loose-fitting clothing reduces chafing.

12. Shower Less Frequently

Long hot showers may feel good but they’re not good for your skin, causing dryness and irritation.

Instead:

Take a short lukewarm bath or shower (no more than 10 minutes) only once in a 24 hour period.
Use soap only where needed (for example, under the arms, around the groin area, the feet, and the face).
Use mild natural, unscented soap designed for sensitive skin)
After showering, quickly and gently pat the skin partially dry with a towel. Immediately afterward, apply cream or oil to protect your skin.
Reapply cream throughout the day as needed, particularly on the hands.
How to Prevent Winter Rash

The best way to treat a dry skin rash is not to develop one!

Keep healthy by eating well and exercising – most forms of dermatitis are caused or made worse by a weakened immune system.
Stay warm – you may feel goofy getting all bundled up but you’re protecting your skin by covering it from the elements while outdoors.
Keep stress levels manageable – stress affects your skin’s ability to retain water. (17)
Avoid products containing alcohol like hand sanitizers, shaving creams, and facial scrubs—these dry out skin in short order.
Avoid tanning beds, as they dry skin and increase your risk for cancer. (18)
Wear gloves and proper footwear whenever you go outside in the colder months.
Stay hydrated – your skin loses water from the outside so it’s important to drink enough water.
Eat foods that support skin hydration.
Consider adding a vitamin D supplement and/or fish oil to your diet to encourage the production of skin-protecting oils.
Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!

Your skin is your protection against and first impression to the outside world. That’s why it’s important to keep it moisturized and healthy to avoid dry skin rash and other skin problems, especially in the winter months.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 21, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-reduce-blood-pressure/,Top 10 Foods that Reduce Blood Pressure and Boost Blood Flow,"Today, we’ll explore 10 foods that reduce blood pressure and boost blood flow, and the top 3 foods that cause high blood pressure, so let’s get into it.

If you’re an adult in America, there’s a 50% chance you’ll have high blood pressure, or hypertension, as half of Americans are affected by it. Globally, this figure is 30%.

Now, because high blood pressure is so common these days, many people tend to overlook its seriousness, and this is a big mistake.

Having high blood pressure, increases your risk of heart diseases, and serious complications like heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, stroke, kidney damage, and aneurysm.

In addition, high blood pressure damages your arteries, leading to poor blood circulation, and symptoms like leg cramps while walking, foot pain, tingling or numbness in your arms and legs, fatigue, varicose veins, digestive problems, and cognitive issues, such as confusion or memory loss.

Fortunately, you can prevent high blood pressure entirely, or easily reverse it through diet and lifestyle changes, without relying on medications that cause unwanted effects.

Before we get to the first food, look at this chart. It shows the categories of hypertension, so you can check against your own blood pressure levels.

The number at the top is your systolic blood pressure, and the number at the bottom is your diastolic blood pressure.

These numbers measure the force against your artery walls during heart contractions (systole), and when your heart is at rest between beats (diastole).

So, the first food is number 10, “Flaxseeds”.

Add 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed to your daily meals.

A study published in the “Hypertension” journal, demonstrates that hypertensive individuals with a systolic blood pressure over 140 millimeters of mercury, experience an average reduction of 15 millimeters of mercury when they consume flaxseed. This reduction in blood pressure is comparable to, or even better than, the effects of many medications.

Flaxseeds contain omega-3 fats, especially alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), potassium, lignans, and fiber, all of which work together to enhance your blood flow and heart health.

Next, at Number 9, is “Nitrate-rich Vegetables”.

Include one serving of nitrate-rich vegetables in your daily meals.

These nitrates convert to nitric oxide in the lining of your blood vessels. Nitric oxide acts as a potent vasodilator, widening your blood vessels to improve blood flow and reduce blood pressure. The effects are cumulative; this means the more you eat them, and the longer you do, the greater the benefits.

Nitrate-rich vegetables, include spinach, arugula, beets and beet greens, rhubarb, cilantro, basil, butter leaf lettuce, mesclun greens, oak leaf lettuce, and Swiss chard.

One Danish study involving 50,000 people, found that simply eating one cup of raw, or half a cup of cooked, nitrate-rich vegetables each day, is enough to significantly lower the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.

Moving on, the next food is, Number 8, “Dark Chocolate”.

Enjoy 2 large squares, or one to two ounces of dark chocolate with at least 75% cacao every day.

The abundance of flavanols, particularly epi catechin, and procyanidins in this delicious treat, can boost nitric oxide production, and promote the relaxation of your blood vessels.

A review of 13 studies from Australia, found that consuming dark chocolate can decrease systolic pressure by up to 8.0 millimeters of mercury, and diastolic pressure by up to 4.9 millimeters of mercury in people with hypertension.

Next, we have, Number 7, “Garlic”.

Eat 3 to 6 cloves of cut or crushed garlic over several meals, or six hundred to one thousand two hundred milligrams of an aged garlic extract every day.

The blood-pressure-lowering effects of garlic are well known. When the bioactive compounds in garlic interact with red blood cells, they trigger the release of hydrogen sulfide, which plays a crucial role in relaxing blood vessels and lowering blood pressure.

In fact, garlic can be as effective as blood pressure medications. In a study involving 210 hypertensive patients, garlic tablets were found to lower blood pressure significantly, when compared to the drug atenolol. What’s more, unlike medications, garlic is safe to use, and generally well tolerated by most people.

Next up, is Number 6, “Pomegranate Juice”.

Drink 8 to 12 ounces of pomegranate juice daily.

Pomegranates contain a unique compound called punicalagins, which are powerful antioxidants with anti-inflammatory effects. These compounds are not only the most abundant antioxidants in pomegranate, but also responsible for over half of the antioxidant activity found in pomegranate juice.

In one Israeli study, one hundred and one kidney disease patients were split into two groups. One group drank pomegranate juice daily, while the other had a placebo drink.

After a year, those who drank pomegranate juice had a notable drop in systolic blood pressure, suggesting that drinking pomegranate juice regularly can help reduce blood pressure, and lower the risk of atherosclerosis, or clogged arteries.

Next, let’s talk about Number 5, “Watermelon”.

Include one slice of watermelon or one cup of chopped fruit in your daily diet, or consider taking 3 to 9 grams per day of L-citrulline from watermelon extract.

Watermelon is rich in citrulline, an amino acid that transforms into arginine in the kidneys. This process helps produce nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, improves blood flow, and lowers high blood pressure.

A study at Florida State University, found that giving nine pre-hypertensive individuals six grams of L-citrulline from watermelon extract daily, improved their arterial function and lowered aortic blood pressure.

Also, watermelon is rich in potassium, which helps prevent excess salt from raising your blood pressure, and also relaxes your blood vessels.

Furthermore, watermelon contains lycopene, a potent antioxidant that promotes heart health, maintains healthy arteries, and improves blood flow.

Up next, is Number 4, “Extra Virgin Olive Oil”.

Take two to four tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil per day.

Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats (like oleic acid), and polyphenols, which help improve your cholesterol profile and lower blood pressure.

In a study involving more than six thousand eight hundred people in Spain, consuming higher amounts of olive oil, was associated with up to a 75% lower risk of hypertension in men, compared to those consuming the least amount.

Coming into Number 3, we have, “Celery”.

Consume four stalks of celery daily as celery juice.

Celery contains a compound called phthalides, that relaxes artery walls, improving blood flow and lowering blood pressure.

The natural compounds in celery work like diuretics, flushing out extra salt that can increase your blood pressure.

Plus, the potassium in celery helps keep your body’s fluid levels balanced, which is key for managing your blood pressure.

Next, we have Number 2, “Hibiscus Tea”.

Drink one to two cups of hibiscus tea daily with your meals.

In one study, 60 diabetic patients were given either hibiscus tea or black tea to drink daily. Those who had hibiscus tea experienced a significant drop in systolic pressure by an average of 22 millimeters of mercury, and pulse pressure by 18 millimeters of mercury after just 30 days, while those drinking black tea actually saw their blood pressure rise.

The antioxidants in hibiscus, like flavonoids and anthocyanins, boost nitric oxide and act as diuretics to lower blood pressure.

And at Number 1, we have “Cinnamon”.

Add half a teaspoon of Ceylon cinnamon to your tea or coffee after dinner.

Cinnamon helps dilate and relax blood vessels, which helps lower blood pressure. This effect, combined with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, plays a key role in managing hypertension.

Moreover, cinnamon’s insulin-like activity can help lower blood sugar levels by reducing insulin resistance and supporting glucose metabolism in the liver, thus contributing to improved blood pressure and overall health.

A review of 9 studies involving six hundred and forty one patients with type 2 diabetes, found that cinnamon can lower systolic blood pressure by approximately five point one seven millimeters of mercury, and diastolic blood pressure by about three point three six millimeters of mercury, indicating its potential to modestly improve blood pressure levels.

Choose Ceylon cinnamon instead of Cassia for safer consumption, since Ceylon has less coumarin, which can be harmful to your liver in high amounts.

There you have it! Ten foods that can reduce blood pressure and boost blood flow.

Individuals with specific health conditions should consult a healthcare provider before increasing their intake of any food or supplement covered in this video.

To keep your blood pressure in the healthy range, make sure to get regular aerobic exercise, and 7 to 8 hours of good sleep every night.

Next, let’s look at the top 3 foods that cause high blood pressure and reduce blood flow.

You’ll want to avoid as much as possible.

Number One: Overeating Refined Carbs and Sugar.

It’s well-established that consuming a diet high in refined carbohydrates and sugar can raise your risk of obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.

Refined carbs are foods like white bread, pasta, pizza dough, pastries, and sugary cereals. They are broken down into sugar or glucose easily.

Consuming too many carbs increases water retention in the blood, which in turn raises blood pressure.

A study from 2014 published in “OpenHeart” found that added sugar, especially high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), may pose a greater risk for blood pressure and heart disease compared to salt.

Fructose, or HFCS is a common sweetener present in the majority of processed foods, sodas, sweetened drinks, juices, biscuits, and salad dressings, making up 80 to 90% of these products.

So, how does added sugar, or fructose, lead to the development of hypertension?

First, consuming a high-carb or sugar diet elevates glucose levels, and increases insulin production. Excess insulin can lead to insulin resistance, causing your body to excrete more magnesium through urine. Low magnesium levels prevent your blood vessels from relaxing properly, thus raising your blood pressure levels.

Second, high glucose levels block nitric oxide production by deactivating it,

Third, exposure to sugar causes your body to produce advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which causes diabetes complications. AGEs also initiate processes that stiffens and narrows your blood vessels, thus causing blood pressure to rise.

Number Two: Vegetable Oils.

Regular consumption of vegetable seed oils can trigger chemicals in your body that cause inflammation, which can contribute to health issues such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and other chronic diseases.

These oils, including soybean, cottonseed, corn, safflower, grapeseed, and canola oil, are made up of Omega-6 poly unsaturated fats that are oxidized during refining.

When you consume ultra-processed foods, such as packaged baked goods, fast food, fried foods, frozen meals, and margarine, it’s highly likely that these products were prepared using vegetable oils, or even harmful trans fats.

Number Three: Excess Salt.

Your body needs a small amount of salt from a healthy source, but many people in industrialized countries get too much salt from consuming ultra-processed foods.

Excess salt can lead to water retention in the body, and this raises blood pressure in some people.

Now, the only time when salt can cause hypertension, is when there is an imbalance of salt and potassium in the diet.

Too much salt reduces potassium, and too much potassium reduces salt.

So, the important thing to do, instead of worrying about a low salt diet, is to avoid processed foods, and increase potassium by eating lot of fresh veggies and fruits.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/best-natural-antibiotics/,14 Best Natural Antibiotics Our Ancestors Used Instead of Pills,"Here are 14 of the best time-tested natural antibiotics used to kill bacteria and reverse life threatening infections. Antibiotics can be lifesavers: They kill bacteria that can cause serious illness or death. In 1909, the first true modern synthetic antibiotic (Salvarsan) was created in the search for a cure for syphilis. It was very successful and was used into the 1940s when it was replaced by penicillin. (Updated Mar 17, 2024)

These and other antibiotics have been used to treat a countless number of people and prevent the spread of life-threatening infection. The discovery of antibiotics was a tremendous advance in modern medicine. Over time, Western medicine came to rely on them to treat even non-bacterial infections. Antibiotics work only against bacteria and not viruses, yeasts, fungi, or mold. Misusing and over-prescribing antibiotics have greatly reduced their efficacy, leading to the development of resistant microbes that stopped responding to antibiotic treatment.

Bacteria, like all living organisms, will adapt in order to survive. The number of people who die from an infection caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is growing.

This resistance may reach into the greater environment; a 2010 study asked the questions of what the consequences of that might be. It is too soon to tell.

“The current state in the field of antimicrobials, resistance, and chemotherapy is certainly not limited to clinical microbiology as it was in the early years of the antibiotic era. Thus, it is not a single grand challenge; it is rather a complex problem requiring concerted efforts of microbiologists, ecologists, health care specialists, educationalists, policy makers, legislative bodies, agricultural and pharmaceutical industry workers, and the public to deal with.”

“In fact, this should be of everyone’s concern, because, in the end, there is always a probability for any of us at some stage to get infected with a pathogen that is resistant to antibiotic treatment. Moreover, even the behavioral patterns, such as hygienic habits or compliance with antibiotic treatment regimens, may have consequences that are not limited only to individual health issues but, on a larger scale, contribute to the interaction with the resistomes around us.” (1)

Antibiotics have been used since ancient times—but not the synthetic kind. Traces of tetracycline were found in bones dating from before the Common Era.

Humans have always struggled against micro-organisms that are detrimental to our health; before the 20th century, they used only what Nature provides. Here are a few the best time-tested antibiotics nature has to offer.

14 Powerful Natural Antibiotics

As with any natural medicine, some of the herbs and spices listed below may interact with medication and may worsen preexisting conditions. They may also be detrimental in high doses or after extended use. Talk to your local naturopath or speak to your doctor before self-administering them.

1. Garlic

This flowering plant is in the same family as onion, leek, scallion, and shallot.

Its sulfur compounds are what give it a strong smell and are partly responsible for its remarkably powerful immune-boosting properties.

Garlic displays “significant antibacterial activity”, even against resistant bacteria. Plus, “Synergistic use can prevent the pathogenic organism grow their resistance against antibiotic.[sic]” (2)

Garlic is also a cancer-preventing antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitic agent due to how its compounds interact with pathogens (3). When using garlic as an antibiotic, there are a few basic rules to follow: click here for more information.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 17, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-natural-cures-to-heal-fungal-infection-naturally/,"How To Kill Fungus FAST With Coconut Oil, Apple Cider Vinegar and Green Tea","Fungal infection can be unpleasant and downright embarrassing. Fungi live in moist environments around your home, pool, gym and backyard. But not all fungi is harmful. In fact, there are approximately 1.5 million different species of fungi on Earth, but only about 300 of those are known to make people sick (1). (Updated Mar 11, 2024)

While most people opt for expensive and invasive anti-fungal cream, there are more natural, better ways to heal your body.

Common Infections

Onychomycosis, candidiasis, ringworm, jock itch, nail fungus and athlete’s foot are the most common fungal infections (2). They can cause skin peeling, redness, itching, burning, and sometimes blisters and sores. They often occur on the feet, groin and armpits, which tend to be humid and warm enough to host the fungi.

5 Home Remedies To Bust Fungi For Good

Before applying any of these to your infection, test a bit of the substance on your arm to make sure you aren’t allergic to it. Also, make sure to keep the skin affected by the fungus as clean and dry as possible to stop the spread of the infection.

1. Coconut Oil

Coconut soothes dry, flaky, itchy skin. It contains medium-chain fatty acids which kill bacteria, fungi and viruses (3). It even works on most candida species (4).

To use, dab coconut oil on the affected area 2-3 times a day until your infection clears up. It’s best to do it on dry clean skin.

2. ACV

The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar acts as an anti-fungal and antimicrobial substance (5). It can be used both internally for oral and digestive infection and topically for skin infection.

To drink, dilute 1 tablespoon of  ACV in a glass of warm water once a day.

For use on the skin, mix equal parts ACV and water, apply on the site of infection for 30 minutes and pat dry. It may sting a little, so you can apply coconut oil after the treatment to soothe your skin.

3. Tea Tree Oil

Tea tree oil is often used to treat nail fungus and scalp infection (6). In laboratory studies, it was tested against 54 species of yeasts, among them 32 strains of Candida albicans (7).

To use, dab oil with a clean q-tip after washing and drying the affected area. Repeat twice daily.

4. Cranberry Juice

Cranberry juice has anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties that work against infections of the digestive and urinary tract (8). It’s often used to treat yeast infection and UTIs.

It’s important to use organic, unsweetened juice, as sugar will only feed fungi and bad bacteria. You can safely drink it multiple times a day, using a stainless steel straw to protect your teeth.

5. Tea

Black and green tea contains tannins, astringent, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory compounds (9,10). Tea also soothes sore skin and relieves swelling, burning and irritation.

To use, soak a few tea bags in water for 10 minutes or so. Remove and place in a plate, making sure not to remove excess water and keep in the refrigerator for half and hour or so. Place the chilled bags over affected area three times a day until the skin is healed.

You can also use tea in your bath water to heal large-surface infection or by placing 5 tea bags in a small basin filled with 4 cups of warm water to soak infected feet. Soak for at least 30 minutes, twice a day until symptoms subside.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 11, 2024"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/symptoms-of-poor-blood-circulation-in-legs/,Top 12 Symptoms of Poor Blood Circulation in Legs,"Do you often feel leg discomfort like aches, cramps, swelling, or chilly feet? These symptoms may be linked to poor circulation in your legs. Today, we’ll explore the symptoms and causes of poor blood circulation in your legs, and how you can alleviate these symptoms caused by inadequate blood flow.

First, what is poor circulation?

When you have poor circulation, it means there is insufficient blood flow to certain parts of your body, like your hands and feet, or a lack of blood flow throughout your body.

It’s not a standalone disease, but rather a root cause or symptom of health conditions like high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, and diabetes, plus other factors we will discuss later in the video.

Over time, poor circulation can lead to disease, and this can make your circulation worse. Conversely, when your blood circulation is healthy, your overall health improves.

Next, what are the symptoms of poor circulation?

The symptoms of poor leg circulation are varied and also affect other parts of your body. They include:

Cold feet and hands all the time, while the rest of your body is warm.

Numbness, and a tingling sensation in the hands and feet.

Sores, and ulcers on the legs that are hard to heal.

Dry, itchy skin, or discolored skin on the nose, lips, ears, hands, and feet that appears pale, blue, or purple.

Shiny legs, and loss of hair on the legs and feet.

Muscle cramps and joint pain in the legs and arms.

Pain in the calf muscles when walking.

Varicose veins on legs that ache and feel heavy.

Swollen legs, from fluid pooling in your legs, feet, and ankles.

Dizziness, loss of balance, and forgetfulness.

Reduced muscle strength, low energy levels, and quick onset of fatigue.

Digestive problems, such as cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stools.

Next, why is it important to improve poor blood circulation?

When your circulatory system works well, your blood can deliver oxygen and vital nutrients to every living cell in your body through the arteries, and carry away waste products and carbon dioxide through your veins.

If your blood flow is disrupted, certain parts of your body will not receive enough oxygen and nutrients.

This results in poor circulation, which tends to affect your legs first, since they are furthest away from your heart.

However, if you notice symptoms of poor circulation in your legs, it means other parts of your body, like your heart, lungs, and brain, may also be affected by inadequate blood flow.

If plaque or blockages form in your arteries, they can disrupt normal blood flow, potentially causing serious outcomes like heart attack, stroke, or in severe instances, leg amputation.

Therefore, it’s important to address circulation issues promptly if it starts causing problems for you.

Next, what are the major causes of poor blood circulation symptoms?

Let’s look at five major causes of poor blood circulation. Many factors that cause heart disease also give rise to poor circulation in your legs.

“Cause Number One”. An inflammatory diet. When your diet is high in added sugar and refined carbs, vegetable oils, table salt, and additives, and low in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats and protein from wild-caught fish and grass-fed meat, it leads to poor circulation. This is because:

One. You are likely missing out on important nutrients your body requires to make nitric oxide, and help with blood circulation. Low levels of iron, vitamin B12, folate, vitamin C, and magnesium, can limit your body’s capacity to produce oxygen-carrying red blood cells.

Nitric oxide is a molecule made in your blood vessel lining, that widens blood vessels, thereby boosting blood flow and reducing blood pressure. Watch our video, “Top 6 Vitamins To Boost Nitric Oxide” to learn about this critical molecule.

Two. Your blood sugar levels are elevated, and this damages the micro vessels and decreases your body’s ability to produce nitric oxide.
Three. You increase the amount of abnormal, oxidized LDL in your body, which increases inflammation and leads to plaque buildup in the arteries, known as atherosclerosis.
Four. This type of eating leads to obesity and chronic disease. Obesity raises the chances of varicose veins and blood pressure problems.

“Cause Number Two”. A sedentary lifestyle. Sitting or standing for extended periods of time can constrict and slow down the flow of blood in your legs. This can result in your legs not getting the nutrients or oxygen it needs.

“Cause Number Three”. Chronic stress. High levels of stress leads to high blood sugar levels and weight gain, which then leads to poor circulation.

“Cause Number Four”. Chronic diseases. Certain conditions can lead to artery narrowing and decreased blood flow. Here are 5 major ones:

Condition 1: Peripheral Artery Disease or PAD.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), also called peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a prevalent condition in people over 50. It occurs when fatty deposits in your leg arteries limit blood flow to your leg muscles.

While some people with PAD may not experience any symptoms, others may feel pain in the calves, thighs, or buttocks when walking. This discomfort is known as “intermittent claudication” and it typically goes away after a short rest.

Other symptoms of PAD include cold legs and feet, reduced leg hair, skin color changes on your legs and feet, slow-healing wounds, nighttime leg cramps, and erectile dysfunction in men.

People with PAD are more likely to develop Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), the most common type of heart disease that can lead to heart attack and stroke.

Condition 2: Diabetes & High Blood Pressure.

When your blood sugar levels are elevated, it can damage your blood vessels and nerves. This nerve damage, known as “neuropathy,” can lead to unusual and severe symptoms in your legs when combined with poor circulation linked to diabetes.

More than 50% of people with diabetes experience nerve damage, which can often go on silently until symptoms appear.

Diabetics are likely to experience the following symptoms: numbness, tingling or “electric shocks” in your legs, feet, and hands, cold hands and feet, dry or cracked skin (especially on your feet), painful leg cramping, and slow-healing leg ulcers.

People with diabetes are also twice as likely to have high blood pressure. Both high blood sugar and high blood pressure damage your heart and peripheral arteries, and allow plaque to build up in the damaged areas. This accelerates the development of PAD and atherosclerosis.

Condition 3: Varicose Veins & Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI).

If you have varicose veins, it means that the valves in your leg veins are not functioning correctly. This causes blood to struggle to flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of blood and fluid in your leg veins.

As a result, your leg veins enlarge and swell, reducing circulation in your legs. This condition is known as Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI), and varicose veins are an indicator. Women and individuals who are overweight are more prone to developing varicose veins.

Condition 4: Blood Clots & Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).

Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot deep in your vein, often occurring when you’ve been inactive and blood circulation in your legs is poor. Pain can develop slowly or suddenly if a clot forms in your leg, and the affected area may turn blue.

DVT is a severe condition as the clot could break loose and travel to your lungs. Seek medical help immediately if you suspect you have a blood clot.

Condition 5: Raynaud’s Phenomenon.

This autoimmune condition causes blood vessels in the extremities to narrow, leading to restricted blood flow. This often affects the fingers and toes, causing them to become cold, numb, and change color during episodes triggered by exposure to cold or emotional stress.

Cause Number Five. Smoking

Not only does smoking put a person at a very high risk of developing and potentially dying from respiratory diseases, it can lead to PAD and atherosclerosis.

If you notice any symptoms related to poor leg circulation, it’s best to see a doctor. Symptoms in your legs could be a signal that you need medical attention.

Next, What are the ways you can improve leg circulation and alleviate symptoms?

Here are 6 things you can do to alleviate discomfort in your legs.

Number 6. Walk More, Regularly

Walking can benefit your arteries and veins. When you walk, your calf muscles contract, helping push blood back to your heart. Walking dilates your arteries, enhancing blood flow throughout your body. It also helps keep your stress levels down.

Walk for 30 minutes, three times a week. Or do 20 minutes of cardio, such as running, swimming and cycling, four to five times a week.

At work, take more breaks so you’re alternating between sitting, standing, and walking every hour.

Number 5. Eat an anti-inflammatory diet.

Eating an anti-inflammatory diet rich in colorful vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and healthy fats, can improve your blood circulation by enhancing overall heart health.

Foods like cayenne pepper, spinach, citrus fruits, garlic, walnuts, and fatty fish help relax blood vessels, improve blood flow, lower inflammation, prevent blood clots, and enhance vascular health. These foods contain special compounds that prevent plaque from clogging up your arteries and restricting blood flow.

For a full discussion, see our video, “Top 10 Foods That Improve Blood Circulation In Legs“

When you avoid inflammatory foods and cut out the added sugar and excess sodium, you also manage your blood pressure, and control your blood sugar better, which helps improve circulation.

For a list of inflammation causing foods to replace, see our video, “Top 5 Foods that Cause Gut Inflammation.”

Number 4. Stay Hydrated.

Since your blood is roughly half water, staying hydrated is key to keeping it flowing smoothly. When you’re dehydrated, the amount of blood in your body decreases, and your blood retains more sodium, causing it to thicken.

Number 3. Wear compression socks.

Wearing compression socks gives your veins extra support, and prevents them from expanding. When veins expand due to prolonged standing or sitting, they can turn into painful varicose veins. By wearing compression socks throughout the day, you gently squeeze your legs, helping your veins to move blood up and out of the feet and legs.

See our recommended compression socks by clicking the link below.

Number 2. Elevate Your Legs.

By lifting your legs to heart level or higher, you make use of gravity to help blood flow back to your heart, and prevent blood from pooling in your lower legs. Simply lie down and elevate your legs above heart level when you watch TV or take a nap. Using a leg elevation pillow can make this position more comfortable. Aim for 15 minutes or longer each time.

Number 1. Drink Hibiscus Tea.

Studies have shown that hibiscus extracts can effectively reduce blood pressure in adults with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, thus improving blood flow. This is due to the high content of anthocyanins in hibiscus. Simply drink one to two cups of hibiscus tea daily to keep your blood flowing smoothly.

Finally, quit smoking and take it easy on alcohol, if you want better blood circulation.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/best-remedies-to-clear-out-your-arteries/,6 Best Remedies To Clear Out Your Arteries,"When you have high blood pressure, the first thing you’re usually advised is to take a pill. But have you ever wondered what people did before these pills existed?

Because there are ancient, natural remedies that provide answers to heart issues.

Your heart is the cornerstone of your overall well-being, and heart disease is a silent yet deadly enemy.

For more than 80 years, heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the United States, claiming a life every 36 seconds and resulting in 655,000 annual deaths.

To combat this alarming trend, conventional medicine relies on medications such as statins, anticoagulants, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors to lower cholesterol and blood pressure. However, these pharmaceutical drugs come with harmful side effects.

For instance, beta blockers may induce fatigue, headaches, and dizziness, while statins can lead to muscle pain, liver complications, heightened diabetes risk, and neurological issues like memory loss.

Furthermore, specific blood pressure medications have been linked to an increased risk of pancreatic, lung, and liver cancer.

So, why not safeguard your heart health with time-tested AND scientifically proven solutions?

Today, we will explore six natural remedies that have been proven to assist in lowering blood pressure, reducing harmful cholesterol levels, and clearing arterial plaque buildup.

You will discover:

A zesty root that helps combat inflammation effectively.

A delicious tea that researchers are considering as a promising solution for heart disease.

A golden root that can reduce cholesterol levels in just 30 days…and much more!

Let’s start with a simple shrub that provides dramatic heart-protective benefits. Number 6 is “HAWTHORN”

Hawthorn berries have been used for centuries to help with high blood pressure.

But first, let’s look at why high blood pressure, or hypertension, is dangerous.

When you have high blood pressure, the sheer force can damage your artery lining, and allow plaque to build up in the damaged areas, leading to atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory condition where plaque accumulates in your artery lining, and reduces blood flow.

Plaque is a sticky substance made of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other materials.

Your heart has to work harder to pump blood throughout your body and this can potentially cause chest pain.

Eventually, high blood pressure can knock out pieces of loose plaque which can completely block the artery, causing a heart attack, stroke, or even death.

This is where hawthorn, in the form of tea, or extracts can help.

Hawthorn berries are rich in compounds called procyanidins, that can help dilate coronary arteries, improve circulation, and lower blood pressure.

They also have powerful anti-inflammatory effects that can help calm chronic inflammation in heart disease like atherosclerosis.

In Europe, hawthorn extracts are commonly used for mild to moderate congestive heart failure, a condition where the heart struggles to pump sufficient oxygenated blood throughout the body.

In a review of studies published in the “Natural Medicine Journal”, hawthorn extracts helped regulate heart rhythm, and alleviate symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue, ankle swelling, and nighttime urination in individuals with Class 2 and 3 congestive heart failure.

Furthermore, these berries also boost exercise tolerance, reduce angina (chest pain), and enhance overall quality of life.

Natural health experts recommend using hawthorn extract standardized to 18.5% oligomeric procyanidins in daily doses of 250 to 500 milligrams.

Before you begin taking any new supplements, it’s important to talk to your doctor to make sure they do not interact adversely with your existing health conditions or medications.

This advice applies to all the supplements we’ll mention in the rest of this article.

Our next botanical remedy is commonly found in your local park. Number 5 is “HIBISCUS”.

Similar to hawthorn, hibiscus is a traditional remedy known for its ability to lower blood pressure and support heart health.

Research published in the journal “Fitoterapia” has demonstrated that hibiscus extracts can effectively reduce blood pressure in adults with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, performing as well as popular pharmaceutical drugs like Captopril.

In addition, hibiscus extracts have been found to aid in lowering triglycerides and oxidized LDL cholesterol levels, which are associated with the development of atherosclerosis.

These beneficial effects are attributed to the high content of anthocyanins in hibiscus, natural antioxidants responsible for the plant’s vibrant red color.

These antioxidants play a vital role in preventing fat oxidation and reducing the risk of atherosclerosis.

Simply drink one to two cups of hibiscus tea daily to maintain optimal heart and blood vessel health.
Hibiscus tea offers a tart yet pleasant flavor that can be enhanced with a touch of honey or stevia for added sweetness.

Next, is a heart-protective warrior that fights heart disease in multiple ways. Number 4 is “GARLIC”.

Garlic has a long history in traditional medicine for addressing various health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and infections.

The key compound in garlic, allicin, is known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which are released when garlic is cut or crushed.

Research has shown that garlic extracts can reduce pro-inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein and interleukin, as well as homocysteine, an amino acid linked to heart disease risk.

Moreover, garlic aids in clearing clogged arteries by enhancing nitric oxide production in the endothelium, the inner lining of blood vessels.

High blood pressure can harm the endothelium, leading to decreased nitric oxide release in blood vessels, and contributing to plaque accumulation and artery blockages.

To maintain optimal nitric oxide levels, eat 3 to 5 cloves of garlic daily with your meals.

Nitric oxide, functions as a vasodilator that widens blood vessels, lowers blood pressure, and prevents plaque buildup in arteries.

A study involving individuals aged 40 to 75 revealed that aged garlic extract significantly reduced coronary artery plaque in participants with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome, includes obesity, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high LDL cholesterol, conditions that elevate the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.

Another study published in the journal “Maturitas” demonstrated that aged garlic extract can effectively lower blood pressure in individuals unresponsive to conventional medications.

For supplementation, consider aged garlic extract capsules containing zero point six percent allicin.
This unique extract is derived from organic garlic aged in ethanol for 20 months to enhance its disease-fighting efficacy.

Natural health experts recommend 300 to 1,000 milligrams taken in divided servings for optimal benefits.

Next, this anti-inflammatory root is a staple in soups, salads, and stir fries. Number 3 is “GINGER”.

Ginger is widely revered as the “universal medicine” in both Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine due to its numerous health benefits.

When ginger is ingested, it exhibits anti-inflammatory effects similar to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by specifically targeting pro-inflammatory molecules like cytokines and cyclooxygenase-2.

Moreover, ginger’s potent antioxidant properties play a crucial role in combating free radicals, thereby safeguarding your cells and tissues from oxidative stress and damage.

A study demonstrated that individuals who consumed 5 grams of powdered ginger daily for 4 weeks experienced significant reductions in LDL oxidation, a process linked to arterial inflammation.

Furthermore, a review published in the journal “Nutrition” proposed that a daily intake of 2 to 4 grams of ginger could potentially aid in the prevention of high blood pressure and cardiovascular issues.

For supplementation, the recommended dose is 2,500 milligrams of powdered ginger capsules twice a day.

For more detailed information on health conditions and medications that should be avoided when using ginger, please refer to the link provided in the description.

Our next remedy is a surprising culinary and medicinal superstar. Number 2 is “CAYENNE PEPPER”.

Cayenne pepper is a popular choice among chefs worldwide for its zesty flavor and satisfying heat, thanks to its main active ingredient, capsaicin.

This compound plays a key role in supporting heart health by widening arteries, improving blood flow, reducing blood pressure, and lowering LDL cholesterol levels.

In addition, capsaicin is known for its effectiveness in addressing obesity, a significant risk factor for heart disease.

It works by kickstarting thermogenesis to boost metabolism and calorie burning, while also decreasing the production of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, thus helping to control cravings.

In a study published in the “International Journal of Obesity”, individuals who consumed a beverage rich in capsaicin during meals, reported feeling less hungry and ended up consuming 16% fewer calories and less fat compared to those who had a placebo.

To incorporate Cayenne pepper into your diet, add this spice to dishes like eggs, marinades, casseroles, soups, chili, and chicken wings for an extra kick of flavor.

For supplementation, consider taking 30 to 120 mg of powdered Cayenne capsules one to three times daily.

Next, a powerful plant pigment that supports heart health. Number 1 is “CURCUMIN”.

Curcumin, the bright yellow pigment in turmeric, is a powerful compound with a wide range of health benefits.

Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda have valued turmeric, also known as haldi, for its healing properties for centuries.

Supported by over 12,000 peer-reviewed studies, curcumin has been found to have various positive effects such as preventing blood clots, lowering cholesterol, reducing inflammation related to heart health, and improving the condition of arterial linings.

Studies comparing curcumin to pharmaceutical drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen have shown that curcumin’s anti-inflammatory properties are superior without any negative side effects.

In addition, research suggests that curcumin can help prevent the formation of sticky blood clots that can lead to heart attack and stroke by inhibiting blood platelet aggregation.

A meta-analysis conducted in 2017 revealed that taking 1,000 mg of curcumin daily for 30 days can improve LDL cholesterol levels and offer protection against cardiovascular disease when used alongside standard treatments.

Due to turmeric’s limited bioavailability, it is recommended to choose a supplement containing 95% curcuminoids along with black pepper to enhance absorption significantly.

For maximum benefits, experts suggest a daily intake of 1,500 mg of curcumin in divided doses.

Again, it’s important to talk to your doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-d-danger/,#1 Vitamin D Danger You Absolutely Must Be Aware Of,"Today, we’ll talk about the number one vitamin D danger, and two big mistakes you could be making when taking vitamin D supplements.

You could be taking vitamin D wrong in a way that not only makes it ineffective, so you can’t actually absorb, or use it, but could actually be dangerous.

This video will show you an easy way to make sure the vitamin D you’re taking is effective, and also prevent it from being dangerous, so let’s get into it.

First, let’s look at why vitamin D supplementation is necessary for many people.

Vitamin D deficiency is a common global issue, with approximately 42% of adults in the US being deficient.

This is largely attributable to our modern lifestyle. We spend a lot of time indoors, so we don’t get enough sunlight to produce vitamin D in our skin.

Using a lot of sunscreen can also limit vitamin D production. This is especially true for those with darker skin, as they need more sunlight to make an adequate amount of vitamin D.

Plus, there are few foods that are rich in vitamin D, such as cod liver oil, certain mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet light, and foods fortified with vitamin D.

If you have a condition that makes it difficult for your body to absorb vitamin D, like inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, or cystic fibrosis, or if you take certain medications, such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, you may also have a deficiency in vitamin D.

Also, some studies suggest that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in polluted air, water bottles, cosmetics, pesticides, and heavy metals can lower vitamin D levels.

As you can see, there are many factors that can increase your risk of vitamin D deficiency.

Your body absolutely needs vitamin D to ensure it functions optimally.

Vitamin D plays a critical role in strengthening the immune system, aiding in calcium absorption, and supporting heart and brain health.

It also activates and deactivates genes that can cause diseases. Studies have shown that vitamin D can turn off genes that cause cancer, and turn on genes that are essential for the immune system to function properly.

So, it’s hardly surprising a deficiency of vitamin D can be dangerous.

When vitamin D levels drop below the threshold level of 30 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL), it puts you at risk of serious chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and disorders that attack your immune system.

Signs of vitamin D deficiency, include weakened immunity, feeling tired, fragile bones, feeling sad and low, hair loss, and muscle or joint pain.

Many people take vitamin D3 supplements to ensure they’re not deficient, but at least 50% of the time, they’re doing it wrong.

That’s because they’re missing two other nutrients that help your body use vitamin D effectively.

This is important, because supplementing with vitamin D “without” these two other key nutrients, can weaken your bones and contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries.

Now, let’s talk about the first important nutrient: Magnesium.

Before you take vitamin D supplements, it’s important to consider if you are getting sufficient magnesium in your diet.

Magnesium is a cofactor or “helper” in hundreds of enzymes that are essential for various biological reactions. This includes the enzymes responsible for the activation and metabolism of vitamin D in the body.

Vitamin D, in either the D2 or D3 form, is biologically inactive, until it is converted into its active form, calcitriol.

For this conversion to happen, the enzymes present in your liver and kidneys need to use sufficient amounts of magnesium.

Now, the more vitamin D you take, the more your body uses magnesium.

If you have low levels of magnesium, your body won’t be able to use vitamin D properly. In other words, the vitamin D you’re taking won’t be effective.

This can definitely impact your bone health, immune function, and overall well-being.

It’s estimated that about half of the population have low magnesium levels because of factors like soil depletion, chronic stress, not eating enough magnesium-rich foods, certain medications, digestive problems, and alcohol consumption.

Studies have shown that low magnesium levels can reduce vitamin D levels and taking magnesium supplements has been found to help reverse vitamin D deficiency.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the recommended amount of magnesium is 400 to 420 milligrams per day for men, and 310 to 320 milligrams a day for women.

If you experience muscle twitches, tremors and cramps, poor sleep, lethargy and heart palpitations, this could be because you aren’t getting enough magnesium.

One way to replenish your body’s supply of magnesium is by eating foods such as almonds, pumpkin seeds, mushrooms, cashew nuts, and spinach.

If you’re thinking about taking a magnesium supplement, consider magnesium bisglycinate. For a lot of people, this is the best form of magnesium to take, because it’s absorbed well by the body and is unlikely to cause digestive issues.

Getting enough magnesium benefits you in a variety of ways, such as relieving muscle tension, reducing stress, helping with your nervous system and your body’s synthesis of proteins, and of course, utilizing vitamin D.

If you suspect your magnesium levels are low, you may just want to supplement without taking a blood test.

This is because a blood test is not a good indicator of magnesium levels, as only about 1% of your body’s magnesium is found in the blood.

Now, let’s talk about the second nutrient you absolutely cannot ignore when taking vitamin D.

A JAMA study published in 2010 found that women aged 70 years or older, who received very high doses (500,000 IU) of vitamin D3 every winter for 3-5 years, were more likely to experience falls and fractures.

You may find these results surprising, since one of vitamin D’s primary functions is to absorb calcium in the intestines into the bloodstream.

And it’s widely believed that more calcium equals stronger bones.

As it turns out, calcium absorption is only one part of the picture. An excessive intake of vitamin D can actually have the opposite effect.

In another 2019 study, people who took either 400 IU, 4,000 IU, or 10,000 IU of vitamin D over three years didn’t see any improvement in bone density. In fact, those who took the highest dose had a decrease in bone density.

To understand why more vitamin D does not lead to stronger bones, you need to know that vitamin D stimulates the formation and activation of osteoclasts.

Osteoclasts are specialized cells that continuously break down old or damaged bone tissue, so that new bone can be rebuilt to maintain bone strength.

During this process, calcium is released from the bone for use throughout your body. This blood calcium is vital for nerve transmission, blood clotting, and muscle contraction.

This means that now your body needs to deliver more calcium to the bones.

The problem is that vitamin D cannot tell calcium to go to the right places like your bones and teeth.

In order for this to happen, your body needs vitamin K2 in the form of MK-7.

So, vitamin K2 is the second missing piece of the puzzle. Here’s what should happen:

The active form of vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium into the bloodstream.

Then, vitamin K2 activates the protein, osteocalcin, which instructs your cells to transport the calcium into your bones and teeth.

And vitamin K2 switches on another protein, MGP, which prevents calcium from accumulating in the soft tissues of the body.

If you take too much vitamin D without an adequate intake of vitamin K2, there will be excessive calcium in the blood. This can lead to calcium being deposited in the kidneys, arteries, and other soft tissues.

In other words, taking vitamin D on its own can lead to calcified arteries, and put you at risk of heart problems.

Studies have shown that people deficient in vitamin K2 are more likely to develop calcified arteries.

They also show that supplementing with vitamin K2 prevented blood vessel calcification in animals and reduced the risk of calcification in humans.

Make sure you’re getting between 100 and 300 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin K2 per day.

You’ll find vitamin K2 in grass-fed butter, cheese, and meat, pastured-raised eggs, beef and goose liver, natto, sauerkraut, and eel.

So, now you understand the importance of getting sufficient magnesium and vitamin K2 along with vitamin D3.

Most people are lacking in one or both of these nutrients, and this can significantly impact their overall health.

So, how much vitamin D should you get daily?

The generally recommended safe upper limit is 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day.

However, individuals who are deficient in vitamin D may need to take a higher dosage, and it’s important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate amount for you.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/symptoms-of-liver-damage/,14 Symptoms of Liver Damage You Need to Know,"Liver damage can lead to widespread issues in your body. Your liver, located under your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen, filters blood from your gastrointestinal tract, aids in metabolizing food, medications, and chemicals, eliminates toxins and waste products, and produces important proteins.

When your liver is injured to the point where it can’t function effectively, it leads to liver damage. This can ultimately progress to liver failure, which requires prompt medical attention.

The most common causes of liver damage include overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, alcohol abuse, certain medications, viral infections, obesity and autoimmune conditions.

Severe liver damage often develops over many years, progressing from inflammation to scarring, known as fibrosis, and then to cirrhosis, when the liver hardens with scars and nodules, and finally to liver failure.

Common diseases of the liver include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cirrhosis, drug-induced liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, hepatitis and liver cancer.

Today, we look at 14 signs of liver damage if you develop cirrhosis, going from early to advanced symptoms.

At Number 14, we have “Loss of Appetite”.

When your liver is damaged, it struggles to metabolize fats and proteins from your food, leading to difficulties in bile production and the processing of fatty meals. If you have chronic liver damage, you may experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and a distaste for meals high in fat and protein.

Next, at Number 13 is “Changes In Skin”.

When your liver is damaged, you may experience visible signs on your skin. Hormonal changes can cause small blood vessels to dilate, leading to the appearance of spider veins, especially on your face and torso. You may also notice a blotchy redness on your face, palms, and feet, which can be due to hormonal changes, vitamin deficiencies, or increased pressure in your vascular system.

In more advanced liver damage, jaundice can cause your skin to turn yellow. Jaundice occurs when a waste product called bilirubin builds up in the body, due to the liver’s inability to metabolize it.

At Number 12, we have “Fatigue & Difficulty Concentrating”.

When your liver is damaged, it needs to work harder to carry out its essential functions. This results in you feeling tired all the time and having difficulty concentrating, as your liver filters out toxins at a slower pace than usual.

The liver is also less efficient in breaking down food and absorbing the nutrients needed to maintain mental clarity and overall well-being. In more advanced cases of liver disease, this can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is brain damage caused by high levels of toxins in the body. The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include forgetfulness, memory loss and confusion.

Moving on to Number 11, we have “Sleep Disturbances”.

Sleep disturbances often trouble those with liver damage. These disruptions worsen as liver disease progresses, leading to a cycle of poor sleep and declining health. You may find yourself unable to sleep due to the discomfort caused by symptoms such as swelling in the abdomen or mental changes associated with hepatic encephalopathy.

Coming into Number 10, is “Loss of Weight & Muscle Wasting”.

When your liver isn’t working properly, it can cause malnutrition. This usually begins with a decreased appetite or frequent nausea, leading to weight loss. For people with cirrhosis, a poor appetite and diet can greatly contribute to muscle wasting (sarcopenia), a decline in muscle mass and strength. They may experience accelerated starvation, where 10 hours of fasting affects them as much as three days of starvation would affect a healthy person.

Next, at Number 9, we have “Abdominal Swelling & Pain”.

Abdominal swelling is a telltale sign of cirrhosis. This condition, known as ascites, arises when the loss of proteins in the blood, cause fluid to leave the vessels and accumulate in the space between the tissues which line the abdomen and abdominal organs. This fluid buildup exerts pressure in the abdomen, leading to discomfort and pain.

Portal hypertension, which is high blood pressure in the portal vein that delivers blood from the digestive organs to the liver, can also lead to the development of ascites. The increased pressure and blood pooling can also cause the spleen to enlarge, causing upper left-side abdominal pain that radiates to the back.

The next symptom is, Number 8, “Itchy Skin”.

If you’re experiencing pruritus, or itchy skin, it could be a sign of a liver disease. This itching could be caused by the restriction or stoppage of bile flow from the liver. This type of itching can be so intense that it disrupts your sleep and daily activities. It does not generally involve rash or skin lesions, and is not relieved by scratching. The itching can develop in one area or all over your body, but it’s most commonly felt on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet.

Our Number 7 symptom is, “Changes in Bowel Movements”.

When your liver is not functioning well, it can slow down digestion, leading the body to increasingly excrete toxins in the bowels. This results in constipation or diarrhea. In later stages of liver damage, the liver may struggle to produce and process bile and bilirubin, which give stool its brown color, causing the stool to become pale-colored.

Next, we have Number 6, “Changes in Urine”.

Dark urine is often one of the first signs that bilirubin levels are elevated. This happens because the damaged liver cannot break down this yellowish pigment and remove it properly. Without effective elimination through stool, excess bilirubin circulates back into your bloodstream and then gets filtered out by your kidneys, darkening the urine.

At Number 5, is “Easy Bruising & Excessive Bleeding”.

Your liver plays a key role in making proteins that help your blood to clot. When your liver is damaged, it struggles to help blood clot properly after an injury, thus causing more bruising or bleeding. Frequent nosebleeds and bleeding gums, or prolonged bleeding from simple cuts, are indications of potential liver issues.

Another problem can arise when new blood vessels are formed to bypass the damaged liver, due to portal hypertension. These vessels, often created in the esophagus and stomach, can swell and cause severe bleeding, especially if blood clotting is not functioning well. If you experience symptoms such as vomiting blood or black stool, it could be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding, and you should seek immediate medical attention.

Next, at Number 4, is “Swelling in Legs or Ankles”.

Liver damage can lead to fluid buildup in your ankles and legs. This happens because the loss of blood protein allows fluid to leak into the tissues. Due to gravity, the legs and ankles are often affected as fluid is pulled down towards the feet. In the late stages of liver damage, noticeable puffiness is commonly seen around the lower limbs.

Coming into Number 3, we have “Nail Changes”.

Various types of liver disease can have noticeable effects on the nails. For instance, Terry’s nails, which are mostly white with a thin, reddish-brown strip near the tip, are often linked to liver failure or cirrhosis.

In a study, 68 percent of liver disease patients (with cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B) had nail changes, while only 35 percent of the control group did. The most frequent change was a fungal nail infection called onychomycosis.

You may also notice other changes like ridges running lengthwise on the nails, nails that are prone to breaking, fingertips becoming rounded and enlarged, and nails that are thick, misshapen, or have unusual color.

Next, at number 2 is “Impotence & Loss of Libido”.

The prevalence of erectile dysfunction is high in men with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Liver damage can also lead to a decrease in sexual desire. Although the exact reasons for these symptoms require more research, many experts think they result from imbalances in sex hormones commonly seen in liver conditions. Also, alcohol seems to contribute to the loss of sexual function, particularly in men.

And at Number 1, we have “Bad Breath”

Fetor hepaticus is a chronic odor in your breath, different from normal bad breath, and is a distinctive symptom of liver disease. It is not related to dental hygiene, and cannot be solved by brushing your teeth more often or using special mouthwash. The scent is described as a mixture of rotten eggs and garlic. This symptom does not appear until there is already significant liver damage, and can only be solved by curing liver disease.

So, there you have it! Some of the most important symptoms of liver damage. If you have more than one of these symptoms, and they don’t go away, consult a healthcare professional who can evaluate your liver function.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/reduce-cholesterol-naturally/,#1 BEST Way to Reduce Abnormal Cholesterol Naturally,"By now, you would have heard that high cholesterol is bad, HDL is the “good” cholesterol, and LDL is “bad.” This is NOT a true statement. In today’s video, we’ll explain the truth about cholesterol and heart disease, and what it really means when you have high cholesterol.

We’ll also give you 8 tips you can act on right away to have healthy cholesterol without meds. By the end of this important video, you’ll understand more about reducing abnormal cholesterol naturally than 99% of people.

Many people are shocked when they hear that LDL or “low-density lipoprotein” by itself is not the problem. Instead, the main culprit that causes atherosclerosis, or blocked arteries, is oxidized LDL. Think of oxidized LDL as the rust on an old car.

So, what is LDL?

First, LDL is not cholesterol, it’s a protein. LDL (and HDL) are carrier proteins that transport life-sustaining cholesterol and triglycerides, and other nutrients like CoQ10 and vitamins to every cell in the body.

And, what is cholesterol?

Cholesterol is an important fatty substance produced by your liver. It helps to build strong cell membranes, and produce hormones such as cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen, as well as vitamin D.

However, it’s critical to distinguish between cholesterol made by your liver, and that which you consume. We’ll circle back to this point in just a minute.

Now, let’s get back to LDL.

Most people do not know there’s actually two types of LDL particles.

The type of LDL that is bad, is small, dense LDL particles, also called type-B LDL particles. And the type of LDL that is good, is large, fluffy type-A LDL particles.

Even though LDL is said to be bad, some people with a high LDL number do not get coronary artery disease. This is because they have lots of type-A LDL particles.

So, why is type-B, or smaller LDL particles considered bad or dangerous?

LDL can get damaged when it interacts with free radicals in your body. Free radicals are produced in response to toxins and sugar, and they cause a chemical reaction called oxidation, which makes LDL unstable.

Small, type-B LDL particles are bad, because they are more prone to oxidation than type-A or larger particles.

In response, your body produces white blood cells called macrophages, which rush to the oxidized LDL to clean it up. However, when macrophages ingest the unnatural oxidized LDL, they become “foam cells.” These foam cells trigger inflammation, and over many years, it leads to atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerosis, or arteries blocked by plaque, is the main driver of Coronary Artery Disease. If plaque becomes unstable, it can break off and trigger a heart attack or stroke.

A study in the journal Circulation found that people with high levels of oxidized LDL had a 4.25% higher risk of heart attack compared to those with low levels of oxidized LDL.

So, the next question is: what causes oxidized LDL?

Normally, your gut bacteria prefer the cholesterol made by your liver to what you eat. So most of the cholesterol from food is not absorbed but passed out in the stool.

However, when you eat too many carbohydrates (or sugar), too much cholesterol is produced, and the large and fluffy LDL particles are transformed into small and dense LDL particles.

Sugar (and toxins) are the real causes of oxidized LDL particles that lead to inflammation and plaque formation in artery walls.

And not saturated fat and cholesterol, as we have been told for decades. In fact, the theory that high amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol is what causes heart disease and death, has never been proven.

Now that you know oxidized LDL is what causes artery blockages, let’s look at the role of HDL and triglycerides.

In short, HDL or high-density lipoprotein, is beneficial, and you want more of it, but it is easily damaged by sugar and toxins.

For HDL, any number below 40 mg/dL in men, and 50 mg/dL in women signals increased cardiovascular risk.

Think of HDL as a powerful cleaner in your body. It sucks up excess cholesterol and plaque in your arteries, depositing them in your liver for cleansing. This teamwork reduces your risk of heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.

As for triglycerides, they are a type of fat found in food and produced in the liver. Like cholesterol, they are carried by lipoproteins to cells where they are used for energy. Triglycerides are stored in fat cells.

Eating too many carbohydrates or sugars causes the liver to produce large amounts of triglycerides packaged in very small, dense LDL particles, thus increasing cardiovascular risk.

So, to summarize: when we talk about lowering high cholesterol, we’re really talking about reducing type-B LDL particles and triglycerides, and raising HDL.

Keep this in mind, as we get into the 8 tips to balance your cholesterol naturally.

Number 8. Choose Good Fat & Avoid Low Fat.

In the last 40 years, the significant increase in heart disease in America has coincided with the popularity of low-fat diets which are high in sugar, refined carbs and vegetable oils.

After following close to 10,000 women for 15 years, researchers in Australia found that higher levels of saturated fat intake were not associated with cardiovascular disease. Instead, this resulted in a lower incidence of diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity.

Saturated fats, found in foods, such as meat, cheese, and coconut oil, are stable and don’t spoil easily. In fact, they stay solid at room temperature and can be beneficial for your health, especially when obtained from organic sources.

In addition, there are healthy partially saturated fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.

Monounsaturated fats, present in nuts, avocados, and olives, are considered incredibly healthy for the body.

Polyunsaturated fats, including essential fatty acids like omega-3 and omega-6, are vital for the body, and can be found in fatty fish, beef, flaxseeds, and walnut oil.

However, avoid vegetable oils, such as canola, corn, and sunflower oils. These polyunsaturated fats have been oxidized during refining, and they cause inflammation in your arteries.

See our video, “Top 5 Foods that Destroy Your Heart“.

Number 7. Eat the Right Carbs.

A diet high in inflammatory foods will increase your risk for hyperlipidemia. Hyperlipidemia is the condition when you have both high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

To prevent problems with cholesterol and triglycerides, avoid sugar and refined grain products, such as white bread, packaged and processed foods, and eat in moderation high-glycemic carbs, like potatoes and short-grain rice.

The best solution is to stop consuming damaging, processed foods and eat an anti-inflammatory diet.

Choose low-carb leafy green vegetables, berries, sprouted nuts and seeds, and cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower.

See our video, “Top 10 Foods to Heal Your Heart“.

Number 6. Exercise Regularly.

Research suggests that regular physical activity can positively impact your cholesterol levels, increasing HDL and preventing the rise of small, dense LDL particles.

Both higher intensity cardio exercises and weight training can benefit your heart health and cholesterol levels.

Activities like walking, swimming, and cycling can have a positive impact on your cholesterol and lipid ratios. Resistance training can also improve your lipid profiles.

The key is to find activities that you enjoy, as this will make it more likely for you to stick with them.

Number 5. Reduce Alcohol.

While light to moderate drinking can have some benefits, heavy alcohol intake is linked to high triglyceride levels and a greater risk of heart disease. To maintain healthy cholesterol levels, drink within the mild or moderate range – one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.

Number 4. Improve Gut Bacteria.

Changes in the composition of your gut microbiome, known as dysbiosis, have been associated with the development and progression of various diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD).

When your gut is functioning optimally and your good gut bacteria are thriving, they work to keep harmful cholesterol out of your body.

Consider working these fermented foods into your meals to help improve your gut bacteria and lower cholesterol: sauerkraut, kefir, kombucha, natto and kimchi.

See our video, “Top 5 Gut Foods To Clean Out Your Arteries“.

Number 3. Reduce Stress.

Chronic stress contributes to abnormal cholesterol, by acting on cortisol, but you can combat this by staying active. Walking at a comfortable pace, even around the office, can release endorphins in your brain, promoting relaxation and improving your mood.

Not only does walking reduce stress but it also has a positive impact on your overall heart health. It can improve cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, regulate weight, and boost energy levels.

Another way to combat stress is by listening to your favorite music. Research has shown that certain types of music can affect heart activity, blood pressure, and breathing, and alter brain chemistry in a way that can help improve cardiovascular health.

Number 2. Get Enough Quality Sleep.

Sleep helps your body repair and reset, and plays a crucial role in clearing out the day’s stressors. It also allows your heart to recover from the day’s hard work.

Both insufficient and excessive sleep can have negative effects on blood lipid levels. Research has shown that getting less than five hours or more than eight hours of sleep can lead to abnormal blood lipid levels.

Another study found that inadequate sleep, especially less than six hours, can result in high levels of small, dense LDL particles. Snoring has also been associated with low HDL levels in the same study.

To ensure you get enough sleep, it’s important to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.

Keeping your bedroom cool and dark can help improve the quality of your sleep.

Turn off your electronics at least one hour before bedtime. The blue light from displays can disrupt melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep.

Doing light exercises like yoga and stretching, and listening to quiet music, can also calm your mind and relax your body before bedtime.

Number 1. Get Enough Sunshine.

Sunlight is essential for your health, including your cholesterol levels.

When sunlight touches your skin, it triggers a process that converts cholesterol in your tiny blood vessels into vitamin D, leading to an increase in vitamin D levels and a decrease in cholesterol levels.

Multiple studies have shown that sun exposure lowers blood pressure, decreases cholesterol, and reduces the risk of heart disease and death. The best time to get sun exposure is in the morning.

There you have it! The eight things you can do to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides naturally.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/heres-why-you-should-ditch-the-eye-cream-and-use-baking-soda-instead/,Put Baking Soda Under Your Eyes To Quickly Get Rid of Dark Circles,"Everybody gets dark circles under their eyes, even children and young adults. Despite this, the beauty industry is always emphasizing that they should be hidden or chemically altered to be beautiful. (Updated Jan 19, 2024)

If it isn’t concealers and highlight powder, there’s always a new eye cream to add to your beauty routine that promises to get rid of dark circles. But do any of these products actually work? If so, at what cost to your health?

Dark circles can be caused by the following (1):

Allergies
Eczema
Contact dermatitis
Fatigue
Heredity — dark under-eye circles can run in families
Pigmentation irregularities
Rubbing or scratching your eyes
Sun exposure, which prompts your body to produce more melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color
Thinning skin and loss of fat and collagen, which can make the reddish-blue blood vessels under your eyes more obvious
Poor blood and lymph circulation
Dehydration

Sometimes it’s just a questions of shadows being cast by puffy eyelids or hollows under your eyes that develop as a normal part of aging (2).

How To Use Baking Soda To Reduce Dark Circles

Baking Soda is a natural exfoliate, which promotes blood flow and moves along lymph as you gently massage it onto your skin.

Similarly to dry brushing, exfoliating also promotes skin cell renewal.

You’ll need:

A shot glass of hot water or chamomile tea
1 teaspoon of baking soda

Instructions:

Mix ingredients well until they form a paste.
Soak cotton pads in the mixture and place them under the eyes.
Gently massage for 2-5 minutes.
Leave on for 10-15 minutes.
Rinse with cold water and pat your face dry with a clean towel.
Follow up with coconut oil or your favorite moisturizer.

You can also reduce puffiness by leaving a spoon in your freezer overnight and applying it under your eyes in the morning, leaving it on until it becomes warm.

Since dark circles can be caused by fatigue and dehydration, always make sure to get a good night’s sleep and drink plenty of water to keep your skin looking healthy.

Most of all, remember that you define your own beauty, not the cosmetic industry.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-to-heal-your-heart/,Eat These 10 Foods that Will Help Your Heart Heal,"Imagine if your doctor prescribed you a “miracle drug” that could lower your blood pressure, reduce your triglycerides, protect you from heart disease, and had no side effects, all while tasting delicious. Would you take it? I’m pretty sure you would take it in a heartbeat.

The good news is that this prescription already exists. In today’s video, we highlight 10 foods that have the power to heal your heart, prevent cardiovascular disease, and improve your quality of life if you already have a heart condition. Continue watching till Number 1, as this is the one food most people ignore.

Let’s begin with Number 10: “Fatty Fish”.

Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and anchovies, are at the forefront of the most heart-healthy foods you can consume. These fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which play a pivotal role in supporting heart health by reducing inflammation, lowering triglycerides, preventing blood clots, and maintaining healthy blood pressure.

A groundbreaking 2021 study revealed that individuals with heart disease who consumed at least two servings of fatty fish per week experienced a remarkable 20% reduction in their risk of heart attacks, strokes, and even death. Furthermore, fish consumption has been linked to a lower risk of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AFib).

Additionally, omega-3 fatty acids from seafood have been shown to help prevent coronary calcification and plaque progression, with a high omega-3 index predicting a low heart attack risk in individuals with coronary calcification.

When purchasing fish, it’s advisable to stay away from farm-raised fish, which can be contaminated with heavy metals and chemicals. Instead, opt for wild-caught fish from a sustainable source.

Coming up next, is Number 9: “Nitrate-rich Vegetables”.

Leafy green vegetables are a vital component of a heart-healthy diet. Recent research from Edith Cowan University in Australia has unveiled the remarkable benefits of daily consumption of a cup of nitrate-rich vegetables, which is associated with a 15 to 26% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. This includes lower blood pressure and a decreased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure.

Nitrate-rich vegetables encompass a variety of leafy and non-leafy options, including spinach, arugula, lettuce, kale, cabbage, beets, and fennel. These greens are abundant in nitrates, which elevate nitric oxide levels in the body.

Nitric oxide is crucial for heart health, as it relaxes blood vessels, enhances blood flow, restores endothelial functioning, and lowers blood pressure.

Furthermore, leafy green vegetables are also rich in vitamin K, chlorophyll, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, making them some of the best foods to heal your heart and reverse heart disease. When purchasing vegetables, always try to go organic.

Moving on, we have Number 8: “Organ Meats”.

Organ meat, such as beef heart and liver, is often referred to as a “carnivore superfood” due to its exceptional nutritional value, particularly for heart health.

Beef liver, is a rich source of vital minerals, L-carnitine, and B vitamins, including B1, B2, B6, folate, and B12, all of which play a crucial role in protecting, strengthening, and stabilizing heart muscle cells.

These B vitamins also aid in lowering homocysteine levels in the blood. High homocysteine is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis, blood clots, and blood vessel blockages.

Additionally, heart and liver are one of the best sources of CoQ10, an antioxidant that increases energy uptake in heart cells, lowers blood pressure and inflammation, and improves vascular function.

When purchasing organ meat, go for high-quality grass-finished or pasture-raised organ meat.

Coming into our Number 7, we have: “Nuts and Seeds”.

Packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, plant sterols, and fiber, nuts and seeds are formidable allies in your quest for a healthy heart.

These nutritional powerhouses not only lower inflammation and harmful cholesterol but could also reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by as much as 23%.

Each type of nut and seed possesses different kinds of vitamins, amino acids, and minerals, including vitamin E, L-arginine, and magnesium.

Studies have shown that vitamin E has the potential to halt plaque development in the arteries and reduce the risk of stroke.

Additionally, L-arginine, an amino acid that converts to nitric oxide in the body, has been associated with lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

And magnesium helps maintain a steady heart rhythm and normal blood pressure.

Nuts and seeds high in magnesium include brazil nuts, chia seeds, cashews, almonds, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, and pistachios. When buying nuts and seeds, always opt for fresh, organic varieties without added ingredients.

Next, at Number 6, we have: “Grass-finished Beef”.

The conventional advice to limit red meat consumption as a means to prevent or reduce heart disease has been a long-standing recommendation. However, this guidance has been influenced by the low-fat movement, leading to a common misconception.

In reality, grass-finished beef, with its impressive nutrient profile, can be a valuable addition to a heart-healthy diet. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), both of which are essential for cardiovascular health.

Additionally, grass-finished beef contains L-carnitine, which has been found to be critical in heart health.

A review study analyzing the benefits of L-carnitine on the heart revealed significant reductions in all-cause mortality, angina symptoms, and ventricular arrhythmias.

When considering beef, it is advisable to prioritize grass-finished beef and to avoid beef that is not organic and comes from grain-fed animals. This is due to the potential presence of growth hormones, antibiotics, GMOs, and toxic pesticides in non-organic, grain-fed beef.

Moving on, at Number 5, we have: “Citrus Fruits”.

Citrus fruits, including oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits, offer a vibrant array of health benefits.

Packed with vitamin C, these fruits act as powerful antioxidants, safeguarding your arteries from free radical damage and supporting the production of collagen, a vital component for artery repair and maintenance.

Moreover, citrus fruits are abundant in hesperidin, a flavonoid that stimulates the production of nitric oxide, thus promoting blood vessel function and reducing inflammation.

This natural compound, combined with the fruits’ potassium and pectin fiber content, can help stabilize cholesterol levels and reduce blood pressure, further enhancing their cardiovascular benefits.

When selecting citrus fruits, opt for organic varieties and limit citrus juice consumption to homemade options in moderation.

Next up, is our Number 4: “Olive Oil”.

A comprehensive study, spanning over two decades, revealed that adding more than half a tablespoon of olive oil into your daily diet could potentially lower your risk of cardiovascular disease by 15% and coronary artery disease by 21%.

These remarkable benefits are attributed to the high levels of antioxidants and monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, found in this heart-protective oil.

To fully embrace the benefits of olive oil, it is recommended to opt for extra-virgin, first, cold-pressed olive oil in a dark bottle, as this represents the highest-quality option.

Coming into the top 3, we have: “Garlic”.

Garlic consumption has been linked to improved circulation, increased blood flow, and a reduction in inflammation.

Notably, a 2017 study published in the Journal of Hypertension revealed that a higher habitual intake of allium vegetables, including garlic, was associated with a substantial 64% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Furthermore, another study demonstrated that taking garlic extract for 24 weeks was as effective as atenolol, a common prescription beta blocker, at reducing blood pressure.

To maximize the benefits of garlic, always crush, chop, smash, or press it before use. Doing this starts the chemical reaction that makes allicin, the biologically active compound found in garlic.

Coming into Number 2, we have: “Berries”.

Blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries are rich in potent antioxidants such as anthocyanins, which combat free radicals in your body and reduce chronic inflammation.

Research suggests that incorporating berries into your diet could lead to lower blood pressure, improved cholesterol levels, and reduced insulin resistance, thus making them top contenders in the fight against heart disease.

It’s worth noting that avocados and pomegranates, which are also technically classified as berries, offer proven heart-healthy benefits.

Avocados have been shown to lower the most dangerous type of cholesterol, small, dense LDL, and are abundant in potassium, which can decrease blood pressure and reduce the risk of stroke.

Furthermore, a study revealed that drinking one ounce of pomegranate juice daily for one year led to a remarkable 30% reduction in atherosclerotic plaque in patients with severe carotid artery blockages. This underscores the potential of these fruits to significantly benefit your cardiovascular health.

And at Number 1, is one food that most people ignore: “Fermented Foods”.

Emerging research suggests that a balanced and thriving gut microbiome can play a pivotal role in preventing the development of cardiovascular issues and maintaining robust heart health. To nurture a healthy gut, it’s essential to embrace a diverse organic diet, replete with prebiotics and probiotic-rich foods.

Prebiotics are found in an array of foods such as bananas, kiwifruit, legumes, garlic, oats, and artichokes, while fermented delights like natto, kimchi, sauerkraut, and coconut kefir, serve as fantastic sources of probiotics, fostering your gut’s health and harmony.

These fermented foods are also rich in vitamin K2, a nutrient that not only prevents calcium from depositing in the arteries but also promotes the removal of calcium from existing plaques. By activating the protein, MGP, vitamin K2 moves calcium away from the blood vessels and kidneys to the bones and teeth where it is needed.

To get enough vitamin K2 daily, as well as all the other nutrients mentioned in this video, you’ll have to consume multiple varieties of whole foods and many bowls a day. To see an easy solution to get all the nutrients you need every day, to naturally banish plaque from your circulatory system, enjoy a surge of natural energy that lasts, and keep your ticker in tip-top shape, check out our recommended product below.

It’s important to remember that while adding these foods to your diet can keep your ticker healthy, it’s equally essential to eliminate or minimize the consumption of foods that can harm your cardiovascular system. See the link below for a list of harmful inflammatory foods to avoid, and their healthy substitutes.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/gut-inflammation-foods/,2 Absolutely WORST Gut Inflammation Foods You’ll Want to Avoid,"Many people think that gut issues are triggered by external factors such as bacterial infections (like H. pylori, which leads to ulcers), or food sensitivities (which cause irritable bowel syndrome).

However, it’s important to understand that gut dysfunction often originates internally. The most visible causes may be external, but the real problem starts on the inside long before you notice symptoms on the outside.

Specifically, when you have inadequate levels of healthy bacteria in the gut flora (also known as gut dysbiosis), this can lead to a host of problems including weight gain and difficulty with weight management, as well as digestive, skin, and mental wellbeing-related issues.

In this video, we take a close look at the two worst inflammatory foods that cause a poorly functioning digestive system. These two foods can create issues years before you ever notice symptoms, and by the time the problem becomes noticeable, your gut may already be in bad shape.

That’s why it’s critical that you take action to avoid and eliminate them from your life starting NOW, so you can get your intestinal health back under control and restore your gut to full, healthy function.

Let’s begin with the first food: Wheat-based Foods & Gluten.

Did you know that the wheat-based products we commonly consume, like breads, bagels, cereals, muffins, and other baked goods, are a primary cause of gastrointestinal issues?

This happens because of two reasons you might not expect.
Firstly, some people may experience digestive discomfort due to a sensitivity or allergy to gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

When a person has celiac disease, which is an autoimmune condition, their body treats gluten as a threat and attacks healthy cells.

But there’s another deeper root cause to consider. Modern-day wheat often contains herbicides, particularly Glyphosate.

Studies have shown that this chemical can kill off the beneficial bacteria in your gut, leading to various sensitivities and gut imbalances when consuming wheat and gluten products that have been contaminated.

If you have problems digesting gluten or wheat products, you may notice symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, headaches, fatigue, depression, anxiety, joint and muscle pain, and brain fog.

While these symptoms show up in places other than your gut, anything that triggers such a reaction in your body can significantly affect your gut function.

Inflammation in the intestines can contribute to digestive problems, and you may experience increased intestinal permeability, commonly known as “leaky gut.”

Let’s talk briefly about Leaky Gut.

Normally, the tight junctions in your gut lining only allow tiny nutrients to pass through and keep out larger molecules like toxins, microbes, and undigested food particles.

When larger molecules from the gastrointestinal tract break open the tight junctions and escape into your bloodstream, leaky gut happens, and further exacerbates digestive issues.

Your immune system marks these molecules as pathogens and attacks them, sparking a chain reaction of inflammation.

Symptoms occur as a result of your body’s immune response to these invaders. They include:

Digestive issues such as gas, bloating, diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Food allergies or food intolerances
Brain fog, difficulty concentrating, ADD, or ADHD
Mood imbalances such as depression and anxiety
Skin issues such as acne, rosacea, or eczema
Seasonal allergies or asthma
Hormonal imbalances such as irregular periods, PMS, or PCOS
Diagnosis of an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, lupus, psoriasis, or celiac disease
Diagnosis of chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia
Now, the number one cause of leaky gut syndrome is gluten.

When consumed, gluten triggers the release of a protein called zonulin by the cells lining the gut. Zonulin weakens the tight junctions in the intestinal barrier, leading to a leaky gut.

Apart from gluten, other foods that promote inflammation, like dairy, and toxic substances, such as sugar and alcohol, can also increase intestinal permeability.

The second reason you’ll want to avoid wheat is because it spikes blood sugar like no other carbohydrate, and this can lead to gastrointestinal issues.

We all know that refined carbs like white bread and pasta can easily cause blood sugar to spike. And if your blood sugar levels, and insulin levels, stay consistently too high, it can lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

What you may not know, is that wheat contains an unusual type of carbohydrate called Amylopectin-A, which spikes blood sugar higher than even table sugar. In fact, studies show that amylopectin-A from wheat raises your blood sugar more than almost any other carbohydrate source based on blood sugar response testing.

High blood sugar levels over time dramatically increase Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) in your body which speeds up the aging process. These nasty compounds cause wrinkled skin, and damage to your organs, your joints, and your gut. This is why diabetics look older than they really are.

So, how does high blood sugar levels cause gastrointestinal problems?

Firstly, it can affect the nerves that control the muscles in your digestive system. This can result in delayed gastric emptying, also known as gastroparesis. The slow movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine causes uncomfortable symptoms such as bloating, nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of fullness.

Secondly, it can damage the blood vessels that supply the intestines, leading to a condition called diabetic enteropathy. This can cause symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and bloating.

Lastly, it can impair the function of the pancreas, which produces enzymes necessary for digestion. This can lead to insufficient breakdown of food and poor absorption of nutrients, contributing to symptoms like indigestion, malabsorption, and weight loss.

If you have diabetes, it’s important to prevent and manage digestive complications by stabilizing your blood sugar levels.

And one way to control blood sugar levels is to cut all highly processed wheat products and gluten out of your diet.

Next, if you think wheat is bad enough, wait till you learn about Number One.

The Number One worst food that causes gut inflammation is: Ultra-Processed Foods

Ultra-processed foods or UPF are industrial food formulations that have more than 5 ingredients. Many wheat-based food products are in fact UPF.

UPF are less filling and raise your blood sugar higher than minimally processed foods. They are often high in pro-inflammatory refined sugars, hydrogenated oils and fats, salt, and artificial substances like flavors, colors, sweeteners, emulsifiers, and other additives, while being low in protein and fiber.

Many of them are snack foods and promote mindless eating, replacing the need or desire for a proper meal. The additives in UPF are used to mimic the taste, texture, and appearance of foods that are either unprocessed or lightly processed, or to hide any undesirable aspects of the final product.

UPF makes up 73% of the US food supply, according to Northeastern University’s Network Science Institute.

Regular consumption of UPF can lead to weight gain, obesity, and an increased risk of chronic diseases including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

UPF contribute significantly to a leaky gut. They disrupt the gut flora, leading to gut inflammation, digestive issues, and a weakened immune system.

In addition, UPF have been associated with higher levels of inflammation in the body, which can contribute to the development of various health conditions.

Despite these health risks, the average adult in the US gets 60% of their daily calories from UPF, while in Canada the figure is 48%. This happens largely because ultra-processed foods are addictive.

Now, let’s take a look at the ingredients commonly found in UPF that cause gut dysbiosis.

There are two types of ingredients that classify UPF: industrial food substances and cosmetic additives.

Food substances include processed protein and fiber (such as whey powder or inulin), maltodextrin (an intensely processed carbohydrate), sugar and sweeteners (high fructose corn syrup or glucose syrup), vegetable oils and trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils).

Cosmetic additives are used to enhance the texture, taste or color of foods. They make ultra-processed foods more appealing and delicious, therefore contributing to their over-consumption.

Examples, are colors and flavors (both natural and artificial), non-caloric sweeteners (includes aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, and stevia), flavor enhancers (such as yeast extract and MSG), and thickeners and emulsifiers (which modify a food’s texture, like soy lecithin).

Even though UPF are considered to be the least healthy within the overall food classification system, many people might not realize that the packaged foods they would normally consider healthy are ultra-processed.

Let’s take a closer look at the list of common UPF.

Some UPF are easily recognized as unhealthy food or junk food. They include:

Soda pop, fruit drinks and energy drinks
Candies and cake mixes
Packaged snacks (like potato chips and cheese crackers)
Instant soups, sauces, noodles
Pre-prepared frozen foods like pies and pizza
Fried chicken and French fries
Chicken and fish nuggets, sausages, hot dogs, burgers, and other reconstituted meat products

As a side note, ham, bacon and cured meats are classified as processed, and not ultra processed, because they are not reconstituted or liquified meats.

Other packaged foods that might not be immediately recognized as ultra-processed include:

Sweetened breakfast cereals, including instant oatmeal
Protein and muesli bars and balls
Some plant-based ‘milks’ like almond milk, coconut milk, and rice milk
Baked goods like cakes, cookies, muffins and bagels
Packaged breads and buns; these are the cheaper brands that are plastic wrapped and sliced
Sweetened or flavoured yogurts
Pre-prepared pasta and stir-fry sauces
Margarine and non-dairy spreads

Some types of UPF may give the illusion of being healthier, due to having fewer industrial ingredients or being lower in sugar. But these are not necessarily less detrimental to our health.

Supermarkets are stocked full of ultra-processed foods, so it can be difficult to avoid them entirely. However, to improve your gut health, always choose unprocessed or minimally processed foods.

(Updated Dec 31 2023)

Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition caused by too much sugar in the diet. It often occurs in overweight and inactive individuals, but can caused by a multitude of factors. Currently, the disease affects roughly 9 percent of the global population (3).

The bodies of diabetics are either unable to produce enough insulin to keep up with their blood sugar levels or their body’s cells no longer recognize and utilize the insulin created.

Losing Weight Changes Everything

Weight loss has always been an important part of treating and reversing diabetes. This study discovered that losing weight is important because high fat levels in the pancreas (the organ which produces insulin) influences the onset of diabetes.

In fact, previous work conducted by these researchers demonstrated that going on a very low calorie diet can remove the fat which is clogging up the pancreas, thus allowing normal insulin secretion to be restored (2).

“What is interesting is that regardless of your present body weight and how you lose weight, the critical factor in reversing your Type 2 diabetes is losing that 1 gram of fat from the pancreas,” said Taylor, the lead researcher of the study.

Study Details

The study followed 18 obese participants with type 2 diabetes, as well as non-diabetic control group, both before and after gastric bypass surgery.

Using a modern and sensitive MRI scan, the researchers revealed that the diabetics had abnormally high levels of fat built up in their pancreas, even when compared to other obese people without type 2 diabetes.

In the non-diabetics participants, who had never had elevated fat levels in their pancreas in the first place, the amount of fat in the organ stayed the same after surgery. But the participants with type-2 diabetes lost on average 1.2 percent fat from the organ, which took them back down to healthy levels.

Following the surgery the diabetics were able to come off their medication, and, incredibly, their insulin secretion levels returned to normal, meaning that their diabetes had been successfully reversed. via ScienceAlert

“This comes across as a simple explanation for type 2 diabetes and for patients it will be a strong motivating factor in losing weight” said Taylor.

“But it also presents a very clear target for future research. If you can block the uptake of fat by the pancreas, you can reverse the disease.” (5)

https://dailyhealthpost.com/clutter-causes-anxiety/,There Is Scientific Evidence That Clutter Causes Anxiety,"Clutter, by definition is ‘a collection of things laying around in an untidy mass.’ According to psychologist Kahleen Vohs, people in messy rooms draw more creativity and are quicker at solving creative problems. (Updated Dec 29 2023)

This could explain why so many great minds never bothered keeping their work desks tidy. Having a little bit of mess around reminds us that the world is not an ordered and structured thing, but something that contains chaos and unknowns. This jumpstarts our brains into creativity mode and makes us remember that it is OK to be a little bit unconventional and think creatively.

Take Einstein’s work desk for example:

Einstein’s work desk

What that picture shows is complete chaos. Not an inch of Einstein’s desk is free of paper. Books, manuscripts, magazines, and envelopes are everywhere (alone with what looks like a cookie jar). The same goes for the shelves. One shelf holds neatly arrayed journals, but elsewhere are piles and piles of papers.

It’s a mess, but it worked for him. It also worked for Mark Twain, Steve Jobs and many others.

Steve Jobs

But the cluttered life isn’t for everyone. Some research is suggesting how clutter might have a detrimental impact on a person’s mental well-being. If the clutter effect is not boosting your creativity, then it’s probably causing you undue stress.

How Clutter Impacts Your Mind

Researchers at the Princeton University Neuroscience Institute (1) found that living or working in a cluttered environment can inhibit your ability to focus and process information. This can lead to stress, feelings of being overwhelmed and more often not, anxiety.

“Multiple stimuli present in the visual field at the same time compete for neural representation by mutually suppressing their evoked activity throughout visual cortex, providing a neural correlate for the limited processing capacity of the visual system.”

In other words, being surrounded by clutter can limit your ability to focus. Whether you are aware of it or not, this sensory overload distracts you from the task at hand. As a result, you may feel as though you’re never able to finish what you set out to do. With time, the number of incomplete tasks keep on increasing and that slowly wears you down mentally.

6 Reasons Why Clutter Causes Stress
Clutter makes it more difficult to relax, both physically and mentally.
Clutter constantly signals to our brains that our work is never done.
Clutter makes us anxious because we’re never sure what it’s going to take to get through to the bottom of the pile.
Clutter creates feelings of guilt (“I should be more organized”) and embarrassment, especially when others unexpectedly drop by our homes or work spaces.
Clutter inhibits productivity by invading.
Clutter frustrates us by preventing us from locating what we need quickly (e.g. files and paperwork lost in the “pile” or keys swallowed up by the clutter). 
How to Declutter Without Feeling Stressed

If you the clutter effect isn’t for you, here are some things you can do at your own pace. Just make sure to remember that it’s not about decluttering everything in one go, but to focus on one thing at a time so that you can clear up your space and have some peace of mind.

Streamline/declutter using the Four-box method – Start with four boxes: trash, give away, keep, or relocate. Go through as many items as you can and filter them accordingly.

Use designated spaces – Keep things where they serve a purpose. For example, keep work supplies in the office or on your desk, hair products and beauty essentials should be in the bathroom, and so on. This will help prevent clutter from building up in the first place.

Sort out your papers –  Nothing causes more stress than piles and piles of papers. Use folders or binders to keep your papers like bills, invoices, notes, etc. organized.

Take the 12-12-12 challenge – If you have kids, you’ll want to make cleaning and decluttering fun; like a game and not something you need to worry about or dread. For this challenge, assign everyone with a simple task of locating 12 items to throw away, 12 items to donate, and 12 items to be returned to their proper place. This is a fun and exciting way to quickly organize 36 things in your house.

Clearing up the clutter around you can not only help increase your focus and help you feel secure and satisfied, but it can also calm your mind, help improve your mental and emotional health, and help to prevent anxiety.

After a long day at work, home is a place where you go back to relax. It’s ok to thrive in a cluttered environment at work, but you definitely don’t want to bring that mess home! Keep you home clutter free and it will help keep your sanity as well as prevent anxiety.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-to-detox-your-kidneys/,Absolutely BEST Foods to Detox Your Kidneys,"When it comes to your diet, unless you know you have kidney problems, you probably aren’t thinking too much about which foods are good or bad for your kidneys. And even if you do have kidney disease or other kidney issues, you may not know or follow the best diet for your kidneys every day.

How strict your meal plan needs to be depends on the stage of your kidney disease. It’s important to understand what you should and shouldn’t eat to help your kidneys.

Your kidneys are vital organs that help balance fluids and electrolytes in your body and remove waste from your blood.

If you have kidney disease, your kidneys are not functioning fully. Eating nutrients your kidneys have trouble processing, like protein, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, can damage your renal organs further.

Unfortunately, not following a healthy diet for managing kidney disease can cause other health risks too, like higher blood pressure, more protein in your urine, weaker bones and heart disease.

This is because when your kidneys aren’t working as well as they should, waste and extra fluid build up in your body over time, and can cause health problems.

A kidney-friendly meal plan can limit certain minerals and fluids you eat and drink. This helps prevent waste and fluid from building up and causing issues.

So how do you know what to eat for a kidney-friendly meal?

In this video, we’ll highlight 10 of the best foods to detox your kidneys and improve renal health. We’ll also mention the worst foods you should avoid.

If you have kidney issues, be sure to consult your healthcare provider to learn what foods and drinks are advised for you, based on your specific kidney problem and treatment plan.

Let’s begin with Number 10. Fish and Meat.

So when it comes to maintaining a balanced diet for your kidneys, you can definitely include some meat and fish. They provide high-quality protein which is important for repairing and building tissues, especially when your kidneys are a little damaged and need to heal.

This is especially important for individuals dealing with stages 3 and 4 of chronic kidney disease (CKD). They need to consume between 60 to 80 grams of protein daily to get the essential amino acids for kidney repair – without overloading the kidneys with nitrogen waste.

Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, sardines, and herring that are rich in omega-3s can be particularly beneficial because of their anti-inflammatory properties. Research has actually shown that omega-3s can help decrease protein in the urine, which is a common issue with kidney disease.

In contrast, red meat should be eaten in moderation, since it contains saturated fats, which can worsen kidney problems if you eat too much.

Opt for leaner meats like skinless chicken and watch your portions to make sure you’re getting the nutrients you need without overloading your system with excess waste.

Also remember that processed meats tend to be high in sodium. Instead, choose fresh cuts of meat seasoned with herbs like garlic or ginger for extra flavor without adding extra salt.

If you plan to supplement with fish oil to reduce inflammation, make sure you choose a high quality Omega-3 fish oil, like the one we recommend below.

Next up, we have Number 9. Egg White.

Egg whites stand out in a kidney-healthy diet. They’ve got awesome protein but not a lot of phosphorus like whole eggs do. When you eat just the whites, your body can use the protein without making as much extra waste. Think of them as clean fuel that won’t overload your renal system. They’re versatile and can be added to various dishes or eaten alone, giving you many options to keep your diet kidney-friendly while still enjoying delicious foods.

Moving on, at Number 8 we have Olive Oil.

Healthy fats aren’t just good for your heart; they’re essential for your kidneys too. Olive oil is a healthy source of vitamin E and mostly unsaturated fat. It’s also phosphorus-free, making it a suitable option for people with kidney disease. Most of the fat in olive oil is oleic acid, which has anti-inflammatory properties. What’s more, monounsaturated fats are stable at high temperatures, making olive oil a healthy choice for cooking. Opt for extra virgin olive oil for salads, marinades, and sautéing because they’re higher in antioxidants.

Coming up next is Number 7. Cabbage.

Cabbage is tasty and cheap, but more than that, it’s packed with nutrients that are good for your kidneys and digestion. There’s green cabbage, red cabbage, napa cabbage, savoy cabbage, bok choy and more. In cabbage you get nutrients like calcium, vitamin K, vitamin C, fiber, manganese, vitamin B6, and folate.

This leafy green helps to maintain healthy red blood cell production, which is important if you’ve got kidney problems. Plus it’s low in phosphorus and potassium, two minerals you need to watch if you have kidney disease.
You can eat cabbage raw, steamed, or fermented into sauerkraut; there are so many ways to make it part of your meals.

Let’s move on to our Number 6. Apple Cider Vinegar.

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) helps prevent oxidative stress on the kidneys by boosting your body’s antioxidants. ACV also helps balance your blood sugar levels and lowers your blood pressure. All of this creates an optimal environment for your kidneys to stay healthy. The citric acid in ACV can even help dissolve kidney stones. Drinking it regularly helps flush toxins out of your kidneys. Just be sure not to overdo it. You’ll also want to dilute ACV with some water before drinking.

Coming into Number 5, we have Cauliflower and Broccoli.

Cauliflower and broccoli are friends of your kidneys. These cruciferous vegetables are rich in antioxidants, including vitamin C and K, calcium, iron, and magnesium. On top of providing anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial effects, they are excellent sources of fiber. They work behind the scenes to help your kidneys repair damage brought on by everyday wear and tear, or more serious conditions.

Eating more fiber can help people with kidney problems. Fiber acts preventatively on some of the risk factors associated with kidney issues. It helps improve the balance of good bacteria in your gut, and reduces excess acidity and inflammation in the blood and tissues.

Include cauliflower and broccoli in your meals regularly! They’re versatile enough to be steamed, roasted, or tossed into stews and soups.

Moving on, we have Number 4. Berries.

Berries, especially blueberries, are a great source of natural antioxidants. They’re also ideal for a kidney diet because they are low in phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and helps reduce inflammation.

These small but mighty fruits pack a lot of punch in supporting your urinary tract health.

Raspberries, for example, offer the sweetness you crave while keeping sugar content low at just five grams per 100g serving. This makes them an ideal choice for maintaining balanced blood sugar levels and promoting overall kidney health.

Cranberries are often associated with urinary tract health because they can help prevent bacteria from sticking to the walls of the urinary system. However, it’s important to watch out for added sugars when consuming cranberry products.

Coming into our top 3, we have Number 3. Bell Peppers.

Bell peppers offer a tasty crunch along with low levels of potassium, phosphorus, and sodium, which is precisely what you need when managing stages 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease. Packed with vitamin C and vitamin A yet low in sugar, bell peppers are excellent for maintaining kidney health.

They bring color to your plates and essential vitamins to support your immune system. Those with kidney disease may have a compromised immune system, so the more of these vitamins, the better. You can use bell peppers in all sorts of recipes like stuffed peppers, fajitas, omelets, dips, salads or sandwiches.

Moving on to Number 2, we have Pineapple.

Pineapple can make a sweet treat for people with kidney conditions. It’s lower in phosphorus, potassium, and sodium than oranges, bananas, or kiwis. Pineapple is also a good source of fiber and vitamin A, and it contains the highest concentration of bromelain. Bromelain is an amazing enzyme that reduces levels of inflammation. It’s also effective at digesting large proteins that may be clogging your organs. This helps get your blood flowing smoothly again through your organs.

And at Number 1, we have Garlic, ginger, and turmeric.

Garlic, ginger, and turmeric pack a powerful punch for kidney health. These three natural healers boast anti-inflammatory properties along with anti-bacterial effects that can help cleanse your body.

Garlic is known to combat urinary tract infections, while ginger stimulates urine production, flushing out toxins more efficiently. Turmeric can not only protect, but also potentially reverse existing damage to your kidneys, thanks to its impressive antioxidant capabilities.

Include minced garlic in your pasta sauce, grate some fresh ginger into a stir-fry, or sprinkle turmeric on roasted vegetables. Your kidneys will thank you!

In addition to these kidney-friendly foods, there are certain foods you should avoid, if you have already developed kidney disease.

To detox your kidneys, avoid refined foods, junk food, high-sugar foods, and high-carb foods, as these are all damaging to the kidneys.

If you are in stage 3 and later of CKD, you must limit your consumption of foods high in potassium, as well as phosphorus, sodium, and protein, since you already have elevated levels of these.

The foods to avoid, include dried beans and peas, dairy products, nuts, bran products, bananas, red meat, processed meat, sweet potatoes and white potatoes, tomatoes, and avocado.

However, it is important to eat fruits and vegetables in moderation to reduce inflammation, and treat the underlying cause of kidney disease.

Now, the three most common causes of CKD are #1: diabetes, #2: hypertension, and #3: inflammation in the kidneys.

All these conditions are interrelated, as the core underlying factor is chronic low-grade inflammation. To get chronic inflammation under control, you should eat an anti-inflammatory diet.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-heal-kidneys-naturally-with-baking-soda/,How to Support Your Kidneys Naturally Using 1 Teaspoon of Baking Soda,"There’s a lot of items in your kitchen that could easily replace those kept in your medicine cabinet. Although you may already know about baking soda’s incredible uses, you’ve probably never heard of this one before: Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) can actually help your kidneys heal and function properly. (Updated Dec 15, 2023)

Kidneys And Baking Soda

Your endocrine system produces hormones and enzymes to help breakdown food into nutrients your body can absorb. It also signals your pancreas and kidneys to produce sodium bicarbonate, which plays a role in neutralizing acidity.

The pancreas is primarily responsible for the production of enzymes and bicarbonate necessary to neutralize acids produced during the normal digestion of food. This bicarbonate is also produced by the kidneys to protect themselves from acid damage.

Kidneys monitor and control the acidity or “acid-base” (pH) balance of the blood. Excess acid, or acidosis, causes inflammation and is considered to contribute to many diseases and to the aging process.

Therefore, if the blood is too acidic, the kidney makes bicarbonate to restore the bloods pH balance. If the blood is too alkaline, then the kidney excretes bicarbonate into the urine to restore the balance. via DrSircus

Individuals suffering from kidney failure have to go through dialysis, a process by which the blood is filtered outside the body. This helps restore healthy blood ph levels, remove excess fluid and prevent toxic overload.

What Studies Are Saying

The US National Health Institute has conducted experiments that show that kidney dialysis using bicarbonate agents have more restorative properties than standard dialysis treatments.

In addition, British scientists at the Royal Hospital in London conducted a study on the relationship between bicarbonate and slowing the progression of kidney disease.

Out of 134 test patients with advanced kidney disease and metabolic acidosis, a randomly selected small group was given a tablet daily, made of a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for a year. The kidney function of these patients declined at a rate that’s expected with normal aging and were less likely to require dialysis. This group had a 2/3 slower decline of health than the untreated group. Patients taking sodium bicarbonate were also less likely to develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.  via ScienceDaily

Professor Magdi Yaqoob, lead researcher of the British study, explained in a press release:

“It’s amazing. This is the first randomized controlled study of its kind. A simple remedy like sodium bicarbonate, when used appropriately, can be very effective.”

“This study shows baking soda can be useful for people with kidney failure. That is, as long as the dose is regulated and under supervision…What happens is the inflammation of kidney is prevented by baking soda because a chemical reaction takes place limiting ammonia production in the kidney.”

Dr. SK Hariachar, a nephrologist who oversees the Renal Hypertension Unit in Tampa Florida stated, upon seeing the research on bicarbonate and kidney disease:

“I am glad to see confirmation of what we have known for so long.  I have been treating my patients with bicarbonate for many years in attempts to delay the need for dialysis, and now we finally have a legitimate study to back us up. Not only that, we have the added information that some people already on dialysis can reverse their condition with the use of sodium bicarbonate.”

How To Take Sodium Bicarbonate (SB):

This health protocol is mostly for those in danger of developing kidney disease.

To avoid injury do not take sodium bicarbonate until the powder is completely dissolved and it is very important not to take baking soda when overly full from food or drink.

Day 1

Start with 1/2 tsp of SB sublingual (dissolved under your tongue).

Day 2-5

Take 1/2 tsp of SB and 1/2 tsp of sodium chloride (cooking salt) and mix it in 1.5 liters of drinking water. Take daily for 2-3 days.

Day 5+

Reduce your daily dosage to 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1/3 tsp salt dissolved in drinking water. It you begin to feel sick or nauseous,  only take the SB sublingually.

As with any other health decision, always talk to your doctor before beginning any sodium bicarbonate treatment.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"December 15, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/see-what-your-feet-can-tell-you-about-your-blood-pressure-thyroid-and-arthritis-risk/,"What Your Feet Can Reveal About Your Blood Pressure, Thyroid And Arthritis Risk","Did you know your feet can reveal almost anything you want to know about your overall health? In fact, there is an entire therapy based on this premise called reflexology. Poor feet health can be a signal that other, bigger health problems may be looming. (Updated Dec 15 2023)

So next time you kick off your shoes, take a look at your feet—they are likely telling you a lot more than you bargained for.

1. Cold Feet

Consistently cold feet can be an indication of a thyroid issue. Since the thyroid gland regulates temperature and metabolism, large variances in temperatures can be a sign that your thyroid is underactive. Chronic cold feet can also be a sign of poor circulation.

2. Numb or Tingling Feet

We’ve all experienced what it’s like to have our feet “fall asleep” at some point in our lives, but when they’re chronically numb, it can be a symptom of damage to your peripheral nervous system— peripheral neuropathy.

This is something you should get checked immediately as chronic numbness can be serious and caused by several things including diabetes and alcohol abuse.

3. Red, White or Blue Toes and/or Feet

While these colors may be suitable for flags or tablecloths, when it comes to your feet, the red, white and blue are not a good thing—it can indicate Raynaud’s disease (a rare disorder of the blood vessels, usually in the fingers and toes.)

If you do see a variance in your feet and toes, contact your physician to make sure there isn’t anything serious.

4. Cramping

The odd foot cramp is nothing serious. But if you find your feet cramping regularly there may be several reasons, such as being dehydrated or you have been working out too hard.

Cramping feet may also be an indication of a deficiency in potassium, calcium, or magnesium. If that is the case, you can try stretching your feet before going to bed and adding more calcium and magnesium rich foods to your diet.

You can also add more potassium by eating more bananas. If the situation doesn’t improve, you should consult a physician.

5. Dry, Scaly Skin

Excessively dry skin on your feet, may be a sign of a fungal infection known as Athlete’s foot. While we all get a little dry skin on our feet now and then, especially in the dry, cold winter months, Athlete’s foot may start out as dry, itchy skin but the skin will eventually become inflamed and blister.

You will need to get an anti-fungal medication, whether it is something more natural like tea tree oil or grapefruit-seed extract (GSE) or a prescription from your doctor.

In the interim, try to allow your feet to air out as much as possible, but also be aware that it is infectious so never walk barefooted in public until you are sure the infection is cured.

6. Thick, Yellow Toenails

Thickening toenails that also change color and separate from the skin are a sure sign of a fungal infection. It is also worth noting that this type of infection is also common in people with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and other immune deficiencies, so it is always a good idea to speak to your doctor.

7. Pitted Nails

Little pits or puncture-like depressions on the surface of your toenails can be caused by a disruption of the growth of your nail at the “nail plate.” Typically half of all people with psoriasis will have this.

8. Your Big Toe is Getting Bigger

Gout is a form of arthritis caused by excessive uric acid. This surplus uric acid forms in cooler temperatures, so in the body, that is your big toe.

If you suddenly notice that your big toe is getting bigger, there is a chance you may have gout, in which case, you should speak with your doctor as it can become serious.

9. Sore Toe Joints

We don’t often think about the joints in our toes, until they become sore, of course. But if this pain is happening more consistently, it may be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Typically RA starts in the smaller joints like your finger, wrist and toes, causing frequent aching and swelling that feels warm to the touch.

10. Cuts or Sores That Don’t Heal

This can actually be a very serious situation that should be discussed with your doctor immediately. Open wounds on your feet that will not heal are a common sign of diabetes.

For people with diabetes, elevated blood glucose levels over time can result in significant nerve damage in your feet. This nerve damage can cause your feet to be less sensitive so you may not notice an ulceration or wound on the bottom of your foot until it becomes infected, at which point it is a very serious matter.

This is why many diabetics end up with amputations, so be vigilant about any open wounds that do not heal.

11. Spoon-Shaped Toenails

Concave toenails typically result from a condition called Koilonychias. It can also signify anemia, so it is best to have it checked.

12. Sharp Heel Pain

Sharp pain in your heel can indicate “plantar fasciitis,” which is an inflammation of a thick band of tissue that connects your heel bone to your toes’ connective tissue along the bottom of your foot (often called jogger’s heel.)

Typically, you will find the pain is localized to your heel and may worsen during the day. More than 3 million people in the US suffer from this condition at some point.

It can be helped by resting your foot as much as possible, regular icing and using a topical anti-inflammatory for the pain.

You can also limit the damage by wearing padded shoes and walking on soft surfaces where possible. Your doctor may also suggest simple exercises such as daily toe and calf stretches. This condition should improve over time.

It’s an annoying ache that can turn stairs into mountains and make a leisurely walk feel like a marathon.

But here’s the thing: over 100 million Americans suffer from chronic knee pain – you’re not alone in this! In this article, we’ll show you how to combat knee pain at any stage of life – from easy stretches to clever lifestyle tweaks.

Understanding Knee Pain: How To Combat Knee Pain At Any Stage Of Life

Knee pain is a common complaint that affects people of all ages and can be the result of an injury, such as a ruptured ligament or torn cartilage. It may also stem from medical conditions including arthritis, gout, and infections.

The knee joint’s complex structure makes it vulnerable to a variety of pains and injuries.

Muscle fatigue impairs proprioception – our body’s ability to perceive its own position in space – increasing the risk for twists and sprains. Overuse can spark inflammation in tendons while sudden movements might lead to acute injuries like meniscal tears.

Careful training helps protect this vital joint, but without proper care, or if one pushes past their limits during physical activities, they’re inviting trouble with every step.

The structure of the knee and how it can be affected

Comprised of bones like the femur, tibia, and patella, the knee joint also includes crucial ligaments and tendons that link muscles to bones.

Menisci act as shock absorbers while cartilage allows for smooth movement between the surfaces. These components all work in unison to support mobility and bear our body’s weight.

However, certain activities or conditions can disrupt this finely tuned system. Pivoting sharply during sports can tear menisci or stretch ligaments too far, leading to an ACL injury.

Knee bursitis may result from repeated pressure on the joint whereas hyperextension occurs when it bends backward unnaturally. Overuse injuries are common among athletes who jump frequently or run long distances without adequate rest or conditioning for their knee joints.

The impact of chronic inflammation on knee pain

Chronic inflammation in the knee can lead to ongoing pain and discomfort, making everyday activities a challenge. This kind of persistent swelling is often associated with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, which gradually wear down the cushioning cartilage inside your knee joint.

Without this protective layer, bones may rub directly against each other – an action that not only hurts but also increases inflammation in a vicious cycle.

Regular exercise helps manage this inflammation by strengthening the muscles around your knees, providing better support and reducing stress on the joint. Neoprene knee sleeves are a useful tool for those dealing with chronic knee issues; they improve proprioception and help handle muscle fatigue which is vital in preventing further injuries.

Wearing these supportive garments can be particularly effective for maintaining mobility without exacerbating existing pain or inflammation.

Exercises and Stretches for Knee Pain Relief

Engaging in physical activity not only helps in weight management but also strengthens muscles, reduces the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes, and contributes to mental wellness.

By incorporating low-impact exercises such as swimming or water aerobics, individuals can stay active while minimizing stress on their joints.

It is essential to focus on strengthening the surrounding muscles and improving flexibility through targeted exercises. This approach can help provide support for the knee joint despite structural problems, ultimately promoting mobility and reducing discomfort.

With consistent effort and appropriate guidance from healthcare professionals or qualified trainers, staying active can be a sustainable part of one’s lifestyle despite knee pain or other structural concerns.

Incorporating stretching into your routine

Incorporating stretching into your routine can further support knee health and overall well-being. The following are effective ways to integrate stretching into your daily activities and reduce the risk of knee pain:

Begin with gentle dynamic stretches to warm up the muscles around the knee joint, such as leg swings or lunges, to improve flexibility and mobility.
Emphasize static stretches that target key muscles involved in knee movement, such as quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves, to promote better range of motion and reduce tension in the surrounding areas.
Use foam rolling techniques to release tightness in the IT band, quadriceps, and hamstrings, facilitating better muscle function and reducing stress on the knees during physical activities.
Incorporate yoga or Pilates exercises that focus on lower body flexibility and strength to enhance balance, stability, and core engagement for improved knee support.
Implement regular sessions of proprioceptive exercises involving balance boards or unstable surfaces to enhance neuromuscular control and reduce the risk of falls or joint injuries.
Consider participating in low – impact activities like swimming or cycling that naturally promote fluid movement in the knees while also incorporating gentle stretching movements into the exercise routine.
Adopt a consistent routine for post-workout stretching to aid in muscle recovery and prevent stiffness that may contribute to knee discomfort post-exercise.
Benefits of having a well-conditioned and flexible body

Incorporating stretching into your routine is crucial for maintaining a well-conditioned and flexible body, providing numerous benefits for overall health. A flexible and conditioned body helps in preventing knee injuries by improving balance, stability, and reducing the risk of muscle fatigue.

These factors contribute to better joint health and lower the chance of chronic inflammation that can lead to knee pain or other related issues.

Well-conditioned and flexible muscles have been shown to reduce the risk of knee injuries due to their ability to absorb shock from impact while promoting healthy joint movement. Moreover, improved flexibility aids in minimizing stiffness and discomfort often associated with knee pain.

Other Ways to Combat Knee Pain
The importance of weight management

Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for reducing the load on the knees, which can alleviate knee pain and minimize the risk of developing osteoarthritis. Regular exercise not only aids in weight management but also strengthens muscles surrounding the knee, providing added support and stability to diminish discomfort.

Furthermore, shedding excess pounds reduces pressure on the lower extremities, potentially preventing further damage and improving overall mobility. It’s essential to prioritize weight management as part of a comprehensive strategy to address knee pain effectively while enhancing overall well-being.

By incorporating physical activity and adopting a healthy anti-inflammatory diet, individuals can proactively manage their weight and reduce strain on their knees, promoting long-term joint health.

Choosing appropriate footwear

The importance of weight management not only relates to reducing the load on your knees but also extends to selecting appropriate footwear. It’s essential to choose shoes that provide proper support and cushioning for your feet and joints.

Look for options with good arch support, shock absorption, and stability features. Additionally, consider shoes designed specifically for walking or running to ensure the right level of protection and comfort.

Properly fitting shoes with ample cushioning can help distribute weight more evenly across your feet, providing relief from strain on the knees.

Maintaining proper posture

Choosing appropriate footwear plays a vital role in supporting proper posture. Wearing shoes with good arch support and cushioning helps to reduce stress on the knees and promotes a balanced stance.

Also, engaging in regular strength training exercises can help develop core muscles, providing essential support for maintaining correct posture and reducing the risk of knee strain.

Lemon water, often seen as just another health fad, is more than meets the eye. In this article, we look at the real reason to drink lemon water every day, and debunk “lemon water lies”.

This citrus-infused drink isn’t just for flavor – it’s loaded with vitamin C, providing between 30 to 50 mg per lemon, which helps keep your immune system strong and acts as an antioxidant.

But there’s much more to this zesty beverage.

Lemon water brings an array of benefits that go beyond common knowledge. The potassium in lemons contributes approximately 49 mg to each glass you sip, promoting heart function and muscle control.

Plus, the vitamin C you get doesn’t stop at supporting immunity; it also plays a crucial role in producing collagen and absorbing iron—vital processes for maintaining healthy cartilage, bones, teeth, and youthful skin.

With age comes changes in digestion; lemon water steps in as a supportive digestive aid complementing stomach acids. It’s not just about what happens inside because how you feel on the outside matters too – drinking lemon water may lead to less wrinkling and healthier skin over time due to its ability to combat sun damage.

But wait—there’s even more! Lemon water functions as a natural diuretic helping your urinary tract stay clean while also offering refreshing breath by fighting mouth bacteria. Your mental health might even get a boost from regularly consuming this tangy tonic through its positive effects on mood and stress levels.

You might’ve heard claims about lemon water detoxifying or slimming down waistlines significantly; however, our bodies are already equipped with effective detox systems and lemons contain too little pectin fiber to truly influence weight loss directly.

The REAL Reason to Drink Lemon Water Every Day
Vitamin C Benefits

Vitamin C is a powerhouse nutrient, and lemon water packs a punch with 30-50 mg of this essential vitamin per serving. It acts like a shield for your body, fighting off free radicals as a potent antioxidant while keeping your immune system robust and ready to fend off common ailments like colds.

Your skin reaps the benefits too; vitamin C is key in producing collagen, which means drinking lemon water could help keep your skin less wrinkled and more radiant.

Regularly sipping on lemon water aids not just in maintaining glowing skin but also plays an important role in heart health due to its vitamin C content. It’s instrumental for healthy bones, cartilage, and teeth because it helps with iron absorption – think of it as nutrition’s helping hand ensuring that other vitamins and minerals go where they’re needed most.

Keep in mind that adults need about 65-90 milligrams of Vitamin C each day—adding lemon water to your diet can help you easily meet these recommendations without much effort.

Antioxidant properties

Let’s look at the antioxidant properties of lemon water. Antioxidants are like your body’s own personal bodyguards, defending cells against damage caused by free radicals—unstable molecules that can harm cellular structures.

This is where lemon water shines, with its supply of vitamin C acting as a potent antioxidant that not only helps safeguard your health but also strengthens your immune system.

Drinking lemon water regularly contributes to an arsenal of antioxidants within your body, essential for fighting off various ailments and maintaining overall well-being. These natural defenders promote healing and protect tissues from degradation.

Essential for immune system

Vitamin C is truly a cornerstone for your immune system. This potent nutrient supports various cellular functions of both the innate and adaptive immune system.

It enhances barrier function against pathogens and promotes oxidant scavenging activity, crucial in protecting your body from illness.

Drinking lemon water regularly may give your immune cells an extra edge by fostering improved responses to infections. Not only does it help maintain the integrity of your skin and mucous membranes, but vitamin C is also vital for the growth and repair of all bodily tissues.

From healing wounds to maintaining strong bones and teeth, this simple habit could be a game-changer for staying healthy year-round.

Necessary for collagen synthesis and iron absorption

Lemon water isn’t just a refreshing beverage; it’s a powerhouse for your health, notably for keeping your skin firm and aiding in nutrient transport. Sipping on this citrus-infused drink gives you vitamin C, which plays a critical role in collagen synthesis—the process that keeps skin strong and resilient.

Your body can’t make collagen without vitamin C, so getting enough of this vital nutrient is essential to maintaining healthy skin that can withstand the test of time.

In addition to its beauty benefits, lemon water also boosts iron absorption from foods you eat. This is particularly important because iron is crucial for carrying oxygen throughout your body and supporting energy levels.

If you often feel tired or sluggish, increasing your vitamin C intake with lemon water could help improve iron uptake—giving you the pep in your step that comes from better oxygen distribution and effective energy utilization.

Heart Health Benefits: Potassium

Your heart will thank you for adding lemon water to your daily routine, thanks to its potassium content. This essential mineral keeps your heart pumping smoothly by aiding in muscle contractions, especially important for a steady heartbeat.

Each lemon packs about 49 mg of potassium, making it a simple and refreshing way to help meet your body’s needs.

Drinking lemon water not only supports cardiac function but also sets the stage for other health benefits. Moving on from the wonders of potassium, let’s explore how this citrusy beverage can enhance the quality of your skin.

Skin Quality Improvement

Regularly sipping on this citrusy beverage helps combat signs of aging by reducing wrinkles and dryness associated with getting older. Furthermore, vitamin C aids in repairing damaged skin cells and protects against harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.

Incorporating lemon water into your daily routine could lead to visible improvements in skin texture and appearance. Its natural antioxidant properties work to fend off free radicals, notorious for causing premature aging and dull complexion.

You may notice a fresher, more radiant look as these antioxidants help keep your skin vibrant and healthy over time. So next time you reach for a drink, consider adding a slice of lemon to tap into this simple yet effective beauty booster.

Digestive Aid

Moving from the outside to the inside, lemon water not only helps your skin but also acts as a gentle aid for your digestive system. Your body’s natural stomach acids, essential for breaking down foods during digestion, diminish with age.

Adding the acidic juice of lemons to your diet can supplement these decreasing acids. This can make it easier for you to process and absorb nutrients effectively.

The citric acid in lemons assists further by working hand-in-hand with your stomach’s digestive fluids. It encourages better breakdown of food, which means less bloating and discomfort after meals.

Integrating lemon water into your daily routine might provide that extra bit of support for smoother digestion throughout the day.

Supplementing stomach acids

Lemon water helps maintain the right levels of stomach acid. As you age, your body naturally produces less stomach acid, which is essential for breaking down food efficiently and absorbing nutrients.

Drinking lemon water can be particularly beneficial because the citric acid from the lemon juice acts similarly to digestive juices. This means that sipping on lemon water could potentially help your stomach break down meals better, especially if you’re experiencing indigestion or bloating after eating.

Rather than reaching for antacids immediately when experiencing heartburn, consider trying a glass of lemon water. It might seem counterintuitive to consume something acidic when there’s already an excess causing discomfort.

However, sometimes heartburn is actually caused by too little stomach acid rather than too much. In such cases, adding acidity through lemon water could balance out your gastric environment and alleviate symptoms.

Always consult with a healthcare provider before making significant changes to how you manage conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) or heartburn though, as individual needs will vary.

Urinary Tract Health

Shifting focus from aiding digestion to supporting urinary functions, lemon water comes into play with its natural diuretic properties. This power-packed beverage helps your body flush out toxins and waste products more effectively, keeping the kidneys and bladder in top shape.

It stimulates the removal of excess fluids without the harsh side effects that come with some synthetic diuretics.

Regularly sipping on lemon water can also discourage the formation of kidney stones by increasing urine volume and pH, creating a less favorable environment for stone development.

Keep in mind that staying hydrated is crucial for urinary tract health, and incorporating lemon water into your routine boosts this benefit. The added perk of a zesty flavor might just encourage you to drink more fluids throughout the day, which further assists in keeping the urinary system clean.

Remembering to hydrate with lemon-infused water could be a simple yet effective step towards maintaining optimal kidney function and overall well-being.

Breath Freshening

Sipping on lemon water throughout the day can be your secret weapon against bad breath. The acidic nature of lemon juice successfully combats oral bacteria, which are often the culprits behind less-than-fresh breath.

It’s a simple and natural approach to maintaining dental health without relying on sugary beverages or gum that may cause tooth enamel erosion over time. Instead of reaching for mints after garlic-heavy meals, consider rinsing with some lemon-infused water to neutralize mouth odors.

Beyond keeping your breath smelling clean, lemon water plays a role in mental health as well. Moving forward, let’s explore how this tangy drink could potentially influence your mood and stress levels.

Combatting oral bacteria

Lemon water serves as a natural warrior against oral bacteria that can lead to bad breath. The acidity of lemon juice works effectively to kill the germs that hide in your mouth and along your gum line, helping you maintain fresher breath throughout the day.

Regularly drinking this citrus-infused water makes for an easy, daily routine to support oral hygiene beyond brushing and flossing.

Mental Health: Potential influence on mood and stress levels

Regular consumption of this citrus-infused drink could have a positive effect on your mood and might help to reduce stress levels.

Vitamin C, found abundantly in lemons, isn’t only good for physical health; it has been suggested that it can influence psychological well-being too.

Bearing in mind the stresses of daily life, integrating lemon water into your routine may contribute to a more balanced and calmer mindset.

Imagine starting your day with an energizing glass of lemon water that not only hydrates you but also sets a peaceful tone for what’s ahead. Its natural properties can support mental health by potentially influencing neurotransmitters linked to mood regulation.

Many people find that maintaining adequate hydration is key for staying alert and focused, which can enhance overall cognitive function and impact how you tackle challenges throughout the day.

While there’s no hard data linking lemon water to major mental health improvements, incorporating this simple habit into your routine could contribute to an overall sense of balance and positivity throughout the day.

Misconceptions and Lemon Water Lies

While lemon water is often lauded for its health benefits, common myths surrounding its effects on detoxification and weight loss may not hold up to scientific scrutiny—read on to discover what the evidence really suggests about this citrus-infused beverage.

Detoxification

Detoxification has become a popular buzzword, often associated with the benefits of drinking lemon water. However, you should know that your body is well-equipped to handle detoxification on its own.

The liver and kidneys are incredibly efficient at filtering out toxins without any special drinks or dietary supplements. These organs work tirelessly to filter out toxins from the blood, breaking them down into harmless substances that are then eliminated from the body through urine or stool.

Lemon water doesn’t have magical properties that boost this natural process.

Despite claims floating around, no drink can improve upon the work your organs already do in maintaining homeostasis. While staying hydrated is important for overall health, it’s not accurate to say lemon water provides additional detoxifying benefits beyond what plain water offers.

All fluids can assist your kidneys with flushing out waste. However, staying properly hydrated ensures that your natural detox mechanisms have what they need to keep you feeling healthy and energized without getting backed up.

So go ahead and enjoy lemon water for its flavor and vitamin C content, but don’t count on it as a detox miracle cure.

Weight Loss

Now, let’s talk about weight loss and lemon water. It’s important to set realistic expectations here. While lemons do contain pectin—a type of fiber that research suggests could help you feel full and eat less—lemon water itself only contains trace amounts of this fiber.

Therefore, the actual impact it has on your appetite is minimal at best. If you’re looking to manage your weight effectively, replacing high-calorie drinks like sugary sodas with lemon water can be a smart move.

This simple swap cuts down on added sugars and calories, potentially helping you trim some extra pounds indirectly.

However, reaching for a glass of lemon-infused water isn’t a magic solution for dropping weight quickly or effortlessly. True weight management requires a balance of nutritious eating habits and regular physical activity—it goes far beyond what any single drink can offer.

Trusting in just one food or beverage to significantly change your body shape might lead to disappointment; focus instead on building an overall healthy lifestyle that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables alongside sufficient hydration throughout the day.

Conclusion

Embrace the refreshing zest of lemon water as part of your daily routine and reap a bounty of benefits. From boosting your immune system with vitamin C to aiding in digestion, this simple drink comes packed with advantages for your heart, skin, and even mental health.

Swap out sugary beverages for lemon water and notice the subtle yet impactful ways it supports your overall well-being. Keep sipping on nature’s tangy gift; it’s more than just a taste sensation—it’s a step towards healthier you.

Digestive health

Chia seeds pack a powerful fiber punch, with up to 10 grams of fiber in just one serving. This high-fiber superstar supports your digestive health by helping food move smoothly through your gastrointestinal tract.

A balanced gut means fewer issues like constipation and an overall happier stomach.

Eating chia seeds regularly can also maintain healthy blood sugar levels after meals, reducing the risk of spikes and crashes that can wreak havoc on your system. They absorb water and expand in the stomach, increasing fullness for longer periods and potentially curbing those snack attacks that hit when you’re least expecting them.

This sense of fullness not only promotes digestive wellness but also assists with weight management efforts.

Weight loss

Integrating chia seeds into your diet could be a game-changer if you’re aiming to shed some pounds. Their high fiber content plays a crucial role in making you feel full and satisfied, which helps curb overeating.

With 25–50 grams recommended daily for weight management, these tiny seeds boost satiety without adding extra calories that can lead to overweight issues.

A study reported in 2014 observed slight weight loss among participants who included chia seeds as part of their regular diet. This is attributed to the way chia seeds can help stabilize blood sugar levels after meals, reducing those sudden hunger spikes that often result in reaching for unhealthy snacks.

Heart health

Moving from weight management to your heart’s wellness, chia seeds play a significant role in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system. These tiny superfood staples are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, mainly alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), which is essential for keeping heart disease at bay.

The high content of ALA in chia seeds can help prevent the buildup of plaque in arteries and support overall heart function.

Consuming chia seeds daily may also lead to other heart-healthy effects such as lowered blood pressure and reduced triglycerides, according to some animal studies. The presence of the antioxidant quercetin not only contributes to this benefit but further helps decrease the risk of developing cardiac conditions.

Moreover, copper—a mineral found aplenty in these seeds—works quietly yet efficiently to keep your heart beating strong and resilient against hypertension and other chronic diseases related to the cardiovascular system.

Cholesterol management

These tiny powerhouses help raise HDL, the good cholesterol that protects against heart attacks and strokes.

Regular consumption of chia seeds may also contribute to the lowering of LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels in your bloodstream. This balancing act means a healthier lipid profile, which reduces your risk for cardiovascular diseases.

Managing your cholesterol doesn’t have to be challenging with chia seeds as part of your diet. Adding 25–50 grams daily has been shown to improve blood lipid balance significantly.

Reduction of Free Radicals

After addressing how chia seeds can help manage cholesterol, it’s worth noting their ability to fight oxidative stress. Chia seeds pack a powerful punch of antioxidants like quercetin and caffeic acid, which scavenge destructive free radicals in your body.

These tiny but mighty seeds from the Salvia hispanica plant offer defense against the cellular damage that excess free radicals cause.

Eating chia seeds daily contributes to maintaining a balanced antioxidant state within your body. This balance is crucial since an overload of free radicals plays a role in the aging process and may increase the risk for various cancers.

Anti-inflammatory Effects

Chia seeds pack a powerful punch against inflammation, thanks to their high content of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a type of omega-3 fatty acid. Your body uses ALA to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which plays a key role in reducing inflammatory processes within your body.

Incorporating chia seeds into your diet can help manage conditions characterized by chronic inflammation, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.

Studies show that the omega-3s in chia seeds rival those found in flaxseeds or fatty fish, which are often recommended for their anti-inflammatory benefits. Additionally, the caffeic acid present in these tiny but mighty seeds has been identified to further aid in curbing inflammation.

Regular intake of chia seeds could lead to lower levels of inflammatory markers, offering a simple dietary approach to preventing long-term health issues related to inflammation.

Blood Sugar Control

Not only do chia seeds help fight inflammation, but they also play a significant role in regulating blood sugar levels. For those concerned about high blood sugar or conditions like type 2 diabetes, incorporating these tiny seeds into your diet could offer substantial benefits.

A study published in 2017 showed that the fiber-rich profile of chia seeds aids significantly in managing post-meal blood sugar spikes.

Fiber does more than just keep your digestive system running smoothly; it also improves insulin sensitivity and can be crucial for maintaining steady glucose levels throughout the day.

Daily intake of chia seeds might assist in staving off insulin resistance—a common challenge for people with obesity—promoting better control over blood sugar fluctuations after eating carbohydrates.

This natural approach to stabilizing glucose is an effective strategy alongside a balanced diet and regular exercise.

Bone Health Improvement

Eating chia seeds might be a game changer for your bones. Just imagine, every crunchy bite packs phosphorus and magnesium, key players in keeping your skeleton strong. You’re not just munching on tiny seeds—you’re feeding your body 18% of its daily calcium needs with every ounce you sprinkle onto your meals.

That’s crucial ammunition against osteoporosis, especially if milk and cheese aren’t on the menu.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/truth-about-vitamin-d/,The Shocking Truth About Vitamin D You Absolutely Must Know,"Understanding Vitamin D and its significance is more than just about maintaining healthy bones. This essential nutrient, vital for immune system support and brain health, has a dark side if levels in our bodies fall too low. Here’s the truth about vitamin D you absolutely must know.

Vitamin D deficiency affects people worldwide, with up to 97% prevalence rate in regions like the Middle East. Falling below the crucial threshold of 30 ng/dL puts us at risk of serious chronic diseases including cancer and disorders that attack our own immune systems.

Our modern lifestyles contribute massively to this issue. We spend most days indoors, shielded from the very sunlight that triggers Vitamin D production in our skin. Additionally, options are limited when it comes to dietary sources capable of boosting our Vitamin D intake; few foods naturally contain significant amounts – think cod liver oil or special mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet light.

The role nutrients play alongside Vitamin D can’t be overlooked either; elements like magnesium and omega-3 fatty acids act as co-factors enhancing its effectiveness within our body’s complex systems.

Given these intricacies and variables among individuals, one-size-fits-all solutions simply don’t apply – some may even need more than the often suggested cap of 2,000 IU per day after consulting their doctors.

Understanding your personal vitamin needs isn’t guesswork—blood tests can help determine precise requirements for maintaining optimal levels between 50-80 ng/dL. With all these factors at play – diet restrictions, lifestyle habits, regional differences in sunlight exposure – knowing how much vitamin you should take becomes critical.

Importance of Vitamin D

Vitamin D, often hailed as the “sunshine vitamin,” plays a crucial role in maintaining our overall health beyond its well-known effects on bone strength. This essential nutrient’s far-reaching impact extends to vital functions that support immune response, muscle function, and even cardiovascular health.

Classic role in bone health

Vitamin D plays a crucial part in maintaining strong and healthy bones. It allows our bodies to absorb calcium, which is the key building block for bone formation and maintenance. Without enough vitamin D, children might develop rickets, a disease that softens and weakens their bones, making them prone to deformities.

Similarly, adults can suffer from osteomalacia, resulting in brittle and fragile bones that break easily.

As early as the 1920s, doctors began using vitamin D supplementation to combat rickets effectively. Today it remains an essential nutrient for preventing these conditions and ensuring our skeletons stay robust throughout life’s stages.

Essential for growth and development in youth, this sunshine vitamin continues to support bone health into old age—helping us all to live active lifestyles with reduced risk of fractures or bone loss.

Now let’s explore how vitamin D functions beyond just keeping our framework sturdy.

Non-classic functions

Vitamin D is a powerhouse when it comes to supporting the immune system. This essential nutrient plays a critical role in helping the body fend off infections and diseases by regulating immune responses.

It’s not just about keeping colds at bay—vitamin D works on a cellular level to manage inflammation, paving the way for quicker recovery from various illnesses.

The benefits of this vitamin also include brain health, as it fosters neurogenesis—the creation of new neurons in the brain. This process is vital for maintaining cognitive functions and overall mental well-being.

Moreover, vitamin D ensures that cells grow properly through its influence on apoptosis or programmed cell death, which helps prevent unchecked cell multiplication that can lead to cancerous growths.

With these impressive capabilities, it’s clear why maintaining adequate levels of this nutrient is essential for full-body health.

Dangers of Vitamin D Deficiency

While often overshadowed by its benefits, the flip side of vitamin D reveals a potential risk: deficiency. This state, far from being benign, can have significant negative effects on various aspects of health and is a crucial issue that demands attention.

Link to chronic diseases

Vitamin D deficiency has a startling link to various chronic diseases. Research reveals that lacking this crucial nutrient ups the risk of serious health conditions, including several types of cancer and autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis.

Daily intake of 1,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D might slash some cancer risks by an overwhelming 60 to 77 percent according to specific studies.

Lower than ideal levels of vitamin D don’t just affect bone health; they also play a role in diabetes management, influencing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases have also been connected to insufficient levels, with effects extending into neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and schizophrenia.

Proper maintenance of vitamin D is critical for keeping these chronic illnesses at bay and could be instrumental in preserving long-term health.

Impact on autoimmune diseases

Autoimmune diseases, where the body’s immune system attacks its own cells, seem to be influenced by vitamin D levels. Studies have found a connection between low vitamin D and several autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and type one diabetes.

Individuals with deficient levels of this crucial nutrient might face higher risks for developing these chronic ailments.

Specifically, thyroid antibodies are more commonly detected in people with insufficient vitamin D – showing up in blood work 20-30% of the time. Alarmingly, some areas report up to 97% of their population having suboptimal vitamin D levels.

This deficiency is not only widespread but poses significant implications for autoimmune disease prevalence. Turning our attention towards factors contributing to this deficiency helps us understand why so many may lack adequate sunlight exposure or dietary sources of Vitamin D.

Influence on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders

Vitamin D plays a critical role in brain health, going beyond its well-known benefits for our bones. Research suggests that adequate vitamin D levels are essential for proper functioning of the nervous system and may protect against disorders like Parkinson’s disease.

Not enough vitamin D can lead to decreased activity in areas of the brain crucial for movement control, such as the substantia nigra.

Looking at mental health, there is a significant connection between vitamin D and various neuropsychiatric conditions. Studies have found links between low levels of this nutrient and an increased risk of issues including schizophrenia, depression, dementia, diabetes-related cognitive impairment, and motor disorders.

This highlights not just the importance but the necessity for maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels to support both neurological function and mental wellbeing.

Factors Contributing to Vitamin D Deficiency

Despite its critical health benefits, many individuals are at risk for vitamin D deficiency due to a range of contributing factors. Understanding these elements is essential to recognizing and addressing the shortfall in this vital nutrient.

Reduced sunlight exposure

Sunlight plays a crucial role in our body’s vitamin D production, but many of us aren’t getting enough of it. Factors like spending too much time indoors, wearing sunblock or protective clothing, and living in areas with heavy air pollution can all decrease the amount of sunlight our skin absorbs.

Even our modern lifestyles contribute to this deficiency—between office jobs and home entertainment, we’re less inclined to step outside.

Skin pigmentation also influences how much vitamin D we can synthesize from sunlight; those with darker skin need more sun exposure to produce the same amount as someone with lighter skin.

Latitude matters too; if you live further from the equator, your chances to catch adequate rays may be limited by longer winters and shorter days. Age is another factor; older adults have a reduced capacity to generate vitamin D from sunlight compared to younger individuals.

With insulin resistance on the rise, it’s essential for us not only to manage our diet and exercise but also consider how much sunshine we’re actually getting—and make changes as needed for better health.

Dietary sources

While reduced sunlight exposure significantly impacts vitamin D levels, dietary sources play a critical role in maintaining sufficient levels of this nutrient. Foods such as cod liver oil and irradiated mushrooms stand out for their high vitamin D content.

For those seeking alternative options, smaller amounts can be found in everyday foods like butter, cream, animal fats, and eggs. It’s worth noting that overall, food sources rich in vitamin D are not abundant.

Considering the scarcity of dietary vitamin D options, fortified foods become an important aspect of meeting daily intake recommendations. Many countries fortify milk and cereals with vitamin D to help prevent deficiency among the general population — a practice contributing to lower deficiency rates in such regions.

Regular consumption of these fortified products alongside natural food sources can support healthier blood calcium levels and promote better health outcomes across diverse age groups and lifestyles.

Supplementation

Supplementation plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy vitamin D levels, especially for those who receive limited sun exposure. People living far from the equator or leading indoor lifestyles often fail to get enough sunlight, which can lead to deficiency.

Taking vitamin D supplements ensures that even without direct sunshine, your body gets the required dose it needs to function properly.

To meet minimum health standards, adults should aim for at least 600 IU of vitamin D daily and 800 IU if they’re over 60 years old. For some individuals with higher needs or severe deficiencies, this dosage may need adjustment under medical advice.

It’s important not to exceed the maximum recommended intake of 2,000 IU per day unless supervised by a healthcare professional since very high amounts can cause harmful effects like hypercalcemia and kidney damage.

Regular blood tests can help tailor supplementation so everyone achieves optimal levels without risking toxicity or deficiency.

Co-factors for Vitamin D Activity

To ensure optimal Vitamin D activity in your body, it’s essential to know the supportive role of various co-factors that boost its effectiveness, which we will explore in detail.

Healthy whole foods

Eating a variety of healthy whole foods is like giving your body a toolkit full of the right equipment. These foods are packed with essential nutrients that work alongside vitamin D to help it do its job in maintaining bone health and assisting in other critical bodily functions.

Think colorful fruits, leafy greens, fatty fish rich in omega-3s, and nuts loaded with magnesium; they all have special roles that contribute significantly to increasing the effectiveness of vitamin D within your system.

Including these power players in your diet ensures you’re supporting optimal vitamin D activity without having to rely solely on sun exposure or supplementation. Your next step for maintaining good health involves getting active; let’s see how regular exercise fits into the picture.

Exercise

Exercise isn’t just vital for maintaining a healthy weight; it also plays a critical role in optimizing vitamin D activity in the body. When you engage in regular physical activity, your cells become more efficient at their functions, which can enhance the way vitamin D works within your system.

From supporting bone health to aiding muscle function, movement is essential.

Consistent workouts may increase your body’s natural ability to utilize the sunshine vitamin effectively. This synergistic relationship underscores why pairing exercise with adequate vitamin D intake is crucial for overall wellness.

Moving on seamlessly from physical activity, there’s another co-factor that significantly influences vitamin D efficacy: magnesium.

Magnesium

Just as regular exercise is key to activating vitamin D within the body, magnesium plays a pivotal role in this process too. It’s an essential mineral that acts as a co-factor for hundreds of enzyme systems and is crucial for the activation of vitamin D from its storage form to its active form.

This means without enough magnesium, even with adequate intake of vitamin D, your body might not be able to use it effectively.

Magnesium also contributes significantly to bone health by influencing the bone mineral matrix and the ability of cells to metabolize vitamin D. Most adults need between 310 and 420 mg of magnesium daily, but it’s important not to overdo it because excessive amounts can cause issues like diarrhea or abdominal cramping.

You can find magnesium in foods such as nuts, seeds, whole grains, beans, leafy greens, and some types of fish—making these excellent additions for anyone looking to boost their vitamin D activity through nutrition.

Omega-3 fatty acids

Just as magnesium plays a key role in the body, omega-3 fatty acids are vital for activating and transporting vitamin D throughout our system. These essential fats, especially EPA and DHA, work closely with vitamin D to support overall health.

They help ensure this crucial nutrient reaches where it needs to go, from strengthening bones to bolstering the immune system.

Omega-3s can be thought of as delivery trucks that move vitamin D around your body effectively. Without them, even if you take enough Vitamin D through supplements or diet, you might not get the full benefit.

Eating foods rich in omega-3s like salmon, flaxseeds, and walnuts or taking fish oil supplements can boost this transport mechanism and enhance Vitamin D activity. Make sure these powerful fatty acids are part of your routine for better health outcomes.

Zinc

Zinc stands as a mighty ally in the realm of vitamin D effectiveness, playing an indispensable role in countless enzymatic reactions including those related to vitamin D metabolism.

It’s a key player for ensuring that vitamin D can do its job correctly within the body. Zinc doesn’t just support bone health associated with adequate levels of vitamin D; it bolsters your immune system and helps with wound healing and DNA synthesis.

So while you focus on getting enough vitamin D, don’t overlook zinc – it’s essential for turning the active form of Vitamin D into a powerhouse that supports overall health.

As we consider these vital co-factors, magnesium enters the conversation as another crucial element for maximizing vitamin D benefits.

Boron and vitamin K2

Moving beyond zinc, it’s crucial to spotlight the team-up of boron and vitamin K2 in enhancing vitamin D activity. These two nutrients might not always grab headlines, but their role is key for maximizing the benefits you get from vitamin D.

Boron helps regulate how your body uses calcium and magnesium, which directly affects the power of Vitamin D in supporting bone health. Meanwhile, Vitamin K2 ensures that calcium goes to your bones where it’s needed most rather than accumulating in arteries.

Understanding the interplay between these elements can make a world of difference for your health. Without enough boron and vitamin K2, even if you’re taking Vitamin D supplements diligently, you may not reap its full potential – be it for strong bones or a balanced immune system.

Hence, incorporating foods rich in these nutrients or considering supplements could be essential steps toward an effective wellness regimen that leverages every ounce of value from your vitamin D intake.

Recommended Vitamin D Intake

Understanding the appropriate intake of Vitamin D is crucial for maintaining optimal health. While guidelines provide a general framework, individual needs may vary based on factors such as age, skin type, location, and overall health status.

Conversion of IU to mcg

Converting vitamin D from International Units (IU) to micrograms (mcg) helps you understand exactly how much you’re taking. To make this switch, simply divide the IU amount by 40. For example, if your supplement lists 2,000 IU of vitamin D, that’s equivalent to 50 mcg.

Knowing these conversions is crucial for managing your intake and avoiding vitamin d toxicity.

Keeping track of your daily vitamin D can prevent health concerns like hypercalcemia crisis or kidney problems associated with excessive amounts. While some individuals may require higher doses to maintain optimal health, it is essential to consult with healthcare professionals before considering megadoses of vitamin D.

Next up: let’s look at what standard guidelines have to say about recommended dosages.

Standard guidelines

The standard guidelines for vitamin D intake are set to ensure that most people get enough of this crucial nutrient without risking overconsumption. Adults typically need at least 600 IU (International Units) per day, while those over 60 should aim for 800 IU.

These amounts support bone health and may help prevent a range of other health issues, from high blood pressure to certain cancers.

Understanding how much vitamin D you need can be tricky because not everyone’s body handles the vitamin in the same way. Even though there’s a daily maximum suggested around 2,000 IU, individuals with certain conditions or limited sun exposure might require more to maintain optimal health.

Blood testing is the best way to find out your specific needs and adjust your intake accordingly—whether it’s through diet, sunlight, or nutritional supplements—to keep your bones strong and body functioning well.

Individual variability

While standard guidelines provide a general framework for vitamin D intake, individual variability must be taken into account to tailor a person’s needs. Factors like age, weight, skin color, geographical location, and overall health can all affect how much vitamin D one actually requires.

For instance, an overweight individual might need more vitamin D compared to someone who weighs less because body fat can hold onto and limit the amount of vitamin D that circulates in the blood.

Understanding this personal variation is crucial because even with doses as high as 5,000 IU daily, some individuals may not achieve the desired serum levels of vitamin D. On the other hand, certain patients could be at risk for hypervitaminosis D if they consume excessive amounts without proper medical supervision.

This highlights why personalized dosing is essential and should ideally be guided by regular blood testing to monitor serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels and ensure optimal health benefits while avoiding potential risks such as elevated calcium levels or kidney complications.

Blood Testing for Vitamin D Levels

Regular monitoring through blood tests is essential to determine your vitamin D status and ensure you’re maintaining optimal levels for overall health. These tests, which can vary by region, help tailor vitamin D supplementation to individual needs and avoid the risks associated with under or over-dosage.

Measurement differences by region

Understanding vitamin D levels can be tricky because different regions use different measurement units. In the United States, for example, experts typically express vitamin D concentrations in nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL).

Meanwhile, many other countries might report these measurements in nanomoles per liter (nmol/L). If you’re looking at a blood test result and need to convert ng/dL to nmol/L, just multiply by 2.5—a handy tip if you’re comparing international standards or studies.

It’s also important to recognize that what is considered an optimal level of vitamin D can vary from one region to another based on local guidelines and practices. Functional medicine practitioners often suggest maintaining your vitamin D between 50-80 ng/dL for overall health; this translates to a range of 125-200 nmol/L.

Keeping up with these differences helps make informed decisions about your health regimen as we move into discussing the importance of optimal levels and proper dosing.

Optimal levels

Maintaining vitamin D levels within the 50-80 ng/dL range is crucial for overall health. This range represents the sweet spot where your body gets enough of this nutrient without tipping into excess.

Experts often recommend aiming for the higher end due to differences in how our bodies handle vitamin D; what’s adequate for one person may not suffice for another.

Striking a balance with vitamin D isn’t just important—it’s necessary to stave off deficiency-related issues and avoid toxicity risks such as elevated blood calcium levels, which can lead to kidney stones or more severe conditions like kidney failure.

To ensure you’re getting it right, regular blood testing plays a pivotal role, guiding proper dosing tailored to your individual needs. Now let’s delve into why appropriate dosing matters and how it affects health outcomes.

Importance of proper dosing

Understanding the optimal ranges for vitamin D is just one step; ensuring accurate dosing can make all the difference in achieving these levels. Taking the right amount of vitamin D is crucial because too little will not correct a deficiency, and too much can lead to toxicity, with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and high blood calcium levels.

Proper dosing balances your body’s needs to maintain strong bones while also supporting immune function without risking an accidental overdose.

Each person absorbs and utilizes vitamin D differently due to individual variability, making it essential for dosages to be tailored rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.

Overconsumption could result in excessive vitamin d accumulation leading to conditions such as hypercalcemia – where calcium serum levels spike dangerously high. Monitoring by medical professionals helps tailor doses that navigate between correcting deficiencies safely and avoiding potential harm from excess intake – a balancing act that underscores the importance of precision in supplement use.

Conclusion

Vitamin D matters for your health more than you may realize. It’s not just about strong bones; it also regulates immune functions and affects your brain health. Without enough of it, serious risks to your overall wellness increase.

Make sure to get your levels checked and consider supplements if needed. Strive for a balanced diet and plenty of sunshine to keep vitamin D at its best in supporting your body.

Marriage connects two individuals in a unique and profound way, and kissing is one of the most significant expressions of this intimate bond. Across various cultures and religions worldwide, it’s often seen as an act exclusively meant for those who’ve committed their lives to each other.

This shared understanding elevates the significance of every kiss within a marriage, reinforcing its sanctity and the deep connection only married couples share.

Withholding such moments of intimacy can lead to emotional strain within a relationship. Engaging in this tender exchange helps to mend rifts after conflicts and serves as a silent reaffirmation of commitment between partners.

Kisses serve not just as acts of love but also as critical communication tools that convey understanding, forgiveness, and mutual respect—all vital elements for sustaining the health and happiness of a marital union.

Withholding physical intimacy can be damaging to the relationship

Not sharing hugs, kisses, or other physical expressions of love can take a heavy toll on a marriage. It often leads to feelings of loneliness and rejection in partners who don’t understand why this important aspect of their connection is missing.

Over time, lack of touch and closeness may breed resentment and create an invisible barrier that’s hard to break down.

Couples might find themselves trapped in a cycle where withholding affection causes emotional strain, which further discourages intimacy. This kind of situation can shake the foundations of trust and satisfaction within the relationship.

Regularly skipping those tender moments might even affect self-esteem as one or both partners feel undesired or unappreciated, ultimately jeopardizing the harmony and happiness that once flourished between them.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"December 4, 2023"

For those living with diabetes or at risk, the skin often serves as an early alarm system, revealing clues about blood sugar levels and insulin efficiency. It’s important to take these diabetes skin problems seriously because catching diabetes early could make all the difference in successful management.

One surprising fact is that one-third of people with diabetes will experience a related skin condition at some point. That’s why we’re turning the spotlight on 12 diabetic skin issues that shouldn’t be ignored.

From dark patches to sores that don’t heal, this guide outlines each problem and decodes what it could mean for your overall wellness. By understanding these top signs of diabetes on your skin, you’ll be better equipped to take action and seek proper care – potentially stopping bigger health problems before they start.

Skin Conditions Associated with Diabetes

Diabetes can manifest in numerous ways, and the skin is no exception; it often serves as a window to underlying health issues. Various conditions like necrobiosis lipoidica, which presents with raised, shiny patches on the skin, or acanthosis nigricans, characterized by darkened, velvety areas typically around neck folds and joints, are telltale signs of high blood sugar levels and insulin resistance.

Individuals may also encounter digital sclerosis—where fingers become stiff—and diabetic blisters that appear startlingly similar to burn blisters but without prior injury.

Skin infections remain a prevalent concern for those with diabetes due to compromised immune defenses; fungal infections such as athlete’s foot and jock itch thrive where moisture accumulates.

Diabetic dermopathy makes its mark through light brown, scaly patches usually found on shins—referred to colloquially as shin spots. Other indicators include eruptive xanthomatosis showcasing yellowish bumps encircled by red halos particularly when.

Necrobiosis Lipoidica

Necrobiosis Lipoidica can make its mark on the skin with yellowish, reddish, or brown patches that might catch your eye. Small and firm bumps appear first, but don’t be fooled; these little bumps are just the start of something bigger.

They grow into thickened patches which often show up on the legs. The affected skin takes on a porcelain-like shine, making tiny blood vessels right beneath the surface very noticeable.

These patches aren’t just for show – they may itch or become inflamed and go through periods of activity and inactivity. Having diabetes doesn’t automatically mean you’ll develop this condition, but it’s more commonly seen in those who do have diabetes.

Keeping an eye out for changes in your skin could be key to managing unexpected symptoms early on. Moving from Necrobiosis Lipoidica to another common condition—Acanthosis Nigricans—is another important step in becoming familiar with how diabetes can impact your body’s largest organ: the skin.

Acanthosis Nigricans

Acanthosis Nigricans is a skin condition that signals something may be going on with your insulin levels. Darker, velvety patches appear most commonly in areas like the back of your neck, armpits, and other folds of skin.

This could mean your body’s resistance to insulin is increasing—a common precursor to type 2 diabetes. Noticing these changes can prompt you to take action before blood glucose levels become harder to control.

Spotting Acanthosis Nigricans isn’t just about skin appearance; it’s an important clue that hints at prediabetes or even undiscovered diabetes mellitus. Don’t ignore these warning signs: they urge you to get tested and potentially adjust your lifestyle or seek medical advice early on.

Turning our attention from the darkness of Acanthosis Nigricans, we move towards another manifestation of diabetic skin complications: Digital Sclerosis awaits explanation next in our lineup.

Digital Sclerosis

While acanthosis nigricans often indicates high insulin levels, digital sclerosis presents a different warning sign for those managing diabetes. This skin complication leads to the toughening and loss of elasticity in the skin, making joints stiff and movement more difficult.

The hands are common trouble spots, where fingers can become so tight that even simple tasks feel challenging.

Managing blood glucose control becomes crucial to addressing digital sclerosis. Keeping diabetes under check may help alleviate symptoms, with some patients benefiting from specific supplements like alpha-lipoic acid or physical therapy exercises aimed at improving flexibility.

Attention to these areas is essential for preventing further complications and maintaining quality of life despite diabetes challenges.

Diabetic Blisters (Bullosis Diabeticorum)

Diabetic blisters, also known as Bullosis Diabeticorum, may startle you if they suddenly appear on your skin. These unusual bubble-like formations can pop up seemingly out of nowhere on feet, forearms, legs, or hands.

They look similar to burn blisters but come without the same level of discomfort; in most cases, these blisters don’t hurt. Despite their benign nature, it’s essential to handle them with care.

Seeing a blister could be alarming—after all, open sores and diabetes are not a great mix due to increased risk of infection and complications related to diabetic neuropathy and poor circulation.

That’s why seeking medical advice is so important for any unexpected changes in your skin’s appearance. Doctors might suggest simple protective measures or prescribe treatments that prevent further complications and promote healing without risking an infection that could result from popping or picking at the fragile areas where blisters emerge.

Skin Infections

Transitioning from the concern of diabetic blisters, another common complication faced by individuals with diabetes includes skin infections. These unwelcome conditions can manifest as hot, swollen patches of skin that might feel tender or painful to the touch and often exhibit signs like an itchy rash or small blisters.

Yeast infections caused by Candida albicans are particularly prevalent among those with diabetes due to elevated sugar levels in their bodies which serve as fuel for yeast growth.

Skin care is essential in managing such infections, especially since they tend to crop up between toes, around nails, or on the scalp—areas susceptible to moisture retention and fungal growth like athlete’s foot and ringworm.

Keeping the affected areas dry and clean helps prevent further aggravation. Because diabetics may need more robust treatment strategies, including prolonged courses of antibiotics or antifungal medications, consulting healthcare providers promptly can halt infection progression before complications arise.

Shin Spots (Diabetic Dermopathy)

Shin spots, technically known as diabetic dermopathy, are a frequent yet often overlooked sign of diabetes. These patches present as light brown, scaly marks that can look similar to age spots but actually signal underlying changes related to diabetes.

They generally appear on the shins and might be accompanied by a slight indentation in the skin’s surface. While these spots do not usually cause discomfort or pain, their presence is important for understanding how well your diabetes is managed.

Many people with shin spots don’t realize they have them since they’re typically free from symptoms like itching or pain. Despite this lack of discomfort, taking notice of these indicators is crucial because they reflect blood vessel damage due to high sugar levels in the bloodstream over time.

The good news is that most shin spots tend to gradually fade if blood sugar levels get under better control; however, persistent high sugars may lead to longer-lasting marks on the skin.

Eruptive Xanthomatosis

Moving from shin spots, another skin issue that might show up for individuals battling with diabetes is eruptive xanthomatosis. This condition surfaces as small, reddish-yellow bumps that can pop up on various parts of the body including the thighs, buttocks, and even on the elbows or behind the knees.

They make their unwanted debut resembling pimples but quickly take on a yellow hue.

These pesky bumps don’t just sit idly; they itch and are often tender to touch, causing noticeable discomfort. If your skin starts sporting these unsightly lumps, it’s a sign that your blood sugar levels may need closer management.

Fortunately, with diligent diabetes control and proper treatment strategies in place, these irritations typically clear up swiftly—allowing your skin to return to its usual state without long-term drama.

Granuloma Annulare

Transitioning from the topic of eruptive xanthomatosis, another skin condition that can raise concern for those with diabetes is granuloma annulare. This disorder manifests as raised lumps which may appear red or match your skin tone.

The patches could also show up in shades of pink, bluish, or purple. Although its connection to diabetes isn’t fully understood, people with diabetes seem to experience it more frequently.

Granuloma annulare often comes and goes on its own and might prompt an evaluation for underlying diabetes. If you notice these distinctive rings or arc-like patterns on your skin, consider discussing them with a healthcare provider.

While they can be persistent and even recur after treatment, options such as light therapy or topical steroids may be suggested to manage symptoms effectively.

Dry, Itchy Skin

Moving from one skin issue to another, dry, itchy skin often plagues those with diabetes. High blood sugar levels can sap moisture from your skin, leaving it parched and prone to itching.

Without enough hydration, the skin becomes irritable and can crack or get infections easily. Staying on top of blood sugar is vital to keeping your skin supple and itch-free.

Sticking with daily moisturizing routines will help manage this uncomfortable symptom. Lotions like CeraVe replenish essential hydration without causing additional irritation. It’s also smart to avoid hot showers that can strip away natural oils and exacerbate dryness.

Keep in mind that while lotions soothe the surface, controlling your glucose levels plays a crucial role in preventing dryness from within.

Xanthelasma

While dry, itchy skin can be bothersome and a sign of diabetes, another indicator that warrants attention is xanthelasma. These yellowish, scaly spots typically settle around the eyes and reveal more than just a skin issue; they signal that there may be higher levels of fat in your blood.

If you notice these patches on your skin, it’s not just about appearance—their presence could point toward existing type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes.

Dealing with xanthelasma involves more than topical treatments; it requires getting to the heart of the problem—managing your diabetes effectively. By keeping blood sugar within target ranges and monitoring cholesterol levels, you can not only improve these particular skin lesions but also enhance your overall health.

It’s imperative to take these signs seriously as they can offer an early warning about your body’s glucose intolerance and pave the way for better diabetes management strategies.

Skin Tags

Shifting focus from the cholesterol-related skin condition of xanthelasma, we arrive at a common and often overlooked sign potentially pointing to type 2 diabetes: skin tags. These small, soft growths hang off the skin like tiny balloons on stalks and frequently appear in areas where your clothes rub against your body or where skin folds—think eyelids, neck, armpits, or groin.

Although they’re usually harmless and non-cancerous, their presence could be hinting at an underlying issue with insulin regulation.

If you spot these little buds sprouting up more than usual, it’s wise not to ignore them. Skin tags can suggest that you have higher levels of insulin in your blood—a marker for type 2 diabetes.

Observing this subtle change in your body gives you a head start to seek medical advice and manage potential health risks associated with high blood sugar levels early on. Keeping an eye out for such signs helps maintain overall health and avoid complications from undiagnosed or poorly managed diabetes mellitus.

Care for Blisters and Small Cuts/Rashes

Taking care of blisters and small cuts is crucial, especially for individuals managing diabetes who are prone to skin issues. Proper treatment helps prevent infections and supports faster healing.

Avoid the urge to pop or break a blister. This protective layer serves as a natural barrier against infection.
Gently cleansing the area with warm water and mild soap minimizes the risk of introducing bacteria that can cause infections.
After cleaning, apply an antibacterial ointment to combat potential bacterial growth.
Cover the affected area with gauze to protect it while it heals; using a sterile bandage reduces contamination risks.
Secure the gauze in place with hypoallergenic or paper tape, options that are gentle on sensitive skin.
Make a habit of changing the bandage daily to maintain cleanliness and monitor healing progress.
When blisters form on feet due to shoes, wearing different footwear can alleviate pressure and friction, aiding recovery.
Start by carefully washing them with warm water and mild soap instead of harsher solutions like alcohol that can irritate the skin.
Avoid rubbing or applying excessive force which might aggravate the cut or rash further.
Pat the area dry with a clean towel rather than rubbing it which could introduce more irritants.
Once dry, apply antibiotic ointment gently to prevent infection while promoting optimal healing conditions.
Protect these smaller injuries with a bandage ensuring it’s not too tight but snug enough to stay in place throughout daily activities.
General Advice from Dr. Ergen on Diabetes Skin Problems

Dr. Ergen emphasizes the critical nature of early diabetes testing for preventive care, and he strongly advises those with the condition to manage their blood sugar meticulously. Maintaining vigilant daily foot inspections is essential to catch any complications early, while understanding and recognizing skin changes can be a telltale sign of diabetes that isn’t well-controlled.

Importance of getting tested for diabetes

Discovering if you have diabetes is crucial, especially for those battling skin issues. Strange rashes, persistent infections, or changes in your skin can be the alarm bells of undiagnosed diabetes.

Testing not only identifies these silent warnings but also opens the door to managing your health proactively. Keeping blood sugar levels in check might alleviate and even resolve different skin complications associated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Working closely with a healthcare provider leads to better control over diabetes once diagnosed. Tests like glycosylated haemoglobin assessments offer insights into how well you’re maintaining glycaemic control.

With early detection through testing, individuals have a stronger chance at preventing nerve damage, foot ulcers, and more severe conditions caused by uncontrolled diabetes. Moving forward from here involves understanding how to manage this condition effectively on a daily basis.

Managing diabetes effectively

Maintaining stable blood sugar levels is key to managing diabetes and preventing skin complications. This involves a balanced diet, regular exercise, and monitoring glucose levels closely.

Staying hydrated and using moisturizers can also help keep skin healthy.

For individuals with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is essential to follow their healthcare provider’s recommendations regarding insulin therapy or other medications.

Keeping hypertension under control and reducing high cholesterol through lifestyle changes supports overall health, including the condition of your skin. Working closely with doctors helps in customizing a plan that targets both diabetes treatment and the prevention of associated skin issues.

Daily self-inspection of feet

Effectively managing diabetes involves more than just keeping blood sugar levels in check; it also includes taking care of your feet every day. Regular foot inspections help you catch problems early, preventing complications down the road. Here’s what to look for and how to do a thorough check:

Start with clean, dry feet. Wash them daily and make sure they’re completely dry, especially between the toes.
Check for any cuts, sores, red spots, swelling, or infected toenails. These can be entry points for infection if left untreated.
Look out for blisters or any areas of rubbed – off skin that might indicate your shoes are not fitting properly.
Feel your feet with your hands to find any lumps or bumps under the skin that may not be visible.
Monitor changes in skin color. Darkened skin could signal poor circulation often associated with diabetes.
Examine your feet for signs of peeling or cracking on the soles or between the toes which could indicate athlete’s foot fungus.
Use a mirror to inspect the bottoms of your feet or ask someone else to check them if bending is difficult.
Observe for hardening areas of skin (calluses) or corns and address them before they turn into ulcers.
Stay alert for any persistent pain which might suggest nerve damage (neuropathy) as a result of high blood sugar levels.
Recognizing signs of poorly managed diabetes

Inspecting your feet daily is just one vital step in catching diabetes-related issues early, but it’s also essential to know what other signs point to poorly managed diabetes. If you notice frequent skin infections or slow-healing sores, this might indicate that your blood sugar levels are not under control.

Boils, styes, and bacterial infections on the skin can often occur more frequently when diabetes is not well-managed. Similarly, if small cuts or insect bites take much longer than usual to heal, it could be a sign of high blood sugar affecting circulation and your body’s natural healing process.

Pay attention to changes in your skin’s texture and color too. Eruptive xanthomatosis—which looks like reddish-yellow bumps on the skin—usually pops up when diabetes is out of hand.

Diabetic dermopathy, presenting as light brown scaly patches commonly found on the shins, serves as another warning sign of complications arising from uncontrolled diabetes. These symptoms necessitate a review by a healthcare professional who can adjust treatment plans accordingly for better management of diabetic conditions.

Conclusion

Keep a watchful eye on your skin; it could be whispering secrets about your health. Early detection of these dermatological signs can lead to better management of diabetes and help prevent more serious complications.

Remember, healthy skin is a reflection of overall wellness, so give it the care and attention it deserves. Make self-care a priority and stay in tune with your body’s signals. If changes arise, don’t hesitate to seek medical advice—together, let’s tackle diabetes one spot at a time!",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 29, 2023"

Promote heart health

Onions pack a powerful punch for cardiovascular health. They come loaded with nutrients that have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease. Flavonoids, like anthocyanins, are warriors against heart attacks and atherosclerosis by shielding the heart from damage.

One superstar nutrient in onions is quercetin, which not only lowers blood pressure but also helps keep cholesterol levels in check. Regular consumption can lead to significant decreases in systolic blood pressure and lower total as well as LDL (bad) cholesterol.

Chewing on some crunchy red or green onions might be more than just a flavor boost for your lunch; it’s an investment in your heart’s wellbeing. These bulb vegetables help prevent dangerous blood clots and combat inflammation – two villains when it comes to high blood pressure and strokes.

Including onions as part of a balanced diet is an easy step toward maintaining a healthy ticker, especially valuable for those managing conditions like type-2 diabetes or aiming for weight loss.

So next time you’re dicing them up for pasta sauces or garnishing your cornbread, remember that these common onions are doing much more than adding taste—they’re guarding your most vital organ.

Aid in digestion

Eating onions can be a game-changer for your digestive system. Due to their high fiber content, they work wonders by supporting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation.

This bulb onion isn’t just crunchy and full of flavor; it’s also loaded with prebiotics. These substances feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, leading to improved gut health and a stronger immune system.

Friendly bacteria in the stomach thrive on these fibers, which could mean fewer problems like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gastric ulcers for those who make onions a staple in their diet.

Onions offer a simple way to keep your digestive tract running smoothly without relying on supplements or medications. Moving beyond digestion, onions’ anti-inflammatory properties may even help reduce inflammation throughout the body.

Reduce inflammation

Continuing our exploration of onions’ health benefits, we delve into their anti-inflammatory properties. Onions boast a high concentration of quercetin, an antioxidant that fights inflammation and reduces the risk of arthritis.

This compound helps calm down body-wide inflammation, which is crucial for people with chronic inflammatory conditions like colitis or allergic asthma.

Regular consumption of onions works to suppress substances that spur inflammation in your body. Imagine the relief as this multi-layered veggie targets swollen joints or inflamed areas, making it a natural aid for those battling constant discomfort due to inflammation.

Including onions in your diet can be a powerful step toward managing your body’s inflammatory response and maintaining overall health.

Enhance bone health

Dice red onions and sprinkle them over your salads for a crunchy, flavorful addition.
Tuck thinly sliced onions into your sandwiches or wraps to add a crisp texture and a pungent kick.
Mix chopped onions into fresh salsas or guacamole for an extra burst of taste and nutrients.
Top your favorite tacos or nachos with raw onions to complement the other ingredients with their natural zest.
Stir minced onions into tuna or chicken salad mixtures to elevate these simple lunches with both taste and health benefits.
Create a zesty onion relish by combining chopped onions with vinegar and herbs, perfect for hot dogs, sausages, or beef burgers.
Include thin slices of onion in your next vegetable stir – fry; they’ll soften slightly while still providing crunch and potent flavor.
Prepare a traditional Greek salad using chunks of onion along with tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese, and olives.
Enjoy pickled onions as a tangy side dish that offers both probiotic advantages and the nutritional perks of raw onions.
Make an onion-centric side dish like Indian pyaz ki kachori (onion-stuffed pastry) that can be enjoyed any time of the day.
Precautions and Risks

While onions offer a multitude of health benefits, it’s important to be aware of potential allergies and to consume them in moderation due to their potent compounds. Some individuals may experience digestive discomfort or heartburn, so listening to your body’s response when incorporating onions into your diet is crucial.

Additionally, those with a history of gastrointestinal disorders should consult with a healthcare professional before significantly increasing their onion intake.

Potential for allergies

Consuming onions can be a concern for some individuals due to allergic reactions. Symptoms can include itching, swelling, and difficulty in breathing and may appear immediately or after a few hours from ingestion.

People with sensitivity to other Allium family members, like garlic or leeks, are more likely to react negatively to onions. This reactivity often occurs among those who already struggle with allergies or have compromised immune systems.

If you suspect an onion allergy, consult a nutrition specialist or seek allergy testing. It’s crucial to stay vigilant about the foods you eat and always check labels for hidden onion ingredients.

Dining out requires careful inquiry into dishes’ contents to avoid unexpected exposure that could trigger an allergic response. Remember that being informed and aware is your first line of defense against potential adverse effects from consuming onions.

Recommendations for moderation

To enjoy onions without the downside, eat them in moderation as part of a diverse diet. Introducing too many onions into your meals could lead to digestive trouble or unpleasant breath.

Balance is key; mix onions with other vegetables and foods rich in vitamin E and dietary fiber to keep your body’s nutrients varied and complete. Pairing raw shallots in salads or minced garlic in dressings can add flavor while keeping portions controlled.

Including onions should not overshadow the importance of overall dietary balance that includes carbohydrates, healthy fats, and proteins. Next, let’s delve into how incorporating raw onions into your diet can be deliciously simple and beneficial.

Conclusion

Incorporating onions into your daily meals offers unexpected perks for your health. These robust bulbs fight inflammation, bolster heart function, and might even keep cancer at bay.

Starchy Foods to Avoid with Enlarged Prostate

When managing an enlarged prostate, it’s wise to limit certain starchy foods such as white bread, pasta, and rice. These staples have a high glycemic index which can affect insulin signaling and potentially exacerbate symptoms linked with prostate health concerns.

White bread, pasta, and rice

Eating white bread, pasta, and rice may not seem harmful at first glance, but these starchy foods could be working against your prostate health. They pack a high glycemic punch that’s been linked to troubles in insulin signaling—a factor that might just tip the scales toward an enlarged prostate.

If you’re looking after your male reproductive system or trying to manage symptoms related to your prostate gland, it pays to cut back on these refined carbs.

Choose whole-grain options instead; they’re kinder on blood sugar levels and offer more nutrients. It’s all about making smart swaps for a balanced diet. Steering clear of foods that contribute to weight gain can also ease the burden on your urinary tract, helping you maintain better overall health without compromising taste or satisfaction at mealtime.

High glycemic index impact on insulin signaling

Foods with a high glycemic index, like white bread and pasta, can wreak havoc on your body’s insulin signaling. These staples go beyond just tipping the scale; they trigger rapid spikes in blood sugar levels that force your pancreas into overdrive to produce more insulin.

Over time, this constant state of high demand can lead to insulin resistance. This condition not only heralds issues like diabetes but is also shown to contribute to an enlarged prostate.

Your plate choices matter more than you think in maintaining prostate health. Choosing low-glycemic options helps keep blood sugar levels stable and eases the burden on your insulin response system.

Integrating whole grains, legumes, and nuts instead of processed starchy foods could play a significant role in preventing or managing prostate enlargement while supporting overall wellness.

Dairy Products and Prostate Health

While the research on dairy products and their impact on prostate health yields mixed results, some studies suggest a potential correlation between high dairy intake and an increased risk of prostate cancer.

The exact mechanisms are not fully understood, but it is thought that certain hormones or growth factors found in dairy may play a role. Therefore, individuals with concerns about their prostate health might consider moderating their consumption of milk, cheese, and other dairy products as part of a proactive approach to wellness.

Mixed evidence on dairy consumption

Diving into the debate around dairy products and prostate health, it’s clear that science doesn’t have a definitive answer for us yet. Research like “Dairy Product Consumption and Prostate Cancer Risk in the United States” has looked into this issue but hasn’t found strong evidence that links dairy to an increased risk of either prostate enlargement or cancer.

However, other studies suggest there might be a connection worth considering.

With such conflicting information, making dietary choices can feel overwhelming. Some experts point out that high consumption of dairy might raise the risk of developing prostate cancer.

Individuals concerned about their prostate health may want to consider moderating their intake of milk, cheese, and other dairy items or perhaps explore non-dairy alternatives like soy milk and cashew milk as precautionary measures.

It’s all about finding balance and what works best for your body and lifestyle while staying informed on the latest research findings.

Possible link to increased risk of prostate cancer

Certain studies have raised concerns about dairy products possibly playing a role in the development of prostate cancer. While research like “Dairy Product Consumption and Prostate Cancer Risk in the United States” hasn’t found concrete evidence linking dairy to an increased risk, some data suggests higher consumption may indeed be associated with greater chances of developing this disease.

This connection might stem from the presence of hormones or other compounds in milk and dairy foods that could potentially influence cancer cell growth.

Men who are mindful of their prostate health may want to consider these findings as they make dietary choices. Shifting focus toward plant-based sources of calcium and protein could be a proactive step towards managing potential risks.

It’s worth exploring options such as leafy greens, almonds, and fortified non-dairy milks which are nutritious alternatives to traditional dairy products. Keeping an eye on one’s diet is part of a broader approach to wellness that includes regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and consuming plenty of fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants like lycopene for overall health benefits including cancer prevention.

High Protein Diets and Prostate Health

While a high protein diet is often praised for muscle building and weight loss, its association with prostate enlargement warrants a closer look at our protein sources. Evidence suggests that diets rich in animal protein may contribute to an increased risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), encouraging men to consider more plant-based proteins such as beans, lentils, tofu, and tempeh for their health benefits on the prostate.

Animal protein’s association with prostate enlargement

Eating a lot of animal protein might do more than build muscles; it could also swell the prostate. Recent studies suggest men munching on too much meat face a greater chance of prostate enlargement, medically known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

It turns out that this risk is linked to the surge in insulin signaling caused by hefty portions of animal-based proteins.

Plant-based proteins like beans, lentils, and tofu are showing up as excellent alternatives. They pack not only the necessary muscle-building amino acids but also come with fewer strings attached when it comes to your prostate health.

Switching from animal to plant sources may be one practical step towards keeping that vital gland in check without missing out on vital nutrients and benefits that proteins provide.

Suggestion for plant-based protein

Switching to plant-based proteins can make a positive impact on prostate health. Foods like beans, lentils, tofu, and chickpeas are excellent choices that offer a powerhouse of nourishment without the risks associated with animal proteins.

These protein-rich plants come packed with fiber and nutrients essential for maintaining a healthy body weight and supporting overall well-being.

Incorporating these meat alternatives into daily meals is an actionable step towards improving prostate health. A serving of black bean chili or a quinoa salad can significantly augment your diet with plant proteins while aligning with dietary recommendations for better management of prostate concerns.

Opting for these wholesome options over red meats not only aids in keeping the prostate gland healthy but also contributes positively to heart health and reduces anxiety linked to dietary issues.

Red Meat and Prostate Health

Red meat, often favored for its rich taste, has been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer due to its concentration of saturated fats and the formation of heterocyclic amines when cooked at high temperatures.

To support a healthier prostate, it may be beneficial to limit consumption and explore alternative protein sources such as fish or legumes that are abundant in protective nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids.

Association with increased risk of prostate cancer

Eating red meat has its risks, particularly for men concerned about prostate health. Studies show grilling or barbecuing beef can increase the chances of developing prostate cancer due to the formation of harmful chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

These toxins are produced when meat is charred or cooked at high temperatures, contributing to various health problems including an enlarged prostate gland and even cancer.

To safeguard your prostate health, it’s essential to monitor how you cook your meats. Instead of searing steaks on a flaming grill, consider broiling or marinating them first to reduce harmful compound exposure.

Opting for healthier cooking methods helps limit the intake of these dangerous carcinogens, making a significant difference in reducing cancer risk while enjoying a protein-rich diet.

Choose grilled chicken or fish as alternatives; they’re less likely to form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and still satisfy those cravings for smoky flavors.

Impact of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from burning meat

Grilling or barbecuing meat until it’s charred might be a popular cooking method, but it’s not the best choice for your prostate health. The intense heat creates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), harmful compounds that can increase the risk of an enlarged prostate and even lead to prostate cancer.

These PAHs form when fat drips onto the hot grill surface, causing smoke that infuses back into the meat, carrying those dangerous chemicals right along with it.

Choosing how you cook your meats is as important as choosing healthier food options. Keep in mind that consuming burnt, barbecued red meat isn’t just about flavor—it could have serious implications for your prostate well-being.

Instead of going for that crispy blackened crust on steaks and burgers, aim for gentler cooking methods like baking or steaming which don’t produce these harmful PAHs. Your body will thank you by maintaining a healthier prostate and potentially reducing cancer risks associated with those smoky flavors we sometimes crave.

Beer and Prostate Health

When it comes to beer and its impact on prostate health, it’s important to understand that excessive consumption might lead to higher levels of prolactin—a hormone linked with an increased risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

While moderate drinking may offer some protective benefits against heart disease, for those dealing with symptoms related to an enlarged prostate, cutting back on beer could reduce the severity of these symptoms.

Impact on prolactin levels and risk of BPH

Pouring yourself a cold one might be a common way to unwind, but if you’re keeping an eye on prostate health, it’s important to understand beer’s influence. Beer can bump up prolactin levels, a hormone that affects the body in various ways.

Elevated prolactin isn’t just about mood or sexual function; it has been linked to an increased risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), where the prostate gland enlarges and makes it tough to urinate smoothly.

Yet, not all news is bad for beer lovers. Drinking beer in moderation could potentially guard against prostate issues. This doesn’t mean you should start cracking open a six-pack daily – moderation is key.

It’s crucial for individuals concerned with BPH or experiencing urinary symptoms to consider limiting their beer intake as part of their fluid intake management efforts to maintain overall prostate health and avoid aggravating any symptoms related to an enlarged prostate.

Moderation and potential protective effects

Enjoying a cold beer might be part of your routine, but when it comes to prostate health, moderation is key. Research suggests that while high consumption can elevate prolactin levels and increase the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), keeping it moderate could actually guard against these issues.

This delicate balance means sipping in small amounts rather than indulging heavily, which can tip the scales towards problems with urinating or even contribute to lower urinary tract symptoms due to alcohol’s diuretic nature.

Finding that sweet spot where enjoyment meets health is crucial. For many men, drinking less may seem like a challenge, but focusing on potential protective effects provides motivation.

A moderated approach not only contributes to maintaining a healthy body mass index but also supports overall well-being—a goal worth raising your glass to, just not too often!

Caffeinated Beverages and Prostate Health

While many of us reach for that morning cup of coffee or afternoon energy drink to keep us going, those dealing with an enlarged prostate might want to think twice. Caffeinated beverages can exacerbate urinary symptoms due to their diuretic effect, which can increase frequency and urgency.

Reducing or eliminating caffeine from your diet could play a part in managing these symptoms more effectively, leading to improved overall prostate health.

Diuretic nature exacerbating urinary symptoms

Caffeine packs a punch, not just in waking you up but also in how it affects your body, especially if you’re dealing with an enlarged prostate. Its diuretic properties mean more trips to the bathroom, adding stress to an already sensitive urinary system.

Each sip of that morning cup or afternoon pick-me-up could be sending you running for the restroom more often than you’d like.

Cutting back on caffeinated drinks might seem tough at first, but it’s a smart move for reducing those frequent and urgent needs to urinate. Think about swapping your regular coffee or soda for decaffeinated versions or herbal teas.

These small changes can make a big difference in managing lower urinary tract symptoms and help maintain better prostate health.

Recommendation to avoid for symptom reduction

Cutting back on caffeinated drinks might be a smart move if you’re experiencing symptoms of an enlarged prostate. Drinks like coffee, tea, and some sodas contain caffeine, which acts as a diuretic.

This means they cause your body to expel more fluid through urine. If you’re already making frequent trips to the bathroom or dealing with urgency issues, these beverages can make those problems worse.

To reduce these bothersome urinary symptoms, consider swapping out your regular cup of joe for caffeine-free herbal teas or water infused with citrus fruits—they not only hydrate but also offer a dose of vitamin C.

Staying well-hydrated with non-caffeinated drinks can help maintain kidney function and manage symptom flare-ups associated with enlarged prostate conditions such as benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

High-Fat Diets and Prostate Health

High-fat diets have come under scrutiny for their connection to an increased risk of prostate cancer, highlighting the importance of steering clear from foods rich in unhealthy fats to maintain prostate health.

While certain fats are necessary for overall wellness, focusing on healthy fats from sources such as avocados, nuts, and seeds, rather than trans fats found in fried and processed foods, can be a beneficial strategy in managing prostate concerns.

Reducing intake of these high-fat options not only supports a healthier prostate but also aligns with broader goals for optimal well-being.

Increased risk of prostate cancer

Eating a diet loaded with high-fat foods may spell trouble for prostate health. Studies reveal that such diets don’t just add extra pounds but also potentially rewire the body’s metabolism, leading to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.

In particular, fats from processed meats and trans fats found in packaged foods can kickstart a chain reaction that amplifies malignant cell growth, making them unwelcome guests on your plate if you’re concerned about your prostate.

For those focused on maintaining or improving their prostate well-being, steering clear of these high-fat culprits becomes essential. It’s not just about cutting back on calories; it’s about choosing the right types of nutrients to fuel the body.

Replacing unhealthy fats with sources of omega-3 and integrating more fruits and vegetables into your meals could help guard against this aggressive form of cancer while promoting overall health.

Importance of avoiding high-fat foods for prostate health

Keeping your prostate healthy means being mindful of the fats you’re consuming. Diets high in fat don’t just tip the scale; they could also increase your risk for prostate cancer and speed up its progression.

Think of it this way: consuming a lot of fatty foods is like adding fuel to a fire, except the fire here is prostate cancer growth, which no one wants. Researchers have discovered that fatty diets can mess with your body’s metabolism and boost harmful biological programs linked to cancer.

To support your prostate health, steering clear of high-fat foods isn’t just a good idea—it’s crucial. Whether it’s fast food or those tempting ice creams and ready meals loaded with hidden fats, cutting back on these can be a significant step toward reducing the chances of encountering prostate complications.

It’s not about depriving yourself but rather choosing smartly for long-term well-being—an investment in your health that pays off by lowering risks associated with poor dietary choices.

Sodium Intake and Prostate Health

Excessive sodium consumption can exacerbate lower urinary tract symptoms commonly associated with an enlarged prostate. Consequently, men experiencing such discomforts may find relief by adopting a diet with reduced sodium content.

This adjustment not only aids in alleviating urinary issues but also promotes overall prostate health, making it a sensible and straightforward change to one’s eating habits.

Intensifying lower urinary tract symptoms

Eating a lot of salty foods can make symptoms worse for those with an enlarged prostate. This includes issues like frequent urination, a strong urge to go all the time, and trouble emptying the bladder completely.

To keep these symptoms in check, it’s wise to cut back on salted snacks, canned fish with high sodium levels, and certain soups that pack a heavy salty punch.

Choosing meals wisely is key for managing lower urinary tract discomforts effectively. Steering clear of high-sodium dishes helps reduce the irritation in the urethra and bladder that comes from an enlarged prostate.

Instead of reaching for those crisps or heavily marinated meats at your Sunday roast, opt for fresh options that won’t aggravate your condition.

Recommendation to reduce sodium intake

Cutting back on salt can make a big difference for those dealing with the discomforts of an enlarged prostate. High sodium intake has been linked to worsening lower urinary tract symptoms, which can mean more frequent trips to the bathroom and other bothersome issues.

To help ease these problems, it’s wise to watch out for hidden sources of salt in your diet. Processed foods, like canned soups and frozen dinners, are often loaded with sodium that you might not even taste.

Making smarter food choices is key. Swap out those high-sodium snacks for fresh fruits and veggies. Read labels carefully when grocery shopping – look for items marked “low sodium” or “no added salt.” And remember, while seasoning your food at home, reach for herbs and spices instead of the salt shaker.

These small changes in your healthy eating habits can lead to better management of prostate health symptoms without sacrificing flavor in your favorite dishes.

Conclusion

As we’ve explored, your plate plays a pivotal role in managing an enlarged prostate. Steering clear of certain foods can make a significant difference in your symptoms and overall health.

Moreover, antioxidants also improve blood vessel function, promoting overall circulatory health. The diverse antioxidants available in nuts make them an integral part of a balanced diet aimed at fostering long-term wellbeing.

The Role of Nuts in Weight Loss

Nuts play a crucial role in weight loss, as they can reduce appetite, boost calorie burning, and are not linked to weight gain.

Reduction in Appetite and Increase in Fullness

Eating nuts first thing in the morning works wonders for weight loss by reducing appetite and increasing feelings of fullness. This is primarily due to their high protein and fiber content which serve as powerful appetite suppressants that can keep us feeling satisfied for a longer period.

Cholecystokinin (CCK) and Peptide YY (PYY), hormones known to regulate hunger, tend to spike after consuming these nutritional powerhouses. Not only does this reduce our overall calorie intake throughout the day, but it also helps maintain steady blood sugar levels preventing energy crashes later in the day.

No less important is how our body’s digestion functions more effectively during waking hours, ensuring efficient nutrient processing and fat burning rate from these plant-based fats packed superfoods.

Boosting Fat and Calorie Burning

Consuming nuts can help boost fat and calorie burning in the body. When we eat nuts, our digestion process gets a kickstart, leading to increased metabolism. This means that our bodies are able to burn fat and calories more efficiently throughout the day.

Nuts also contain plant-based fats that are beneficial for weight loss as they provide sustained energy and keep us feeling fuller for longer periods of time. So, incorporating nuts into your diet can be a great way to support your weight loss goals by boosting fat and calorie burning naturally.

Regularly eating nuts has been shown to prevent weight gain when combined with a healthy balanced diet. Research has found that individuals who consume nuts regularly tend to have lower body weights and reduced risk of obesity compared to those who don’t include nuts in their diet.

Not Linked to Weight Gain

Research has consistently shown that including nuts in a weight loss diet does not lead to weight gain. Despite their high fat and calorie content, studies have found no association between nut consumption and weight gain.

In fact, nuts have not been linked to weight gain at all. So if you’re trying to lose weight, there’s no need to worry about including nuts in your diet – they can be a healthy and satisfying addition without the risk of gaining unwanted pounds.

Best Time to Eat Nuts for Weight Loss

When consumed in the morning, nuts help increase feelings of fullness throughout the day. This is because digestion is more active during waking hours, making it easier for the body to process and absorb the healthy fats in nuts.

Additionally, choosing almonds as a morning snack can be particularly helpful due to their high protein content and essential nutrients. On the other hand, cashews, pistachios, and pine nuts are better suited for later in the day as they have lower protein content but still provide an energy boost when needed.

So if you’re looking to lose weight, try incorporating nuts into your morning routine!

The Best Nuts for Weight Loss

The best nuts for weight loss are almonds, cashews, walnuts, pistachios, and pine nuts.

Almonds

Almonds are considered one of the best nuts for weight loss. They are packed with protein, making them a great addition to any balanced diet. Not only that, but the fat content in almonds is low in saturation, which can help lower LDL cholesterol levels.

So if you’re looking to shed some pounds and improve your heart health, snacking on almonds regularly could be a simple and tasty solution.

Cashews

Cashews are excellent for weight management. They are packed with protein, plant-based fats, fiber, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. The fats in cashews have low saturation and can help lower bad cholesterol (LDL).

Additionally, they are rich in fiber, calcium, and potassium which support weight loss and overall health. However, it’s important to note that the calorie content of cashews can significantly impact weight loss efforts.

Therefore, portion control is key when including cashews in a balanced diet for those looking to shed pounds or maintain a healthy weight.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/fish-you-should-never-eat/,Top 8 Kinds Of Fish You Should Never Eat,"Do you find yourself confused about which fish are the healthiest to consume? It’s an important question, as research shows that certain types of fish provide essential nutrients – like Omega-3 fatty acids – crucial for our overall well-being. But there are also certain types of fish you should never eat.

This article will guide you through the maze, helping you identify the best and worst varieties for your diet. Let’s go!

Importance of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Fish

Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically DHA and EPA found in fish, are essential for optimal health as they support the development of our brain, nervous system, retina, and promote heart health due to their anti-inflammatory properties.

DHA as a building block for brain, nervous system, and retina

DHA, or Docosahexaenoic acid, works wonders for our health. This omega-3 fatty acid plays a crucial role in brain growth and development. It forms an integral part of our nervous system and keeps it functioning smoothly.

When we talk about the retina, DHA seals its importance by keeping our vision sharp and clear. Not just this, every single cell present in the body relies on DHA to maintain its membrane structure intact.

From boosting cognitive functions to being a vital element for retinal health, DHA proves itself as an all-round champion for overall wellness.

EPA’s anti-inflammatory properties for heart health

EPA, or Eicosapentaenoic acid found in fish, offers powerful protection for your heart. Indeed, the magic lies in its natural anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation is often a silent culprit behind serious cardiovascular diseases.

However, consuming fish rich in EPA can help reverse this risk and bolster heart health. The body uses EPA to manufacture signaling molecules that reduce inflammation. Moreover, incorporating these omega-3 fats into your daily diet helps maintain healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels—two factors crucial for optimal cardiac function.

This potent component not only prevents heart-related conditions but also aids existing patients by mitigating further complications. Thus, the beneficial role of EPA from regular fish consumption should never be underestimated when striving for robust cardio health.

Factors to Consider When Choosing Fish for Optimal Health

When selecting fish for optimal health, consider key factors such as the mercury levels present in the fish, the quantity of beneficial Omega-3 fatty acids it contains, and how easily your body can digest its protein content.

Mercury levels

Large predatory fish, such as swordfish and king mackerel, accumulate higher levels of mercury due to their diet. This bioaccumulation occurs because these predators feed on smaller fish who have consumed algae containing trace amounts of mercury.

As a result, the larger and older a fish gets, the more mercury it will likely carry in its body. For instance, tile fish from the Mexican Gulf holds the highest recorded level of mercury at 1,450 parts per billion.

On the other hand, younger and smaller species like sardines usually present lower mercury levels since they primarily eat algae and plant material. Tuna is a peculiar case with high variability in its mercury content which ranges between 350 to 689 parts per billion.

As consumers aiming for optimal health through seafood consumption, understanding these variations in mercury levels becomes critical for informed decisions on our dietary choices.

Pollution also plays a significant role in determining the amount of this toxic metal in marine life forms as it contaminates water bodies where organisms live or feed from there directly contribute to increased Mercury levels in them.

Therefore caution needs training while interpreting data sets related to Mercury contamination as they may not necessarily be comprehensive or up-to-date reflecting real-time conditions.

However, irrespective of nature’s intricacies around bioaccumulation, and predator-prey relationships affecting mercury levels variance across different fishes available for human consumption, one principle stands taller above all when choosing seafood: prioritizing those having high Omega-3s contents but low incidences of this heavy metal ensuring maximum nutritional benefits whilst minimizing potential health risks associated with excessive intake thereof.

Omega-3 content

Omega-3 fatty acids, namely EPA and DHA, are vital nutrients found in abundance in certain types of fish. Not only do these essential fats play critical roles as building blocks for our brain, retina, and nervous system but they also exhibit potent anti-inflammatory properties supporting heart health.

High omega-3 content is a major factor to consider when selecting fish for optimal health benefits. Sardines stand tall with 1,500 milligrams of Omega-3 per 100 grams while Atlantic mackerel tops it at 2,670 milligrams making them excellent nutritional choices.

However, not all marine sources boast high levels of these fatty acids; Mahi-mahi, cod and flounder fall on the lower end of the spectrum. It’s noteworthy that wild-caught species typically have higher omega-3 levels than their farm-raised counterparts due to dietary differences between natural and controlled environments.

Protein digestibility

While considering various factors in choosing fish for optimal health, protein digestibility plays a key role. Fish proteins are generally easier to digest compared to proteins from red meat.

This ease of digestion helps our bodies absorb the essential nutrients effectively.

Incorporating fish into your diet gives you access to an easily digested source of protein, contributing towards overall well-being. The amount of protein can vary by about 3-4% depending on the type of fish, but regardless of its kind, nearly 20% of any given fish includes crucial dietary protein.

As such, it’s vital to understand that different types offer varying levels and quality of this significant nutrient component.

Fish You Should Never Eat for Optimal Health

For optimal health, it’s crucial to steer clear of certain fish like Tilefish from the Mexican Gulf, Swordfish, Shark and King Mackerel due to their high mercury levels. While Tuna can be enjoyed sparingly because of its moderate mercury content, Orange Roughy and Mahi-mahi should also be limited in consumption due to their low omega-3s and relatively high mercury levels.

Lastly, despite its popularity in many dishes, Cod is another one to avoid as it contains only minimal amounts of beneficial omega-3s while carrying moderate levels of mercury.

Tile fish from the Mexican Gulf

Tile fish from the Mexican Gulf tops the list of types of seafood to avoid due to its high mercury content. In fact, it holds the record for highest recorded level of mercury at a whopping 1,450 parts per billion.

These soaring levels are attributed to bioaccumulation, a process where contaminants build up in organisms over time. Predatory fish like tilefish consume smaller creatures that have already ingested pollutants such as mercury.

The more these predators eat and age, the higher their mercury burden becomes which makes them unfit for human consumption due to potential health risks.

Swordfish, shark, and king mackerel

Swordfish, shark, and king mackerel pose significant health risks due to their high mercury levels. As predatory fish, they accumulate more mercury in their bodies from the smaller fish they consume.

This toxic accumulation makes them among the worst seafood choices for human consumption. High exposure to this element can lead to mercury poisoning, which negatively affects many body functions.

Especially vulnerable are pregnant women and children whose developing systems can suffer long-term damage from excess mercury. These fish represent a double-edged sword as not only do these species contain harmful contaminants but also their populations are under pressure due to overfishing; hence sustainable fishing practices need urgent prioritizing when dealing with such species.

Top it all off with ocean pollution adding another layer of toxicity within the ocean food chain – it’s clear that Swordfish, shark, and king mackerel should be avoided on your dinner plate for optimal health.

Tuna (consume sparingly)

Tuna is a popular choice for many seafood lovers due to its taste and nutritional benefits. However, it also has high mercury content, ranging from 350 to 689 parts per billion. High mercury content can pose health risks if the fish is consumed frequently.

Guidelines recommend limiting tuna intake to no more than once every two months in order to avoid excessive mercury exposure.

While data on mercury levels in tuna is based on readings taken by the FDA between 1990 and 2010, these readings are not universal. The frequency of sampling or geographical coverage does not extend globally which highlights a need for caution when interpreting this information.

By exercising common sense alongside statistical data about mercury contamination, consumers can safely enjoy a diverse range of seafood options including tuna sparingly.

Orange Roughy (consume sparingly)

Orange Roughy, a deep-sea fish known for its delicate flavor and texture, carries a high mercury content of 571 parts per billion. This elevated level makes it unsuitable for regular consumption.

Health guidelines advise eating this fish no more than once every two months. The primary concern stands with the potential risk of mercury poisoning, which may lead to serious health issues over time.

Thus, consumers seeking safe fish choices should opt for varieties with lower mercury levels as part of their recommended fish intake regimen. It’s important to note that these recommendations are based on FDA readings taken sporadically between 1990 and 2010.

Therefore, the presented data might not fully represent current conditions of all seafood worldwide but serves as a common guide in avoiding high-mercury fish like Orange Roughy.

Mahi-mahi (high mercury, low omega-3s)

Mahi-mahi, a popular fish in many coastal cuisines, unfortunately carries high amounts of mercury while providing little omega-3 fatty acids. The mercury levels in this fish are five to ten times more than some safer seafood options.

Interestingly, the omega content is disappointingly low for a sea creature. Farmed Mahi-mahi pose even greater health risks due to potential contaminants from farming practices. Ultimately, with its lack of beneficial nutrients and unsafe contaminant levels, Mahi-mahi emerges as an unwise choice for those seeking optimal health through their diet.

Making smarter decisions such as opting for wild-caught fish over farmed varieties can greatly impact your overall wellness positively.

Cod (low omega-3s, moderate mercury)

Cod, known for its mild flavor and flaky texture, unfortunately, falls short in providing substantial omega-3 fatty acids. Despite it being a popular choice among seafood lovers, it’s not the most beneficial option for health-conscious eaters.

Not only does cod contain low levels of these essential fats needed by our bodies, but also moderate amounts of mercury. The presence of this heavy metal can overshadow the nutritional benefits of eating fish if consumed above safe limits.

Even more alarming is that farm-raised cod often contains higher mercury levels compared to their wild-caught counterparts. Therefore, consumers need to exercise caution when including cod in their diet due to these health-related concerns over nutrient content and potential contaminants.

Fish to Include for Optimal Health

Discover which fish should fill your plate for optimal health. These five seafood superstars offer essential nutrients without the mercury worry.

Sardines (high omega-3s, low mercury)

Sardines, known for their high omega-3 content and low levels of mercury, are a top choice for optimal health. These small fish pack an impressive 1,500 milligrams of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids per 100 grams.

That’s nearly three times the amount found in salmon! Plus, with mercury levels as low as 13 parts per billion, sardines are one of the safest seafood options available. Even better? They’re convenient and affordable.

Just pop open a can for an instant nutrient boost – no cooking required! However, it’s crucial to opt for wild-caught varieties whenever possible, as farmed sardines often contain higher levels of contaminants that may negate some of these health benefits.

So next time you’re on the hunt for nutritious seafood snag some sardines—they’re rich in nutrients without posing many safety risks typically associated with fish consumption.

Atlantic mackerel (high omega-3s, moderate mercury)

Atlantic mackerel, teeming with a copious amount of Omega-3 fatty acids, is a top pick for your plate. Boasting the highest level of Omega-3s among fish mentioned in our list, it delivers whopping 2,670 milligrams per serving.

Your body appreciates this generous dose of EPA and DHA – essential building blocks for brain functions and heart health. Mercury levels remain an important consideration so Atlantic mackerel’s moderate mercury content at 50 parts per billion is reassuring.

Opt for wild-caught varieties where possible to avoid imbalanced omega-6 to omega-3 ratios often found in farm-raised fish. As always, use caution when interpreting mercury data as contamination can vary based on a myriad factors such as fish size and age or environmental pollution levels.

Salmon (highest omega-3s, low mercury)

Salmon, a powerhouse of nutrition, has one of the highest Omega-3 fatty acids content among fish. With as much as 2,590 milligrams per serving, it provides an abundant source of these essential nutrients.

Not only that but Salmon also boasts very low mercury levels – just 22 parts per billion! It’s vital to go for wild-caught salmon if you’re aiming for optimal health benefits. Beware of farmed varieties though; with grey flesh and a whopping 16 times more PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), they don’t fit the bill when targetting healthier options.

As such, due to high Omega-3 content and low mercury levels alone, health rankings place salmon at the top spot over other kinds of fish.

Herring (high omega-3s, moderate mercury)

When looking for a flavorful, nutrient-dense addition to your diet, consider herring. This fish packs nearly 2,000 milligrams of Omega-3 fatty acids per serving. These essential nutrients are known to support heart health and brain function.

While it’s true that herring contains moderate levels of mercury, with around 84 parts per billion reported in studies done on the species. It is deemed safe enough for regular consumption as part of a balanced diet.

Notably though, pregnant women or young children should limit their intake of high-mercury fish like herring due to potential harmful effects on fetal development and early childhood growth.

Croaker (moderate mercury, acceptable omega-3s)

Croaker is an excellent choice for those seeking to balance nutritional benefits with health risks. This species has a moderate mercury content, making it relatively safe compared to fish with high levels of this harmful heavy metal.

The omega-3 fatty acid amount in croaker is also considered acceptable, contributing positively to heart and brain health. Consuming croaker regularly can help meet your dietary needs without introducing excessive amounts of mercury into your system.That’s the kind of balanced diet we’re aiming for!

Importance of Choosing Wild-Caught Over Farmed Fish

Selecting wild-caught over farmed fish can significantly elevate the quality of your diet due to lower contaminant levels and a better balance of omega-3s to omega-6s. Continue reading to glean more important information regarding this and make informed decisions about your seafood consumption!

Farm-raised fish have higher levels of contaminants

Farm-raised fish pose significant health concerns due to high levels of contaminants. Industrial pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), reside in much higher concentrations within farm-raised seafood than their wild counterparts.

This is especially true for farmed salmon, where PCB concentration measures a staggering sixteen times greater than that found in the wild variety. Not only do they ingest hazardous chemicals from contaminated water but also from their feeds teeming with toxins and metals such as mercury.

Even more alarming is the rampant use of antibiotics in aquaculture facilities, akin to practices employed by cattle and poultry industries. Feeding on this antibiotic-laden diet not only makes these fish unhealthy but could potentially lead humans toward antibiotic resistance over time.

The unnatural diets fed to fish raised on farms drastically spikes omega-6 fatty acids while depleting beneficial omega-3s; tilapia and catfish are notorious examples of species affected by this dietary imbalance.

Farmed fish have imbalanced omega-6 to omega-3 ratios

Farmed fish, due to their diet of grains, corn, and soybeans, often carry imbalanced omega-6 to omega-3 ratios. This imbalance disrupts the potential health benefits that people expect from consuming fish.

Omega fatty acids in appropriate amounts are crucial for our diets, thus an increase in omega-6s coupled with a significant reduction in omega-3s becomes a matter of concern.

The shift towards feeding farm-raised fish a grain-based diet is largely responsible for this nutritional disruption. To ensure getting optimal health benefits from your meal, choosing wild-caught over farm-raised varieties is suggested.

Wild caught fish naturally maintain balanced levels of these vital fatty acids and hence provide substantial health improvement compared to those found on farms. Don’t let your quest for a healthy meal be undermined by unknowingly opting for fish with compromised nutritional integrity!

Caution and Common Sense in Interpreting Mercury Data

Interpreting mercury data requires a careful approach, as levels can differ based on various factors such as the size and age of the fish, its habitat, and prevalent pollution conditions.

Mercury levels vary based on fish size, age, habitat, and pollution levels

Mercury levels in fish are a complex matter that hinges on various factors. Size and age play significant roles, with larger, older fish typically containing more mercury due to bioaccumulation.

Similarly, predatory fish, which consume other smaller species increase their own mercury levels. The habitat of the fish also influences these levels; for instance, it’s striking how tilefish from the Mexican Gulf contain nearly ten times as much mercury as those from the Atlantic Ocean.

Pollution compounds this issue further, causing an increase in overall mercury found in surrounding waters and subsequently in our seafood. Therefore, understanding these elements is crucial when choosing safe and healthy varieties of fish to consume.

Data sets are not comprehensive or up-to-date

Mercury is a naturally occurring element that can accumulate in fish. Yet, the information used to advise us on safe mercury levels in our diet might be staler than you think. The readings we base these safety measures on are from data collected by the FDA between 1990 and 2010.

This implies that this dataset isn’t exhaustive, leaving us with potentially flawed or outdated data to navigate our seafood consumption choices. Furthermore, these tests weren’t even carried out yearly or throughout all global waters! It’s a real catch-22: despite low mercury reports associated with particular fish species, there’s no guarantee these levels will remain consistent over time due to insufficient data coverage and irregular testing practices.

Therefore, common sense plays a significant role when interpreting such inconsistent datasets – it’s not just about the numbers but understanding their limitations too.

Conclusion: Prioritize Fish With High Omega-3s and Low Mercury for Optimal Health

Eating the right fish can pave your way to optimal health. So, prioritize feasting on those offering high Omega-3s and low mercury content. Use this guide as a compass when deciding your seafood choices. Remember, your wellness lies in every bite you take!",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 19, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/6-ways-to-boost-magnesium-levels/,6 Powerful Ways to Boost Your Magnesium Levels,"To keep your body strong and healthy, make sure to pay attention to your intake of all essential nutrients. A magnesium deficiency can lead to a plethora of health problems, including diabetes, heart attacks and anxiety. (Updated Nov 10, 2023)

Many people are magnesium deficient without even realizing it, and it’s better to be safe than sorry! Here are six proven ways to boost magnesium levels.

1. Blend Magnesium-Rich Foods

If it’s a rich dark green and it has leaves, chances are it’s excellent for your health. Foods like kale and spinach have been popularized as foods rich in iron and antioxidants, but what not everyone knows is that they also do wonders for your magnesium levels.

Go ahead and make the verdant salad of your dreams, and toss in some nuts along the way for even more of the mineral. A few handfuls of almonds, cashews, pine nuts, brazil nuts, pecans and most of all pumpkin seeds are a great natural magnesium supplement.

If you’re in the mood for something sweeter, try this magnesium-rich smoothie:

5 bananas (fresh or frozen)
1/2 bunch of fresh kale
1/2 bunch of fresh spinach
1 Tablespoon of chia seeds
4 dates
1.5 – 2 cups of purified water or fresh coconut water
2. Make Your Own Magnesium Lotions

Magnesium butter smells fresh and feels divine when rubbed onto your skin. You can easily make it from scratch yourself from only three ingredients. It’s the perfect addition to your pre-bedtime routine—or your own domestic spa day.

Blend together just a half cup of coconut oil, another half cup of coconut butter and a quarter cup magnesium oil and you’ll have a soft, fragrant lotion to massage onto your skin.

Here are some additional recipes you can try making at home from TheModestMomBlog and RadiantLifeCatalog. It takes about 20-30 minutes for any lotion to completely absorb into your skin, so if after that time you’d like to rub the lotion off with a wet cloth, feel free to.

If you’re brave, you can also choose to use pure magnesium oil as a body lotion. But be warned, many people find it a mildly irritating, while very few find it super soothing.

3. Go For a Swim…In The Sea!

All major oceans are a natural source of magnesium. In fact, sixty-five percent of the magnesium in the world is contained in sea water. If you live close to one, luxuriate in the water as long as you want and feel the mineral seep through your skin to revitalize your cells.

4. Improve Absorption With Key Nutrients

Your magnesium levels aren’t just dependent on how much of the mineral you take in. Other materials in the body are required to properly process it. To help boost your levels, ensure that you’re getting enough of these nutrients:

Vitamin D3
Vitamin B1 (thiamine)
Selenium (can be found in brazil nuts)
Vitamin E (can be found in avocado)
Vitamin B6

That’s only one side of the story, though: like it or not, there’s a host of products you’ll want to avoid if you’re serious about maintaining healthy magnesium levels. The list includes foods high in sugar, gluten, and alcohol. The bottom line: avoid anything that is overly refined, processed or sweetened and stick with real food.

5. Epsom Salt Baths

Basking in nutrient-infused water is both physically soothing and chemically strengthening. Add a dash of magnesium flakes to your next hot bath and relax. Epsom salt baths are a sweet alternative to magnesium flakes, and they’re fun to float in.

6. Don’t Let Stress Take Over

Magnesium is the 4th most abundant mineral in your body and is the most critical mineral of all for coping with stress. That’s why, when you’re constantly stressed, you can become magnesium deficient even if you eat the right foods regularly. To prevent this from happening try meditating or coloring books.

Bottom Line

An often overlooked bodily necessity, magnesium is essential to all facets of your health. Promote the health of your mind, heart and body by consuming enough of it every day. You may feel a sudden surge in your energy levels, or the feeling of being cleansed from within. Activities that promote healthy magnesium levels also promote overall health—so you have every reason to go home and test out what you’ve learned.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 10, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/9-signs-of-hormone-imbalance-women-mistakenly-ignore/,9 Signs of Hormone Imbalance Women Shouldn’t Ignore,"Although you may think of hormones mainly in the context of puberty and sexual activity, there are many different kinds and they affect your entire body. Because of their importance in bodily functions, when hormones are unbalanced they can have some pretty sticky effects. (Updated Nov 9, 2023)

If you have any of the following symptoms, your hormones may just be the culprit.

1. Excessive Weight Gain

If you’re gaining weight inexplicably or just can’t seem to lose it, consider that a hormone imbalance might be the root of the problem (1). Weight gain on account of low thyroid hormone tends to be mild and causes symptoms like fatigue and dry skin.

As men and women age, declining levels of sex hormones can make it hard to keep off the extra pounds. The third major cause of hormone imbalance, cortisol (stress hormone), can trigger excessive hunger pangs and lead to an increased appetite (2).

2. Sweaty Skin

An excess in thyroid hormone, or hyperthyroidism (3), can cause excessive sweating. Those with this condition may also experience rapid weight loss, anxiety, and heat intolerance.

On the other hand, the condition can also lead to an increase in appetite, so if you notice an inconsistency in your food intake and how much weight you’ve been gaining, speak to your doctor about getting a thyroid hormone check done.

3. Digestive Problems

For menopausal women in particular, digestive issues are often the result of a hormonal imbalance. As a woman gets older, her body produces less estrogen and progesterone (4).

Other hormones, such as cortisol, can also impede the digestive process through raised stress levels (5).

4. Sugar cravings

A classic symptom of adrenal fatigue, the most common hormonal imbalance in women, is a sharpened sweet tooth. This may accompany intense hunger and craving for salty foods (6).

If adrenal fatigue is in fact the culprit, you will likely experience other symptoms too, such as irritability, anxiety, and inflamed skin. When the adrenal glands aren’t up to speed, hormones start stressing out the body and mind.

5. Poor Libido

After childbirth and menopause, a woman is likely to experience low libido. This is because her estrogen levels are depleted (7). This may result in not only a reduced sex drive; a woman’s tissues may experience a decrease in elasticity and cause her discomfort or pain.

6. Hair Loss

Yet another bodily blip caused by wonky estrogen levels, hair loss (8) can be an unwelcome surprise when women approach menopause or give birth.

However, excess estrogen is only one hormonal imbalance that can cause hair to start thinning. Testosterone in women can lead to hair growth on the body and hair loss on the head.

In addition, one study found that women with certain markers of insulin resistance sustained a greater risk of female pattern baldness (9).

7. Mood Swings

Known as pre-menstrual syndrome, or PMS, the anxiety or depression that many women experience before their period, is yet another symptom of an estrogen imbalance.

Estrogen levels influence the production of serotonin (10) , a hormone with a large part in controlling your emotional state. When estrogen levels fluctuate, your serotonin levels also fluctuate, which can lead to bouts of unanticipated emotional sensitivity.

8. Insomnia

Two hormonal causes of insomnia exist: adrenal fatigue and estrogen imbalance. The tricky thing about hormone-related sleeplessness is that it’s likely to become a vicious cycle.

Sleeplessness itself can worsen a hormone imbalance, which in turn can prevent you from getting the sleep you need. If you notice that your sleeping patterns have become irregular, consider asking your doctor about a possible hormone balance.

9. Fatigue

Feeling worn out, drained, or just apathetic in general? Don’t blame yourself—look to your body for the answers. In women, the hormonal changes associated with perimenopause and menopause are classically associated with feelings of fatigue (11).

More specifically, decreases in estrogen and progesterone can sap your energy and drain you. So if you’re going through menopause and feeling down more than normal, remember that it might be your hormones talking.

Hormones are great, essential even—and it’s also essential that you keep your levels in check. If you’re female, pay particular attention to any possible symptoms of an imbalance during menopause or after pregnancy.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/magnesium-lotion/,Rub This Homemade Magnesium Lotion On Your Skin To Help Relieve Pain In Minutes,"Everyone knows your body needs calcium for healthy bones and muscle development but there is another mineral that is just as important. In fact, magnesium is one of the most important minerals your body needs to function properly. One of the best ways to boost your levels of this crucial mineral is by applying magnesium lotion. (Oct 21, 2023)

Studies now show that there are 3,751 magnesium-binding sites on human proteins and that magnesium is also found in more than 300 different enzymes in your body. It plays a key role in your body’s detoxification processes, which makes it vital for protecting your cells from environmental chemicals, heavy metals, and other toxins that can damage your body. (1)

In fact, without magnesium, your body cannot even properly absorb or utilize calcium! “Magnesium converts vitamin D into its active form so that it can help calcium absorption.” (2)

Despite this, nearly 75 percent of Americans are magnesium deficient. Studies show only about 25 percent of US adults actually get close to the recommended daily amount of magnesium. Your daily dose should be between 310 to 320 milligrams (mg) for women and 400 to 420 for men. (3)

Why You Need Magnesium

Magnesium is vital for so many processes in the human body.

Here are just a few (4):

Maintains healthy bones
Activates muscles and nerves
Keeps energy levels balanced by activating adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
Promotes healing and soothing of inflammation and other injuries
Helps in the absorption of vitamin D from the sun
Promotes circulation
Helps you digest proteins, carbohydrates, and fats
Serving as a building block for RNA and DNA synthesis
Acts as a precursor for neurotransmitters like serotonin
Can lower your risk of diabetes

So what happens when you don’t get enough magnesium? The simple answer is that your body starts to breakdown. Many of the vital functions necessary for daily health are impeded and when this happens, and disease sets in.

Magnesium Deficiency

Here are just some of the signs and symptoms of a magnesium deficiency:

Allergies and sensitivities
Anxiety, depression or restlessness
Arterial calcification
Asthma
Bad short term memory
Back pain
Behavioral problems
Body odor
Carbohydrate cravings
Chronic fatigue
Coldness in extremities (hands and feet)
Constipation
Depression
Fatigue or unusual tiredness
Frequent cavities or poor dental health
Fuzzy brain or difficulty concentrating
Gut disorders
Hair loss
Headaches
Heart “flutters” or palpitations, arrhythmia
High levels of stress
Hyperglycemia
Hypertension (high blood pressure)
Inability to sleep, or insomnia
Infertility
Insulin resistance
Irritability
Kidney stones
Lack of appetite
Mental disturbances
Morning sickness
Muscle soreness, cramps or spasms
Nausea and vomiting
PMS
Poor coordination
Sensitivity to noise
Seizures
Stomach cramps
Trouble swallowing
Thyroid problems
Vertigo

While some of these symptoms may be caused by a number of other issues, if you are experiencing 5 or more of the above symptoms, it is highly likely you are deficient in magnesium. And one of the fastest and most efficient ways to increase your magnesium is with a topical cream.

Topical Magnesium

Your skin is the largest organ of your body. It not only expels toxins by sweating etc., but it can also absorb substances.

Many medications are often applied transdermally (topically) because it is an effective and often safer, faster method.(5)

When it comes to magnesium, it can be applied topically in several forms: magnesium oil, magnesium gel, and magnesium lotion or magnesium bath salts. These forms of magnesium can be applied easily by either spraying them directly on your skin, applying them as a lotion or gel, or even by adding them to your bath.

One study by the American Holistic Medical Association shows that using a daily foot soak with magnesium flakes, followed by a topical magnesium oil, can actually significantly increase the magnesium levels in 75 percent of people, and in just 4 weeks. (6)

Topical Magnesium Application vs Dietary

You may be wondering why you would not just take a eat more magnesium-rich foods or take a magnesium supplement. While you can, studies show that when it comes to magnesium, your body will typically only absorb between 20 to 50 percent of the magnesium you ingest from any source. As well, any medications you take like diuretics and antibiotics will also affect how well your kidneys function, often causing them to excrete, rather than reabsorb magnesium.

Add to that digestive issues such as poor gut health, low stomach acid, and any gastrointestinal diseases, and the amount of magnesium you actually receive is minimal. Even such things as aging, diabetes, alcohol dependence, stress, and illness can negatively affect how much magnesium your body can absorb. By applying magnesium topically, you can essentially bypass many of these issues to assure your body actually absorbs this vital mineral.

Studies also show that while absorption rates will vary among individuals, magnesium oil has one of the highest rates of absorption of any form of this mineral. One study shows that after 12 weeks of using a transdermal application of a 31 percent magnesium chloride, 89 percent of people raised their cellular magnesium levels by an average of 59.7 percent. (7)

What is more convincing is that people who took oral supplements had to take them for up to two years to experience similar results. As an added bonus, the people who used the transdermal magnesium also experienced an improved calcium/magnesium ratio while another 78 percent showed significant heavy metal detoxification following the treatment.

Supplements Aren’t King

Other studies show that many magnesium supplements, especially those that contain magnesium oxide, are highly inferior and provide only a 4 percent absorption rate. (8)

The other issue with supplements that are widely marketed is that many of the cheaper brands, and those that are not certified organic, contain little to none of the actual vitamins and minerals claimed. In 2015, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman showed that as many as 79 percent of all the supplements tested in one investigation did not actually contain the primary ingredient listed. (9)

So, the easiest way to make sure you get enough magnesium is to apply it directly to your skin. To get you started here is an inexpensive recipe to make your own magnesium skin cream you can apply daily.

How To Make Magnesium Lotion

This magnesium lotion recipe will make you feel amazing!

Ingredients:

Magnesium Oil

½ cup magnesium flakes
3 tablespoons boiling water

Magnesium Body Butter

½ cup magnesium oil (see above)
¼ cup avocado oil (alternatively, you can use sweet almond oil or unrefined coconut oil)
2 tablespoons beeswax
3 tablespoons shea butter

Instructions:

Magnesium Oil

Pour 3 tablespoons of boiling water into the magnesium flakes in a small container and stir until it dissolves. This will create a thick liquid. Set aside to cool.

Magnesium Body Butter

In a quart size mason jar inside a small pan with 1 inch of water, combine the coconut oil, emulsifying wax and shea butter and turn on medium heat.
When melted, remove the jar from the pan and let the mixture cool until room temp and slightly opaque. At this point, put into a medium bowl or blender.
If in a bowl, use a hand blender or immersion blender on medium speed and start blending the oil mixture.
Slowly (starting with a drop at a time) add the dissolved magnesium mixture to the oil mixture while continuing blending until all of the magnesium mix is added and it is well-mixed.
Put in the fridge for 15 minutes and re-blend to get body butter consistency.

This moisturizing magnesium body butter will keep for up to two months, especially if stored in your fridge. You can also mix your lotion with several drops of a carrier oil, like sweet almond or coconut oil to make a soothing massage oil.

If you like, you can also add a few drops of your favorite essential oil, such as lavender for a relaxing bonus. You can even use it before bed to help calm your nerves and act as a natural sleep aid.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 21, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/10-worst-breakfast-foods-for-blood-sugar/,10 Worst Breakfast Foods For Blood Sugar,"Are you grappling with fluctuating blood sugar levels, especially after breakfast? Here’s an important fact: some popular morning meals can send your blood sugar soaring. In this article, we reveal ten typical breakfast foods that could be causing these spikes and offering healthier alternatives for a balanced start to your day. Let’s dive in to make the most important meal of the day also the healthiest!

Why Breakfast Matters for Blood Sugar

Breakfast plays a crucial role in managing blood sugar levels, as it helps kickstart our metabolism for the day. Skipping this meal can lead to fluctuations in blood glucose levels, making it harder to control throughout the day.

That’s why making smart breakfast choices is key, especially for those with diabetes or pre-diabetes conditions. Choosing foods low in sugars and carbohydrates while high in fiber and protein can help maintain steady blood sugar levels and avoid sudden spikes caused by unhealthy options.

Impact of breakfast on blood sugar

Eating breakfast sets the tone for your blood glucose levels for the day. Consuming a meal high in sugar and lacking fiber in the morning leads to elevated blood sugar, particularly harmful for diabetics.

Skipping breakfast entirely contributes to even higher blood sugar throughout the day. Timing your meals correctly is crucial as it can influence the likelihood of developing diabetes.

A balanced, nutritious breakfast provides stable blood sugar regulation while supplying continuous energy all day long, making it an essential part of diabetes management and overall health.

The 10 Worst Breakfast Foods for Blood Sugar
Bagel and cream cheese

Bagel and cream cheese, a popular breakfast choice, stands out on the list of the 10 worst breakfast foods for blood sugar levels. This combo can pack a double punch to your morning routine.

The bagel, typically made from refined wheat flour, is high in carbohydrates which quickly break down into sugars, causing an immediate spike in blood sugar levels. To compound this problem, most varieties of spreadable cheese contain added sugars that further increase these levels.

Their low protein and fiber content provide little sustenance leaving you hungry soon after eating. Those living with diabetes should be particularly wary as such drastic blood sugar fluctuations could have detrimental effects on their health management plans.

What’s more alarming are studies showing even seemingly healthier options such as Philadelphia cream cheese could potentially raise blood sugar levels due to its trans fat content.

Store-bought muffins

Store-bought muffins are high in refined ingredients, making them less than ideal for blood sugar control. They often contain large amounts of sugar and refined vegetable oils, contributing to an unhealthy breakfast choice.

Even options like bran or oat muffins might seem healthier but can still have a negative impact due to hidden sugars and processed elements. With a low fiber content and not much protein, these muffins may result in sharp spikes in your blood glucose levels.

Instead of aiding your morning energy needs, these sugary baked goods resemble morning cupcakes more than nutritious breakfast foods.

Sausages

Sausages, a typical breakfast staple, fall among the top ten worst foods for blood sugar. Loaded with vegetable oil, they pose significant health risks especially to diabetics.

High levels of this unhealthy fat can cause havoc on your blood sugar control mechanisms. The body’s response to insulin gets disrupted, leading to potential spikes in blood sugar levels.

Other meats sharing this problem include ground beef cuts, bacon, and bologna.

Sugary cereals

Sugary cereals present a dangerous breakfast choice for individuals with diabetes due to their high sugar content and low protein levels. The sweetness makes them an appealing, crunchy option but behind the taste hides a threat: they are low-quality carbohydrates.

Instead of providing lasting energy, these types of cereals can cause sharp spikes in your blood sugar levels and leave you feeling sluggish as the day wears on. Furthermore, they have been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes due to their negative impact on blood sugar control.

Not just that, sugary cereals lack both fiber and protein – key nutrients needed to start your day right – causing you to feel hungry soon after eating.

Sweetened yogurts

Sweetened yogurts often land on the list of worst breakfast foods for blood sugar. Most people think they’re opting for a healthier choice, but these non-fat versions can contain an astonishing amount of sugar – sometimes even more than ice cream! It’s not just the high sugar content that amplifies your blood glucose levels; sweetened yogurts also lack natural dairy fat which further exacerbates blood sugar spikes.

Sugary pastries

Sugary pastries, such as donuts and sweet rolls, rank high on the list of foods to avoid when managing blood sugar. Baked goods like these not only contain alarming amounts of refined sugar but are also full of low-quality carbohydrates due to their composition of refined wheat flour.

Packaged pastries and cookies intensify this problem, frequently incorporating unhealthy fats into their recipes. On top of that, they offer very little protein—a key nutrient for stabilizing blood-sugar levels—making them a suboptimal breakfast choice for individuals with diabetes.

Freshly juiced fruits

Freshly juiced fruits may seem like a nutritious start to your day. However, they are actually high in sugar content and lack the necessary fiber to keep blood sugar levels steady.

The process of juice extraction removes beneficial fibers and concentrates fruit sugars into one sugary beverage.

This can result in an immediate, rapid increase in blood sugar levels after consumption. Take orange juice as an example; even when made fresh at home, it can deliver a large dose of rapidly absorbed sugars due to its minimal amounts of fat and fiber that slow down this absorption process.

This makes freshly juiced fruits one of the worst breakfast choices for people looking after blood sugar control.

Stack of pancakes

A stack of pancakes may seem like a delightful way to start your day, but for those managing blood sugar levels, it’s high on the list of worst breakfast foods. Pancakes are packed with refined carbohydrates that can cause a rapid surge in your blood sugar.

This excessive load of carbs makes your body produce more insulin, leading to increased insulin resistance over time. That’s not all! Many store-bought varieties or those served at bustling breakfast joints often come coated with generous servings of added sugars and unhealthy toppings, aggravating their adverse impact on blood sugar control even further.

Fruit smoothies

Fruit smoothies may seem like a healthy breakfast option, but they can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels. These tasty drinks often contain multiple servings of fruit, resulting in high sugar content.

The excess sugar not only disrupts blood sugar balance, making them unsuitable for those with diabetes, but it also triggers increased hunger and sluggishness later in the day. Despite their natural ingredients and delicious taste, fruit smoothies rank among the worst breakfast foods for maintaining stable blood sugar levels due to these potential impacts on your health.

Breakfast bars

Breakfast bars, known for their convenience and portability, often lack the nutrition necessary to satisfy hunger in a healthy manner. Many are filled with refined flours and sugars that can sharply spike blood sugar levels and then plunge them into a crash.

Despite their seemingly health-positive image, granola bars fall under this category due to their high sugar content. The types of sugar they contain have adverse effects on both blood sugar and insulin levels.

Moreover, breakfast bars typically offer little protein or fiber which could leave you feeling sluggish throughout the day and hungry sooner than expected.

Why These Foods Are Problematic

These breakfast foods are problematic as they’re rife with sugar and carbohydrates, crucially lacking fiber and protein, leading to sharp and concerning spikes in blood sugar levels.

These high glycemic index foods can often turn your morning meal into a diabetes disaster.

Healthy Breakfast Alternatives

Switch to low-sugar cereals for a lighter start. Opt for whole-grain toast topped with avocado or nut butter. Try a vegetable omelette packed with nutrients instead of the usual sausage and eggs.

Overnight oats mixed with fruit and nuts can be both tasty and healthy. Lastly, consider a homemade smoothie boosted with protein powder—a delicious alternative that keeps your blood sugar in check!

Low sugar cereals

Low sugar cereals serve as a perfect breakfast option for diabetics, helping to keep blood sugar levels in check. Not all cereals bear the same benefits; it’s crucial to choose wisely.

Opting for options low in sugar yet rich in nutrients can start your day on a high note while keeping post-meal spikes at bay. High fiber content found in such cereals aids digestion and provides lasting energy throughout the day.

For instance, oat-based cereals are great examples of nutritious breakfast choices that won’t wreak havoc on your blood sugar levels. Moreover, homemade granola recipes come into play when store-bought variants seem too sugary.

By ensuring minimal added sugars and maximizing nutrient intake, you can enjoy your morning bowl without any guilt or worry about fluctuating blood sugars!

Whole-grain toast with avocado or nut butter

Consuming whole-wheat bread instead of white reduces blood sugar spikes due to its higher fiber content. However, avoid wheat in general if possible, go for non-wheat options.

Toast it lightly and add slices of ripe avocado, a superfood known for its healthy fats and dietary fiber that can support blood sugar control. For protein, consider spreading a chunky or smooth variety of almond or peanut butter on your warm slice of toast.

This nutritious duo provides quick energy without causing post-meal sluggishness, ensuring extended satiety until lunchtime rolls around. A balanced breakfast featuring these elements offers numerous advantages in the ongoing quest for effective diabetes management.

Vegetable omelette

A vegetable omelette stands as a nutritious breakfast choice for individuals managing diabetes. Packed with fiber-rich vegetables and protein from the eggs, this dish offers sustained energy, keeping hunger at bay until your next meal.

Incorporating healthy fats such as avocado or olive oil can enhance both flavor and nutrition profile of your omelette. The low-carbohydrate nature of this breakfast option complements diabetes-friendly diets, helping to maintain steady blood sugar levels.

For an exciting twist, consider adding lentils – they not only improve texture but also provide additional health benefits related to better diabetes management.

Overnight oats with fruit and nuts

Overnight oats with fruit and nuts emerge as a champion among healthy breakfast alternatives. They offer an impressive mix of fiber-rich foods and satiety-promoting ingredients essential for blood sugar management.

Loaded with complex carbohydrates, protein sources, and healthy fats, these oats help sustain energy levels throughout the day.

Fruits lend a touch of natural sweetness to overnight oats while boosting their nutrient profile. Incorporating nuts not only adds a delightful crunch but also enhances the meal’s overall nutritional value.

The end result is a bowl full of goodness that aids in blood sugar regulation without compromising on taste or satisfaction.

Homemade smoothie with protein powder

Protein-packed smoothies can serve as a brilliant breakfast alternative for people living with diabetes. One of the main advantages is that you control what goes in, thus ensuring no hidden sugar surprises.

Incorporating protein powder into your homemade smoothie not only provides approximately 22 grams of protein per serving but also contributes to a balanced meal full of fiber and good fats necessary for maintaining stable blood glucose levels throughout the day.

For versatility, mix up your ingredients; use peanut butter or avocado to add extra nutritional punch or blend in some spinach or kale for an added vegetable boost. Don’t forget that Greek yogurt can be a fantastic source of protein if you don’t have powdered options on hand! These high-protein breakfast beverages are easy to prepare, customizable to personal taste preference, and perfect for those busy mornings when time’s at premium!",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 8, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/magnesium-for-your-heart/,7 Unique Benefits of Magnesium for Your Heart,"You’ve probably heard of people taking magnesium for sleep, anxiety, and constipation. But did you know it’s one of the most essential minerals for your heart?

Magnesium is so important that many cardiologists recommend this vital mineral as part of a holistic approach to cardiovascular wellness.

Today, we’ll explore seven unique benefits of magnesium for your heart – from regulating heartbeat to reducing inflammation and boosting energy production.

We’ll also reveal the best magnesium supplement you can take to maximize health benefits. So, make sure to watch till the end.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider about any changes to your health regimen.

First, it’s important to understand what happens to your body when you have a magnesium deficiency.

Magnesium is an often overlooked mineral that quietly performs hundreds of vital jobs to keep your body running smoothly.

Every organ in your body needs magnesium. It contributes to muscle and nerve function, regulates blood sugar, and supports bone health, among many other functions.

One study published in the journal Atherosclerosis found that people with low magnesium levels were more than twice as likely to die of heart disease. They were also more than seven times as likely to die from all causes.

Despite its importance, it has been estimated that 50-80% of the population is deficient in magnesium without knowing it.

This deficiency could be caused by gastrointestinal disorders, kidney disease, medications, and poor diet. However, a major contributing factor is the depletion of minerals in the soil due to modern farming practices

So, how do you know if your body is low in magnesium?

The first symptoms of magnesium deficiency can be subtle and may include leg cramps, foot pain, or muscle twitches. Other early signs are loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness.

As magnesium deficiency worsens, numbness, tingling, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms can occur.

If you do a blood test for magnesium levels, be aware that it may not accurately reflect the total body store of this mineral.

This is because only 1% of magnesium circulates in the blood, while the rest is stored in the bones and muscles.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

Now, let’s look at magnesium’s multifaceted benefits for your heart:

Number 7. Maintain a Normal Heart Rhythm.

Your heart is like a drum – constantly beating out a steady rhythm. But what keeps it on tempo? Magnesium plays a key role.

Magnesium is like a conductor, making sure the electrical signals move smoothly through the heart’s muscle cells. It ensures each beat happens on cue. Without enough magnesium, the heart’s rhythm can go haywire.

Irregular heartbeats like atrial fibrillation can occur. The heart may start racing out of control in a condition called tachycardia, when the heart rate is dangerously fast at more than 100 beats per minute.

Magnesium regulates levels of calcium, sodium and potassium. All these electrolytes must be balanced for the heart’s electrical system to function properly.

Simply put, getting enough magnesium helps maintain a healthy heart rhythm and prevent issues.

Number 6. Support Healthy Blood Pressure.

Magnesium plays a vital role in maintaining healthy blood pressure. This essential mineral helps your blood vessels relax, allowing them to widen and support proper blood flow.

One study found that consuming 500-1000 mg of magnesium per day could lower systolic pressure by up to 5.6 points and diastolic pressure by up to 2.8 points.

On the flip side, a magnesium deficiency can lead to vasoconstriction, where blood vessels tighten, making it harder for blood to flow freely and potentially elevating blood pressure.

Magnesium works in several ways to lower blood pressure:

Boosting Endothelial Health:
Magnesium improves the health of your endothelium, the thin inner lining of your heart and arteries. This helps increase the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that supports vasodilation, the relaxation of blood vessels, and ultimately lowers blood pressure.

Acting as a Natural Calcium Channel Blocker:
Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, relaxing the heart and blood vessels, thereby lowering blood pressure.

Relieving Depression and Anxiety:
Magnesium can alleviate depression and anxiety which can throw the nervous system out of balance, increase sympathetic activation, and drive up blood pressure.

Reducing Inflammation and Oxidative Stress:
This will be discussed next.

Number 5. Reduce Inflammation.

Magnesium plays a crucial role in supporting your immune system and maintaining low levels of inflammation. Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), have been linked to high blood pressure.

Chronic inflammation is closely tied to heart disease.

A multitude of studies have highlighted the effectiveness of magnesium in reducing CRP levels. Think of magnesium as your body’s peacekeeper, quelling internal flare-ups and protecting your cardiovascular system.

Magnesium also reduces inflammation by helping with insomnia.

Low magnesium levels may be the culprit behind sleep difficulties, and getting enough magnesium can relax the nervous system and support restful sleep. Better sleep leads to less inflammation, a well-regulated nervous system, and lower blood pressure.

Number 4. Decrease Oxidative Stress.

Magnesium has powerful antioxidant properties that helps battle oxidative stress in your body. This stress is like rust, targeting your heart and the intricate network of vessels that nourish it.

If left unchecked, it can pave the way for many cardiovascular complications, including plaque buildup in the arteries and constriction of the blood vessels.

Acting as a protective shield, magnesium neutralizes harmful free radicals that drive oxidative stress. This process can be likened to giving your heart a suit of armor, safeguarding it from potential threats, and ensuring it beats strong and healthy.

Number 3. Reduces Risk of Clogged Arteries.

Atherosclerosis, also known as clogged arteries, is a silent and sinister threat to your cardiovascular health. It can lead to heart attack or stroke. Magnesium helps maintain the smooth flow of your circulatory system and protects against the buildup of arterial blockages.

Number 2. Supports Heart Muscle Function.

Your heart is the most critical muscle in your body. It requires magnesium to relax and contract properly. This mineral aids in transmitting muscle impulses so your heart can pump blood more efficiently throughout your body.

Number 1. Increases Energy Production.

Your heart is working nonstop, and it requires a continuous energy source in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to function optimally. Magnesium plays a crucial role in the production of ATP, ensuring that your heart has the energy it needs.

Now that we’ve covered the benefits of magnesium for your heart, let’s look at how you can get magnesium from foods and supplements.

First, here’s a list of top foods chock-full of this vital mineral: Spinach, Pumpkin Seeds, Almonds, Artichokes, Avocado, Tuna, Salmon, Zucchini, Sweet Potatoes, and Dark Chocolate.

However, in reality, it’s difficult for an adult to get 400 mg of magnesium daily from food alone, for all the reasons we mentioned earlier. So, it’s important to supplement.

Next, let’s look at the 5 best magnesium supplements for your heart and overall health.

Magnesium Citrate: This is an easily absorbed form that is commonly used to treat constipation, heartburn and indigestion. One study found that magnesium citrate can help improve arterial stiffness in healthy overweight individuals.

Magnesium Malate: Some people believe this is the most bioavailable form of magnesium. It helps with energy production at the cellular level, so is often preferred by individuals experiencing fatigue or muscle pain. Magnesium malate is naturally found in fruits, which is why it often has a “tart taste”. It also helps alleviate migraines, chronic pain, and depression.

Magnesium Taurate: A combination of magnesium and the amino acid taurine, this form is particularly recommended for heart health. Taurine offers cardiovascular benefits of its own, and when combined with magnesium, the duo can be particularly effective for supporting healthy muscle function, improving circulation, and helping to maintain a regular heart rhythm.

Magnesium Bisglycinate: Also known as Magnesium Bisglycinate Chelate, this is a form of magnesium where the mineral is chelated, or bound, to two molecules of the amino acid glycine. This chelation process enhances magnesium absorption in your body, making it one of the most bioavailable forms.

Magnesium Orotate: This highly bioavailable form is derived from orotic acid and is known for its ability to support heart tissue health and improve overall heart performance. This makes it a popular choice for individuals with heart disease, those who have had a heart attack or heart surgery, and athletes seeking enhanced recovery, energy, and performance. Magnesium orotate is believed to be the best form for improving metabolism.

Now, instead of wondering which type of magnesium will best suit your needs, wouldn’t it be great if you could get all five types in one supplement? This way you can maximize the health benefits for your heart, brain, digestion, bones and muscles.

After doing a lot of research online, we finally found one supplement that offers all five forms of magnesium scientifically formulated in the right ratios. Click the link below to learn more.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-calcium-plaque-in-your-heart-arteries/,8 Ways To Stop Calcium Plaque In Your Heart Arteries,"Welcome to our video on the 8 Ways To Stop Calcium Plaque In Your Heart Arteries. The blood vessels that wrap around the outside of your heart, covering it like a crown, are called coronary arteries. They deliver a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients to your heart muscle so it can pump blood effectively to the rest of your body.

Excess calcium commonly builds up in the coronary arteries as you age. Coronary calcification is widespread; calcium deposits are found in 67% of women and 90% of men over 70.

Contrary to popular belief, coronary artery disease (CAD) is not a result of consuming saturated animal fats or dietary cholesterol.

Instead, coronary calcification, the root of CAD, is a symptom of inflammation and repair in your arteries.

Calcium, the most abundant mineral in your body, usually resides within your teeth and bones.

However, calcium can start depositing elsewhere as you age, including in your arteries.

Calcification starts early in the development of atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease that causes your arteries to harden and narrow.

Over time, as calcium accumulates in the fatty deposits called plaque, reduced blood flow may cause chest pain or tightness (angina), shortness of breath, and extreme fatigue.

However, more often than not, calcification goes undetected and has no symptoms until a blood clot cuts off the blood flow entirely and causes a heart attack or stroke.

Now, calcification is not random; it is found in all patients with documented CAD.

The good news is you can rewrite your heart’s story by addressing the inflammation in your body.

Here are eight ways to reverse coronary calcification, backed by the synergy of modern science and timeless wisdom.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider about any changes to your health regimen.

So, we start with Number 8. “Avoid Inflammatory Foods.”

Say goodbye to inflammation-inducing foods in your diet. These offenders, including vegetable oils, trans fats, refined sugars, GMOs, and gluten, can cause a low-grade inflammatory response in your body, contributing to coronary calcification. Instead, focus on anti-inflammatory, heart-healthy foods that can help combat inflammation.

Consume whole foods rich in vitamin K2, magnesium, and vitamin D. This powerful trio can help counteract nutritional deficiencies linked to coronary calcification.

Picture a plate filled with vibrant, organic leafy greens, nutritious nuts from nature, and wild-caught fish from the ocean’s depths. Remember to include grass-fed and pasture-raised meats; they are nutrient-dense sources of these vitamins.

Click the link below to get your FREE anti-inflammatory diet plan.

Next, we have Number 7. “Practise Fasting.”

When you eat food, your body breaks it down into fuel that provides energy for essential organs like your brain, heart, lungs, and liver.

During fasting, your body looks for alternative energy sources, leading to ketosis. In ketosis, your body uses ketones from fat as its primary fuel source instead of glucose from carbohydrates.

Fasting and ketogenic diets help reduce oxidation, inflammation, and insulin resistance, three factors that contribute to artery calcification.

As you fast, your fat stores decrease, and your body may slowly and naturally break down coronary plaque for fuel. Fasting can also increase apoptosis and autophagy, which help clear damaged cells and plaques in arteries.

Some fasting protocols that may help prevent coronary calcification include intermittent fasting, alternate-day fasting, 24-hour fasting, and 72-hour fasting periods.

Consider consulting a healthcare professional before starting any extended fasting regimen.

Moving on, we have Number 6. “Get Regular Exercise.”

Staying active is essential for a healthy heart, but it’s all about finding the right balance.

Moderate exercise can help slow down the hardening of heart arteries, but very high-intensity workouts may speed it up.

Don’t let this discourage you from being active, though. Studies reveal a sedentary lifestyle promotes heart artery hardening by lowering body metabolism and increasing inflammation.

For most individuals, the cardiovascular benefits of exercise far outweigh any potential risks. Whether you take a leisurely walk in the park or a lively dance class, every move you make is a step towards a healthier heart.

Next, at Number 5, we have “Get Enough Sunlight.”

Did you know that soaking up the sun’s rays could benefit your heart? Turns out, sunlight does way more than feel nice your skin.

It helps your body make optimal vitamin D crucial for preventing coronary calcification.

Vitamin D keeps inflammation in check. Not getting enough can cause inflammation to spiral out of control and speed up calcification.

Despite its importance, an estimated 42% of people in the US struggle with vitamin D deficiency, mainly due to spending too much time cooped up indoors and slathering on sunscreen when outside.

Besides helping with vitamin D production, sunlight also stimulates the creation of nitric oxide, a compound that widens blood vessels. When the body has enough nitric oxide, blood flows freely and quickly, thus preventing calcification.

Diabetes and insulin resistance can cause clogged arteries by blocking nitric oxide production. You can increase nitric oxide by spending more time in the sun.

Coming up next is Number 4. “Reduce Toxins.”

We are constantly exposed to harmful substances such as air pollution, pesticides, mold, heavy metals, and chemicals in everyday products. These toxins can disrupt your body’s balance and contribute to coronary calcification.

Choose organic food and avoid items susceptible to mold mycotoxins. Replace chemical-heavy cleaners and beauty products with natural alternatives.

By making these changes, you can reduce exposure to harmful substances and support your body’s natural detoxification processes, ultimately promoting better heart health.

In the top 3, we have Number 3. “Reduce Stress.”

When stress invades your life, it triggers a series of biological changes, such as increased blood pressure and a fight-or-flight response, which leads to a surge in hormones like cortisol.

Chronic stress leads to inflammation, a significant contributor to calcification.

Studies show that reducing stress can help stop or slow the progression of coronary artery calcification by lowering cortisol levels and blood pressure.

Moving on next, Number 2 is “Sleep More.”

Getting enough quality sleep is critical for heart health. Multiple studies have found strong links between insufficient sleep and increased risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, and other cardiovascular problems.

A 2008 study from the University of Chicago found that people who slept less than 5 hours per night were over twice as likely to develop coronary artery calcification over five years compared to those sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night.

The researchers concluded that getting just one extra hour of sleep per night could significantly reduce heart disease risk, with benefits comparable to a significant drop in blood pressure.

And at Number 1, we have “Supplement As Needed.”

Due to depleted soils and chemical agriculture, it’s increasingly more difficult to obtain all the essential nutrients your body needs from food alone.

Here are six essential nutrients that combat calcification and CAD, along with their food options.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids.

Statins do not prevent coronary calcification, but eating seafood does.

A recent study showed that omega-3 fatty acids from seafood help to prevent coronary calcification and plaque progression. According to this study, a high omega-3 index predicts a low heart attack risk in people with coronary calcification.

Wild-caught fatty fish top the list of omega-3 foods you can eat.

They are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that support the heart by decreasing inflammation, lowering triglycerides, preventing blood clots, and maintaining healthy blood pressure.

The best seafood choices for Omega-3s are salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, anchovies, oysters, and mussels.

If you plan to supplement, take a look at the high-quality fish oil below.

Vitamin K2.

Clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that vitamin K2, especially in the form of MK-7, can help slow down the development and progression of coronary artery calcification.

Vitamin K2 activates a protein called MGP, which prevents calcium buildup in blood vessel walls and pushes the calcium to your bones where needed!

Fermented foods reign supreme when it comes to vitamin K2. Bacteria produce it during fermentation, so foods like natto (fermented soybeans), sauerkraut, kefir, and cheeses like gouda, brie, and cheddar pack a punch when it comes to K2. Two other excellent choices are grass-fed butter and pastured egg yolks.

When choosing a supplement, opt for the MK-7 form of K2, as it stays in your bloodstream longer, providing more benefits to your heart health.

CoQ10

CoQ10 does two critical things. It sparks energy production in your body’s cells, including your heart. Plus, it scavenges and destroys free radicals that cause cardiovascular problems and heart disease. Fueling your body with CoQ10 is one of the most important things you can do for your heart.

CoQ10 is an antioxidant. It helps prevent artery calcification by reducing the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. It also regenerates nitric oxide to improve blood flow.

The bioavailable form of CoQ10 is Ubiquinol, which provides eight times more absorption and works better for people over 45.

For a supplement that combines ubiquinol with vitamin K2, see the link below.

Vitamin D.

Vitamin D helps increase the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines.

There are a few decent food sources of vitamin D: fatty fish, cod liver oil, pastured egg yolks, mushrooms exposed to UV light, beef liver, and fortified foods.

When supplementing, take vitamin D3 with vitamin K2. Multiple studies have shown that taking MK-7 plus vitamin D over six months to 2 years slows artery calcification more than vitamin D alone.

B Vitamins.

Homocysteine is a double-edged amino acid that plays a crucial role in building proteins but can be harmful when levels become too high.

Eating protein-rich foods like meats, seafood, dairy, eggs, sesame seeds, and Brazil nuts converts the amino acid methionine to homocysteine.

B vitamins, specifically B12, B6, and B9 or folate, help regulate homocysteine levels by breaking it down into other beneficial substances, leaving only a trace in the bloodstream.

High homocysteine levels can cause significant damage to arterial walls. It can also trigger excessive clotting, obstructing blood flow to critical body areas and potentially leading to heart attacks, accelerated dementia, and strokes.

To consume all three, B12, B6, and folate, in foods, choose beef liver, salmon, pastured eggs, grass-fed milk and yogurt, fortified cereals, lentils, spinach, asparagus, and avocado.

When supplementing, choose a liposomal B complex for better absorption.

Magnesium.

Magnesium is vital in various bodily functions, including muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation, and bone health.

Up to 80% of adults are not getting enough magnesium because it’s depleted in the soil. This can be serious, because your heart cannot function properly without adequate magnesium.

Magnesium prevents muscle spasms of the heart arteries, which increases the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack.

Together with vitamins K2 and D3, magnesium stops calcium from forming inside the plaque. Higher magnesium intake has been associated with reduced markers of calcium plaque in the arteries.

There are many forms of magnesium. Get 7 types of magnesium in one supplement at the link below.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/coffee-chocolate-smarter/,"Coffee and Chocolate Make You Smarter, According to the Latest Neuroscience","The brain is a very delicate organ. And while exercising as well as meditating have been found to help keep the brain young, there are also other things you can do to protect it, such as drinking coffee. Over the last decade, dozens of studies have been made in regards to coffee and the brain. Among these studies, the following three are definitely worth sharing for their breakthrough findings. (updated Sept 23, 2023)

The Big Three

First, in a joint study from the National Institute of Aging and Johns Hopkins University, researchers discovered that methylxanthines, such as caffeine “has clear effects on neuronal network activity, promotes sustained cognitive performance and can protect neurons against dysfunction and death in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.” In that same study, researchers found that when the brain metabolized caffeine, xanthine metabolites were released and were found to “also contribute to the beneficial effects of coffee, tea and cacao on brain health.”

Second, a meta-analysis of 11 studies on how coffee affects brain health showed that both coffee and tea reduced the risks of developing alzheimer’s disease and brain cancer.

Lastly, a novel study at Okayama University, “indicated that intake of coffee components, CA and CGA, enhanced the antioxidative properties of glial cells and prevents rotenone-induced neurodegeneration in both the brain and myenteric plexus.”

In layman’s terms, caffeine makes your brain more flexible and resilient. If you want to keep your brain healthy throughout the years, coffee, tea and cacao should be part of your diet. 

How Much Caffeine Should I Consume?

Studies recommend a daily limit intake of 400mg of caffeine within a single dose (1). Therefore you can safely consume four to five cups (8oz/cup) spread out throughout the day. Ideally you consume most of it before to 2pm so that it doesn’t disturb your sleep. This works very well with intermittent fasting as caffeine also helps suppress your appetite. It’s the perfect combo for protecting your brain while also losing fat. For obvious reasons, you should also make an effort to avoid using any sugar or creamers when drinking coffee or tea.

If you’re not a fan of coffee, don’t forget that you can substitute it with dark chocolate or tea. Here’s a helpful chart to help you figure out how much you would need from different sources (2).

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-destroy-your-heart/,Top 5 Foods that Destroy Your Heart,"In this video, ​we take a deep dive into the top 5 foods hiding in your kitchen that could cause devastating damage to your heart and blood vessels. Chilling? Yes. Preventable? Absolutely!

This is an important topic to understand, as cardiovascular disease, or heart disease, is the leading cause of death globally. It accounts for 20 million deaths each year, and includes heart attack and stroke.

This video will clear up a lot of misinformation about what causes heart disease, and arm you with the crucial knowledge and tips to transform your diet and heart health immediately. So, if you’re ready, let’s get into it.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider about any changes to your health regimen.

First, let’s understand the real cause of heart disease.

Heart disease is caused by damage to the blood vessels or arteries that supply the heart. There are two main factors that initiate this damage – inflammation and oxidative stress.

Inflammation is your body’s natural response to injury or infection. But chronic inflammation over time can damage your arteries. Oxidative stress is the imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in your body. Too many free radicals can harm your blood vessels.

So, what causes chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in the first place?

The number one cause of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress is insulin resistance. This is when your cells become resistant to the effects of the hormone insulin.

Insulin resistance is common, especially in people who are overweight or have diabetes. It leads to higher levels of sugar and fat in the blood, which causes more inflammation and oxidative stress. Current data show that 20-40% of adults in Western countries are insulin resistant.

However, it’s important to know that heart disease can still occur even without insulin resistance. Other potential causes include toxins from smoking, heavy metals, leaky gut, bacterial infections, chronic stress, nutrient deficiencies, and unhealthy fats.

So, what causes insulin resistance?

The key drivers of insulin resistance are obesity, a sedentary and stressful lifestyle, and overeating foods high in refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and vegetable oils. The signs of insulin resistance a doctor may look for include an expanded waistline, high blood pressure, skin tags, and dark, velvety skin. Insulin resistance is the root cause of type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, and cardiovascular disease. 

Next, let’s understand how insulin resistance leads to heart disease.

So, insulin is a hormone released by the pancreas that helps get glucose or sugar from the blood into the cells, so your body can use it for energy.

If you become resistant to insulin, your cells cannot use insulin at the rate at which it is being produced. This causes high levels of sugar to remain in your blood. It also causes high insulin levels, because your body compensates by increasing insulin production when it senses high sugar levels.

Now, high levels of sugar and insulin inflame and damage the layer of endothelial cells inside your blood vessels, and this leads to more oxidative stress.

It also causes LDL cholesterol particles in the blood to become oxidized or chemically modified. Oxidized LDL is more likely to stick to artery walls and build up into plaque, along with fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium, and fibrin, and heavily increase inflammation. This plaque accumulation is called atherosclerosis.

So now, your damaged arteries narrow instead of opening wide, and become stiffer over time. This makes it harder for blood to flow and your blood pressure rises. As inflammation continues and immune cells attack the plaque, it can rupture and form blood clots that lead to heart attack or stroke.

Insulin resistance also leads to fat buildup, especially visceral fat, and metabolic syndrome. That’s because insulin is a fat-storage hormone, and when your insulin levels are high, your body won’t burn fat. Visceral fat and obesity are directly linked to heart disease.

So, to summarize this process: insulin resistance promotes high blood sugar and insulin, which leads to inflammation and oxidative stress, which then damages blood vessels, oxidizes LDL, increases belly fat, and accelerates atherosclerosis.

Fortunately, it’s possible to reverse insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes and heart disease, through lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, stress management, a balanced diet with anti-inflammatory foods, and by avoiding certain foods.

Now, let’s get into the 5 foods that increase the risk of heart attack and stroke you’ll want to avoid.
We begin with Number 5. “Added Sugar and Artificial Sweeteners”.

Added sugar refers to sugar carbohydrates added to food and beverages during processing, cooking or before eating. They include sucrose (table sugar), glucose (dextrose), high-fructose corn syrup, honey, syrups, and fruit juices.

Consuming too much sugar contributes to insulin resistance. It causes extreme fluctuations in your blood sugar, triggers widespread inflammation, and raises your oxidized LDL cholesterol to dangerous levels.

Excess blood sugar causes glycation inside your body, in which substances called Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) speed up the aging process, and damage your organs, skin, joints, and arteries over time. This is why type 2 diabetics look older than their real age. They need to cut back on their consumption of added sugar, including fruit.

The number one source of added sugars in the American diet is sugary drinks, which provides over 35% of added sugar intake. Sugary drinks include soft drinks, fruit drinks, sweetened teas and coffees, energy drinks, and sports drinks.

So, what is too much sugar? A 12-ounce soda contains around 39 grams of sugar or approximately nine teaspoons. This is already more than the daily added sugar limit of 6 teaspoons recommended by the American Heart Association for women, and equal to the daily limit of 9 teaspoons for men.

A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2014, found that people who got 17% to 21% of their calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease compared to those who consumed 8% of their calories as added sugar.

From this evidence, it’s clear that anyone who consumes 1-2 cans of sugary drinks a day, in addition to other sources of dietary sugar, is setting themselves up for heart disease, not to mention fatty liver, and type 2 diabetes.

While artificial sweeteners, such as erythritol and aspartame, used in diet soda, table sweeteners and dairy-based foods are not defined as added sugar, these synthetic sugar substitutes may do more harm than good.

A 2017 published paper from the Boston University School of Medicine, suggests that people who consume more than one artificially-sweetened beverage per day may be up to three times more likely to suffer from a stroke or dementia. Researchers believe these effects may be due to the chemicals used to replace sugar, potentially altering the gut’s microbiome and causing negative health effects.

Other than sugary drinks and table sugar, the top sources of added sugar to avoid are desserts and sweet snacks, such as cookies, candy, ice-cream, pastries, sweet spreads like jams, breakfast cereals, flavored yogurts and milk, and baked goods, such as breads and muffins.

The next major culprit is Number 4. “Carbohydrates”.

Carbohydrates are mostly made up of sugar. Overeating carbs, especially refined grains like white rice and bread, causes large spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels and increases age-accelerating AGEs in your body. This can lead to insulin resistance over time, potentially progressing to prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Studies show that diabetics are 2 to 4 times more likely than others to develop cardiovascular disease.

Carbohydrates are a vital source of energy your body uses. So, the solution is to reduce the intake of refined carbs and also complex carbs, such as oatmeal and quinoa, even though they are slower to cause blood sugar to rise. Also, eating carbs along with fiber, protein and fats, such as meat, fish, nuts and vegetables, slows down the digestion of carbs, and prevents blood sugar spikes.

One food to avoid if possible is wheat, even whole wheat. Most people do not know that wheat contains an unusual type of carbohydrate called amylopectin, which some tests have revealed can spike your blood sugar higher than even pure table sugar. Furthermore, wheat contains gluten, which causes your gut to become inflamed and leaky, as well as antinutrients such as phytates and lectins, which block your body’s absorption of minerals like zinc, iron, manganese, and calcium.

Next, the #1 worst food for your heart. Number 3 is “Vegetable Oils and Trans Fats”.

There are three reasons why you should avoid vegetable oils like soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil, safflower oil, and cottonseed oil, to prevent heart disease and other health problems.

First, all vegetable oils are refined, and they contain some trans fats due to the extremely high heat, solvents, and pressure they are exposed to during the refining process. It doesn’t matter if the labels on the bottles say they are partially hydrogenated, or even non-hydrogenated. You already know why trans fats are deadly. They damage your cell membranes and cause cancer, obesity, Alzheimer’s, and heart disease.

Second, the polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils become oxidized fats during processing. These oxidized fats are mutated, and they damage cell membranes and cause massive inflammation leading to dysfunction in the arteries. I have included links to the studies below.

This damage is intensified when the vegetable oils are repeatedly reheated, such as when deep frying chicken, French fries and doughnuts. Other than oxidizing fats, deep frying also produces AGEs and toxic compounds such as acrylamide, and HCAs. Frequently consuming these compounds from fried foods is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and other chronic diseases.

Third, another major reason why vegetable oils can clog your arteries is because they are mostly made up of inflammatory omega-6 fats, while having very little anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats. A  2:1 or even 1:1 for your omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is considered healthy, but most vegetable oils skew your ratio as high as 20:1 or even 30:1 in favor of harmful inflammatory omega-6 fats. And remember, these are the oxidized polyunsatured fats, not the healthy kind found in nuts.

The solution is to replace vegetable oils with healthy oils like coconut oil, olive oil, macadamia oil, avocado oil, and grass-fed butter, all of which do not cause any of the health problems we’ve mentioned.

Now, vegetable oils and trans fats are found in almost all processed packaged foods. They include baked goods like biscuits, crackers, and cakes, frozen foods like pizza, coffee creamers, whipped toppings, margarine, and snacks like potato chips.

Now, before we get to the last two foods, let’s talk about saturated fats.

Since the 1950s, we’ve been told by the media that saturated fat from animal products like full-fat cheese and butter, and red meat raises cholesterol and causes heart disease.

But, over the decades, the “fact” that saturated fats are bad for you has never been proven by any legitimate studies.

Although saturated fat intake does increase your “bad” LDL cholesterol, it actually increases your “good” HDL cholesterol even more, hence improving your overall cholesterol ratio.

Then, there’s evidence that saturated fat may actually be good for you. People who eat a diet rich in natural saturated fats, like certain tribes in Africa who eat lots of whole milk and red meat, have extremely low body fat levels, and heart disease and diabetes are virtually non-existant.

In fact, saturated fats like grass-fed butter and cream, dark chocolate with 72% cocoa and higher, and coconut milk and oil, can actually help you live longer. In particular, grass-fed dairy is an amazing source of vitamin K2, conjugated linoleic acid, and Omega-3 fats that prevent artery clogging and may even reverse heart disease.

Next, let’s talk about Number 2, “Ultra Processed Foods”.

Many of the foods we have mentioned are ultra-processed foods (UPF).

These include frozen meals, soft drinks, hot dogs, bacon, salami, lunch meats, and deli meats, processed cheeses like American cheese or cheese spreads, yogurt that’s loaded with sugar or artificial sweeteners, packaged cookies, cakes, and salty snacks.

UPF refers to industrial formulations with 5 or more ingredients. It is addictive and harmful to the heart due to the high levels of sugar, sodium or salt, fats, additives, and lack of nutrition. There’s little or no whole food that gives you vital vitamins and minerals.

According to a study in the British Medical Journal, UPF makes up 58% of the calories eaten in the U.S. and contributes almost 90% of the energy from added sugars.

These highly-modified foods disrupt the gut microbiome, and cause the gut lining to leak toxins, bacteria and large food particles into the bloodstream, triggering inflammation. This increases plaque and hardening of the coronary arteries.

Fortunately, once you stop eating ultra-processed foods, your body starts to heal itself.

And at Number 1, we have “Alcohol”.

Drinking alcohol can damage your heart and lead to heart disease in several ways.

Alcohol consumption can increase insulin resistance, due to the direct effects of alcohol on the liver, which plays a crucial role in the storage and release of glucose. It can also interfere with the normal functioning of the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that helps with insulin action.

Heavy alcohol intake can lead to weight gain and high blood pressure. Long-term heavy drinking can damage the heart muscle, causing a condition called alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which weakens the heart and makes it less effective at pumping blood. Binge drinking, in particular, can cause irregular heart rhythms called arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, which is a quivering heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.

Some types of alcoholic drinks are worse for the heart than others, such as sugary cocktails like piña coladas and margaritas, Long Island Iced Teas, rum and soda, and high-alcohol craft beers. Healthier alcoholic drink options for the heart include red wine, light beer, and vodka or gin with zero-calorie mixers like soda water. However, no alcohol is completely safe, and moderation is key. This means one drink per day for women and one to two drinks per day for men.

Testosterone levels help regulate everything from sex drive and mood to the rate of muscle recovery after exercise. When levels become low, it can negatively impact a man’s health and mental well-being.

Take a look at these symptoms of low testosterone and if required consult with a doctor to learn about possible low testosterone treatment options that are available to you.

1. Decreased Libido

Sexual desire is tied directly to testosterone levels. A study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism determined that libido and testosterone were “strongly” related, low levels generally meant low sex drive[1].

The study did call for additional research, as some individuals did not report lower sex drives with low testosterone levels. Regardless, decreased libido is a recognized symptom that signals testosterone levels might be falling.

2. Depression

Testosterone helps regulate the mental state of men. Some studies indicate that low testosterone caused by age is a primary contributor to depression in older men[2].

Additional studies have investigated the link between testosterone and mood, particularly the argument that higher levels of testosterone have a positive effect[3]. Most research recommends hormone therapy for older men experiencing the mood fluctuations associated with low testosterone levels.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 10, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/what-happens-when-you-take-fish-oil/,What Happens When You Take Fish Oil for 90 Days,"Today, let’s look at what happens to your body when you consume fish oil every day over a period of 90 days and more. We also give you important tips to consider if you plan to supplement with fish oil, so you can get the best results. Many people are not aware of these tips, so make sure you watch till the end.

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats that your body cannot produce on its own, making it necessary to obtain them from external sources, such as fish and fish oil supplements. These two components – fish oil and omega-3s – work synergistically to promote optimal health.

Without further delay, let’s look at the benefits of taking fish oil, starting with:

Anti-Inflammatory Powers of Fish Oil

One of the most well-known and researched benefits of fish oil is its anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation has been linked to a range of health issues, including heart disease, arthritis, and even certain types of cancer. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play a crucial role in reducing inflammation throughout the body. 

Imagine your body as a battleground, where inflammation is the enemy causing damage and havoc. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil act as powerful soldiers fighting against this inflammation, helping restore peace and balance within.

When we consume fish oil supplements or incorporate foods rich in omega-3s into our diet, these fatty acids work at a cellular level to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. They also promote the production of anti-inflammatory molecules, creating a more harmonious internal environment.

Studies have shown that regular consumption of fish oil can significantly reduce inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). By decreasing these markers, fish oil may help alleviate symptoms in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Not only does fish oil combat inflammation internally, but it also has benefits for external inflammation-related issues. For instance, studies have shown that consuming omega-3s can improve skin conditions such as acne and psoriasis. It helps by reducing overall redness, swelling, and the severity of skin lesions. Fish oil’s anti-inflammatory properties can also enhance wound healing by speeding up the inflammatory response, which is essential for initiating the repair process.

Next, one major area where fish oil supplements have gained the most attention is their potential to:

Support Heart Health

The EPA and DHA fatty acids in fish oil contribute to reducing inflammation in the arteries, which is a key factor in developing heart disease. According to the American Heart Association, consuming 1 gram of omega-3s per day can significantly reduce cardiovascular diseases by approximately 10%.

Studies suggest that taking fish oil supplements can help lower the risk of certain cardiovascular conditions, such as coronary artery disease and high blood pressure. Even in small doses, it has been shown to decrease the blood pressure of those suffering from hypertension. And fish oil may prevent the development of plaques that cause arteries to harden, as well as make arterial plaques more stable and safer in those who already have them. However, these benefits may vary depending on factors like dosage and individual differences.

Another primary way fish oil supports heart health is by reducing triglyceride levels in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides in their blood are more likely to suffer from coronary artery disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular issues.

A randomized controlled trial involving individuals with high triglyceride levels found that taking prescription omega-3 fatty acid medications significantly reduced triglyceride levels compared to a placebo group.

In addition, fish oil supplements also play a role in:

Balancing Cholesterol and Triglyceride Levels

Cholesterol management is vital for maintaining a healthy heart, and fish oil supplements can contribute to achieving this goal.

Consuming fish or taking fish oil supplements rich in EPA and DHA has been associated with increased HDL cholesterol levels. Higher HDL cholesterol is linked to better heart health as it helps remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream, reducing the risk of oxidation and plaque buildup in the arteries.

While the impact on LDL cholesterol is less pronounced, studies suggest that fish oil supplements can modestly lower LDL cholesterol levels. However, it’s worth noting that this effect seems to occur mostly in individuals with elevated triglyceride levels.

It’s important to mention that other lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, also play crucial roles in managing cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

For example, a study conducted on 18,645 adults found that individuals who consumed fish regularly had significantly lower total cholesterol levels compared to those who did not consume fish. This supports the idea that incorporating fish or fish oil supplements into one’s diet can have positive impacts on heart health.

Think of balancing cholesterol and triglyceride levels as a delicate dance where the omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil seamlessly harmonize with your body’s biochemistry, working together to promote a healthy cardiovascular system.

Next, let’s now turn our focus to another area where fish oil supplements show great promise:

Brain and Mental Health

Did you know that your brain is made up of nearly 60% fat, and much of this fat is omega-3 fatty acids? Both EPA and DHA fatty acids in omega-3 are important, but DHA may be more important when it comes to brain health. That’s because DHA is the predominant fatty acid in the brain and eye tissue, where it is several hundred times more abundant than EPA.

Studies have shown that fish oil can raise the amount of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a vital growth factor for the brain and central nervous system that plays a key role in cognitive function, mood, and mental health. One of the primary ways BDNF contributes to brain health is by supporting neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt and form new connections between neurons, facilitating learning and memory processes.

Omega-3 fatty acids serve as building blocks for cell membranes in the brain, ensuring optimal communication between nerve cells and enhancing cognitive functions.

Furthermore, fish oil exerts anti-inflammatory effects within the brain, reducing inflammation that can arise from factors such as oxidative stress or neurodegenerative diseases. By modulating inflammation, fish oil supplementation may help alleviate symptoms associated with conditions like depression, anxiety, and age-related cognitive decline.

Studies showed a 13% decrease in the risk of brain-related declines, like dementia and Alzheimer’s disease with higher omega-3 intake. And a 2014 metaanalysis found that regular consumption of fish oil supplements containing high levels of EPA, could decrease symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder by approximately 30%.

So, if someone you know has been struggling with chronic stress and experiencing feelings of anxiety, introducing fish oil into their diet could potentially provide relief by reducing inflammation in the brain and promoting a more balanced mood.

In addition to its impact on general mental health, fish oil has also shown promise in:

Reducing Symptoms of Neurodevelopment Disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders encompass a range of conditions characterized by atypical development of the brain and nervous system. Examples include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and dyslexia.

Fish oil supplementation has been investigated as a potential intervention for alleviating symptoms associated with these disorders. That’s because the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil help to regulate neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers in the brain.

Studies have shown that supplementing with fish oil can improve attention and focus in individuals with ADHD, potentially reducing impulsivity and hyperactivity.

Think of fish oil as the conductor of a symphony, harmonizing the neurotransmitter communication in the brain to promote better focus and control.

Moreover, omega-3 fatty acids may support cognitive function in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Some studies have indicated that fish oil supplements could enhance language and social skills while reducing repetitive behaviors often associated with autism.

It’s important to note that fish oil should be considered as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for neurodevelopmental disorders, involving appropriate medical and therapeutic interventions. Always consult with healthcare professionals before incorporating any supplements into one’s regimen, especially for children.

Now, let’s explore the other diverse ways fish oil can positively impact our well-being.

Diverse Health Benefits
Joint Health: Fish oil’s anti-inflammatory properties have shown promising results in reducing joint pain and stiffness associated with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. By mitigating inflammation, and providing lubrication and nourishment to the joints, fish oil can contribute to improved joint mobility and overall comfort for those with joint-related issues.
Skin Health: Omega-3 fatty acids help maintain healthy skin by supporting its natural barrier function. Fish oil supplements are known to alleviate skin disorders such as psoriasis and eczema or atopic dermatitis, reducing redness, itching, and scaling associated with these conditions. They may also contribute to skin hydration, promoting a youthful appearance.
Eye Health: While evidence regarding fish oil’s effect on preventing eye diseases is still emerging, studies suggest that consuming omega-3s may reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and dry eyes. Including fish oil supplements in your diet may be beneficial for maintaining good eye health.
Pregnancy Support: Omega-3 fatty acids are essential during pregnancy for fetal brain development. Supplementing with fish oil during pregnancy has been linked to improved infant visual development, reduced risk of allergies, and protective effects against preterm birth complications.
Liver Function: Fish oil supplementation may aid in improving liver function and reducing fat accumulation in individuals dealing with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3s contribute to better liver health.

Next, let’s look at:

How to Supplement with Fish Oil

Here are some suggestions and considerations if you plan to consume fish oil every day:

Look for a high-quality supplement that is in the natural triglyceride form, and clearly states the amount of EPA and DHA per serving on the label. You may want to choose one with a high DHA to EPA ratio, like the one we recommend below.

Choose fish oil that has been purified through molecular distillation or supercritical CO2 extraction to remove contaminants like heavy metals and toxins.

Look for enteric-coated capsules that help prevent burping up the taste of fish.

A supplement containing vitamin E as an antioxidant can prevent oxidation and rancidity. To maintain freshness, store your fish oil supplements away from light, or in the refrigerator.

Be sure not to use any supplements that have a rancid smell or are past their expiration date.

​It is recommended to consume fish oil supplements with a meal that contains fat. This helps improve the absorption of omega-3 fatty acids, allowing your body to make the most of them.

Begin by taking 1 gram (1000 mg) of fish oil per day. Over time, you can gradually increase your dosage to 2-4 grams per day for optimal results. If you have any specific health concerns or conditions, it’s best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dosage recommendations.

For reference, a typical 1,000-mg fish oil softgel generally contains about 250 mg of combined EPA and DHA, while one teaspoon (5 ml) of liquid fish oil packs in around 1,300 mg. According to the European Food Safety Authority, omega-3 fatty acid supplements can be safely consumed at doses up to 5,000 mg daily.

While fish oil is generally safe for most individuals when taken in recommended doses, it’s important to be aware of potential risks and side effects.

The most commonly reported side effects include gastrointestinal issues such as fishy aftertaste, bad breath, indigestion, nausea, or loose stools. These symptoms can often be minimized by taking the supplement with a meal or switching to enteric-coated capsules that help prevent burping up the taste of fish.

If you have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to fish or seafood, it is advisable to avoid fish oil supplements. It may trigger allergic reactions such as itching, hives, swelling, or even anaphylaxis in severe cases.

It’s important to note that fish oil has blood-thinning properties and may increase the risk of bleeding in individuals with bleeding disorders or those taking blood-thinning medications.

For vegans and other individuals who want a direct source of EPA and DHA without consuming fish, algal oil supplements are a viable option.

Plant-based foods with omega-3s, such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, contain ALA, and not the EPA and DHA your body needs. While ALA can be converted to EPA and DHA in the body, the process is remarkably inefficient. One estimate is that only 0.5% is converted.

Lastly, avoid overdosing on fish oil, as it can cause gastrointestinal discomfort and increase the risk of bleeding.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/8-simple-tips-to-stop-snoring-naturally/,8 Easy Tips To Help You Stop Snoring Naturally,"Snoring can be a major problem when it comes to sleeping, both for the snorer and their spouse. How do you stop snoring naturally? Here are 8 simple tips to help you.

1. Sleep on Your Side

One of the simplest ways to stop snoring is to change your sleep position. When you sleep on your back “the base of your tongue and the soft palate collapse to the back wall of your throat,” according to WebMD.

This results in the vibrating sound associated with snoring. If you are having trouble maintaining this position then some suggestions have been to use a full body pillow which encourages you to sleep on your side.

2. No Alcohol Before Bed

Not only can alcohol encourage snoring but it has also been found to have negative effects on sleep apnea and some people who snored before without this condition showed signs of it after drinking alcohol before bed [1].

3. Control Allergens in Your Home and Bedroom

Another problem that may be contributing towards your snoring are allergens in your home, in your bedroom or in your pillows. Try changing your pillows, make sure everything is well dusted and keep pets out of the bedroom.

4. Clear Your Nasal Passages Before Bed

Snoring may often occur when you have colds, flu or other nasal problems whereby the nasal passages become blocked. Try taking a hot shower or using a saltwater rinse to clear nasal passages before bed if the snoring seems to be coming from your nose.

5. Stay Well Hydrated

We’ve all heard of the importance of drinking plenty of water and keeping hydrated and it is no different when it comes to snoring. Not being properly hydrated can actually lead to more snoring. So make sure you are getting enough water daily.

6. Stop Smoking

Smoking increases your risk of both snoring and sleep apnea by inflaming your nasal passages and causing other throat issues. If you currently smoke and want to stop snoring then try giving up cigarettes [2]. Not only can smoking cause snoring but also a host of other, more serious, diseases and disorders.

7. Use Herbal Remedies and Aromatherapy

A number of herbs and essential oils can assist with relieving snoring and the advantage with these is that often they don’t only treat the symptoms but also the cause. Herbs that open up the airways such as Echinacea and Fenugreek and others such as ginger can be particularly helpful in combating snoring.

8. Try a Mouth Guard or Other Stop-Snoring Equipment

Some people have had success using a mouth guard to stop snoring which helps to support the mouth and jaw. Speak to your doctor or dentist about what options may be available to you and what would work best in your specific situation.

Snoring can be a real problem when it comes to getting a good night’s rest and result in fatigue and problems during the day. Try these natural solutions to stop snoring and get some good rest.

By addressing issues head-on instead of burying them under the surface, couples can work together to find solutions and grow closer in the process.

It Displays Care and Investment in the Relationship

Couples who argue in a civilized way demonstrate care and investment in their relationship. When partners are willing to engage in open and honest discussions, it shows that they value each other’s opinions and want to resolve issues together.

By actively listening, respecting each other’s feelings, and finding solutions, they create a sense of trust and commitment. This willingness to address differences and work through challenges is a clear sign that both individuals are dedicated to the growth and success of their relationship.

How to Argue the Right Way

Respect and value each other’s feelings, focus on solvable issues, and avoid absolutes in your argument. Read more to learn effective strategies for arguing in a healthy relationship.

Respect and Value Each Other’s Feelings

Couples who argue in a healthy and respectful way understand the importance of respecting and valuing each other’s feelings. They recognize that everyone has their own emotions, perspectives, and experiences, which deserve to be acknowledged and respected.

By showing respect towards each other’s feelings during an argument, couples create a safe space for open communication and understanding. This fosters trust, strengthens the emotional bond between partners, and allows them to work through disagreements with compassion and empathy.

Focus on Solvable Issues

Couples should focus on addressing solvable issues when arguing in their relationship. Instead of getting caught up in endless arguments about unresolved problems, it is important to prioritize the ones that can actually be resolved.

By focusing on solvable issues, couples can work together to find solutions and move forward, rather than getting stuck in a cycle of conflict. This approach allows couples to effectively communicate and understand each other’s perspectives, leading to greater intimacy and relationship growth.

So rather than dwelling on unchangeable differences or past mistakes, it is beneficial for couples to direct their energy towards finding resolutions that will strengthen their bond.

Avoid Absolutes in Your Argument

Using absolutes in your argument can be counterproductive and escalate the conflict. When you use words like “always” or “never,” it can make your partner feel attacked and defensive.

Instead, focus on expressing how you feel and what specific behaviors or actions are bothering you. This allows for open communication and encourages a more productive resolution to the issue at hand.

Remember that arguments should be about finding solutions, not proving who is right or wrong. By avoiding absolutes, you create an atmosphere of understanding and compromise that will strengthen your relationship in the long run.

It’s not surprising; there are people who skillfully project a well-intentioned facade, aptly described as “wolves in sheep’s clothing.” In this article, we guide you through identifying these deceptive personas and safeguarding yourself from their manipulative tactics.

Let’s unravel the wolf-ish mystery together!

Key Takeaways
Wolves in sheep’s clothing appear innocent but have dangerous intentions.
Signs of a wolf include a love for power, resistance to correction, manipulation using emotions, and a lack of the Fruit of the Spirit.
To detect a wolf, pay attention to their actions, ask probing questions, watch for inconsistencies in their story, and observe impatience and troubled behavior.
Understanding the Concept of “A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing”

The term “wolf in sheep’s clothing” paints a vivid picture of deceit and cunning. This phrase hints at a character who appears innocent and harmless on the surface, much like harmless sheep, yet underneath harbors dangerous intentions similar to that of a predatory wolf.

The concept goes back to Biblical times with its origin credited to one of Jesus’ warnings about false prophets in Matthew 7:15.

These deceitful individuals or ‘wolves’ disguise themselves as benign entities while they subtly carry out their harmful actions unnoticed. They could very well be your charming neighbor next door, an influential figure you admire, or even someone within your circle of trust.

Essentially, these wolves possess ulterior motives beneath their convincing disguises, aiming for self-gain or causing harm without showing apparent signs till it’s too late.

Such characters often resort to manipulation and use emotions as their tools of trade for personal benefit—crafting impeccable reputations while destroying those who stand in their way from behind the scenes.

Recognizing such people can prove challenging unless you’re aware of the subtle signs they exhibit—a love for power and control, coupled with refusal to accept correction or criticism, highlights some red flags.

However unlikely we may think it is to come across these individuals—the reality is quite different; workplace competition or casual social gatherings aren’t exempted from spotting such personalities either! Understanding this concept isn’t just important—it’s essential not only for maintaining strong personal relationships but also crucial when selecting team members for workplace tasks or entrusting significant responsibilities.

Signs of a Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing

– They love power and themselves.

– They refuse correction and respond to criticism with anger.

– They use emotions to get what they want.

– They lack the fruit of the Spirit.

They Love Power and Themselves

Wolves in sheep’s clothing often harbour a deep-seated affection for power and control. They itch to dominate every situation, ruling with an iron fist hidden beneath the soft wool of their disguise.

They are driven by self-interest and have a self-beneficial mindset, constantly seeking ways to elevate themselves above others.

These individuals take pleasure in being at the top of the hierarchy, relishing positions where they can wield authority over others. Their love for power is directly proportionate to their love for themselves – they place their desires, aspirations and needs above anything or anyone else.

Self-love morphs into narcissism as they bask in their own perceived superiority, trampling over other people’s perspectives and feelings without remorse or consideration.

They Refuse Correction and Respond to Criticism with Anger

People who act as wolves in sheep’s clothing share a notable trait: they resist correction and explode with fury when facing criticism. This sign is conspicuous, yet often overlooked due to their charming exterior.

They could present a facade of humility, only for their hidden arrogance to flare up during moments of critique or correction. Rather than accepting feedback gracefully, these individuals may lash out in anger as an attempt to deflect the spotlight from their wrongdoings.

It’s not just about refusing correction; it’s about the inability or unwillingness to introspect, self-evaluate and change for betterment. Their immediate knee-jerk reaction displays a lack of understanding and emotional maturity which is essential for personal growth and constructive relationships.

They Use Emotions to Get What They Want

Wolves in sheep’s clothing often take advantage of others’ emotions to achieve their selfish goals. They spin a web of deceit, carefully constructing their tactics around empathy and sympathy.

These individuals have mastered emotional manipulation, skillfully using it as a tool for personal gain or power. Their attractive exterior is merely a disguise used to cloud their ulterior motives and twist the truth.

They lack the Fruit of the Spirit

A key sign of a wolf in sheep’s clothing is their lack of the Fruit of the Spirit. The Fruit of the Spirit, as described in Galatians 5:22-23, includes qualities like love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

These are characteristics that reflect a person’s connection to God and their genuine relationship with Him. A true follower of Christ will strive to exhibit these traits in their words and actions.

However, a wolf in sheep’s clothing will often lack these qualities and instead demonstrate selfishness, manipulation, aggression or other sinful behaviors. Their actions reveal their true nature and highlight their deviation from God’s teachings.

How to Detect a Wolf in Disguise

To detect a wolf in disguise, you need to know what’s real so you can spot the phony, ask questions (the more the better), watch out for inconsistencies in their story, and observe their impatience and troubled behavior.

Know What’s Real So You Can Spot the Phony

Knowing what is real is crucial in identifying a wolf in sheep’s clothing. To spot the phony, keep these key points in mind:

Pay attention to their actions: Look for consistent behavior that aligns with their words.
Trust your instincts: If something feels off or doesn’t sit right with you, listen to your gut feeling.
Do your research: Investigate their background, credentials, and reputation to gather more information.
Look for evidence: Seek tangible proof or factual support for their claims or promises.
Watch for inconsistencies: Notice any contradictions or discrepancies in their stories or explanations.
Don’t be fooled by charm alone: While they may appear friendly and charismatic, look beyond surface-level charm to assess their true intentions.
Question everything: Ask probing questions to gauge their knowledge, motivations, and genuine beliefs.
Look for patterns: Identify recurring behaviors or patterns that may indicate ulterior motives or manipulative tactics.
Ask Questions, the More the Better
Be proactive in asking questions when interacting with others.
Don’t hesitate to inquire about their beliefs, motives, and intentions.
By asking more questions, you can gain a deeper understanding of the person’s true character.
Questioning helps reveal inconsistencies and falsehoods that may indicate someone is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
Engage in open and honest conversations to uncover any hidden agendas or ulterior motives.
The more questions you ask, the better equipped you’ll be to recognize deception and protect yourself from being misled.
Watch out for inconsistencies in their story

Pay close attention to any inconsistencies in the story they tell. Look for discrepancies or contradictions in their words and actions that could indicate deception. This can include:

Conflicting details: Take note if they provide different versions of events or change their story over time.
Inaccurate information: Pay attention to whether their statements align with known facts or if they make claims that seem far-fetched or unlikely.
Contradictory behavior: Observe if their actions contradict what they say, as this can be a sign of hidden motives or ulterior agendas.
Changing narratives: Notice if their story keeps evolving or if they frequently shift blame or deflect responsibility.
Dishonesty markers: Be alert for signs of lying, such as avoiding eye contact, excessive fidgeting, or inconsistent body language.
Observe their impatience and troubled behavior

Observe their impatience and troubled behavior:

Impatience may stem from early negative experiences and feelings of insecurity.
Wolves in sheep’s clothing may display a lack of emotion or show signs of being troubled.
When their goals are hindered, wolves can quickly become irritable.
Recognizing impatience and troubled behavior can help identify a potential wolf.
Dealing with an impatient person requires directness and addressing issues head – on.

Be vigilant

Stay alert and watchful. Keep your eyes open for any signs of a wolf in sheep’s clothing. False teachers can be cunning and manipulative, using their charm to deceive unsuspecting individuals.

They may appear kind and trustworthy on the surface, but underneath lies ulterior motives and a desire for personal gain. Don’t be fooled by their outward facade; stay vigilant in discerning the truth from falsehoods.

By knowing the real teachings of God’s word and surrounding yourself with other believers who have wisdom and insight, you can protect yourself from falling into their traps. Remember, it’s crucial to rely on the discernment given by God’s Spirit within you as you navigate through this spiritual battle against false prophets.

Know the real and you’ll know the fake too

Knowing the truth is the key to identifying deception. When we have a firm grasp on what is real and genuine, it becomes easier to recognize what is fake or deceitful. This applies not only to people but also to teachings and ideologies.

By immersing ourselves in God’s Word and seeking wisdom from His Spirit, we gain discernment that helps us distinguish between truth and falsehood. Understanding the signs of a wolf in sheep’s clothing allows us to navigate through spiritual battles with caution and protect ourselves from being deceived by those who twist scripture for their own ulterior motives.

Trust the discernment and wisdom of God’s Spirit living through your life

Trust in the discernment and wisdom of God’s Spirit within you as you navigate through the presence of wolves in sheep’s clothing. This divine guidance will help you identify false teachings, resist manipulation, and see through deceptive motives.

By relying on God’s Spirit, you can remain vigilant against those who seek to deceive and harm. Through prayer and a deep connection with God’s Word, allow His Spirit to lead you towards truth and protect you from falling into the traps set by those who disguise themselves as followers of Christ.

Surround yourself with other believers you know and trust

Surrounding yourself with other believers you know and trust is essential in navigating the presence of false prophets. These trustworthy individuals can provide guidance, support, and accountability when it comes to identifying and dealing with those who twist the truth.

While believers may have different opinions on certain matters, it is important to recognize that we all share a common enemy – the wolves in sheep’s clothing. By standing together and striving for unity in the body of Christ, we can remain strong in our faith and protect ourselves from falling prey to deceitful teachings.

Trusting in the discernment and wisdom of God’s Spirit within us, we can confidently navigate this spiritual battle while maintaining a steadfast commitment to living according to His Word.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 7, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-that-youre-holding-unto-negative-energy/,5 Signs You’re Holding Onto Negative Energy (And How To Let It Go),"Negative energy is like a poison that slowly but consistently steals your joy. If you’re surrounded by negative people at work or at home, it’s easy to absorb their energy without even noticing. Sometimes, you’re so immersed in your emotions that it’s hard to truly understand them. In times like this, look our for these 5 signs to get your life back on track. (Update Sep 7, 2023)

1. You Feel Guilty and Anxious

Do you lay in bed for long periods of time and think of your regrets? Do you get a rush of panic when you’re alone with your thoughts?

It may be hard to recognize this sign during the day, as you’re likely too busy with other thoughts to search deep within yourself and pull up the things you’ve absorbed subconsciously.

The most obvious sign of negativity overload is stress, fear, and difficulty sleeping. You may feel you heart beat faster, your muscles tighten, and breath becomes more shallow and quick as you try to catch some zzzs.

The easiest way to get out of this headspace is to take long deep breaths through one nostril and exhale through the other. Focus solely on your breath and let your emotions wash over you. Keep breathing. Soon enough, you’ll be lulled into a deep, restful sleep.

2. You No Longer Invest in Your Hobbies

Negative thoughts take all your energy away. They can make you feel emotionally exhausted and  cause you to lose the desire to do all the things you love. Just surviving from one day to the next can seem daunting and exhausting.

It’s important to break this cycle one step at a time. Start by doing one small thing you enjoy every day. It may be going for a walk after dinner, drinking your coffee outside before work, or even strolling through a park on your way home.

Get out of your house and spend time in nature to gather your thoughts and let go of everything that doesn’t serve you. Focus on the small things you can do to improve your mood and get you back on track. It may seem insignificant at first, but these little acts of self-love will bring you closer to your authentic self and release you from your funk.

3. Your Weight Fluctuates

Cravings, changes in appetite, and weight gain are tell-all signs of emotional unrest. You may think that everything is fine, but your heart and mind could be in a different place altogether.

When you’re feeling unmotivated, take the time to prepare yourself a well-balanced meal. It’s also a good idea to get your body moving and collect your thoughts through yoga and meditation. The more you take care of your body, the more your mind will be at peace.

4. You are Cranky and Irritable

When you’re stressed, you’re more likely to have a short fuse and very little patience. If you’re normally calm and collected but you’re easily irritated as of late, it’s a good idea to do a bit of soul-searching.

Get away from whatever is bothering you and spend a bit of time by yourself. It might be worth investing in a journal or reaching out to a psychologist to get a bit of perspective and a bit of help.

5. You Are Being Overly Judgmental

People are a mirror of ourselves. If you find yourself being overly critical or judgemental of others, it may be a good idea to take a good hard look at yourself.

What characteristics in others irritate you? You might be shifting blame for your unhappiness onto others. Remember that you are the only person responsible for your own happiness. Pick yourself up and let go of the negative emotions you’re clinging onto.

To get a little boost of happiness every day, keep a collection of your favourite quotes on your phone or around your home to remind you that there is always happiness to be found after a big challenge.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 7, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/different-types-of-magnesium-supplement/,You’ve Been Taking The Wrong Type of Magnesium All This Time,"Magnesium is a mineral essential for human health yet it doesn’t get the press it should. For example, magnesium is more important for bone health than calcium, for without it, calcium isn’t absorbed by bone cells. The fourth most plentiful mineral on the planet, magnesium is necessary for virtually every process in the human body, including creating DNA and proteins; regulating blood pressure and sugar levels; muscle, nerve, and brain function; and maintaining an active immune system. (Updated Sep 6, 2023)

Without enough magnesium, your body can’t produce the energy to do all the things you want and need it to do.

Chronic magnesium deficiency can manifest in any health malady, including: fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, high blood pressure, memory loss, asthma, tremors, insomnia, depression, chronic fatigue, osteoporosis, heart arrhythmia, and kidney stones.

The World Health Organization has estimated that seventy-five percent of Americans don’t get enough magnesium in their diets. (1)

The reasons why we may not be getting enough magnesium in our diets are many:

Immunological conditions like Chron’s disease and irritable bowel syndrome place a huge burden on the body as every cell is fighting or its life—literally.
Proton pump inhibitors are a type of drug used to treat gastrointestinal issues like ulcers, acid reflux, and heartburn—many are over-the-counter and are greatly over-used. These work by blocking normal cell activity, thereby keeping magnesium from penetrating cells. (2)
Chronic stress
Use of diuretics
Medications: corticosteroids, insulin, antibiotics
Too much salt
Too much coffee, soda, or alcohol
Not enough magnesium-rich foods

C. Norman Sheal, MD, PhD is a neurosurgeon and pain management expert. He has this to say about magnesium deficiency:

“Every known illness is associated with a magnesium deficiency…magnesium is the most critical mineral required for electrical stability of every cell in the body. A magnesium deficiency may be responsible for more diseases than any other nutrient .“ (3)

Magnesium’s importance, therefore, can’t be over-emphasized but very few people recognize it.

Seven Different Types of Magnesium

There are seven different types of magnesium, in the sense that when combined with other compounds, the magnesium behaves differently to fulfill its different roles in the body. The bioavailability of magnesium is rather low; it’s meant to work together with other substances.

Below are magnesium compounds to consider for supplementing to optimize cell health and activity. Please be advised that most supplements are synthetic and not exactly like the minerals found naturally in the body. Deriving added magnesium from a swim in the ocean, an Epsom salt bath, and food sources are always preferable.

Magnesium Aspartate – (not to be confused with “aspartame”!) one of the most bioavailable forms of magnesium, it is bound to asparitic acid (an amino acid) and stays in the blood—unlike some other forms of magnesium that are readily eliminated through waste. This compound can help boost general energy level, brain and muscle performance, and prevent muscle cramps and fatigue.
Magnesium Citrate – used for stool softening and to prevent kidney stones, this form is derived from citric acid and is highly bioavailable.
Magnesium Glycinate – glycinate is another amino acid chelated (bonded) with magnesium; it easily passes through intestinal barriers and is therefore highly absorbable and well tolerated. Taking with a meal will help avoid any potential side effects like upset stomach or diarrhea. May help alleviate insomnia.
Magnesium Malate – when bound to malic acid (a fruit acid), magnesium improves energy metabolism, easing muscle pain such as experienced with fibromyalgia. (4)
Magnesium Orotate – orotic acid is an enzyme that may foster heart health, however, as a magnesium supplement it may not be optimal. (5) Consumer Lab, an independent laboratory for health and nutrition products, warns:

“Magnesium orotate is not the best choice as a magnesium supplement and despite preliminary evidence of a benefit for people with heart disease, there is also evidence suggesting a potential safety concern at around the high dosage used for that purpose.  Until more is known about the potential benefits and risks, it may be best not to use magnesium orotate.” (6)

The European Food Safety Authority had similar concerns:

“The Panel concludes that in the light of the tumour-promoting effect of orotic acid in animal experimentation, the small margin of safety to this effect from foreseeable exposure, and the absence of any relevant studies on genotoxicity and of any developmental studies, the use of orotate as a source of the eight other minerals [including magnesium] and choline at the proposed levels of use is of safety concern.” (7)

Magnesium Taurate – good for brain and nervous system support, heart and mental health, easily absorbed and tolerated by the digestive system, taurine is a beta amino acid that, when paired with magnesium, enables easy movement through cell walls. (8) A beta amino acid is one that doesn’t create proteins and is highly adaptive as a nutrient carrier. Taurine delivers magnesium to a cell, which penetrates and stays inside while calcium stays outside the cell. The magnesium is therefore where it needs to be. Taurine itself has antioxidant properties and like magnesium, adapts to different roles in different types of cells (e.g., liver, pancreas, heart). Magnesium taurate causes diarrhea for some, so begin with a small dose and take with food. (9)
Magnesium-L Threonate – improves memory and brain function and eases anxiety, with implications for treating neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s. (10)",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 6, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/4-unlikely-foods-for-treating-constipation/,4 Unlikely Foods for Treating Constipation,"Many of us now sadly prefer to rely on processed convenient foods as a source of daily nutrition, without ever giving a second thought to what these foods might be doing to the state of our digestive health. (Updated Sep 4, 2023)

As a result of these modern day meals, constipation is now a common occurrence and exactly the reason why many people visit their doctors, in the hope they will give them a drug to treat it.

But there is another way, a gentler way than using medication to relieve the constipation you or someone you know may be suffering from. And these options are natural, and as you will see are also quite tasty too!

1. Blackstrap Molasses

Blackstrap molasses is commonly used as a sweetener and is a favourite in health food stores because of its incredibly rich source of trace minerals such as iron, copper, and manganese. And surprisingly, this syrup can help with constipation.

To try this method to relieve your constipation you will need to boil some water and add 2 teaspoons of unsulfured, organic blackstrap molasses to it, once it is cooled drink it like you would a glass of water. The best time to try this method is first thing in the morning so you can help to get your stools softening over the course of the day, to hopefully bring on a bowel movement later that day.

Many people find that this natural remedy helps even more so if used on a long-term basis, and that it can also help give you a natural energy boost.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 4, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/you-can-never-hold-your-baby-too-much/,"You Can Never Hold Your Baby Too Much, Science Explains","Are you worried that you’re holding your baby too much? It’s a common concern among new parents, but science actually suggests the opposite: there’s no such thing as cuddling your infant too much.

In this article, we’ll explore research findings about how physical closeness benefits brain development and strengthens the bond between caregiver and child. Get ready to snuggle up with some fascinating facts – it could change both yours and your baby’s lives.

Key Takeaways
Holding your baby and engaging in skin-to-skin contact promotes brain development, bonding, and secure attachments.
Science supports that holding your baby too much does not spoil them but instead provides a sense of safety and security.
Responding promptly to your baby’s cues helps them feel loved, safe, and supports their brain development.
Understanding your baby’s cues such as crying, body movements, facial expressions, eye contact helps you meet their needs promptly.
The Science Behind Holding Your Baby

Holding your baby and engaging in skin-to-skin contact promotes brain development, bonding, and secure attachments.

Advocating for Skin-to-Skin Contact

Skin-to-skin contact does a lot of good for the baby’s brain. This is even more true for babies born early, also called preemies. Holding them close helps their tiny brains grow well.

It turns on a boost button in their bodies named oxytocin. This boost also lights up pathways in nerve fibers that help with touch and feel senses. The American Academy of Pediatrics says parents should hold their babies close to make them feel secure and loved.

Special therapists can work in hospitals to give preterm babies planned touch times too!

Spoiling a Baby: Fact or Fiction?

Some people think you can spoil a baby by holding them too much. This is not true. Science backs this up. You give your baby a sense of safety and security when you hold them. It does not lead to spoiling.

The bond between the baby and parent grows stronger with touch. Your kid’s brain also develops better because of it. So, use every chance to cuddle your little one!

What Does This Mean for Parents?

Parents can take comfort in the knowledge that holding their baby as much as they want is not only beneficial for their child’s development, but also promotes a healthy parent-baby bond.

Responding to Your Baby’s Needs

Babies tell us what they need in many ways. They cry when they’re hungry or have a wet diaper. If your baby is crying, it means they need something. Your job is to find out what that is.

You may need to feed them, change them, or give them a cuddle. Responding fast helps your baby feel safe and loved. It also helps their brain grow strong and healthy.

Promoting Independence in Infancy

Babies need to feel safe before they can learn about the world. Holding your baby a lot gives them this feeling of safety. It helps their brain grow well. At first, babies depend on you for everything.

Soon, they start learning from you how to do things by themselves. This is important for their development too. Tummy time is one good method that helps your baby build strong muscles and skills needed for rolling over, sitting up, and crawling.

Keep in mind not to let your baby get too tired doing it or cranky due to overstimulation! You are helping them become secure and happy people who can take care of themselves later in life.

When and How to Comfort Your Baby

Understanding your baby’s cues is key to knowing when and how to comfort them. Pay attention to their body language, facial expressions, and sounds they make to determine if they need soothing.

Additionally, explore alternatives to holding such as gentle touch or swaddling that can provide comfort without always relying on physical contact.

Understanding Your Baby’s Cues

Babies communicate their needs through cues. Here are some important cues to look out for:

Crying: This is the most common way babies communicate. They may cry when they’re hungry, tired, uncomfortable, or need attention.
Fussing: It’s a milder form of crying and indicates that your baby needs something.
Body movements: Babies use gestures and movements to express themselves. They may kick their legs when they’re excited or lift their arms when they want to be held.
Facial expressions: Watch for facial expressions like furrowed brows, squinting, or smiling, as they can give you clues about your baby’s emotions.
Eye contact: Babies make eye contact to engage with you. It shows that they want your attention and connection.
Sucking on hands or fingers: This can indicate hunger or the need for comfort.
Alternatives to Holding for Comfort

Here are some alternatives to holding your baby for comfort:

Deep breathing: Taking deep breaths together can help both you and your baby relax.
Driving or walking: The rhythmic motion of being in a car or stroller can be soothing for babies.
Swaying: Gentle swaying back and forth can provide comfort to your baby.
Bathing: Warm baths can be calming for babies and create a sense of security.
Going outside: Fresh air and a change of scenery can help distract and calm your baby.
Playing rhythmic noise: Soft, rhythmic sounds like white noise or lullabies can soothe a fussy baby.

So, science shows that there is no such thing as holding your baby too much. Cuddling and physical closeness have important benefits for brain development, especially for preemies.

It helps promote bonding, secure attachments, and supports their overall well-being. So go ahead and hold your baby close – it’s good for both of you!",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 2, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/clutter-sabotaging-your-success/,Psychology Explains How Clutter is Secretly Sabotaging Your Success,"Feel suffocated by the stacks of unused items in your home? You’re not alone – research from UCLA reveals a strong correlation between clutter and increased stress levels. This article goes beyond surface-level tidying tips to explore the psychological underpinnings of why we accumulate ‘stuff’ and how this habit affects our mental health. Ready for a clutter-free life? Read on!

Key Takeaways
Clutter is not just a messy room; it’s any disorganized stuff that causes stress and makes it hard to focus.
Hoarding disorder is a mental health issue where people can’t let go of things, leading to excessive clutter and negative impacts on their well-being.
Clutter increases stress levels, impairs focus, promotes procrastination, strains relationships, and lowers overall quality of life.
Understanding Clutter

Clutter is defined as a collection of objects that are disorganized and take up space, hindering functionality and causing distress.

Definition of Clutter

Clutter is not just a mess. It’s any stuff that fills a place in a disordered way. Imagine your room with toys, books, clothes and more all over the floor. This is what clutter looks like.

Too much of it can make you lose focus and feel stressed out. Even emotions expressed by others may be hard to tell when there’s too much clutter around!

How Clutter Accumulates

Clutter can pile up in many ways. Here are a few common ways:

Buying more than you need: Often, we buy items we don’t really need or use. This adds to the clutter in our homes.
Not throwing away old items: We may find it hard to part with items we no longer use. Over time, they pile up and add to our clutter.
Keeping things “just in case”: Many times, we keep unused items for future use. But most of the time, these “just in case” items become part of the clutter.
Lack of organization: When there is no place for each thing, it results in a mess. Items left lying around become clutter.
Neglecting to finish tasks: Unfinished projects add to home stress levels. They are seen as clutter and cause stress just like physical clutter.
Emotional attachment: We often keep things due to sentimental value or fear of loss. These attachments make it harder for us to get rid of excess stuff.
The Psychology Behind Hoarding

Hoarding comes from the mind. It is a mental health issue. People with hoarding disorder have trouble throwing things away. They feel they may need these items in the future or they are too important to lose.

Their fear of loss keeps them from letting go.

Things pile up and spaces become cluttered. This can cause stress, anxiety, and other problems. Hoarders often live alone because others find it hard to deal with the mess. Yet, they do not see their stuff as clutter but as valued possessions that give comfort and safety.

The Connection Between Clutter and Mental Health

Clutter negatively impacts mental health by increasing stress levels, impairing focus, promoting procrastination, straining relationships, and reducing overall quality of life.

Increased Stress Levels

Having too many things can make us more stressed. This is because clutter in our homes can lead to higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Women with messy homes often feel very stressed.

They find it hard to handle day-to-day tasks and even moving from work to home becomes tough for them. If you have less clutter, it will help you keep your stress levels low.

Difficulty Focusing

When your environment is cluttered, it can be challenging to stay focused. Research shows that women who perceive their homes as cluttered have higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can make it harder to concentrate.

This is especially true when transitioning from work to home, as a cluttered space can create mental distractions and overwhelm. Even unfinished home projects are considered as clutter and can generate the same level of stress as physical clutter, further hindering your ability to focus.

It’s important to declutter and create an organized space to promote better concentration and productivity throughout the day.

Procrastination

Procrastination is a common issue that arises when we have too much clutter. When our environment is messy and disorganized, it can be overwhelming and make it difficult to focus on tasks at hand.

This leads to putting things off until later, which only adds to the stress and anxiety caused by the clutter. Procrastination can negatively impact our productivity and quality of life, as well as strain relationships with others.

By decluttering our space and creating an organized environment, we can reduce procrastination tendencies and improve our overall well-being.

Impaired Relationships

Having too much clutter in your home can negatively impact your relationships. When women perceive their homes to be cluttered, they tend to be less happy with their marriages. This suggests that a messy environment can create tension and strain within a relationship.

Additionally, clutter can lead to social isolation if you feel embarrassed or overwhelmed by the state of your home and avoid inviting people over. In turn, this can hinder opportunities for connection and support from friends and loved ones.

It’s important to recognize how clutter affects our relationships and take steps to declutter our living spaces for the well-being of ourselves and those around us.

Lower Quality of Life

Living in a cluttered environment can lead to a lower quality of life. It can contribute to increased stress levels, making it difficult to relax and enjoy your surroundings. The constant visual stimulation from clutter can also make it hard to focus and be productive.

Additionally, having too much stuff can lead to procrastination and difficulty completing tasks. When our living space is disorganized and chaotic, it can strain relationships with others and create feelings of isolation.

Overall, excessive clutter negatively impacts well-being and makes it harder to live a fulfilling life.

Decreased Well-Being

Clutter doesn’t just create physical chaos; it can also have a negative impact on our well-being. When our living spaces are cluttered, it can lead to increased stress levels and feelings of overwhelm.

Research conducted by UCLA’s Center on Everyday Lives of Families found that women who perceived their homes to be cluttered reported higher levels of unhappiness and dissatisfaction with their lives.

In addition, they experienced higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol throughout the day. Clutter can make it difficult for us to relax and unwind, leading to a decrease in overall well-being.

Furthermore, clutter can impede our ability to focus and be productive. When we’re surrounded by mess and disorganization, it becomes challenging to concentrate on tasks at hand. This can lead to procrastination and feelings of frustration or inadequacy.

Clearing away the clutter not only creates a more organized environment but also clears mental space, allowing us to think more clearly and feel less overwhelmed.

Psychological Concepts Related to Clutter

Loss aversion, the sunk cost fallacy, the endowment effect, self-efficacy and Bandura’s theory are just a few psychological concepts that shed light on our attachment to clutter. Discover how these concepts can illuminate your relationship with possessions in the full blog post.

Loss Aversion

Loss aversion is a psychological concept that makes it hard for us to let go of clutter. It’s the tendency to place more value on what we already have, even if it no longer serves a useful purpose.

This bias stems from our fear of loss and the belief that getting rid of something means losing out on its potential benefits. So, when faced with the decision to declutter, we may feel a sense of attachment and find it difficult to part ways with our belongings.

Understanding this cognitive bias can help us address the underlying reasons why we hold onto clutter and take steps towards creating a more organized and clutter-free environment.

The Sunk Cost Fallacy

The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias that makes it hard for people to let go of clutter. It happens when we continue investing in something, like keeping items we no longer need or use, just because we’ve already invested time, money, or emotions into them.

This bias is connected to our fear of losing what we already have and the emotional attachment we develop towards our possessions. Even if holding onto clutter no longer benefits us, the sunk cost fallacy leads us to believe that letting go would be a waste.

To address this bias and overcome clutter accumulation, it’s important to recognize cognitive distortions and understand why we’re attaching so much value to things that can actually hold us back.

The Endowment Effect

The Endowment Effect is a psychological concept that helps explain why people hold onto possessions for sentimental reasons, even if they no longer have a practical use. It occurs when individuals assign more value to something simply because they own it.

This emotional attachment can make it difficult to let go of items, leading to clutter accumulation. For example, someone may keep old clothes in their closet because those items hold memories or sentimental significance, despite not wearing them anymore.

The Endowment Effect highlights the strong bond between people and their possessions, which can contribute to the clutter that holds them back from living a simpler and more organized life.

Self-Efficacy and Bandura

Self-efficacy, which is the belief in one’s own abilities, plays a crucial role when it comes to decluttering and organizing. It refers to our confidence in being able to successfully complete tasks related to tidying up our spaces.

This concept is associated with psychologist Albert Bandura, known for his work on self-efficacy and social learning theory. According to Bandura’s theory, self-efficacy influences our motivation, behavior, and personal development.

To increase self-efficacy in decluttering and organizing, we can focus on acts of mastery, learn from others who have successfully organized their spaces, use persuasive techniques like positive affirmations or rewards for progress made, as well as create a sense of psychological arousal by imagining the benefits of having a clutter-free environment.

Rationalizations and the Unconscious Mind

When it comes to clutter, our minds can play tricks on us without even realizing it. One way this happens is through rationalizations. These are the justifications we come up with to convince ourselves that keeping clutter is necessary or beneficial.

For example, we might tell ourselves that we’ll use those old magazines for a rainy day or that holding onto clothes from years ago will motivate us to lose weight. These rationalizations are often driven by our unconscious mind, which influences our thoughts and behaviors without our conscious awareness.

Our unconscious mind has a strong influence on our decision-making processes.and can lead us to hold onto things that no longer serve us. It’s important to recognize these rationalizations and understand the underlying motivations behind them.

The Impact of Clutter on Happiness and Life Quality

Clutter can have a significant impact on your happiness and overall quality of life. It affects not only your physical environment but also your mental well-being. Discover how clutter distorts thinking patterns, increases stress levels, and hinders emotional health.

Find out the strategies to counteract these negative effects and create a clutter-free space that promotes happiness and improves your overall life quality.

How Clutter Affects Your Environment

Too much clutter in your environment can have a negative impact on your mental and emotional well-being. When your physical space is filled with excessive items, it can lead to feelings of overwhelm, stress, and anxiety.

Research from UCLA’s Center on Everyday Lives of Families shows that the amount of clutter in a home directly correlates with the level of stress experienced by individuals and their families.

Women who perceive their homes to be cluttered tend to be less satisfied with their marriages, while having clutter can make it difficult for women to manage everyday tasks and feel effective.

Clutter also affects our ability to focus and concentrate, making it harder to complete tasks efficiently. By decluttering our spaces and creating an organized environment, we can reduce stress levels, improve focus, and create a more peaceful living space.

Distorted Thinking Patterns

Distorted thinking patterns can contribute to clutter and affect our mental health. These patterns involve thoughts that are not accurate or realistic. For example, we may have emotional attachments to objects and believe they hold sentimental value, even if they don’t.

We might also engage in cognitive distortions such as catastrophizing (thinking of the worst-case scenario) or overgeneralization (making broad assumptions based on limited experiences).

Distorted thinking can lead us to hold onto items we don’t need, causing clutter to accumulate. It’s important to recognize these patterns and challenge them in order to address clutter and improve our well-being.

Emotional Reasoning

Emotional reasoning can play a big role in why people hold onto clutter. It means that instead of using logic or practicality to decide what to keep and what to let go of, individuals rely on their emotions.

They may keep things because they have sentimental value or because they believe that getting rid of them would be like losing a part of themselves. However, it’s important to challenge these emotional attachments and consider whether the items still serve a practical purpose or bring joy into our lives.

By recognizing the underlying emotions associated with clutter and adopting more rational thinking, individuals can break free from the clutter trap and create a more organized and peaceful living space.

How to Counteract the Negative Effects of Clutter

To counteract the negative effects of clutter, dedicate specific time for decluttering, reduce unnecessary items, and create an organized and clutter-free space in your home.

Dedicating Time for Decluttering

Dedicating time for decluttering is an important step in countering the negative effects of clutter. By setting aside specific time to tackle clutter, individuals can regain a sense of control and improve their overall well-being.

Taking the time to sort through belongings and decide what to keep, donate, or discard can help reduce stress levels and make it easier to manage everyday tasks. Whether it’s dedicating a few hours each week or setting aside a whole day for decluttering, making this effort can have a positive impact on mental health and create a more organized living space.

It’s important to remember that decluttering doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Starting small with one area at a time can make the process more manageable. Breaking tasks down into smaller steps ensures progress is made without feeling discouraged or stressed.

Reducing Items

To counteract the negative effects of clutter, you can start by reducing the number of items you have. Here’s how:

Take inventory: Make a list of all your belongings and assess which ones are necessary and which ones you can let go of.
Donate or sell: Consider donating or selling items that you no longer need or use. This not only helps declutter your space but also benefits others who may find value in them.
Set limits: Establish boundaries for the number of items you allow yourself to own in certain categories (e.g., clothing, books, kitchenware). Stick to these limits to prevent unnecessary accumulation.
Simplify belongings: Opt for versatile items that serve multiple purposes rather than having separate items for every specific task or occasion.
Practice gratitude: Appreciate what you already have instead of constantly seeking more possessions. Cultivating a mindset of gratitude can help reduce the desire for excessive material possessions.
Organizing

Organizing is an important step in counteracting the negative effects of clutter. It helps create a sense of order and calm in your space. Here are some ways to organize:

Sort your items: Start by sorting through your belongings and categorize them into groups, such as keep, donate, or discard.
Create designated spaces: Assign specific areas for different items in your home. This will make it easier to find and put things away.
Use storage solutions: Invest in storage containers, bins, or shelves to keep things organized and easily accessible. Labeling can also help you quickly identify what’s inside each container.
Develop routines: Establish daily or weekly habits for tidying up and putting things back in their designated places. This will prevent clutter from accumulating again.
Reduce visual clutter: Keep surfaces clear by organizing items out of sight. Use hooks or wall organizers to hang coats, bags, or keys instead of leaving them on tables or countertops.
Digitize where possible: Scan documents, photos, or other paper-based items to reduce physical clutter. Store electronic files in a well-organized manner on your computer or cloud storage.
Minimize duplicate items: Only keep one of each item unless it serves a specific purpose to have multiples.
Creating a Clutter-Free Space

Creating a clutter-free space is essential for improving mental well-being and overall quality of life. Here are some steps you can take to achieve a clutter-free environment:

Start small: Begin with one area or room at a time to prevent feeling overwhelmed.
Sort and categorize: Separate items into categories such as keep, donate, or discard.
Let go of sentimental attachments: While it can be challenging, learn to part with items that no longer serve a purpose or bring you joy.
Organize strategically: Utilize storage solutions like bins, shelves, or drawers to keep items neatly stored and easily accessible.
Maintain regular decluttering sessions: Set aside dedicated time each month to ensure you stay on top of any new clutter that accumulates.
Implement effective systems: Develop routines and habits that support a clutter-free lifestyle, such as putting things back in their designated place after use.
Seeking Professional Help If Needed

If you’re struggling with clutter and finding it difficult to declutter on your own, seeking professional help can be beneficial. Mental health professionals, such as therapists, can provide guidance and support in uncovering underlying thoughts and feelings that may be preventing you from decluttering.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often used to treat hoarding disorder and can also be effective for clearing clutter and counteracting its negative effects. Additionally, attending decluttering and organizing workshops or hiring a professional organizer can provide valuable strategies and accountability to help you create a clutter-free space.

Seeking professional help when needed can make the process of decluttering more manageable and increase your chances of success.

Conclusion

In conclusion, psychology shows us that too much clutter can have a negative impact on our mental health and overall well-being. It increases stress levels, makes it hard to focus, and leads to procrastination.

By decluttering, organizing, and creating a clutter-free space, we can counteract these negative effects and improve our happiness and quality of life. Remember, taking small steps towards a clutter-free environment can have big benefits for our emotional health and self-care.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 1, 2023"

Mature people often choose to stay single. They like having more time for themselves, their family and friends, and their hobbies. Not being in a relationship means they don’t need to make as many compromises.

They can live life on their own terms.

Some mature singles also love traveling alone. For them, it is easy and less complex than going with a partner or group. Singlehood can lead to personal growth too. Singles can learn new things about themselves without the distractions of a romantic relationship.

The Freedom That Comes with Being Single

Being single in maturity offers the freedom to focus on personal interests, travel with greater flexibility, and make fewer compromises.

More Time for Personal Interests

Being single gives you lots of free time. You can use this to chase your dreams and enjoy your hobbies more. If you love painting, reading books, or learning a new language, being single lets you do that often.

You also have the chance to spend more hours with family and friends. With no partner requiring your focus, there is plenty of time for the people in your life who matter most. Plus, things that make you happy get more space in your calendar!

Fewer Compromises

Being single lets you make fewer compromises. In a relationship, people often need to bend. They change plans for the other person. This can be hard at times. But singles don’t face this much.

They are free to make their own choices in life without having to think about others. This brings a kind of freedom that many enjoy and love being single because of it.

Greater Flexibility for Travel

Traveling alone can also be fun and rewarding in its own way. Single people have the chance to see lots of different places too!

Personal Growth Opportunities in Singlehood

Singlehood offers numerous opportunities for personal growth. It allows individuals to focus on self-improvement, career advancement, and building resilience. Embrace the benefits of staying single and discover how it can positively impact your life.

Read more to uncover the personal growth opportunities in singlehood.

Room for Self-Improvement and Self-Sufficiency

Remaining single in maturity provides ample room for self-improvement and self-sufficiency. Without the responsibilities of a long-term relationship, mature individuals have more time and freedom to focus on personal growth.

They can invest their energy in developing new skills, pursuing educational opportunities, or engaging in hobbies that bring them fulfillment and joy. This period of singleness allows them to become more independent and self-reliant, as they learn to navigate life’s challenges on their own.

By embracing this opportunity for personal development, mature singles can build resilience and confidence in themselves, enhancing both their inner strength and overall well-being.

Focus on Career Advancement

Being single allows individuals to focus more on their career advancement. Without the responsibilities and compromises that come with being in a relationship, singles have the freedom to fully invest their time and energy into their professional growth.

They can prioritize their own goals and ambitions without having to consider the needs or desires of a partner. This can lead to better opportunities for personal development, increased dedication to work, and the ability to bounce back from setbacks in one’s career.

Staying single provides an environment where individuals can thrive professionally and make significant progress towards achieving their goals.

Building Resilience

Building resilience is an important aspect of staying single in maturity. Being on your own allows you to develop the ability to bounce back from challenges and setbacks. It gives you the space and freedom to process past events, grow as a person, and become more self-sufficient.

When faced with difficult situations, singles who have built resilience are better equipped to handle them and move forward with their lives. This ability to adapt and cope can lead to greater overall well-being and personal fulfillment.

Health Benefits of Staying Single

Staying single offers increased physical activity, better stress management, and financial health and independence.

Increased Physical Activity

Single individuals tend to engage in higher levels of physical activity compared to those in relationships. This is because they have more freedom and flexibility with their time, allowing them to prioritize fitness and exercise.

Being single means less time spent on commitments and compromises, giving them the opportunity to focus on personal interests, including staying active. Research shows that singles are more likely to maintain a healthy weight and experience the associated health benefits that come with increased physical activity.

Moreover, being single allows individuals to participate in activities such as outdoor adventures or joining sports clubs without having to consider the preferences or schedules of a partner.

Better Stress Management

Being single can contribute to better stress management. When you’re not in a relationship, you have fewer commitments and compromises to make, allowing you more time and freedom for yourself and your personal interests.

This gives you the opportunity to focus on self-improvement, career advancement, and building resilience, which can all help in managing stress effectively. Moreover, being single provides greater flexibility for travel and exploration, giving you a chance to relax and unwind from everyday pressures.

So, staying single can be beneficial for maintaining a healthier lifestyle and managing stress in a better way.

Financial Health and Independence

Staying single in maturity can bring financial health and independence. When you’re single, you have control over your finances and don’t need to rely on someone else’s income. You can make decisions about how to spend your money without having to compromise with a partner.

This allows you the freedom to save for your future, invest in things that matter to you, and live according to your own priorities. Being financially independent also means being able to take care of yourself without relying on anyone else for support.

It gives you a sense of security and empowerment as you navigate through life on your own terms.

In addition, staying single can help avoid some of the common financial downsides associated with relationships or marriages. Divorce or separation can often result in significant financial loss as assets are divided and expenses increase due to maintaining two separate households.

By remaining single, you eliminate this potential economic strain on your resources and reduce unnecessary monetary burdens.

Improved Social Relationships

Having the freedom and time that comes with being single allows mature individuals to engage in acts of compassion, expand their social circles, and be more attentive in their relationships.

More Time for Acts of Compassion

Being single in maturity allows individuals to have more time and energy to dedicate towards acts of compassion. Without the commitments and responsibilities of a long-term relationship, mature singles can focus their attention on helping others and making a positive impact in their community.

Research has shown that single individuals are more likely to engage in acts of kindness and be there for friends and family when they need support. With fewer demands on their time, singles have the freedom to lend a helping hand or volunteer for charitable causes, providing valuable assistance where it is needed most.

This ability to prioritize acts of compassion is one of the many benefits that come with embracing singlehood in maturity.

Greater Diversity in Social Circles

Remaining single in maturity can provide individuals with the opportunity to have a greater diversity in their social circles. Without the commitment of a long-term relationship, mature singles have more freedom to connect with different people from various backgrounds and interests.

This allows for a richer and more diverse network of friendships and relationships. By expanding their social circles, mature singles can engage with new perspectives, experiences, and ideas, which can contribute to personal growth and enhance overall life satisfaction.

Improved Attentiveness in Relationships

Improved attentiveness in relationships is something that can happen when mature individuals choose to stay single. With fewer commitments and distractions, they have more time and energy to focus on their social connections.

This increased attentiveness allows them to be more present and engaged with the people in their lives, leading to deeper and more meaningful relationships. Research has also shown that single individuals may be better able to empathize with others and respond to their needs, which further enhances relationship satisfaction.

In fact, studies have found that both men and women who are single tend to exhibit higher levels of empathy compared to those in committed relationships. They are often more attuned to the emotions of others and can provide a greater level of support.

This heightened attentiveness not only benefits romantic partnerships but also extends to friendships, family relationships, and even professional connections.

Moreover, being attentive in relationships is particularly important for same-sex couples who may face unique challenges due to societal stigma or discrimination. However, research suggests that homosexual individuals are just as likely as people of other sexual orientations to be in a relationship.

In fact, gay men experience longer periods of singlehood compared to heterosexual men or women of various sexual orientations.

Evolutionary Perspective on Staying Single

Understanding the factors that contribute to mature individuals choosing to remain single provides insight into human behavior and relationship dynamics. Read on to explore the evolutionary perspective behind this decision and gain a deeper understanding of why some people embrace singlehood in their later years.

Individual Differences and Personality Traits

Mature individuals who choose to remain single may have a variety of individual differences and personality traits that contribute to their decision. Research has shown that some people naturally have a fear of being single, which can make them more inclined to seek out relationships.

On the other hand, there are also individuals who prioritize their career or personal interests over romantic partnerships. Additionally, studies have found that sexual orientation plays a role in the likelihood of remaining single, with homosexual individuals experiencing longer periods of singlehood compared to those with different sexual orientations.

Ultimately, it is important to recognize and respect the diverse range of reasons why mature people may prefer to stay single.

Fear of Being Single

Some mature people may have a fear of being single. This fear can stem from societal expectations and the pressure to be in a long-term relationship. However, it’s important to remember that being single can bring many benefits, such as more personal freedom, time for personal growth, improved social relationships, and even better health.

So rather than fearing being alone, it’s important to embrace the opportunities and advantages that come with staying single in maturity.

Sociosexuality and Career Focus Effects

People’s preference for staying single in maturity can also be influenced by their sociosexuality and career focus. Research has shown that individuals who lean towards unrestricted sociosexuality, meaning they have a more casual attitude towards sex and relationships, are more likely to prefer being single.

Additionally, those who score higher on the Dark Triad personality traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy) are also more inclined towards remaining single. This suggests that certain personality traits play a role in shaping people’s choices when it comes to relationships.

Furthermore, individuals who are highly focused on their careers may prioritize their professional goals over romantic partnerships. They may feel that being single allows them greater freedom to devote time and energy to pursuing their ambitions without the potential distractions or compromises that come with committed relationships.

Conclusion: Embracing Singlehood in Maturity

In conclusion, many mature individuals choose to embrace singlehood because it offers them freedom, personal growth opportunities, improved social relationships, and even health benefits.

Being single allows them more time for themselves and their interests, as well as the flexibility to travel and focus on career advancement. By staying single in maturity, these individuals can build resilience, improve their overall well-being, and enjoy fulfilling relationships with a diverse range of people.

Ultimately, being single is a valid choice that can lead to happiness and fulfillment in life.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 1, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-get-rid-of-acid-reflux-naturally/,How To Get Rid Of Acid Reflux Naturally,"In this video, you will discover highly effective strategies to naturally get rid of acid reflux from the comfort of your own home. No need to rely on medication, as you implement this 6-step approach to treat acid reflux through dietary changes and home remedies.

Acid reflux happens when stomach acid, and sometimes bile, flows backward into the esophagus, leading to discomfort and various symptoms.

This occurs because the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is weakened, and opens instead of staying closed as it should.

When acid reflux becomes chronic and severe, it is known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Now, it’s important to understand that the LES operates through direct feedback from adequate stomach acid levels.

When there is insufficient stomach acid as food enters the stomach, the tone of this sphincter weakens, making it unable to retain the stomach contents, ultimately resulting in acid reflux.

So, contrary to what a lot of folks say, acid reflux is not primarily caused by too much stomach acid, but rather by not having enough.

Insufficient stomach acid can result in delayed gastric emptying, poor digestion, yeast overgrowth, leaky gut, bacterial and parasitic infections, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and nutrient deficiencies.

All of these conditions can inflame and damage your gut lining.

So, what are the symptoms of acid reflux?

These can include a burning sensation in the chest, often known as heartburn, which typically occurs after eating, and may be more intense at night.

There may also be regurgitation of food or sour liquid, difficulty swallowing, and a feeling of bloating.

Some people might notice bloody or black stools, experience nausea and vomiting, or frequent burping.

Other symptoms can include wheezing, a dry cough, unexplained weight loss, and disrupted sleep.

In some cases, there’s also dysphagia, which is the sensation of food being stuck in the throat.

Without further delay, here is the 6-step guide to bid farewell to acid reflux once and for all.
One. “Avoid foods that trigger acid reflux.”

If you are living with acid reflux, you’ll want to steer clear of specific foods that can trigger reflux symptoms. These foods can relax your LES, increase acid in the stomach, or slow down digestion. Here are the main culprits:

High-fat foods: This includes deep-fried foods (French fries, onion rings), full-fat dairy (cheese, cow’s milk), fatty meats (fatty cuts of beef, bacon, sausages), processed snacks (beef jerky, potato chips), and other fast food (pizza).

Spicy foods: foods that contain chili powder, curry, and hot peppers.

Acidic foods and drinks: like tomatoes, citrus fruits, soda and other carbonated drinks, as well as alcohol, such as wine and beer.

Chocolate: including milk and dark chocolate.

Too much coffee: 1-2 cups of coffee is fine for most people.

Mint: like spearmint and peppermint, and anything mint-flavored, such as tea, alcohol, candy, and desserts.

Gluten: gluten-containing grains (wheat, barley, and rye) in starchy foods, like bread, pasta, and cereals.

Garlic and onions: These two vegetables, especially in their raw form, are hard to digest, and make your heartburn worse.

High-fat foods, in particular, can increase the pressure in your stomach, causing the contents to reflux into the esophagus.

Also avoid large meals, especially in the evening, as they can put pressure on the esophageal sphincter.

Two. “Improve eating habits to optimize digestion.”

By improving your digestion, you can alleviate symptoms of acid reflux.

Chewing plays a vital role in the digestion process, serving not only to break down food but also to send a signal to your brain, prompting your stomach and pancreas to release digestive enzymes. Therefore, it is important to take your time and thoroughly chew each bite until it becomes as smooth as a puree.

Next, let’s look at consuming beverages with meals. Drinking during meals can dilute your digestive juices, making them less effective, and your food harder to digest. It’s best to wait about an hour after eating before having a beverage.

Three. “Heal your gastric lining and reduce inflammation.”

First, you’ll have to determine if your gastric lining has been damaged. 

To do this, you can dilute a small amount of apple cider vinegar (ACV) in water. ACV is acidic, and when ingested, it can help tell you the condition of your stomach lining.

If you feel a burning or uncomfortable sensation after consuming diluted ACV, it could be a sign that your stomach lining is damaged or inflamed.

In this case, you’ll need to first heal your gastric lining, before testing with ACV again.

You can use natural remedies such as chamomile, fennel, licorice root, marshmallow root, turmeric, and slippery elm to achieve this. We will delve deeper into these healing agents later in the video.

Four. “Improve stomach acid production after you heal the gastric lining.”

Here are three natural remedies that support stomach acid production.

Betaine hydrochloride (HCL).

Betaine hydrochloride (HCL) supplements improve gut function and digestion by restoring gastric acidity. They activate the protein-digesting enzyme, pepsin. Plus, they combat bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and small intestine, while promoting the flow of bile and pancreatic enzymes.

For optimal results, it is recommended to take betaine HCL during or immediately after meals, rather than before. Taking it before a meal can potentially trigger misleading heartburn signals and disrupt stomach acid production. Additionally, it is advisable to avoid betaine HCL while concurrently using NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, Tylenol, or aspirin.

Digestive enzymes.

Natural digestive enzymes, such as lipase, amylase, and protease, play a crucial role in breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. By supplementing with enzymes, digestion can be enhanced. It is recommended to take enzyme supplements either with a meal or shortly before eating to maximize their effectiveness.

Bitter foods and herbs.

Bitters can help manage reflux by stimulating digestive enzymes and enhancing gut motility. Bitter-tasting foods, which include dandelion greens, kale, arugula, radishes, bitter melon, cabbage, endive, and cilantro, also contain prebiotic fibers to nourish and balance the microbiome.

Bitter herbs such as, gentian, wormwood, and globe artichoke are known to promote digestion by stimulating saliva release and gastric secretion. These herbs also strengthen the LES, thereby preventing stomach contents from flowing upward. Moreover, they can enhance mucous production, further contributing to digestive health.

Five. “Use natural remedies to heal your gut.”

Now, let us delve into the home remedies that are as effective as conventional medications in treating acid reflux, all without the unpleasant side effects.

Licorice root is a traditional remedy that can calm inflamed digestive tissues due to its demulcent properties. It helps with acid reflux by creating a protective layer on the esophagus against stomach acid. For regular use, choose the DGL form of licorice root to avoid possible side effects from glycyrrhizin.

Fennel aids in controlling gut movements and reducing spasms due to its calming properties. This herb helps manage reflux by relaxing the stomach muscles and promoting digestive secretions.

Chamomile tea is famous for its strong anti-inflammatory and calming qualities that help soothe the stomach. It also helps reduce stress, which often triggers acid reflux.

D-limonene is derived from the peels of citrus fruits. This nutrient protects the esophagus, speeds up food movement in the stomach, and can guard against bacterial infections like H. pylori, which can trigger acid reflux.

Marshmallow root is known for calming inflamed tissues. This herb forms a protective gel when mixed with water, reducing inflammation and acidity in your digestive tract. 

Slippery elm protects and soothes the esophagus, preventing acid damage and inflammation. It may also help guard against ulcers by increasing gut mucus. It’s usually taken as a powder, mixed with tea or water, up to three times a day

Aloe vera juice can help reduce inflammation and stomach acidity associated with heartburn. It’s a natural remedy for ongoing indigestion. Start with 1-2 tablespoons daily, and if needed, increase to 2 ounces twice a day. For best results, drink it about 20-30 minutes before meals.

Baking soda is a cost-effective remedy that can neutralize stomach acid and offer temporary heartburn relief. Add ½ teaspoon to a cup of water and sip slowly. However, check with a healthcare provider before use as it may affect certain medications. Avoid long-term use as it can cause your stomach to overproduce acid.

Zinc carnosine, while not a cure for GERD, can contribute to a holistic treatment plan. Studies suggest that it can help repair the gut lining. This nutrient is often used in the treatment of gastric ulcers and gastritis.

Probiotics, or “good bacteria”, can aid in controlling acid reflux. They balance the gut microbiome, improve digestion, lessen inflammation, and thus help reduce reflux symptoms. Probiotics may also help eliminate H. pylori, a bacteria linked to acid reflux.

Six. “Lifestyle changes.”

In addition to making modifications to your diet, lifestyle changes can help put out the fire of acid reflux.

Exercise.

Obesity can cause hiatal hernia, a known risk factor for GERD. Regular exercise can help manage acid reflux by helping you lose weight and reduce stomach pressure. 

However, not all exercises are beneficial for acid reflux; some can worsen symptoms.

High-intensity workouts such as running, jumping, sit-ups, crunches, and weight lifting can exert pressure on the abdomen, and cause the splashing of stomach acid into the esophagus.

So, it’s better to engage in low-impact exercises, such as cycling, brisk walking and yoga.

Stop Smoking.

Quitting smoking can greatly help manage acid reflux. This is because nicotine relaxes the LES, allowing stomach acid to cause heartburn and other symptoms.

Improve Sleep and Manage Stress.

Lastly, never underestimate the power of a good night’s sleep. If you don’t sleep well or are stressed, it can make reflux symptoms worse. So, make sure to get enough sleep, and use stress-reducing methods like meditation or deep breathing exercises. Avoid eating before bedtime, and raise the head of your bed if you have reflux when lying down. Sleeping on your left side can also help reduce pressure on the LES.

Next, let’s look at why medications may not be the solution for acid reflux.

Acid reflux is conventionally treated with medications like antacids, H2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

PPIs, widely used and available over the counter, block stomach acid production to relieve symptoms. However, recent studies suggest PPIs may have significant downsides.

Long-term use can impair the absorption of essential vitamins and minerals, disrupt the gut microbiome, and increase the risk of food poisoning, infections, stomach cancer, and dementia.

Furthermore, they don’t address the root cause of acid reflux (such as a weakened LES, hiatal hernia, or lifestyle factors), and can even worsen reflux over time.

Hence, it is best to gradually reduce the intake of medications under the guidance of a healthcare professional while implementing the natural strategies described in this video.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider about any changes to your health regimen.

In addition to medicine prescribed by doctors, plenty of exercise, and a balanced diet of heart-healthy foods, natural remedies that promote heart health are an important part of clearing out clogged arteries. (updated Aug 29, 2023)

Let’s look at the 4 best herbs that promote free flowing blood and heart health.

1. Garlic

Garlic is, by far, the most popular natural herbal remedy for heart health. Using garlic for medical purposes became popular in ancient Egypt.

There, ancient doctors used garlic to treat hundreds of conditions.  Even today, garlic remains one of the most popular go-to home remedies for every ailment under the sun.

It’s not just a tall tale or ancient medical folklore, the medical power of garlic is substantiated by research that proves it can clear your arteries and help treat coronary heart disease.

A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition investigated the hypolipidemic action of garlic oils, determining that garlic decreases serum cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein.

The result? Participants who ate more garlic, saw cholesterol levels go down and blood pressure improve.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 29, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-many-eggs-a-day-can-you-safely-eat/,How Many Eggs a Day Can You Safely Eat?,"The egg is a remarkable achievement of nature. It contains everything needed to make a chicken, and has long been considered one of the healthiest foods available. (Updated Aug 27, 2023)

Nutritionally, eggs are a very good source of protein and the trace mineral selenium, a good source of phosphorus, riboflavin and vitamin B12 and high in nutrients important for the eyes and brain, but high in saturated fat and very high in cholesterol.

In fact, a single medium-sized egg contains 62 per cent of the recommended maximum daily intake. After many years of criticism and bad publicity, eggs are again accepted in nutritional circles, and it is generally agreed that up to 3 whole eggs can be safely eaten each day, and 2 to 6 of the cholesterol-rich yolks a week.

What if you want to eat more than 3 eggs a day, and more than 6 yolks a week?

An 88-year-old man who had eaten 20 to 30 soft-boiled eggs a day for at least 15 years was reported in 1991 (1). He reported no adverse effects from eating the eggs throughout the day, had kept careful records of the eggs consumed and was thought to have done this because of a psychological compulsion.

Whatever the reason for this remarkable record of egg-eating, his health was excellent and his cholesterol level was normal and had been so for years.

Eating more than the recommended number of eggs and egg yolks apparently caused him no problems, and there is in fact little evidence to support any restriction of egg eating on account of cholesterol content.

The Truth Behind The Cholesterol Myth

Cholesterol is associated in most people’s minds with heart attack and stroke, but it is an important part of the cell membrane, and of the sheath that surrounds nerve fibers and allows them to conduct electricity.

Cholesterol is also necessary for the production of the adrenal gland hormones cortisol and aldosterone, and of the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. It is made into bile in the liver and may protect other cells as an antioxidant.

A certain amount of cholesterol is necessary, and it is produced in the liver if it cannot be obtained in the diet.

If cholesterol is taken in from eggs and other foods, production by the liver is dialed back or shut down [2], so that the total amount of cholesterol obtained from diet and produced by the liver stays about the same(3).

This has led to the suggestion that the recommended limitation of cholesterol intake, from eggs and otherwise, should be reconsidered(4).

HDL Vs. LDL Cholesterol

There is more to cholesterol than just the blood level, however. There are several different subtypes of cholesterol, mainly HDL (high-density lipoprotein)  LDL (low-density lipoprotein).

Small dense LDL is the “bad” cholesterol that contributes to atherosclerosis, the deposition of fats and calcium in blood vessel walls that leads to their blockage and results in heart attack and stroke.
HDL is the “good” cholesterol that helps to remove these deposits and has a protective effect against heart attack and stroke(5).

Several large studies have confirmed that the HDL cholesterol is increased with egg consumption(6), that eggs increase the beneficial effect on “good” cholesterol of a restricted-carbohydrate diet(7) and that whole eggs are more effective in raising “good” cholesterol levels than egg whites(8).

LDL Subtype Cholesterol

Total cholesterol levels generally do not change with egg consumption(9), but there is sometimes an increase in LDL cholesterol(10).

About 30 per cent of people respond to eating whole eggs with a slight increase in LDL cholesterol, but there is no association between egg consumption and heart disease(11).

This is apparently because small dense LDL particles are the ones associated with heart and blood vessel disease, and larger LDL particles are not necessarily “bad” cholesterol.

The rise in LDL cholesterol in some people who consume eggs is due to an increase in the large LDL subtype(12), and this kind of cholesterol is not associated with the risk of heart attack and stroke(13).

High cholesterol and excessive “bad” LDL cholesterol is often combined with depletion of insulin and the development of elevated blood sugar, and eventually of diabetes.

The combination of central obesity, the apple or pear shape that is characteristic of overweight men, high blood pressure, decreased HDL and increased LDL cholesterol and resistance to the effects of insulin was first recognized in the 1950s and has been called syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome, cardiometabolic syndrome and CHAOS (coronary artery disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis, obesity, stroke) syndrome.

The term metabolic syndrome is now generally applied, and the condition now affects about one-third of the U.S. population and is increasing(14).

Eggs and Diabetes

There has been some concern about the effects of eggs in people with diabetes. A number of studies, some of them very large, have shown that people who eat eggs do not have an increased risk of heart disease or stroke(15). In some studies the risk of stroke is actually lower with egg consumption(16).

The risk of heart disease is greater in diabetics who eat eggs, however, although it is not clear in these studies whether this is due to the eggs or to other factors like diet, exercise or severity of the diabetes(17).

If people with diabetes follow a low-carbohydrate diet, eating eggs is associated with a decrease in risk factors for heart disease(18) and improvement of the metabolic syndrome(19).

Eggs have several other health benefits. They are rich in the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which reduce the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration, the leading causes of visual loss with aging(20).

They also supply choline, a brain nutrient and precursor of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which may be deficient in the diet of as many as 90 per cent of people in the United States (21).

Eggs are a rich source of high-quality protein, which is increasingly important with age in maintaining bone health (22) and muscle mass(23).

They have also been shown to increase satiety and facilitate weight loss with dieting(24), and to enhance the loss of body fat(25).

How many eggs a day can you safely eat? Apparently, as many as you want, if you pay attention to your total calorie intake and are careful about carbohydrate intake.

If you have diabetes, you can safely eat eggs too, but will need to be particularly attentive to carbohydrates and blood sugar control.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 27, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/top-9-natural-herbs-for-memory/,Top 9 Natural Herbs For Memory,"Many people associate memory loss with ageing. But whether it’s occasional forgetfulness or loss of short-term memory, one must be aware that there are specific factors that can cause it even at a young age instead of simply attributing memory loss to a natural decline in cognitive functioning. (Updated Aug 24, 2023)

These causes include alcohol, drug or tobacco abuse, certain medications, sleeplessness, stress and depression, nutritional deficiency, head injury, stroke and dementia. Whether to prevent or treat memory loss, these natural herbs have served as timeless aids:

1. Gingko Biloba

There is a reason why gingko biloba supplements are one of the most popular herbal medications in Europe and America. Among its many therapeutic benefits, gingko biloba’s power to enhance memory stands out.

In particular, scientific studies discovered gingko’s potency to aid memory and thinking of those with Alzheimer’s or vascular dementia by protecting nerve cells damaged by these disorders to improve learning, daily activities, social behavior and reduce feelings of depression. Laboratory tests further show gingko biloba’s value in improving blood circulation along the central nervous system to promote overall brain development and functioning.

The mechanism behind gingko leaves is due to the presence of two types of chemicals, flavonoids and terpenoids, which contain antioxidants to combat free radicals that contribute to health disorders like Alzheimer’s and dementia. Studies confirming gingko’s effectiveness to enhance memory in older adults continue to be promising.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/fruits-to-avoid-for-high-blood-pressure/,5 Fruits to Avoid for High Blood Pressure,"Let’s talk about the 5 worst fruits to avoid if you have high blood pressure, and the best fruits to lower blood pressure.

Today, we’re going to discuss an important topic that affects millions of people worldwide: high blood pressure.

This condition, also known as hypertension, occurs when the force of blood against the walls of your arteries is consistently too high.

This can damage your blood vessels, heart and kidneys, leading to serious health issues.

So, it’s important NOT to brush off high blood pressure, just because you don’t see any symptoms.

The only way you can detect high blood pressure early is through regular monitoring or tests. You can then take the necessary steps to get this silent killer under control.

Now, let’s get into the fruits you need to avoid if you’re trying to lower your blood pressure.

While fruits are generally considered healthy, some types of fruit are very rich in sugar and salt and can contribute to elevated blood pressure levels.

Let’s start with Number 5. “Fruit Juices.”

Things can take a not-so-healthy turn when fruits are converted into juices. While fruit juice is generally healthy, it may not be beneficial for people with high blood pressure.

In one study, central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) was found to be 3-4 mm Hg higher in individuals who regularly consumed fruit juice compared to those who did not.

Central systolic blood pressure is the pressure seen by the heart, the brain, and the kidneys.

Fruit juices, as compared to whole fruit, have a high concentration of both naturally occurring and added sugars. Take the example of orange juice.

Oranges are considered healthy because they’re rich in fiber, minerals, and vitamins. When converted into juice, they lose all of the fiber, so you’re just drinking a glass of sugar or fructose.

Commercial fruit juices sold in stores are worse; they contain added sugars, like sucrose or corn syrup.

The high consumption of sugary beverages, such as soda, energy drinks, and fruit juice, significantly contributes to the rising prevalence of hypertension and fatty liver disease in developed countries.

Now, let’s briefly look at how excess sugar increases blood pressure.

First, a high-sugar diet increases inflammation and oxidative stress. This damages the lining of blood vessels and causes plaque to accumulate, blocking your blood flow.

Second, fructose increases uric acid in your blood, which blocks the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and opens blood vessels. When there’s less nitric oxide, your blood vessels narrow. This leads to higher blood pressure.

Third, excess sugar increases blood pressure indirectly through insulin resistance and being overweight.

Next, we have, Number 4. “Crystallized or Candied Fruits.”

Dried fruits are highly nutritious because they contain natural sugars. However, candied fruits contain high amounts of added sugars.

Eating dried fruit in moderate amounts supports good heart health and regulates healthy blood pressure. Studies have found that prunes and raisins are rich sources of fiber and antioxidants that may help in lowering blood pressure.

On the other hand, candied fruits contain high fructose corn syrup and have been shown to damage blood vessels and impair their ability to regulate blood pressure.

They are made by boiling fruit in syrup so that the fruit loses its natural moisture, dries up and eventually substitutes the water with sugar.

Similarly, crystallized fruits, such as crystallized ginger, are typically made by cooking ginger root in sugar syrup and then coating it with sugar.

This means that a very high amount of added sugar is entering your system, which can raise your blood pressure levels. Candied fruits are just like candies.

And at Number 3, we have, “Grapefruit.”

Grapefruit contains natural compounds that may interfere with the absorption of cholesterol, diabetes and blood pressure drugs.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that various hypertension medications, both prescription and over-the-counter, may interact negatively with grapefruit or grapefruit juice. It may cause either too much or too little of the drug to remain in your system, both of which are dangerous.

Research has shown that grapefruit increases the dosage of medication entering the bloodstream, by inhibiting the enzyme CYP3A4 in the intestinal tract. This can cause undesirable effects.

So, if you’re on any blood pressure medication, you should ask your doctor whether you can take grapefruit.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

Moving on, we have Number 2. “Canned Fruits.”

Fruit cans are often lined with a chemical called bisphenol A (BPA), which causes your blood pressure to go up. According to new research, a 5-millimeter rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was associated with consuming two cans of fruit.

Systolic blood pressure is the top number and refers to the amount of pressure experienced by the arteries while the heart is beating.

In addition, canned fruits are less nutritious and contain added sugars and sodium. Picture this – you’re enjoying a bowl of canned peaches or pears, but something is lurking behind that syrupy sweetness: excess sodium.

Consuming too much sodium can lead to water retention, putting extra strain on your blood vessels and increasing blood pressure.

If you’re trying to control high blood pressure, you’ll want to give canned fruits a miss. This includes “canned vegetables”, such as tomatoes, beans, peas, sweet corn, and olives; these “vegetables” are technically fruits!

And Number 1 may come as a surprise. “Ripe Bananas.”

Bananas are well-known as a rich source of potassium, a mineral that lowers blood pressure by relaxing the walls of blood vessels.

Potassium also helps the kidneys excrete excess sodium instead of retaining it.

However, high-potassium foods can interfere with blood pressure medications, such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, that increase your body’s retention of potassium.

Too much potassium in your blood is dangerous and can cause an irregular heartbeat or heart attack.

Furthermore, ripe bananas are high in sugar and can cause blood pressure to spike. As bananas ripen, the starches are broken down into natural sugars.

So, if you’re going to eat bananas, go for green bananas which have less sugar.

And talk to your doctor if needed, to avoid unwanted complications, especially if you have kidney issues.

There you have it – 5 fruits to avoid if you have high blood pressure.

Now, you may be wondering: What are the fruits that can lower blood pressure? Let’s look at 5 fruits.
So, Number 1 is “Citrus Fruits.”

Citrus fruits, such as oranges, and lemons contain flavonoids like hesperidin, which have been linked to lower blood pressure levels. They are also loaded with fiber, potassium and vitamin C, an antioxidant that protects cells from damage and helps repair artery walls. Vitamin C also helps boost nitric oxide production, which in turn lowers blood pressure.

Next, Number 2 is, “Berries.”

Berries, like blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries, offer heart health benefits similar to citrus fruits. A review of clinical studies published in 2020 found that different kinds of berries, whether they were whole, freeze-dried, or made into juice, lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) by more than 3 mm Hg. In this study, cranberry juice had the most effect on SBP.

At Number 3, we have “Kiwifruit.”

Kiwifruit is loaded with high amounts of vitamin C, fiber, potassium, magnesium, and antioxidant flavonoids. In one study, a group of 43 healthy Asian individuals in New Zealand discovered that their blood pressure was reduced by 2.7 mm Hg after eating two kiwis for breakfast every day for 7 weeks.

Next, Number 4 is, “Avocados.”

Avocados are packed with heart-healthy nutrients that include oleic acid, potassium, folate, and fiber. One study published in 2023 showed that the consumption of 5+ avocado servings a week is associated with a 17% effective decrease in the rate of high blood pressure.

And Number 5, is “Apples.”

Apples are a great source of fiber and quercetin, an antioxidant that studies have shown to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure. Eating 100-150 grams of apples per day decreases blood pressure, total and LDL cholesterol, inflammation and cardiovascular risk.

High blood pressure, if left undetected or unmanaged, can cause damage over time.

It’s important to be aware of the potential consequences, which may include:

Heart Attack: Damaged arteries can become blocked and prevent proper blood flow to the heart muscle.

Stroke: The blood vessels that supply oxygen and blood to the brain can become blocked or burst.

Heart Failure: Increased workload on the heart can cause it to enlarge and eventually fail to supply enough blood to the body.

Kidney Disease or Failure: Damaged arteries around the kidneys can impair their ability to effectively filter blood.

Vision Loss: Strained or damaged blood vessels in the eyes can result in vision loss.

Sexual Dysfunction: For men, hypertension can contribute to erectile dysfunction, while for women, it may affect libido.

Angina: High blood pressure can contribute to heart diseases such as microvascular disease (MVD), which manifests as chest pain.

Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): Atherosclerosis can narrow arteries in the legs and arms, resulting in pain and fatigue.

Hypertensive Crisis: This medical emergency occurs when blood pressure rapidly rises above 180/120, potentially causing organ damage. Symptoms include blurry vision, dizziness, severe headaches, nosebleeds, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, and anxiety.

Remember, an anti-inflammatory diet and an active lifestyle is key to managing your blood pressure effectively.

And for many women, hair is also a source of pride and even identity. (Updated Aug 16, 2023)

Rice water has long been used in Asia for clear skin and long, luscious hair. The Yao minority ethnic women from Huangluo Village, in Guangxi Province, in southern China, have one striking feature in common—their extraordinarily long hair that stays black until they are around 80 years old.

With their average hair length of about 6 feet, the Yao ethnic women made it to the Guinness Book of World Records as the “world’s longest hair village.” Part of their secret to having such long hair lies in washing it with fermented rice water.

What Can Rice Do For Your Skin and Hair?

This grain is rich in antioxidants, minerals, vitamin E, and traces of pitera, a substance produced during the fermentation process. These nutrients in the rice water help to heal scars and reduce wrinkles, fine lines, and inflammation, leaving the skin with a healthy glow (1). Rice also contains iron, zinc and B-complex vitamins (2) that are essential for hair growth (3).

https://dailyhealthpost.com/8-sleeping-positions-and-their-effects-on-health/,8 Sleeping Positions and Their Effects on Health,"Getting enough sleep is most important – but did you know that how you sleep can also impact your health? Let’s take a look at eight common sleeping positions and what they do to your body. (Updated Aug 16, 2023)

Best Position To Sleep
1. On Your Back, Arms at Sides

Sleeping on your back with your arms at your side is generally considered to be the best sleeping position for spine health and it’s good for your neck, too, as long as you don’t use too many pillows. That said, back sleepers tend to snore more than those in any other position and sleep apnea is strongly associated with sleeping on the back.

2. On Your Back, Arms Up

This so-called “starfish” position is also good for the back. Whether you have your arms up around your pillow or not, sleeping on your back may also help to prevent facial wrinkles and skin breakouts. However, like the arms-down back sleeping position, this one can also result in snoring and problems with acid reflux. Plus, having your arms up can put pressure on nerves in your shoulders, leading to pain.

3. Face Down

Sleeping on your stomach can improve digestion but unless you’ve developed a way to breathe through your pillow, it most likely leads to you tilting your face in one direction or the other. This can put a lot of strain on the neck. Sleeping face down can also cause back pain, as the curve of the spine is not supported.

4. Fetal Position

Sleeping all curled up into a ball with your knees drawn up and your chin tilted down might be comfortable but it’s probably one of the worst sleeping positions to consider as it can do a number on your back and neck.

The extreme curl of the fetal position can also restrict deep breathing. That considered, sleeping like a fetus can have you sleeping like a baby if you typically have problems with snoring or if you’re pregnant.

5. On Side, Arms at Sides

When you’re sleeping on your side with both arms down, the spine is best supported in its natural curve. This can definitely help reduce back and neck pain while also reducing sleep apnea. The downside? Sleeping on the side can contribute to skin aging due to gravity, meaning facial wrinkles and sagging breasts.

6. On Side, Arms Out

This position has many of the same benefits of sleeping on your side with your arms straight down. However, any side sleeping can cause shoulder and arm pain due to restricted blood flow and pressure on the nerves, which may be exacerbated by having your arms out in front of you.

7. On the Right Side

If you’re a side-sleeper, which side you sleep on also makes a difference. Sleeping on the right side can worsen heartburn while sleeping on the left side can put strain on internal organs like the liver, lungs, and stomach (while minimizing acid reflux). For pregnant sleepers, doctors typically advise sleeping on the left side, since this can improve circulation to the fetus.

8. Pillow-Supplemented

Choosing a proper sleeping position is important but regardless of which sleeping position you prefer, it’s highly likely that you can get a better night’s rest with less pain in the morning by supplementing your body with a pillow.

Back sleepers can put a small pillow under the arch of their spine, side sleepers can place a pillow between their knees, and stomach sleepers can place a pillow under their hips to support the joints and allow for full, pain-free relaxation.

Of all the sleeping positions mentioned, which one gives you the best night’s rest without pain?

https://dailyhealthpost.com/improve-blood-flow-to-legs-and-feet/,The Best Meal to Improve Blood Flow to Legs & Feet,"Let’s talk about the best meal you can eat to improve blood flow to your legs and feet.

These foods have been scientifically proven to increase blood circulation by dilating your blood vessels and lowering inflammation. If you feel low in energy, have high blood pressure, or have any discomfort in your legs, pay close attention to this video. We’ll also be sharing a simple solution to boost your blood flow and oxygen levels in just 20 minutes.

But first, let’s talk about why good blood flow is important.

Your heart works tirelessly to pump blood throughout your body. This blood carries vital oxygen and nutrients to every cell in your body, to ensure they function optimally. Now, think about your legs and feet. They’re the farthest from your heart, so they’re the last to get this oxygen and nutrient-rich blood.

So, if your blood flow isn’t great, these areas can suffer the most. You start to feel pain, heaviness and even swelling in your legs and feet. This is because nutrient-poor blood causes your arteries to narrow and reduces blood flow to your legs.

Over time, your nerves and tissues become damaged, and blood clots can form. You may develop conditions like peripheral artery disease (PAD), peripheral neuropathy (PN) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Next, let’s get into the foods you can pick for a meal that is not only tasty but also improves your blood flow.

Each of these foods is a powerhouse of nutrients that can jumpstart your circulation.

Let’s dive in with our first star ingredient: wild salmon.

This fatty fish plays a pivotal role in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.

Wild salmon is rich in omega-3, a type of fat that’s more than just healthy—it’s essential. Our bodies can’t produce omega-3s on their own, so we need to get them from our diet. Salmon is one of the best sources out there, and wild salmon is better than farmed salmon; we’ll explain why in just a minute.

But why are omega-3s so important?

Our cell membranes need Omega-3s (EPA and DHA are the two most important ones), especially our brain, eyes and heart. Omega-3s help soothe chronic inflammation that wreaks havoc on your body, including impairing circulation.

Inflammation causes your arteries to narrow and harden, a condition known as atherosclerosis. This impedes blood flow, making it harder for your heart to pump blood to your legs and feet. But with omega-3s on your side, you can keep inflammation in check and ensure your arteries are open and relaxed, allowing for strong contractions and smooth-flowing blood.

Now, farmed salmon might be easier on your wallet and more readily available, even boasting a bit more Omega-3 than its wild cousin. But there’s a catch—farmed salmon also contains six times the amount of Omega-6 compared to wild salmon. This comes from the non-marine feed that farmed salmon eats, which is loaded with Omega-6.

Now, if you’re eating a typical Western-style diet, chances are you’re already consuming plenty of Omega-6 from vegetable seed oils found in processed foods. This creates unwanted inflammation in your body. So, it’s a good idea not to add more Omega-6 into your diet. If possible, opt for wild salmon to keep inflammation at bay.

Other wild fatty fish high in Omega-3 and low in Omega-6 you can substitute for salmon, are anchovies and mackerel.

One interesting thing studies have found is that your body uses the Omega-3 fats from fatty fish to make a compound called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide stimulates the relaxation of blood vessels, leading to improved blood flow and lowered blood pressure. This reduces the risk of heart attack and blood clots.

Now, it’s important to understand how nitric oxide is produced in your body because this molecule is key to strong blood circulation and high oxygen levels.

Picture a process in your body that converts an amino acid, L-arginine, into nitric oxide. This process takes place in the endothelium, and it’s boosted by Omega-3s, which increase the amount of L-arginine that can be converted.

So, “What is the endothelium?” It’s a layer of cells lining your blood vessels, from the major arteries in your heart and lungs down to the smallest capillaries in your fingers, toes, eyes, and all your organs.

The reason the endothelium is vital is because it controls blood flow throughout your whole body. And nitric oxide is the signaling molecule that keeps your endothelium healthy.

However, as we get older, our endothelium can slow down, and nitric oxide production decreases. This is why many people experience circulation issues and stop enjoying life.

But have you ever noticed older individuals who seem younger than their years? They likely have a robust endothelium. The exciting part is that certain foods, which we discuss in this video, can help your endothelium stay healthy. So, keep watching!

If you would like to discover a 10-second solution to boost nitric oxide and blood oxygen levels in 20 minutes, click the link below at the end of this video.

Now, nitric oxide is so crucial to your body that it has a backup plan for its production – dietary nitrates. We’ll get into this fascinating process in the next food, coming up now.

Next, let’s add a side dish of arugula salad.

Arugula is the cruciferous vegetable that’s going to form the base of our salad. So, what’s so special about cruciferous vegetables?

First, these vegetables, which also include broccoli, kale and Brussels sprouts, are known for their liver-loving properties. They contain compounds such as sulforaphane, that support liver detoxification.

Since the liver is responsible for filtering your blood, by keeping your liver happy, you’re also helping to keep your blood clean and flowing smoothly.

Next, arugula is a healthy source of nitrates. Nitrates are converted to nitrites by bacteria in your mouth and stomach, which is then converted to nitric oxide, once inside your tissues and blood. And nitric oxide helps your blood vessels relax to improve blood flow.

Other vegetables rich in nitrates are beetroot, spinach, lettuce, and bok choy.

Arugula is also rich in potassium and magnesium, two minerals that help the muscles in your blood vessel walls relax and contract properly.

One suggestion is to toss your arugula salad with an olive oil dressing and serve it with roasted beets, oranges, pecans, and feta cheese.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is rich in monounsaturated fats that can help lower bad cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation in your blood vessels.

A second side dish we can add is the fermented vegetable, kimchi.

Kimchi is a superfood for heart health and circulation that many people neglect. It’s a fermented vegetable similar to sauerkraut.

The process of fermentation involves the presence of highly beneficial microbial species. These friendly microbes or probiotics deliver a host of benefits to humans when kimchi is consumed.

These benefits include lower blood sugar, reduced insulin resistance, less inflammation, and the production of B vitamins, such as B6, folate, and B12.

In other words, eating kimchi can help improve your gut microbiome, and increase the assimilation of nutrients, which in turn improves your cardiovascular system.

Kimchi is made from cabbage, onion, garlic, radish, chili pepper, and ginger – an incredible combination for strong blood flow.

Animal studies suggest that kimchi may reduce inflammation and increase nitric oxide production in the endothelium.

This fermented vegetable contains massive amounts of vitamin C, and beta-carotene, and also has vitamin K2.

Vitamin C is the most important nutrient your body relies on to repair and replenish the collagen fibers necessary for maintaining healthy artery walls.

While vitamin K2 directs calcium to your bones and not your arteries, thereby preventing the calcification of arteries in your legs and heart.

If you don’t like spicy food, or cannot get used to kimchi, replace it with sauerkraut.

Next, let’s add certain fruits before or after your meal.

There’s no best time to eat fruits; some people insist that fruits are better before a meal while others prefer them after.

Certain fruits have been linked with improved circulation. One of them is watermelon. There are two ways eating watermelon can enhance blood flow. One, the antioxidant called lycopene that gives watermelon its red color, has been linked to lower blood pressure levels. In addition, watermelon also contains an amino acid called L-citrulline. Citrulline is converted into arginine efficiently in the body, which in turn increases the production of nitric oxide in the endothelium.

Alternatively, enjoy a bowl of mixed berries, like blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. Berries are packed with vitamin C and antioxidants that reduce inflammation in your arteries and therefore prevent circulatory issues.

Pomegranate deserves special mention. Studies have shown that patients who drank pomegranate juice daily over 12 months reversed plaque accumulation in the carotid arteries. This suggests that eating pomegranates can help people with peripheral artery disease.

And finally, let’s conclude our meal with cinnamon.

Picture this: you’ve just enjoyed this super meal and now you’re settling down with a hot cup of tea. You add a dash of Ceylon cinnamon and instantly, your tea is transformed. It’s not just about the warm, spicy kick that cinnamon adds to your tea. Cinnamon is a health dynamo, known for its blood sugar-regulating properties. Plus its antiplatelet and antithrombotic properties can help prevent blood clots and improve circulation.

A good alternative to cinnamon tea is hawthorn tea. Hawthorn berry has been used for centuries in Asia to help people with heart, circulatory, and respiratory troubles. Modern scientific research confirms that hawthorn has a remarkable ability to protect endothelial cells from damage, so more nitric oxide can be produced to improve blood flow.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-stop-progressions-of-bunion/,How To STOP The Progression of Your BUNION With These 5 Natural Techniques,"Feet aren’t exactly the first thing you look at when you meet someone. However, if they were more publicly displayed, you’d notice that many of your close friends and family probably suffer from a strange bump on the lower joint of their big toe. This rotates the big toe towards your other toes. The medical term for this condition is “bunion” (1). (Updated Aug 9, 2023)

This condition can also affect the small toe and may cause intense pain and discomfort as it develops.

Bunions are extremely common, affecting 23% of people 18-65 years old and 36% of elderly adults (2).

What Causes Bunions?

The most common cause of bunions is genetics. In fact, it’s a highly inheritable trait for men and women of European descent. Chances are, if you have bunions, your children probably will too.

While the condition is most often an inherited trait certain outside factors such as foot injuries or deformities present at birth can increase your risk of developing bunions (3).

Inflammatory conditions, like arthritis, or lifestyle factors, like spending a lot of time on your feet and wearing improper footwear, may also contribute towards the condition.

How To Treat Bunions

Even if your bunion isn’t interfering with your day-to-day or causing any pain, it may worsen over time and limit your mobility in the future.

However, there are a few things you can do halt the progression of your bunion (4).

Maintain a normal weight.
Stay active and practice flexibility-based exercises, like yoga.
Protect the bunion from blisters with a moleskin or gel-filled pad.
Use podiatrist-approved shoe inserts.
Under a doctor’s guidance, wear a splint at night to hold the toe straight and ease discomfort.
Eat anti-inflammatory
Purchase well-fitting footwear that is wide in the toe area.

If you frequently experience pain cause by your bunion, try the natural remedies below.

1. Olive oil

Warm up a bit of olive oil and use it to massage your bunion twice a day for 15 minutes. This will help increase blood flow throughout the foot and stimulate synovial fluid movement in the joint.

As you massage, practice the technique in the video above to increase flexibility and strength in your toe to push it back into its natural alignment.

You can also add more olive oil to your diet to fight foot inflammation and pain (5).

2. Red Pepper

Applying a heat compress to your bunion provides relief, but it isn’t very practical if you run around all day. Instead, apply pepper juice to your toe joint, wrap it with a bandage and get on with your day.

Peppers contain capsaicin, a compound that heats up your skin to relieve pain and inflammation. It’s actually the main ingredient in most heat therapy ointments. All peppers produce capsaicin, but using stronger peppers like cayenne may cause skin irritation and a slight burning sensation, so trick to red pepper (6).

3. Castor Oil

The Castor oil‘s anti-inflammatory properties help reduce swelling and improve joint mobility (7). Heating up the oil will also soother tight muscles in the foot to free up your tendons and relieve pain.

To use, gently heat ½ cup of oil into a small saucepan until it is warm to the touch but does not burn. Dip a thin cloth into the solution, wrap it around your foot and cover with a towel to prevent heat loss. Leave it on until the cloth becomes cool and repeat up to 3 times a day for pain relief.

4. Epsom Salt

Epsom Salts contain the powerful compound magnesium sulfate, which has been known to reduce inflammation and pain (8). It also relaxes sore muscles, reduces stress, and improves nerve health.

To use, add half a cup of Epsom salt to a foot-sized tub of hot water and soak your feet your 20 minutes. Follow-up with a light massage and repeat twice a day.

5. Ice Pack

After a long day on your feet, use an ice pain to provide temporary for intense or sharp pain. Simply apply for 10 minutes at a time and repeat as often as needed until the pain subsides (9). 

Bonus:

This massage focusses on releasing tension in the connective tissue in your foot that may be causing or contributing to your condition.

To start, sit down on a comfortable chair with your feet firmly on the ground. Grab a new pencil and use the eraser to apply light pressure right above where the inside of your big toe meets your foot. This spot should feel a little sore.

Place your other hand above your foot and push your foot in the direction of your little toe. As you do so, push the pencil into your big toe with maximum force.

Next, lift your heel up and down 10 times to get a deeper stretch. It might hurt a bit at first, but doing 30 repetitions of this exercise 3 times a day definitely helps.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 9, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/neuropathy-remedies/,Top 6 Neuropathy Remedies (Peripheral Neuropathy Home Remedies),"Let’s talk about the best natural remedies to treat neuropathic pain, including peripheral neuropathy.

Once you have experienced the torment of neuropathy, you’ll never forget it. The weakness, pain, and numbness caused by this condition are truly like no other.

So, what exactly is neuropathy?

It occurs when one or more of your nerves are diseased or malfunctioning. The most prevalent type, peripheral neuropathy, affects your hands, feet, arms, and legs.

Normally, your peripheral nerves transmit messages from your brain and spinal cord to different parts of your body. However, when neuropathy damages these nerves, the messages get intercepted. This alters the way your body responds to pain, temperature changes, and various other factors. If you suffer from chronic neuropathic pain, these symptoms can flare up unexpectedly, without any clear cause.

One of the leading causes of neuropathy is disease, particularly diabetes, which accounts for 30% of cases. Other causes include cancer treatment, infections, amputations, injuries, and long-term, excessive alcohol consumption.

Surprisingly, neuropathy is more common than you think. Approximately one in three people in the United States deal with chronic pain, with 20% of them experiencing neuropathic pain. A 2014 study estimated that up to 10% of all Americans have some form of neuropathic pain. 

It’s certainly a challenging condition to live with, but thankfully, there are natural ways to treat and reverse it…

Before we dive into natural treatment options, let’s explore the symptoms of neuropathy.

While each person’s experience may vary, some common symptoms include:

Tingling, numbness, and “pins and needles”.

Burning, stabbing, or shooting pain.

Sudden pain without an obvious trigger.

Sensitivity to typically non-painful situations (such as cold weather or brushing hair).

Difficult-to-describe and unpleasant sensations.

Sleep disturbances.

And emotional toll from living with chronic pain, sleep deprivation, and difficulty articulating symptoms.

Now, there are different types of neuropathy, depending on which nerves are damaged.

Here are seven of the most common ones…

Peripheral Neuropathy

This is the most prevalent form of neuropathy and results from damage to the peripheral nervous system. This condition predominantly affects the nerves in your hands, feet, arms, and legs. If you have peripheral neuropathy, you may also notice a gradual onset of numbness starting in your hands and spreading to your arms and legs.

Charcot’s Joint

This is also referred to as neuropathic arthropathy, a condition where a joint deteriorates as a result of nerve-related issues. Typically affecting the foot, individuals with Charcot’s Joint often experience a significant loss of sensation in their feet. On top of that, the muscles are unable to adequately support the joint, leading to difficulties in walking. Individuals with pre-existing neuropathy are particularly susceptible to this condition.

Compression Mononeuropathy

This is a relatively common type of neuropathy. It occurs when a single nerve is damaged, resulting in numbness and swelling. One example that most people are familiar with is carpal tunnel syndrome.

Femoral Neuropathy

Most cases of femoral neuropathy, or femoral nerve dysfunction, occur in people who have type 2 diabetes. It affects the legs, causing pain and muscle weakness in the thighs, and potentially down to the feet.

Unilateral Foot Drop

This is a condition that occurs as a result of damage to the peroneal nerve in the leg. This nerve controls the muscles responsible for lifting the foot; so people with this condition are unable to raise the affected foot.

Focal Neuropathy

This condition is characterized by sudden weakness or pain that can impact a single nerve or a cluster of nerves. It may lead to double vision, pain in specific body parts like the thigh, or even result in Bell’s palsy—a form of partial facial paralysis.

Cranial Neuropathy

This affects the 12 sets of nerves that connect to the brain and play a crucial role in sight, hearing, eye movement, and taste. It can lead to the paralysis of eye muscles, resulting in double vision. There are various types of cranial neuropathies, including Bell’s palsy, microvascular cranial nerve palsy, third nerve palsy, fourth nerve palsy, sixth nerve palsy, and multiple cranial neuropathies (MCN).

Next, if you’re looking to reverse neuropathy, here are 6 home remedies to try…
At Number 6, we have, “Socks for Neuropathy”.

Peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes can leave your feet vulnerable to unexpected everyday damage. Due to reduced sensation, you might not even feel the pain if a small object gets stuck in your shoe or if you step on something sharp. This puts you at risk of foot injuries and developing ulcers without realizing it.

Fortunately, diabetic socks offer a solution. These specially designed socks not only help mitigate the risks but also ensure your feet stay dry, comfortable, and well-ventilated. With seamless construction, they minimize friction and prevent potential damage. Plus, the breathable moisture-wicking fabric helps ward off infections, while the added padding provides extra protection.

Wearing diabetic socks can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with neuropathy. However, if you also have poor circulation in your feet, it’s crucial to select socks that fit snugly without rubbing against your skin while still allowing proper airflow. Pair your diabetic socks with comfortable shoes that are not too tight.

Next up, we have Number 5. “Supplements for Neuropathy”.

When it comes to managing neuropathy and its symptoms, anti-inflammatory supplements like krill oil can be incredibly beneficial. Packed with omega-3 fatty acids, krill oil not only helps alleviate neuropathic pain but also promotes neuron growth.

But that’s not all – krill oil offers a wide range of benefits; it protects your brain, balances blood sugar and improves blood lipids.

Moreover, for those suffering from neuropathy caused by autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, krill oil’s anti-inflammatory effects can provide relief for the root symptoms of the disease itself.

You can reap the amazing benefits of krill oil and its powerful omega-3s, by making this supplement a part of your daily routine.

If you are taking fish oil, you may be wondering why we recommend krill oil; there are two main reasons. One, the Omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil are in the form of phospholipids, which are better absorbed by your body’s cells than the triglycerides in fish oil.

Two, krill oil contains a powerful antioxidant called astaxanthin which helps protect your body against oxidative damage and enhances the absorption of anti-inflammatory Omega-3s. To see our recommended wild-caught Antarctic krill oil supplement, click the link below.

To learn about other nutrients for neuropathy, see our video, “The Best Vitamins for Your Nerves“.
Moving on, we have Number 4. “Herbs for Neuropathy”.

Curcumin, the powerful compound found in turmeric, holds great promise in providing relief for neuropathy. It exhibits remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, making it an ideal herb for soothing numbness and tingling in your feet or hands.

Interestingly, a groundbreaking 2013 study discovered that consumption of curcumin in the early stages of neuropathy may prevent chronic neuropathic pain.

Moreover, a 2014 animal study showcased the potential of curcumin in alleviating symptoms of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.

If you choose to take curcumin as a supplement, find one with enhanced bioavailability, such as the one we recommend. This means your body can absorb curcumin more effectively and reap its maximum benefits; click the link below to learn more.

In the top 3, we have Number 3. “Acupuncture for Neuropathy”.

Acupuncture, a key treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), involves the gentle insertion of thin needles at precise points on the body’s surface, to activate the body’s innate healing response. This technique offers a multitude of benefits, including the management of neuropathic pain. By stimulating the release of endorphins, acupuncture induces a positive, pain-relieving feeling throughout the body.

Scientific research has consistently shown that acupuncture is highly effective in alleviating neuropathic pain. It provides a gentle and holistic alternative to medication, without any side effects. Moreover, this treatment can also safeguard your nerves from potential future damage.

Moving to Number 2, we have, “Essential Oils for Neuropathy”.

Research has suggested that certain essential oils can be beneficial in managing nerve pain. Let’s explore a few options:

Peppermint oil: Known for its soothing properties, peppermint oil can help alleviate muscle discomfort and relieve pain. In a study, patients reported immediate pain relief when applying this oil topically.

Roman chamomile: This essential oil is believed to have muscle-calming effects, potentially offering relief for inflammatory disorders.

Lavender: Not only does lavender oil possess muscle-relaxing properties, but it may also aid in reducing stress and promoting relaxation.

Moreover, blending multiple essential oils can provide additional relief for neuropathy. A 2010 study found that a combination of geranium, bergamot, lavender, eucalyptus, and tea tree oils provided pain relief for some participants.

If you plan to try essential oils at home, remember to dilute them with a carrier oil like coconut or olive oil before applying them to your skin. This will ensure safety and effectiveness.

In addition to topical applications, diffusing relaxing oils in the air can also help alleviate the anxiety and fatigue associated with chronic pain. But do note that some essential oils may not be safe to diffuse around pets.

And at Number 1, we have, “Exercise for Neuropathy”.

Regular physical activity, particularly aerobics and stretching exercises, has been shown to effectively reduce the intensity of neuropathic pain. In addition to slowing nerve damage and improving circulation, exercise can serve as a valuable outlet for managing the stress associated with chronic conditions.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-sciatica-pain/,1 Mineral to STOP Sciatica Pain & Relieve Nerve Pain,"Let’s talk about a miracle mineral that can help reduce and stop sciatica and nerve pain. This mineral is none other than magnesium, specifically, one particular form of magnesium.

Now, you may be wondering, “Why magnesium?”

The answer lies in the multifaceted roles that this essential mineral plays within your body. Magnesium, often overlooked, is a powerhouse when it comes to maintaining and enhancing your neurological health.

From a neurological perspective, magnesium is a key player in nerve transmission, the process by which signals or ‘messages’ are sent throughout your nervous system. It aids in the conduction of neuromuscular activities, ensuring that your muscles respond correctly to nerve stimulation.

This function is particularly important when we consider nerve degenerative conditions, like sciatica and diabetic neuropathy, where nerve signal transmission is often compromised.

But the role of magnesium doesn’t stop at nerve transmission and neuromuscular conduction. It also serves a protective function, guarding our neurons–the building blocks of our nervous system–against excessive excitation.

This overstimulation can lead to neuronal cell death, a process that can contribute to a multitude of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

So, by regulating the excitability of our neurons, magnesium helps to maintain the health and functionality of our nervous system.

Now, the benefits of magnesium in neurological health are not just theoretical.

They are backed by scientific research that has shown the significant impact of magnesium supplements on the recovery of various neurological disorders, including sciatica.

A 2018 study published on PubMed provides compelling evidence of the role of magnesium in nerve health. The researchers found that magnesium supplementation promoted the regeneration of the sciatic nerve in subjects and it also down-regulated the inflammatory response.

Next, let’s understand what’s going on with sciatic nerve pain.

Sciatica is a specific type of nerve pain that is characterized by discomfort radiating along the path of the sciatic nerve.

This nerve is the longest in the human body, originating from the lower back, branching through the hips and buttocks and extending down each leg. When you experience sciatica, the pain typically affects only one side of your body.

The pain associated with sciatica can range from mild to severe and can be quite debilitating. It often feels like a sharp or burning sensation or like electric shocks. It can be accompanied by numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness in the affected leg or foot. These symptoms can be triggered by simple movements like coughing or sneezing and prolonged sitting can worsen the discomfort.

The root cause of sciatica is often a herniated disk, bone spur on the spine, or narrowing of the spine, also known as spinal stenosis. These conditions can compress part of the nerve, leading to inflammation, pain and often some numbness in the affected leg. In rare cases, it can also be caused by conditions such as tumors or damage due to diseases like diabetes.

Now, let’s take a closer look at the mechanism through which magnesium helps to alleviate sciatic nerve pain.

Magnesium acts as a natural muscle relaxant to reduce muscle tension and inflammation. Inflammation is a common response to nerve damage and can exacerbate pain and further impede nerve function. By reducing inflammation, magnesium not only aids in nerve recovery but also helps to alleviate some of the painful symptoms associated with sciatica.

Moreover, magnesium aids in the proper functioning of nerves by acting as a gatekeeper for NMDA receptors which are involved in nerve signal transmission. By blocking these receptors, magnesium can prevent excessive calcium influx that can lead to nerve cell death, a process known as excitotoxicity.

Taking magnesium helps prevent the worsening of nerve conditions, and facilitates nerve regeneration by repairing both the nerve endings and the protective myelin sheath that surrounds them.

Next, let’s look at the function of magnesium in your body– other than regulating nerve signals and muscle contractions and reducing inflammation and pain.

Every cell in your body contains this mineral and needs it to function. About 60% of the magnesium in your body is found in bone, while the rest is distributed in muscles, soft tissues, and fluids, including blood.

This crucial mineral is involved in more than 300 enzymatic reactions in your body. It helps maintain a steady heart rhythm, blood pressure and insulin levels and is vital for energy creation, protein formation, DNA repair and cell renewal.

Multiple studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of magnesium in reducing anxiety, panic attacks, heart palpitations, and the pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia and sciatica.

The problem is, up to 70% of adults are deficient in magnesium.

One of the primary causes is inadequate dietary intake. Many people simply do not consume enough magnesium-rich foods regularly. Magnesium-rich foods include dark chocolate, pumpkin seeds, cashew nuts, avocados, spinach, salmon, oats and beans.

Other causes that interfere with the absorption and retention of magnesium in the body, are medications such as antacids, acid-blockers, and diuretics; diseases such as Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, and type 2 diabetes; and drinking too much alcohol.

But the most important reason is depleted soil nutrients; this results in less magnesium in our food. This means that even with a diet high in magnesium-rich foods, you may still not be getting enough of this crucial mineral. This is especially true if you’re dealing with conditions like sciatica and nerve pain; the solution is to supplement with magnesium.

So, which form of magnesium should you choose to relieve sciatica and nerve pain?

Magnesium supplements come with different rates of bioavailability—that is, how much of the magnesium can be absorbed into your bloodstream and used by your body.

The type of magnesium supplement we recommend is magnesium glycinate. This chelated form of magnesium is the most bioavailable. It’s typically used to correct long-term deficiencies.

It’s especially good for people with nerve pain like sciatica, diabetes neuropathy and multiple sclerosis. As well as for people looking for help with sleep, anxiety and other neurological issues, such as depression. 

Furthermore, magnesium glycinate has been studied for its ability to promote bone health, manage blood sugar, maintain normal heart rhythms, reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), amplify exercise performance, improve fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, and reduce the risk of stroke and heart failure.

Also, it is less likely to cause diarrhea—a common side effect of magnesium supplementation—and is more gentle on the stomach. To see our recommended magnesium glycinate, click the link below.

Next, it’s important to get the dosage right.

The recommended dietary allowance for magnesium varies depending on age and gender, but for adults, it generally ranges from 310 to 420 mg per day. If you’re dealing with sciatica or nerve pain, your healthcare provider may recommend a higher dosage.

A useful guideline for determining the appropriate magnesium dosage is to see how much your body can tolerate without experiencing any gastrointestinal discomfort, such as stomach cramps or diarrhea.

Texas Doctor Reveals A “Miracle Mineral” That Relaxes Restless Legs, Muscle Cramps and Neuropathic Nerve Pain (after a decade of getting it wrong)",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"July 29, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/10612-coconut-oil-weight-loss/,"Eating Coconut Oil Daily Can Help Reduce Waist Size And Lower Cholesterol Levels, Study Finds","Coconut oil is well-known for its health benefits – hailed as a superfood, many people swear by its ability to reduce the waistline of people who take it regularly. But does it really work? (Updated July 26, 2023)

Recent studies on the efficacy and safety of coconut oil as a weight loss supplement seem to indicate that it does in fact lead to waistline reductions and lower levels of fat in the body. Rich in medium chain triglycerides (or MCTs), coconut oil is associated with weight loss due to the length of the fatty acid chains that it contains.

The fatty acid chains in coconut oil differ from longer, more common fatty acid chains found in other plant-based oils, like canola oil and vegetable oil. While the longer-chain fatty acids are stored as body fat, MCTs found in coconut oil are more easily used by the body for energy and are therefore less likely to be stored in the body.

This means that a diet high in MCT-containing oils like coconut oil, as opposed to long-chain fatty acids like canola oil, results in the body burning off more fat for fuel rather than storing it – leading to lower cholesterol levels, a slimmer figure, and better overall health.

“Consumption of MCT oil as part of a weight-loss plan improves weight loss compared with olive oil and can thus be successfully included in a weight-loss diet,” researchers in one study concluded, adding, “Small changes in the quality of fat intake can therefore be useful to enhance weight loss.”

Another study reported on the safety of coconut oil as a weight-loss supplement, concluding that it is safer than most supplements on the market today.

A third study concluded that “MCT oil can be incorporated into a weight loss program without fear of adversely affecting metabolic risk factors.”

Coconut oil is not only effective in helping people reduce their waistlines, but it is also a low-risk dietary supplement, with few to no negative side effects noted in the studies. In fact, a study on pre-menopausal women in the Phillipines associated coconut oil supplements with lower risk of cardiovascular disease.

While conventional wisdom encourages people who are trying to lose weight to reduce their intake of saturated fats like coconut oil, the actual evidence strongly suggests that when taken in moderation as part of a balanced weight loss diet, coconut oil plays a significant role in reducing overall body fat and fighting obesity.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/clean-your-arteries-out/,Top 5 Gut Foods to Clean Your Arteries Out,"Let’s talk about the best gut-healing foods to clean out your arteries; that is, to reduce atherosclerotic plaque.

These foods improve your gut microbiome—the population of bacteria and other microorganisms that live in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

So, why are we talking about the gut when our goal is to prevent artery blockages that can lead to heart attack and stroke?

This is because recent human studies have shown that the wrong balance of gut bacteria is linked to increased amounts of plaque and hardening of the coronary arteries.

Now, the imbalance of gut bacteria, called dysbiosis, can be caused by a lack of diversity of beneficial bacteria, or an increase in harmful bacteria, or both.

In a new study published in July of 2023 in the journal Circulation, Swedish scientists studied the link between gut bacteria and atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries of 8,973 participants aged between 50 and 65.

They found that Streptococcus and other bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity contribute to increased inflammation and plaque buildup in the coronary arteries.

Another study, published in the European Heart Journal in 2018, found for the first time a link between our gut microbiome and the hardening of arteries.

After studying 617 middle-aged twins, scientists found that those with a less diverse mix of good bacteria in their gut also had stiffer arteries.

These studies, and more, show that there is a link between gut health and heart health; and the key to a healthy heart may lie within your gut. This is called the gut-heart connection.

Next, it’s important to understand how an unhealthy gut can affect your heart.

The negative effects of gut bacteria imbalance occur largely through inflammation–your immune system’s reaction to an injury or a foreign substance.

Now, 70% of your body’s inflammatory or immune cells are located in your gut, so it is hardly surprising that inflammation in your gut can spread throughout your body.

There are 4 ways an unhealthy gut can cause inflammation in the arteries and, ultimately, lead to atherosclerosis.
The first way is “Dysbiosis.”

Studies show that patients suffering from chronic heart failure have reduced diversity in their gut bacteria. Also, they have lower levels of microbial by-products called short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, which are beneficial for the heart.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

Second, we have, “Leaky Gut and LPS.”

A primary route by which bacteria can enter the bloodstream and stick to artery walls, causing inflammation, is through a damaged gut barrier, also known as leaky gut.

Leaky gut becomes problematic when large molecules called lipopolysaccharides (LPS), or bacterial toxins, get into your bloodstream and induce inflammation.

This is because inflammation makes the plaque in the arteries unstable and more likely to rupture, which can lead to blood clots, blocking blood flow, and potentially causing a heart attack.

Researchers have found LPS derived from Escherichia coli circulating in the blood of people with heart attacks; these people have leaky guts.

The third way is, “SIBO”, Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth.

Up to 80% of people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) have SIBO. In SIBO, the bacteria in your small intestine become unbalanced and overgrow. Most of your gut bacteria are meant to be in the large intestine and colon.

Symptoms of SIBO include bloating, abdominal pain, reflux, diarrhea, or constipation, or both.

One study found that people with SIBO had stiffer arteries and lower activity of the protein MGP, which prevents the calcification of arteries.

This is because SIBO reduces the absorption of Vitamin K2 from food and its production by gut bacteria. Also, SIBO can cause widespread inflammation in the body, which increases the risk of clogged arteries.

And the fourth way is, “Bacterial Infection.”

Studies show that people with massive quantities of pathogenic bacteria such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori, have higher rates of atherosclerosis. Researchers have been able to identify bacterial DNA in more than 50% of all plaques.

Now, let’s get into the foods that improve your gut microbiome and reduce inflammation in your arteries.
We begin with Number 5. “Fermented Foods & Probiotics.”

You may not know this, but fermented foods, such as kimchi and sauerkraut, are good for your heart. They contain beneficial microbes from the fermentation process that offer many health benefits when consumed; these benefits include reduced blood sugar levels, decreased insulin resistance, reduced inflammation, and the production of B vitamins.

Simply put, fermented foods increase the diversity of good gut bacteria, which helps reduce cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.

These good gut bacteria are called probiotics. Other fermented foods that contain probiotics include unsweetened yogurt and kefir, tempeh, miso, natto, and kombucha.

A detailed study showed that probiotic supplements can reduce high blood pressure. The most effective results were seen when people with high blood pressure took several species of probiotics for at least eight weeks or consumed more than 100 billion CFUs of probiotics daily.

Other studies show that a multi-strain probiotic supplement may help relieve leaky gut symptoms, such as IBS, bloating, and Crohn’s, as well as improve markers of intestinal permeability.

To treat SIBO with probiotics, only use soil-based probiotics (usually Bacillus strains), as they do not contain lactobacillus or bifidobacterium. These two probiotic strains are already overgrown in your small intestine, and adding more will worsen your SIBO symptoms.

Moving on, we have Number 4. “Prebiotic Fiber.”

Simply put, prebiotics are food that your good bacteria, such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, can eat, so they can grow stronger.

Prebiotics are found in many fiber-rich foods like green bananas, garlic, onion, and Jerusalem artichoke, and so are often referred to as prebiotic fiber.

Not all fibers are prebiotics. To be classified as a prebiotic, the fiber must pass through the GI tract undigested and stimulate the growth and activity of good bacteria in the large intestine. Prebiotics also reduce harmful bacteria.

Other foods that are naturally high in prebiotics, which you can eat raw or lightly cooked, include asparagus, chicory root, leek, oats, rye, soybeans, green peas, apple, and grapefruit.

If you have SIBO, you will want to restrict fiber, especially fermentable fibers, until your gut microbiome improves. Seek a nutritionist or gastroenterologist who can help you figure out the root cause of your SIBO or IBS, and eliminate it. In the meantime, intermittent fasting, as well as antimicrobial herbs, such as oil of oregano, neem, berberine, and allicin, can help with SIBO.

Many studies have found that a diet high in prebiotics can lower the risk of heart disease.

This is because prebiotics reduce inflammation and are fermented into heart-protective, short-chain fatty acids (butyrate) in the colon.

Butyrate gives energy to your gut cells, helping them strengthen the gut lining and prevent leaky gut.

Coming in at Number 3, we have, “Foods that Heal Your Gut Lining.”

To heal your gut barrier, drink one cup of bone broth on an empty stomach every morning. Bone broth is full of collagen, gelatin, glycine, and glutamine—four nutrients that heal your GI tract by reducing inflammation and forming new connective tissue.

This tissue gradually seals the tiny holes in your gut, ensuring that you can properly digest food and get all the necessary nutrients and minerals from it.

You can also repair your mucus barrier using herbs such as marshmallow root, slippery elm, and aloe vera.

Next, at Number 2, we have, “Foods that Increase Bile Flow.”

If your liver does not properly secrete bile, large fat particles that are not broken down can damage the mucosal barrier of your small intestine and cause leaky gut.

Also, when there is decreased bile flow, less cholesterol is excreted. And microbes can build up in the small intestine, leading to SIBO.

Bitter foods are excellent for stimulating bile production. You can choose from dark leafy vegetables, beetroot, artichokes, radishes, and dandelion root.

Other bile-producing foods are lemons, ginger, and turmeric.

And at Number 1, we have, “Vitamin K2 Foods.”

Vitamin K2 helps to prevent calcification of the coronary arteries by activating the protein, MGP. It moves calcium away from the blood vessels and kidneys, to the bones and teeth where it is needed.

Now, you may be wondering, “How is vitamin K2 connected to gut health?”

First, good bacteria in your gut can convert K1 from leafy green vegetables into K2, although this is a small amount.

Next, studies show that vitamin K2 improves your microbiome by increasing the number of beneficial bacteria, such as lactobacilli, and reducing the number of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia coli.

Vitamin K2 may also reduce LPS and inflammation in the gut, thus helping to prevent leaky gut.

So, how can we obtain vitamin K2?

Vitamin K2 is synthesized by bacteria both in animals and through fermentation processes.

So, we need to get Vitamin K2 from two sources: one, fermented plant sources, such as natto, kimchi, and sauerkraut; and two, grass-fed, pastured animal sources, such as kefir, cheese, egg yolks, fatty pork and beef, and organ meats.

If you plan to supplement, go for the MK-7 form of K2, as it stays in your bloodstream longer. The recommended dosage is 100 to 200 mcg per day. MK-7 is often combined with vitamin D3 in one supplement, so this is a good option to choose; vitamin D3 helps your bones absorb calcium.

Next, here are two things you can do to immediately improve your gut microbiome.

Avoid sugar, refined carbs, alcohol, and other high-carb foods and drinks.

And use medications like antibiotics and acid-blocking drugs only when absolutely necessary.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/increase-blood-flow-to-legs-and-feet/,"10 Ways To Increase Blood Flow To Legs And Feet, NO Exercises!","Let’s talk about the best ways to increase blood flow and circulation in your legs and feet without doing cardio exercises or lifting weights.

Plaque buildup, blood clots, or narrowed blood vessels can lead to poor circulation. When obstacles or narrow paths slow down blood flow, it is difficult for your body to send oxygen and nutrients efficiently to the furthest parts of the body.

Slow-moving blood can cause symptoms in your feet and legs, such as:

Cold, aching feet…Swollen ankles and calves…Throbbing or stinging pain…Pale or blue skin color…Tingling and numbness…Muscle cramps…Varicose veins…and Slow-healing wounds…

Most people don’t pay attention to poor circulation, and this is a big mistake because it could be a sign of a more serious issue in the body. We’ll talk about this later in the video.

Now, let’s get into the 10 ways to increase blood flow to your legs, and reduce the symptoms of poor circulation. If you’re ready, let’s go.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice. Talk to your doctor if you notice these symptoms of poor circulation.

Let’s begin, with Number 10. “Wear Shoes That Fit.”

You can do all the exercises in the world, but if your shoes are too tight, they can apply excessive pressure to your feet and legs, reducing blood flow and increasing the risk of blood clots and swelling.

So, the first thing is to wear shoes in which your toes are not squeezed together in a triangle at the front. Look for shoes with a wide toe box so that your feet can spread out and rest in their natural state. These shoes are helpful for those with conditions such as diabetes and varicose veins.

Next up, we have Number 9. “Elevate Your Legs.”

A proven way to improve blood flow in your legs is to elevate your feet above your heart. This counters the force of gravity and opens up the valves in your leg veins, allowing blood to more easily return to the heart, resulting in improved circulation throughout the body.

There are a few ways to elevate your legs; the easiest is to put your legs up against the wall while you rest or meditate. Another way is to use leg elevation wedges to prop up your legs at an angle during the day or while sleeping at night.

Another method is to sit in a zero-gravity chair; this chair is inspired by the liftoff posture of astronauts and positions the body in a reclined position with the legs elevated above the heart.

Elevating your legs can help people with circulatory issues, varicose veins, or those who spend a lot of time on their feet.

Moving along, we have Number 8. “Foot Alignment Socks.”

One in five people live with chronic foot pain. If you are one of them, then you know how seriously it can limit your life.

Foot alignment socks offer natural relief and can help eliminate foot pain. They’re designed to enhance circulation, decrease swelling, and reduce foot pain over time.

The “toe dividers” gently separate your toes, improving foot strength and dexterity. They’re particularly beneficial for conditions like plantar fasciitis, hammertoes, bunions, bursitis, tendinitis, arthritis, and diabetes.

What’s interesting is that the design is inspired by a 5,000-year-old yoga technique of toe stretching. To see our recommended foot alignment socks, click the link below.

Coming up next, is Number 7. “Compression Socks.”

Compression socks can be a real help if you have a job that requires long hours of sitting or standing; they increase blood circulation in your legs, alleviate swelling, and reduce discomfort.

Their secret is “graduated compression,” which means the socks are tightest at the ankle and become looser as they go up your leg. This helps to push stagnant blood out of your feet and legs, similar to squeezing toothpaste from the bottom of the tube.

Doctors often recommend these socks for long flights or post-surgery to prevent deadly blood clots.

Compression socks are also used to alleviate chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), wherein the valves in the leg veins are damaged, causing blood to leak and pool in the legs instead of flowing back to the heart.

Plus, athletes wear them to improve athletic performance and quicken recovery time.

However, traditional compression socks come with a problem. Learn about this problem and see our recommended compression socks that solve it by clicking the link below.

And at Number 6, we have, “Soak Your Feet in Hot Water.”

Soaking your feet in a hot tub of water can help promote sleep, enhance blood circulation, and de-stress your mind. Hot water causes the dilation of blood vessels, helping to move congested blood in your feet and lower legs. This not only reduces swelling but also helps prevent the formation of blood clots. Adding Epsom salt or essential oil to the water further enhances the benefits.

Next up, is Number 5. “Krill Oil”.

One of the main causes of edema, or fluid retention in the feet or ankles is chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Omega-3 supplements, such as fish oil and krill oil, may help alleviate edema.

Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and have been found to combat CVI; they help open your arteries and promote better blood flow, effectively reducing symptoms of edema. They also help lower blood pressure and prevent blood clots.

A deficiency in omega-3s can lead to painful swelling in your legs, ankles, and feet. If you have never enjoyed fish oil or it has never worked for you, click the link below to see our recommended wild-caught krill oil.

And at Number 4, we have, “Manage Blood Pressure.”

If you have high blood pressure, it can damage your arteries, and make them stiff and narrow. This condition is called atherosclerosis. As a result, your legs and feet may not get enough blood flow, which can lead to the symptoms of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD).

Symptoms of PAD include pain and cramps in the legs or buttocks when walking, cold feet, and stinging pain in the feet at night.

To lower blood pressure and prevent PAD, eat high-potassium foods, reduce salt and sugar by avoiding processed foods, get a good night’s sleep, and reduce stress. To reverse PAD, see our video “The Best Way to Clear Your Arteries“.

Coming into the Top 3, Number 3 is, “Stand More”.

Standing up can boost blood flow to your legs, improving circulation. Try to stand more often in your daily routine. If you work at a desk all day, consider getting a standing desk. At home, stand more instead of lounging on the couch. Aim to get up and walk around for five minutes every half-hour that you spend seated.

And at Number 2, we have, “Stay Well Hydrated”.

When you are well-hydrated, your blood has an easier time circulating throughout your body. If you are a coffee drinker, you may want to cut back to one cup per day. Caffeine is a diuretic, which means it dehydrates your body.

Drinking herbal teas is a delicious way to stay hydrated. Studies show that the antioxidants in tea may improve circulation, among other benefits. This is true for both black and green tea.

Additionally, certain teas contain nutrients that make them natural vasodilators, meaning they widen blood vessels and enhance blood flow. These include ginger, hibiscus, Ginkgo Biloba, and White Peony Root teas.

And at Number 1, we have, “Eat Red Foods.”

Many of nature’s top fruits and vegetables, which are excellent for your heart, circulation, and energy levels, are some shade of red. They get their vibrant colors from nutrients called polyphenols.

These nutrients are powerful antioxidants that help protect your body from harmful damage caused by excessive free radicals. Plus, polyphenols can enhance the production of nitric oxide, which improves blood flow and boosts your energy.

The “reds” you’ll want to eat regularly include beets, apples, pomegranates, grapes, cranberries, strawberries, raspberries, (blueberries, blackberries, and bilberries), tomatoes, watermelon, and cayenne pepper.

For more foods that boost blood flow, see our video, “Top 10 Foods that Improve Blood Circulation in Legs“

Now that we’ve looked at the ways to increase blood flow, let’s look at the causes of poor circulation in your legs.

First, these common lifestyle factors can drain your energy and productivity and pave the way to circulatory problems.

–Consuming too many omega-6 fatty acids or processed foods with refined grains and sugars can cause your blood to become thick and sluggish.

–Inadequate exercise, including both cardio and weight lifting, and lack of regular stretching can contribute to poor blood flow.

–Not getting 7-9 hours of deep, restful sleep or experiencing excess stress can also negatively impact your circulation.

–And smoking and overindulgence in alcohol are both recipes for poor circulation.

Other major causes of poor circulation in the legs are:

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) – PAD is most common in adults over 50, as well as in smokers.

Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) – A condition in which a blood clot forms in the deep veins of your leg. This is the most common cause of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).

Varicose Veins – These are enlarged veins, usually found in the legs, that are caused by damaged blood vessels.

Diabetic neuropathy – This is nerve damage that can occur in the arms, legs, hands, and feet when you have persistently high blood glucose levels, causing damage to nerves and blood vessels.

Obesity – If you are obese, you are more likely to have circulatory problems.

To enjoy good blood circulation, eat an anti-inflammatory diet. Get your FREE anti-inflammatory diet plan by clicking the link below.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-your-kidneys-are-failing/,11 Signs Your Kidneys Are Failing,"Let’s talk about the 11 warning signs your kidneys are failing. While it might not help with early detection, being aware of the symptoms of late-stage CKD is still important, because you can then take immediate action. It is possible to reverse your kidney function naturally, despite what you may have heard.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a catch-all term used to describe any dysfunction involving the kidneys. Detecting CKD in its early stages can be challenging because the signs and symptoms usually appear late; after kidney damage has occurred. As a result, most people with early-stage CKD don’t know they have it.

Without further delay, let’s get into the signs of kidney damage. Watch until the end, to learn about the best diet for kidney disease, and the best and worst foods for your kidneys.

Talk to your doctor immediately if you notice any of these potential signs and symptoms of CKD.

Now, what is the purpose of your kidneys? Their job is to balance fluids and electrolytes as well as purify the blood from waste products by filtering them into the urine. The kidneys also produce hormones, such as erythropoietin (EPO) for red blood cell production, and calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, for calcium absorption.

When your kidneys’ filtering system fails, instead of retaining nutrients, you start to lose them, and waste products build up in your body. This occurs because the filtering units of the kidneys, known as nephrons, are damaged.

All 11 symptoms of CKD are directly related to damaged nephrons. Even though they can occur at any of the 5 stages of CKD, most people begin to experience them at Stage 3 or 4.

The first warning sign of kidneys that have diminished in function is:

Number 11. “Changes in Urination.”

Changes in urine are common since the kidneys’ main function is to regulate the body’s chemistry through urine. These changes include:

– increased nighttime urination

– foamy or bubbly urination (caused by protein leaking into the urine)

– increased or decreased urine output

– dark yellow or brown urine

– blood in the urine

– increased urge, or a feeling of pressure on the bladder

Next, we have Number 10. “Fluid Retention in the Legs & Eyes.”

Swelling and puffiness because of retaining fluids, can occur at any part of the body, especially in the ankles, feet, arms, legs, and also in the eyes and face. Fluid retention can also happen around the lungs and heart. This is because your kidneys have difficulty getting rid of excess water and salt in the body.

Coming up is Number 9. “Severe Itching & Greyish Skin.”

Itching is a common symptom of kidney disease; it can occur over the entire body, is usually worse at night, and can be relentless. This is not a normal skin itch; rather, it seems to go down to the bone. Furthermore, the skin may change to an unhealthy grey color. This happens because toxic waste accumulates in the blood, eventually reaching the skin. Specifically, this is due to elevated levels of phosphates in the blood.

Moving on, Number 8 is, “Feeling Tired All the Time.”

The buildup of toxins in the blood causes you to feel constant fatigue, tiredness, drowsiness, and lethargy. Also, as kidneys fail, they produce less of the hormone EPO, which means your body makes fewer red blood cells to carry oxygen to your muscles and brain, and they tire quickly. This condition is called anemia.

Next, we have Number 7. “Shortness of Breath.”

Being short of breath can be related to the kidneys in two ways. First, extra fluid in the body can build up in the lungs, causing breathing difficulty. And second, CKD-induced anemia may also cause breathlessness. This makes it difficult to sleep at night and keeps your body in a constant state of stress.

Coming up next is Number 6. “Dizziness & Brain Fog.”

Anemia related to kidney failure means that your brain is not receiving enough oxygen. This can lead to faintness, dizziness, or weakness, and can also cause memory lapses or difficulty concentrating.

And at Number 5, we have, “Metallic Taste & Ammonia Breath.”

A buildup of waste in the blood (called uremia) can alter food tastes and cause bad breath that smells like ammonia or urine. You may find that you no longer enjoy eating meat or are losing weight due to a lack of appetite. And the foul taste in your mouth almost feels like drinking iron.

Moving on, Number 4 is, “Back Pain Or Kidney Pain.”

Your kidneys are located above your waist in the back of your body, and kidney pain can resemble back pain. This is because when the kidneys are damaged, the body produces pain signals to alert the person that something is wrong in that area.

Coming into the Top 3, Number 3 is, “Nausea & Loss of Appetite.”

Nausea and vomiting are horrible kidney disease symptoms that are usually coupled with low appetite and anorexia. This is mainly caused by a buildup of the blood chemical urea.

Number 2 is, “Abnormal Levels of Potassium, Phosphorus, Calcium & Vitamin D.”

When you have reduced kidney function, this causes electrolyte imbalances, such as low levels of calcium and high levels of potassium and phosphorus. Huge spikes in blood potassium, or hyperkalemia, can be dangerous because they interfere with the way the heart and muscles work, increasing the risk of heart attacks.

When your kidneys are not functioning properly, they do not produce enough vitamin D, and your body is unable to absorb and transport calcium as effectively. This can cause calcium to begin accumulating in your arteries, joints, and kidneys as kidney stones.

And at Number 1, we have “High Blood Pressure.”

Even if high blood pressure was not initially the cause of kidney failure, it can develop as kidney disease progresses. This is because failing kidneys are unable to effectively remove excess fluid, which leads to fluid buildup and increased blood pressure. This further damages the kidneys over time and increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.

To learn about a proven natural program for reversing kidney disease and living a normal healthy life, even if you have advanced CKD, click the link below.

Next, let’s look at what causes kidney damage.

The three most common causes of CKD are diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation in the kidneys.

Diabetes is the #1 cause, present in over 40% of CKD cases. High blood sugar levels in diabetics damage the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, causing them to harden and become less elastic; this is similar to what happens to heart arteries in atherosclerosis.

Also, diabetes contributes to high blood pressure, the #2 cause of CKD, accounting for more than 25% of cases.

Other causes of kidney damage are glomerulonephritis, which is inflammation of the kidney filters, low vitamin D, low potassium, and polycystic kidney disease (where the kidneys develop cyst-like growths).

Now, here is one important thing to remember. The tricky thing about CKD is that all of these conditions are often interrelated, as the core underlying factor is chronic low-grade inflammation. This type of inflammation is common among diabetics, people who are obese, those with heart disease, and those with specific inflammation in their kidneys.

Next, let’s talk about the best and worst foods for your kidneys when you have already developed kidney disease, whether at the early or end stage.

If you have been diagnosed with CKD, your doctor will have told you what to eat and what not to eat.

Avoid refined foods, junk foods, high-sugar foods, and high-carb foods as these are all damaging to the kidneys.

If you are in Stages 4-5 of CKD, you must limit your consumption of foods high in potassium, such as fruits and vegetables, as well as phosphorus, sodium, and protein, since you already have elevated levels of these.

The foods to limit for Stages 4-5 of CKD include dried beans and peas, dairy products, nuts, bran products, bananas, red meat, processed meat, sweet potatoes and white potatoes, tomatoes, and avocado.

However, it is important to eat fruits and vegetables in moderation to reduce inflammation and treat the underlying cause of CKD.

If you are living with CKD, you already have an excess of acid in your tissues and blood – this is a condition known as metabolic acidosis. Acidosis happens because your kidneys, which are supposed to remove acid from the blood, are unable to perform this function.

This causes an acid-alkaline imbalance which can lead to serious problems such as bone loss and muscle wasting, and worsen your CKD.

So, to remove acidosis and reduce inflammation, the best solution is to eat an alkaline diet, made up of fruits and vegetables.

Fruits and vegetables alkalize the body because they naturally contain citrates.

If you have Stage 4-5 CKD, one thing you can do is choose low-potassium fruits and vegetables. Another trick is to leach high-potassium vegetables to reduce potassium. I have included a link below about potassium foods in a CKD diet.

To restore health, eat 75% alkaline-forming foods and 25% acid-forming foods within each meal. Use pH strips to test your urine each morning. It may take up to 8 weeks, but when your pH test strips show that you are in the 6.25 to 7.25 zone, you can downgrade your diet to 60% alkaline-forming foods and 40% acid-forming foods for maintenance.

I have included a link to a complete list of alkaline-forming and acid-forming foods below.

Lastly, some of the best foods that help reduce inflammation in your kidneys and relieve symptoms of CKD are celery, leafy greens like asparagus and kale, blueberries, apple, watermelon, cranberries, lemon, grapes, garlic, onions, and extra virgin olive oil.

And while essential oils are best known for their role in aromatherapy, it’s important to note that their benefits go way beyond their pleasant smell. In fact, reflexologists even recommend using certain oils under your feet to help you get a good night’s sleep. Here’s how it works. (Updated June 30, 2023)

How Your Feet Absorb Oils

The soles of your feet have five layers of skin and no hair follicles. The pores found in this area are particularly absorbent and can quickly pull the essential oil into the bloodstream. When applied to the entire foot, traces of essential oil can be found throughout the body in less than 20 minutes (1).

This is because your soles and palms are the only sites on your body without sebaceous glands (2). Sebum, which is produced by sebaceous glands all over the skin, is an oily substance that functions as a protective shield and weakens the skin’s ability to absorb foreign materials. Because the palms of your hands and soles of your feet do not have sebaceous glands, these areas have no barrier between the essential oils and your pores.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 30, 2023"

Eat This Japanese “Memory Bean” To Erase Senior Moments & Regain A Sharp Mind In 7 Seconds A Day

As we get older, it seems like many of us face more and more of these annoying “senior moments.” But have you ever noticed how some people just don’t seem to have these issues even in their 80s and beyond?

These people are called SuperAgers, and they have younger brains and stronger memories compared to those who are at least 30 years younger. You probably have a SuperAger friend or family member.

Would you like to join the ranks of the SuperAgers?

Today, we look at three foods you need to eat after age 50 to improve your short and long-term memory, thinking speed, and focus well into your golden years.

Watch until the end to learn the #1 thing you must do to grow new brain cells and supercharge your brainpower. Without further delay, let’s get into it.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Your brain is the mastermind behind almost everything—your thoughts, memory, focus, movements, breathing, and heartbeat—and the first food that can help make it stronger, sharper, and smarter is:

Number 3. “Luteolin-Rich Foods”.

Luteolin is a powerful plant antioxidant that can protect your mind and body from the damaging effects of inflammation caused by stress, pollution, inadequate sleep, smoking, sugar consumption, food additives, and other factors.

It is found in many fruits, vegetables, and herbs; here are some of the best luteolin-rich foods:

Radicchio or red endive

Celery

Parsley, peppermint, oregano, sage, rosemary

Green bell peppers

Chicory greens

Pumpkin, carrots

Kohlrabi, broccoli, cabbage

Extra virgin olive oil

Let’s take a closer look at how luteolin can help boost your brain power.

Studies show that luteolin can restore microglia in the brain that have deteriorated due to inflammation and make them function as efficiently as they did decades ago.

So, what are microglia? These are tiny cells in your brain that develop from the same group of stem cells as those that eventually become white blood cells.

Healthy microglia are the secret to having a brain that defies aging.

That’s because they help create new synapses, which means you can think faster on your feet.

They also assist in growing new cells in the hippocampus – the “memory center” of your brain.

Plus, microglia release protective chemicals to sick neurons, which helps you stay sharp and alert as you get older.

And on top of that, they play a role in growing myelin, a fatty tissue that protects your nerve cells.

MRI scans show that SuperAgers and younger adults have almost identical microglia.

If your microglia are damaged due to inflammation, you will experience symptoms of brain aging, ranging from minor “senior moments” to full-blown cognitive decline.

So, it’s important to eat luteolin foods if you want to keep your microglia healthy.

Moving on, we have Number 2. “Foods that increase BDNF”.

Previously, it was thought that you were born with a limited number of brain cells and could never grow any new ones.

But then in the early ’80s, scientists found a protein that encouraged the growth of new brain cells! When scientists added this protein to neurons in the lab, they were stunned when the neurons started sprouting new branches out of nowhere.

They named it brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or simply BDNF. Think of BDNF as a “fertilizer” that grows new brain cells, enhancing your memory, learning, thinking, and more. Not only does BDNF grow new brain cells, but it also keeps the existing ones healthy in various ways.

It boosts brain plasticity, fights inflammation, works as a natural antidepressant, and counteracts the harmful effects of stress on our brains.

Furthermore, it helps protect our brains from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. There is even evidence suggesting it may play a part in controlling how long we live!

Now, the #1 most important way to encourage BDNF production is physical exercise. So, if you only do one thing to increase BDNF, it would be to engage in regular physical exercise.

Even Chess Grandmasters like Gary Kasparov credit much of their exceptional brain power to physical exercise.

As little as 10 minutes of exercise has positive effects on your brain. Some workouts are especially good at increasing BDNF levels, like sprinting in short bursts, practicing yoga, dancing, doing resistance training, and going for high-impact runs. Even just walking more increases BDNF, and makes you happier and healthier.

Other ways to increase BDNF are deep sleep, meditation, listening to music, getting sunlight, spending time with friends and family, and intermittent fasting.

At the same time, avoid or reduce these things that decrease BDNF: stress, eating sugar, and social isolation.

Now, let us look at specific foods that are known to increase BDNF levels. They are all high in plant antioxidants, called flavonoids.

Not only are these powerful anti-inflammatory agents, but they also help to boost BDNF production.

Turmeric. Adding turmeric to your meals over the long run can help improve BDNF levels. Taking turmeric with black pepper and a healthy fat, such as coconut oil, increases curcumin absorption.

Berries. Wild blueberries, and other berries such as strawberries, blackberries, chokeberries, cranberries, and pomegranates are rich in BDNF-boosting antioxidant content.

Leafy green vegetables. These include spinach, kale, and broccoli, which are rich in the macular carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin and have been shown to increase BDNF levels.

Prebiotics. There is a direct connection between the gut and the brain. Prebiotic foods contain insoluble fibers that our probiotic (good) bacteria love to feed on. They have been shown to increase BDNF more than just probiotics alone. Some of the top prebiotic foods include asparagus, bamboo shoots, bananas, barley, cocoa, leeks, garlic, lentils, mustard greens, onions, and tomatoes.

Fermented foods. Eating fermented probiotic foods, such as yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, tempeh, and kimchi helps to promote gut-friendly bacteria and increase BDNF.

Dark Chocolate with at least 70% cocoa. Dark chocolate contains a chemical called theobromine which increases BDNF. Plus, it has other brain-boosting benefits; it improves blood flow to the brain, which enhances memory and cognitive function. It contains magnesium, which helps reduce stress by suppressing the release of the stress hormone cortisol, and it increases beneficial bacteria in the intestines, which helps prevent dementia.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Omega-3 fatty acids that are abundantly present in seafood and fatty fish are anti-inflammatory and help protect your brain. This is specifically true for DHA, which makes up a significant portion of your brain’s gray matter.

Having enough DHA in your diet can protect against age-related mental decline, dementia, and even Alzheimer’s disease. Also, human research studies show an increase in BDNF levels after regularly consuming omega-3s.

Other brain-protective foods that boost BDNF are red grapes, coffee, green tea, and extra virgin olive oil.

And at Number 1, we have “Eggs & Choline”

Eggs offer a wealth of benefits for your brain. They have several components that can enhance cognitive function, uplift mood, and boost overall brain energy.

The first key component is choline, which is mainly found in egg yolks. Choline is a precursor for acetylcholine, an essential compound for cognitive functions such as memory, focus, and concentration, as well as maintaining a positive mood.

In addition, choline helps improve the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients the brain needs, such as vitamins A, D, E, K1, and K2.

Eggs are an abundant source of choline – just eating two a day can provide more than half of your recommended daily intake.

Another key nutrient found in eggs is omega-3 fatty acids. Pasture-raised, organic eggs are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA. These can reduce the risk of clots, thus helping to prevent strokes.

In addition to being high in healthy fats, eggs are low in carbohydrates and high in protein, which helps encourage ketone production to fuel the brain. They are also an excellent source of B12, B6, and folate, which the brain needs.

Egg yolks are high in cholesterol, which is needed for making vitamin D and various hormones, as well as providing the raw material for all cellular membranes in the brain.

Don’t worry about eggs adversely affecting your health; studies have long shown there is no association between eating eggs and either heart disease or stroke in healthy people.

If you prefer taking a supplement to boost luteolin, BDNF, and choline levels, check out our advanced memory formula below.

One important strategy for fighting brain inflammation is to eat an anti-inflammatory diet. Click the link below to get your FREE anti-inflammatory diet plan.

To enjoy better brain function, avoid toxins in your food, water, soil, and environment, as well as unnecessary stress, excessive caffeine, drugs, alcohol, and sugar.

Focus on exercising, maintaining a clean environment, keeping a healthy weight, getting eight hours of sleep, managing stress, practicing gratitude, and surrounding yourself with positive people.

And now over to you: Do you know a SuperAger? What are they doing to stay mentally young in their 80s and beyond?

Comment below, we’d love to hear from you!",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 28, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/truth-about-clogged-arteries/,The Truth About Clogged Arteries and Heart Disease,"Discover the truth about clogged arteries and heart disease. When we look at the root cause of cardiovascular disease, in virtually all cases, the core issue is inflammation.

(scroll down to see blood tests and studies) Specifically, it is inflammation in the arteries that damages the arterial walls and attracts plaque deposits.

When plaque builds up and narrows and stiffens the arteries, this condition is called atherosclerosis; it is the primary cause of heart attacks and strokes.

So, what causes inflammation in the arteries, that leads to atherosclerosis? The answer goes far beyond the conventional idea of “too much cholesterol.”

Today, we look at 8 major risk factors that cause artery-damaging inflammation and increase your risk of heart disease.

Thankfully, heart disease is 100% preventable. Watch till the end to learn how you can detect these risk factors, and take steps to protect your heart. Without further delay, let’s get into it.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors. You can find a link to the studies below.

At the top of our list is Number 8. “Leaky Gut”

Most people don’t know this, but “Leaky Gut” is closely linked to cardiovascular disease.

The cells in your intestinal lining are supposed to prevent bacteria and toxins from entering your bloodstream. However, sometimes this barrier develops “holes” and “leaks,” allowing unwanted substances, such as LPS (bacterial toxins), to contaminate your blood and trigger systemic inflammation.

Inflammation in your arteries can lead to endothelial dysfunction, which means the cells lining the inside of your blood vessels (endothelium) are damaged, causing the heart arteries to narrow instead of opening wide.

This can cause chest pain and shortness of breath and can contribute to artery blockage and high blood pressure.

Additionally, leaky gut can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis, which can increase the risk of hardening arteries.

Symptoms of leaky gut range from bloating, gas, and cramps to food sensitivities, fatigue, headaches, and joint pain.

A major driver of leaky gut is an unhealthy diet that is low in fiber, high in sugar, and high in bad fats, leading to an imbalance of gut bacteria.

One blood test to detect inflammation is called the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) test. This protein indicates overall inflammation in the body. A good level is below 1.0 mg/dL, and high levels indicate arterial inflammation that is seen with infections and gum disease.

For more information about leaky gut, see our video “Top 5 Foods that Cause Gut Inflammation“.

This brings us to the next risk factor, Number 7, “Bacteria in the Mouth”.

Every cardiologist will agree there is an association between gum disease, gingivitis, and cardiovascular disease.

Bacteria from the deep pockets of the gums can enter the bloodstream and cause injury, inflammation, plaque buildup, and blockages in the coronary arteries.

Many people notice blood while brushing or flossing, but they are not aware that this could signal a problem.

What’s alarming is that scientists have found oral bacteria in blood clots that cause strokes, brain aneurysms, and heart attacks.

Root canal teeth are especially concerning because they are dead teeth. These dead teeth are infected deep within the jawbone and can release inflammatory particles into the arteries.

In a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, DNA analysis revealed that the same bacteria from root canal teeth were found in the plaque of coronary arteries.

In another study published in the Journal of the American Dental Association, researchers found that people with root canal teeth had more than twice the risk of cardiovascular disease than those with no history of having root canals.

Yet, millions of root canals are performed every year without considering this correlation.

So, it’s important to be aware of the risks associated with root canals and do your own research. I have included links below.

Next on our list is Number 6, “Refined Sugar & Bad Fats”.

Everyone thinks that LDL cholesterol is bad, but the evidence linking it to heart disease is weak. Half of the people who have heart attacks have normal LDL levels, so there is not a strong correlation.

Having said that, the type of LDL cholesterol that is harmful is oxidized LDL. These are the small, dense LDL particles that are easily oxidized and quickly enter your arterial walls. When this happens, the oxidized LDL particles trigger an inflammatory response, which causes plaque to build up.

And guess what causes oxidized LDL to increase in your body? A diet high in refined sugars, refined carbs, and vegetable seed oils, such as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), white flour, and “unhealthy fats” like chemically-processed corn oil, safflower oil, and trans fats found in deep-fried foods and packaged foods; these are the heart-damaging foods you’ll want to avoid.

Also, a diet high in saturated fats (like coconut oil), does not correlate with heart disease; it is more about the quality of fats that we consume. Fatty fish, nuts, seeds, and olive oil are examples of healthy fats rich in anti-inflammatory Omega-3s and monounsaturated fats.

See the link below, to learn what are healthy HDL and LDL test values and ratios.

This brings us to Number 5. “High Insulin Levels”.

Millions of people are dealing with blood sugar issues; if you are pre-diabetic or diabetic, you may wonder what this has to do with heart disease. The answer lies in insulin resistance; that is, your body cannot use insulin at the rate at which it is being produced. As a result, you end up with high insulin levels.

So, what is a normal fasting insulin level? Many metabolic health experts suggest that fasting insulin should stay below 10 μU/mL, and preferably below 5. Many diabetics have fasting insulin levels that can go up to 100.

Insulin is an inflammatory particle that causes inflammation when present in high levels in the bloodstream. It is a hormone released by the pancreas. When your insulin levels are too high, they can inflame and damage cells, just like high sugar levels.

If you were to remove all the blood from your body and measure the amount of sugar in it, there would only be about a teaspoon or five grams of sugar. Now, that can of soda you drink contains 18 to 20 grams of sugar.

So, when your body senses high sugar levels, it tries to compensate by increasing insulin production. Unfortunately, this leads to fat buildup, especially visceral fat, high blood pressure, and metabolic syndrome.

All of this is closely related. If you are diabetic and start taking insulin because your condition has worsened, you could be taking insulin for years; this can lead to increased weight gain.

People say that visceral fat and obesity are directly linked to heart disease; however, what they do not mention is that administering insulin to so many people makes it difficult for them to remain lean.

That’s because insulin is a fat-storage hormone. When your insulin levels are high, your body won’t burn fat. The enzyme that burns fat is called lipase, and it is deactivated by insulin. Therefore, if you want to lose weight, you need to lower your insulin levels instead of increasing them.

Coming up Next is Number 4, “Sleep Disorders & Stress”.

Millions suffer from sleep problems, such as insomnia and sleep apnea.

People with sleep apnea are constantly suffocating and starving for oxygen every night, which is incredibly stressful and puts immense strain on their cardiovascular system.

At night, your fight-or-flight hormones should be low because you’re resting. 

However, if a person stops breathing multiple times per minute due to sleep apnea, their stress hormones will surge all night long, and damage the heart and blood vessels.

Sleep apnea cases have been increasing due to factors such as smoking, drinking alcohol, being overweight, and airways narrowing.

This is a serious issue and should be treated. Solutions like CPAP machines and other mouth devices can help.

If you are sleeping poorly because of a respiratory condition and your airways are blocked, you can use an OPEP device to open up your airways and clear excess mucus from your lungs. Click the link below to see our recommended solution.

Lastly, stress is closely linked to high blood pressure and heart disease, and poor sleep can make stress worse.

To relieve stress and improve your ability to fall asleep faster, you can use this special hand-held device. It sends gentle signals from your hand to your brain that tell your nervous system to relax. Check it out at the link below.

Coming into our Top 3, at Number 3 we have “Heavy Metals & Toxins”.

We face an onslaught of toxins in our food, water, air, homes, and workplaces every single day.

Numerous studies have revealed that heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium can harm our health by disrupting normal cell function. They accumulate from sources including dental fillings, water supplies, smoking, and beauty and hygiene products.

Researchers have linked the buildup of toxins to high blood pressure, heart artery damage, heart muscle damage, and peripheral artery damage in the legs.

Also, air quality has emerged as a major cause of heart disease. While we have long known the dangers of smoking and second-hand smoke, new data show that non-smoking-related air pollution can also damage arteries and cause inflammation.

To completely flush heavy metals and toxins from your body, and detoxify at the cellular level, check out our recommended solution below.

Moving on next, we have Number 2. “Nutrient Deficiencies”.

A deficiency of certain vitamins, such as Vitamin D, CoQ10, and folate can affect your cardiovascular health. In particular, a deficiency in B12 or folate can lead to high homocysteine levels, which greatly increase the risk of clogged arteries.

Homocysteine, an amino acid, can cause inflammation in the arteries when levels are too high. A healthy homocysteine level is under 9 mcmol/L.

For a list of vitamins that can help to prevent artery damage and dissolve plaque deposits, see our video, “The Best Way to Clear Your Arteries.”

And at Number 1, we have, “Sedentary Lifestyle”.

A lack of physical activity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Spending too much time sitting increases inflammation due to the loss of muscle tissue and increased body fat. Moving regularly is crucial for clear arteries and strong heart muscles.

Do anything you enjoy: tennis, walking, using a standing desk, taking the stairs, or parking further away from stores so you walk a bit more each day.

There you have it! The 8 major factors that increase your risk of clogged arteries and heart disease.

You can test for blood sugar, inflammatory markers, cholesterol, and lipids during your routine checkup. To see the recommended lab tests, and learn what levels are good, click the link below.

One important strategy for clogged arteries is to eat an anti-inflammatory diet. Click the link below to get your free anti-inflammatory diet plan.

Essential Lab Tests for Assessing Your Risk Factors for Clogged Arteries

Understanding your risk factors for clogged arteries is crucial for maintaining heart health. Several lab tests can provide insight into these factors. A Comprehensive Blood Analysis is an excellent place to start, as it examines various aspects of your health.

Blood Sugar Levels

It’s important to monitor your blood sugar levels:

HbA1C: This measures glycated hemoglobin and red blood cells. Ideally, it should be between 4 and 5.2%. The optimal range is 5% or lower. A moderately high range is 5.3-5.6%, while 5.7-6.4% indicates prediabetes and a high risk of developing diabetes. Over 6.4% means you have diabetes.

Fasting Glucose: Optimal levels are under 90 mg/dL. Normal levels are less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), while 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) indicates prediabetes. Two separate tests with results of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher confirm diabetes.

Fasting Insulin: Optimal fasting insulin levels are between 2-5 uIu/mL. Early insulin resistance ranges from 6-9 uIu/mL, while anything over 10uIu/mL indicates insulin resistance. Severe insulin resistance isn’t flagged on the lab until it reaches over 24.9 uIu/mL.

Inflammatory Markers

Monitoring inflammatory markers is essential:

HsCRP: Ideal levels are under 1, with the optimal being below 0.8. High levels indicate arterial inflammation, often seen with infections and periodontal disease.

LDH (lactate dehydrogenase): The optimal range is 140 to 180. High levels suggest chronic inflammation, while levels below 140 indicate hypoglycemia.

Serum ferritin: The ideal range is under 150. High levels signify inflammation.

Homocysteine: This inflammatory protein is a byproduct of methionine metabolism. Healthy levels are under 9, with optimal levels being under 7.

Lipid Panel

A lipid panel test examines the following:

VLDL cholesterol: The ideal range is 5 to 30 mg/dl.

HDL cholesterol: The ideal range is 55 to 80. Levels above 100 can indicate chronic inflammation or active infection.

Triglycerides: The ideal range is 40 to 80.

Maintaining a balanced ratio of LDL to HDL and triglycerides to HDL is crucial for your health. Aim for an LDL: HDL ratio of 3:1 or less, and a triglyceride: HDL ratio of 2:1 or less, with 1:1 being optimal.

Higher triglyceride and lower HDL levels typically indicate insulin resistance and high fasting insulin levels.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/2-handfuls-of-cashews-is-the-therapeutic-equivalent-of-a-prescription-dose-of-prozac/,2 Handfuls of Cashews is The Therapeutic Equivalent of a Prescription Dose of Prozac,"You probably already know this by now but nuts in general are tremendously healthy for us. Some like walnuts and brazil nuts offer more specific benefits. (Updated June 15, 2023)

All nuts and seeds contain beneficial fats, B vitamins and magnesium for a healthy mood, but cashews are one of the few actually linked to reducing not just anxiety, but also warding off general stress and even mild depression. via OneGreenPlanet

That being said, did you know? 6.7% of Americans over the age of 18 will be affected by a major depressive disorder this year. This is equivalent to 14.8 million people and majority of them will resort to prescription medication like Prozac (1).

According to RXList, minor side effects to Prozac include:

cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat;
drowsiness, dizziness, feeling nervous;
mild nausea, upset stomach, constipation;
increased appetite, weight changes;
sleep problems (insomnia);
decreased sex drive, impotence, or difficulty having an
orgasm; or
dry mouth.

More serious side effects include:

very stiff (rigid) muscles, high fever, sweating, fast or uneven heartbeats, tremors, overactive reflexes;
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, feeling unsteady, loss of coordination;
headache, trouble concentrating, memory problems, weakness, confusion, hallucinations, fainting, seizure, shallow breathing or breathing that stops; or
severe skin reaction — fever, sore throat, swelling in your face or tongue, burning in your eyes, skin pain, followed by a red or purple skin rash that spreads (especially in the face or upper body) and causes blistering and peeling.
All The Right Nutrients

Fortunately, nature has you covered. Cashews contains iron, magnesium, Vitamin B6, protein and even omega-3 fats, which are all nutrients that help fight off depression and anxiety naturally.

Dr. Andrew Saul, featured in the popular film Food Matters, even says that cashews are such a win for depression and stress that they provide the same mood-boosting effects equivalent to Prozac! Though we can’t make any promises, consuming 1/4 cup per day is a great way to try it out for yourself due to the nutrition powers this humble nut holds.

Why Cashews Work

Trytophan (amino acid): Cashews rank among the best plant-based sources of this amino acid (trytophan). This amino acid plays an important part in the absorption and production of serotonin. A depletion of serotonin can make us feel anxious, stressed, and just downright sad. Trytophan is found in many plant-based foods, but is incredibly dense in cashews with 1000-2000 milligrams per 1/4 cup serving. via MensJournal

Magnesium (mineral): Magnesium is critical to a healthy mood and nervous system, helping treat anxiety and depression as a result. Cashews contain roughly 83 miligrams per serving.

Niacin: One of niacin’s unique properties is its ability to help you naturally relax and get to sleep more rapidly at night. Listen to this story about a woman who was dosed with niacin to fight her depression. Niacin is found in cashews.

Vitamin B6: This vitamin helps reduce depression and improve overall brain health by helping magnesium reach cells more effectively.

Bottom Line

This is wonderful news for those of us who wish for a more natural way to treat their depression or for those who react terribly to Prozac. Also, cashews are delicious and can be used to make recipes like this one.

Other health benefits of cashews include improved heart, bone, and oral health, improved nerve and muscle function.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-to-clean-out-your-liver/,8 Amazing Foods To Clean Out Your Toxic Liver,"Today, we are going to explore the best foods to clean out your liver. It is important to understand that your liver does not naturally have toxins. Its primary function is to detoxify harmful substances such as toxins, poisons, and chemicals.

Many people think the liver stores harmful substances; however, this is only true if you have a fatty liver. In such cases, the toxins get stored in fat cells and make the liver toxic.

When your liver gets inflamed, it heals by forming scar tissue. Too much scar tissue can cause cirrhosis and loss of liver function, resulting in serious health issues.

However, it is possible to regenerate your liver through food alone, and help it to detoxify at maximum capacity; this is what we will cover in this video.

First, let’s talk about the different functions of the liver.

So, the liver plays a vital role in detoxification, bile production, and hormone synthesis.

Bile is a fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder that aids in breaking down fats and absorbing nutrients from them.

Your liver is a primary producer of hormones, including IGF-1, or insulin-like growth factor 1. Growth hormone, produced by the pituitary gland, tells the liver to make IGF-1. Then, IGF-1 carries out growth-promoting actions as an extension of growth hormone, such as fat burning, muscle building, and protein synthesis. It also helps you use stored sugar and fat as energy for your body.

Plus, your liver processes steroid hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and vitamin D3 (which acts like a hormone in the body).

Another important hormone produced by your liver is cortisol, the primary anti-inflammatory hormone that helps your body deal with stress. Without enough cortisol, you will feel more stressed. Eighty percent of the cortisol circulating in your bloodstream is made from HDL cholesterol secreted by your liver.

Your liver needs to produce the correct amounts of HDL and LDL so that enough cholesterol can be delivered to the locations where it is needed to make steroid hormones and cell membranes. Every single cell in your body—and there are trillions of them—is lined on the outside with cholesterol.

If your diet is high in sugar, it will cause your liver to produce more LDL, which when oxidized, can lead to cholesterol buildup in your arteries. Research has shown that NAFLD is strongly associated with clogged arteries.

What is interesting is that people who take statins to lower cholesterol may end up not making hormones efficiently, and they may have all sorts of issues.

So these are just some of the 500 functions of your liver.

Now, before we get to the food, let’s go through the different symptoms that occur when you have damage to the liver.

Skin itchiness, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes), lethargy, swollen legs and abdomen, and achy joints are some common symptoms that may indicate liver issues.

Many people who experience stiffness and joint inflammation might be dealing with an underlying liver problem.

Nausea is another major symptom associated with liver dysfunction. And, a decline in cognitive function could also be linked to liver damage.

Gallstones are a likely indicator of liver problems because a deficiency of bile and an excess of cholesterol can cause them to form.

So, now let’s get into the best foods to cleanse and detox your liver.
At the top of the list is Number 8. “Cruciferous Vegetables”.

Cruciferous vegetables, such as kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, radish, arugula, and mustard greens, are incredibly beneficial for liver health.

These vegetables are rich in a natural phytonutrient called sulforaphane, which plays a vital role in boosting your liver’s detoxification enzymes and reducing inflammation.

Inflammation, can lead to insulin resistance, high insulin levels, diabetes, and even cancer. So, incorporating sulforaphane into your diet is essential for liver protection

Sulforaphane can quickly detoxify substances like caffeine, drugs, chemicals, and even poisons. It can also help if there’s fat accumulation in the liver.

Cruciferous sprouts, such as broccoli, radish, and mustard seed sprouts, contain up to ten times more sulforaphane. Adding just a small amount of these sprouts to your salad can yield significant health benefits.

Cruciferous vegetables also contain cysteine, a primary building block of glutathione – a disease-fighting natural molecule found in every cell, often described as the body’s “master antioxidant.” It helps reduce liver damage and inflammation and contains sulfur which binds to toxins and free radicals, allowing them to be harmlessly flushed from the body.

To get up to 4 times more sulforaphane from these sprouts, heat them for ten minutes at no higher than 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit).  For mature broccoli, heat no more than 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit).

Coming up we have Number 7. “Garlic”.

Garlic is packed with sulfur, a powerful compound that aids in detoxifying the liver and acts as a natural antibiotic. It is very anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral.

Sulfur is an essential component of glutathione, and your liver would not be able to make glutathione without it.

Garlic is particularly effective in removing excess fat from the liver, thus promoting optimal liver function.

Additionally, garlic boasts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that protect the body against cellular damage; furthermore, it has been widely recognized for its anti-cancer properties.

Moving on we have Number 6. “Beets”.

Beets have long been recognized for their liver detoxifying properties, offering numerous benefits for liver health.

They can help lower elevated liver enzymes. And their phytonutrients, particularly the pigments, aid in activating the release of bile salts (the primary component of bile). This helps remove fat from the liver.

Moreover, beets are hepatoprotective, which means they safeguard liver cells and significantly reduce inflammation in the liver. In this way, beets help slow down the progression of fibrosis (scar tissue formation), and cirrhosis.

And at Number 5, we have “Turmeric”.

Turmeric is an essential ingredient for liver health, primarily due to its active phytonutrient, curcumin.

Curcumin is a powerful agent with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and detoxifying effects. It protects the liver from the damaging effects of pollutants, particularly heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic.

Turmeric has been extensively studied for its ability to reduce fat accumulation in the liver, and it has been shown to protect against metabolic syndrome – a cluster of unhealthy medical conditions that can set the stage for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Additionally, turmeric has been shown to help repair and regenerate liver functions. Interestingly, the liver is the only organ in the human body that can regenerate itself after damage.

This resilient organ can withstand significant damage and still function effectively provided that it is not completely destroyed. Many people with damaged livers can still survive and thrive.

Next up, we have Number 4. “Mushrooms”.

Mushrooms play a crucial role in supporting overall liver function, due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Mushrooms are especially high in glutathione content. This master antioxidant neutralizes free radicals and protects the liver from oxidative stress. Mushrooms with high levels of glutathione include porcini, white button, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms.

In addition, reishi and shiitake mushrooms not only boost liver health but also offer hepatoprotective properties, which means they safeguard the liver cells from damage.

Coming into the top 3, Number 3 is “Avocados”.

Avocados are highly beneficial for liver health due to their rich content of glutathione. Including avocados in your diet can help reduce inflammation, which is crucial to prevent liver complications such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and cirrhosis. Consuming just one to two avocados per week can improve liver health.

Moving on we have Number 2. “Eggs”.

Eggs are beneficial for your liver because they contain high amounts of choline in the yolk, which can help stop and reverse NAFLD. It helps move fat away from the liver to other places in the body, thereby preventing the accumulation of fat in the liver, which can cause inflammation, liver damage, and cirrhosis.

Furthermore, choline helps control cholesterol levels and keep the liver healthy. As if its fat-burning capabilities weren’t impressive enough, it turns out that choline can actively promote the regeneration and regrowth of liver cells. Another excellent source of choline is organ meat like liver and kidney.

And at Number 1, we have “Prebiotics and Probiotics”.

The liver is very close to the digestive system and connected by a special system called the “hepatic portal system”. If there is an imbalance in the digestive tract, such as too much bad bacteria, it can hurt the liver. This is because bad bacteria release substances that can cause inflammation in the liver.

Taking probiotics (healthy bacteria) and prebiotics (fiber, which acts as “food” for good bacteria) can help improve liver health. The probiotics and prebiotics help balance the gut, which leads to positive effects on the liver.

Studies showed that people with NAFLD who took prebiotic and probiotic supplements reduced inflammation and scarring, as well as fat storage in the liver.

Prebiotic fibers include onions, garlic, asparagus, and bananas. Probiotic-fermented foods include sauerkraut, miso soup, kimchi, and kombucha.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 12, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/cancer-lymphatic-system/,How Cancer Spreads Through The Lymphatic System (And How To Keep It Healthy),"Cancer and the lymphatic system have a pretty interesting relationship. The lymphatic system runs parallel to the circulatory system. Unlike blood, there is no pump to circulate lymph; it flows through the body via muscle movement. (Updated June 7, 2023)

Lymph is a clear, fatty fluid produced by blood marrow, organs, and glands that moves throughout the body, carrying nutrients and removing waste that are too big to move through veins. The system is comprised of lymph nodes, vessels, and lymphoid tissues. The gut is the body’s lymph storehouse, containing 80% of our immune cells in lymphatic tissue (1).

Cancer And The Lymphatic System

Lymph moves through the body and is filtered in the nodes. Lymphocytes in the nodes kill abnormal cells (cancer), viruses, and harmful bacteria. The liquid then transports the waste to the liver and kidneys for detoxification and subsequent removal through the excretory system.

Any intruders that the lymphatic system doesn’t recognize (e.g., toxic chemicals and pollutants) go along for the ride and are carried throughout the body, including in the blood and organs. This is why cancer tests include a lymph biopsy: if cancerous cells are prevalent in lymph, it’s a sign that they exist in the organs as well. What the immune system (of which lymph is a huge part) can’t kill is transported and makes its way through the lymphatic system—this is how cancer can spread.

Symptoms of a sluggish lymphatic system include:

Bloating
Brain fog
Breast swelling or soreness during menstruation
Cellulite
Cold hands and feet (poor circulation)
Constipation
Dry or itchy skin
Fatigue
Leg discoloration
Morning stiffness or soreness
Swollen fingers
Keeping Your System Flowing

We can see then how important it is to keep lymph flowing freely, to prevent toxins and cancerous cells from settling in any one place to take hold and proliferate. Here’s what you can do to reset your system.

1. Exercise

Regular exercise helps keep everything in the body working properly: We simply aren’t meant to be sedentary. Muscle movement, strength and tone are important to move lymph. Studies show that exercise increases lymph flow 2-3 times that of when at rest.

Gravity is a useful force with any liquid and bouts of zero gravity help to drain lymph. Not all of us live near an amusement park to ride a roller coaster so gentle jumping on a trampoline—called “rebounding”—is one of the best ways to improve lymph flow. It’s low impact and you can do it at home. Two minutes at a time 3-10 times a day does wonders for circulation.

2. Inversion

Placing your body or parts thereof in an upside-down or inverted position allows gravity to pull in the direction opposite of the normal upright, thereby pulling lymph through nodes and toward the heart. An inversion table is ideal for this. Some yoga positions are extremely beneficial for this purpose as well. You can find photos and instructions for some poses here.

3. Deep Breathing

With each breath, we take in oxygen to feed our blood. However, the pressure and muscle stimulation of conscious deep breathing also promote lymph flow. There is much more lymph in the body than blood, so it’s important to push it along. Plus, pranayama yoga breathing exercises are very effective and have been shown to have many benefits for the body and mind (2).

4. Dry Skin Brushing

With a stiff dry natural bristle brush, gently brush the arms and legs toward the heart before showering in the morning to get your lymph flowing. Lymph ducts are located in the chest, so make sure to follow the proper movement.

Dry skin brushing also helps remove toxins excreted through the skin. External pressure followed by the warm shower stimulates flow from both outside and within and washes them down the drain.

5. Drink Water

Many of us don’t drink enough plain (filtered) water and since lymph is a fluid, it can become too thick in times of dehydration. Getting plenty of warm water and herbal tea helps keep everything in the body moving as it should, improving digestion and lymph flow in the process.

6. Massage

Lymphatic massage, whether performed by a trained therapist or on your own, is proven to facilitate flow and proper drainage (3). Additionally, since chronic stress can contribute towards a sluggish lymphatic system, massage can help reduce stress and muscle constriction (4).

7. Iodine

Deficiency in this important nutrient is common and can be a sign of poor lymph flow and thyroid dysfunction. Dulse, Himalayan salt, mushrooms, and beets are exemplary sources of iodine to help your body rid itself of toxins.

8. Red Foods

The red pigment in pomegranates, cherries, red grapes, beets, berries, and other red foods contains phytonutrients including antioxidants that stimulate lymph.

9. Overall Diet

What you eat directly affects every cell in your body. Eliminating processed foods that are laden with synthetic chemicals and other toxins takes a tremendous strain off your lymphatic system. Food that contains genetically modified organisms and pesticides are considered foreign invaders by your body and what lymph can’t handle will remain, leading to illness and disease. Lymph will thicken with residual toxins, making it harder for your body push through to eliminate. Whole foods, with an emphasis on organic raw fruits and vegetables, provide the nutrients you need without the bad stuff. The Ayurvedic practice of eating seasonal fruit on its own is known to promote lymph health (5).

Maintaining a vibrant lymphatic system will help to prevent the development of cancer and other serious illness. Just because you can’t see it doesn’t mean it’s not there; giving lymph the attention it deserves supports your immune system and delivers nutrients where they’re needed.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 7, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/frozen-lemon-technique-fights-cancer/,How To Use a Frozen Lemon To Fight Malignant Tumors in The Body,"Lemon seem to be in every detox recipe on the web. Whether it’s lemon water, lemonade or lemon tea, there’s no escaping the fact that these little citrus fruits pack a health punch. (Updated June 5, 2023)

If you’re juicing your lemons, you’re missing out on so many beneficial compounds, you’ll wish you were freezing them all along!

Lemon As Medicine

Lemons have long been used in traditional cooking both as a flavoring agent and a medicinal remedy.

In fact, lemons have been proven to :

Fight Cancer
Lower cholesterol (1)
Fight inflammation
Kill harmful bacteria
Regulate high blood pressure (2)
Combat depression and stress
Detox your kidneys and liver
How Lemons Are Equipped To Fight Cancer

The Department of Horticultural Sciences at Texas A&M University examined the anti-cancer benefits of lemon and concluded that “citrus limonoids may have potential for the prevention of estrogen-responsive breast cancer.” (3)

And it’s not just limonoids: “coumarins in lemon fruit are promising chemopreventive agents by inhibiting radical generation.” (4)

Lemons are also rich in polyphenols, which have at least 100 positive effects on cancer cells such as the antioxidant effect, says Leicester University’s professor Will Steward, head of clinical oncology (5).

Other than prevention, limonoids also showed promising result in promoting the self-destruction of cancer cells in less than 12 hours (6). The quantity of limonoids needed to have this affect is about equivalent to a glass of citrus juice.

These studies, among others suggest lemon may help prevent and possibly treat the cancers of the mouth (7), breast, stomach, colon, childhood cancers and more.

Getting The Most Out Of Your Lemons

Lemon peel contains 5 to 10 times more vitamins than the lemon juice itself.

In fact, Dr Marilyn Glenville, a nutritionist and expert on women’s health, says that eating a wider range of fruit peels is beneficial to our health. She told BBC food: “Most of the antioxidants contained in fruit are found within the peel or the pith rather than in the pulp itself.”

More specifically, the pith, pulp and peel of lemon contains “in particular flavones, flavanones, flavanols, phenolic acids, limonoids, carotenoids, coumarins, furocoumarins, polymethoxyflavones, and dietary fibre, among others.” (8)

And so, Dr Glenville suggests: “It’s better to make a smoothie than a juice, because you can whip everything up including the skin, and you’re not discarding anything in terms of nutrient content.”

When it comes to citrus fruits, smoothies aren’t ideal since they can be quite bitter. The recipe bellow will show you how to get the most out of your lemon without scrunching up your face from the strong flavor!

How To Freeze Lemons
Start by washing and disinfecting the fruit with a little apple cider vinegar.
Rinse and dry.
Freeze the lemon overnight.
Once fully firm, remove from the fridge and grate it pulp, peel, seeds and all.
Keep frozen in an ice cube tray for future use.

Lemon peel can enhance the flavor of your meals, including: salad, ice cream, soup, yogurt, pasta sauce and more!

Try a spoonful in smoothies, a pinch in your favorite juice and teas or a generous amount in baked goods. The possibilities are endless!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/clear-out-your-arteries/,The Best Way to Clear Out Your Arteries,"When your arteries become clogged and hardened by sticky plaque, this condition is called atherosclerosis. It is the main reason people get heart attacks and strokes, which can be fatal.

Today, we look at where plaque comes from, and how you can reverse clogged and stiff arteries naturally. Scroll to the end to see Sources.

So, the reason that plaque builds up in the arteries is due to damage to the inner lining. This creates inflammation.

Now, if a specific part of an artery is damaged enough, it can tear open and cause bleeding, which is dangerous and can quickly kill a person.

So, the body forms plaque as a kind of “band-aid” to prevent bleeding at the site of injury where the artery walls are weak.

What happens is inflammation chemicals at the site of injury attract oxidized cholesterol and calcium to form plaque deposits.

Now, this sticky and flexible plaque is meant to be a temporary coating while your body catches up with repairing the artery wall.

If there is repeated injury to an artery, inflammation increases, leading to a rise in inflammatory chemicals, and thus, a thicker plaque deposit.

This almost always occurs in arteries with high flow, as plaque is rarely seen in veins due to low blood flow.

Now, as that artery narrows, some of the plaque becomes solid and calcified, not moving but stable; however, the newer layers are soft.

This is called soft plaque, and it is probably the most dangerous. With the sheer force of fast-flowing blood, it can rip off or tear, and cause new inflammation.

So, the body sends in its platelets and fibrinogen and other factors, and you get a clot. The clot blocks the blood from delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells and tissues. So, the person could have a heart attack, if the block is in the heart, or a stroke if the block is in the brain, and then they have a problem.

As plaque deposits occur in other arteries, we get stiffness all over the body. As people age, the inner lining of their arteries gets more and more damaged and scarred, resulting in stiffening. This is known as, “hardening of the arteries”.

If you have problems climbing the stairs, and your legs or feet are cold, numb, or painful, you may want to get a calcium score test to check for artery calcification.

In some people, calcium deposits almost turn into bone. When seen in an X-ray, the artery is calcified like a bone and can no longer contract.

At this point, it should be clear that heart disease happens as a result of a buildup of damage to the walls of arteries that is not repaired in time.

Now, let’s take a look at a “vitamin therapy” that supports your body’s ability to repair damaged arteries, heal inflammation, and dissolve plaque deposits. It consists of 7 important vitamins.

We start with Number 7. “Vitamin C”

So, how does your body repair a damaged artery wall? Your body responds to this potentially life-threatening problem by laying down new collagen fibers. Collagen is one of the most abundant proteins in the body, providing strength to connective tissues such as skin, ligaments, and artery walls.

So, vitamin C is the most important nutrient your body needs to repair or replace the collagen fibers that are required to keep the artery walls in good condition. Plus, your body uses vitamin C as an antioxidant to support immune function, aid in stress response, and bind to toxic heavy metals so they can be removed.

The recommended amount of vitamin C or pure ascorbic acid to take is 6-12 g/day. However, to prevent an upset stomach, it is advisable to split this into smaller doses.

Also, because vitamin C does not stay in your system for long, you’ll get the most benefit by dosing throughout the day. For better absorption, choose liposomal vitamin C.

The best type of vitamin C supplement is derived from whole fruits, such as camu camu powder. Food-derived Vitamin C is chemically the same as ascorbic acid, but it also contains other plant nutrients that may improve the bioavailability of vitamin C.

You can get vitamin C from fruits and vegetables, such as bell peppers, citrus, and cruciferous vegetables; however, for most people, it is often not enough.

Now, it’s important to take two other amino acids to ensure good collagen synthesis: L-Lysine and L-Proline. These two amino acids also help dissolve the plaque deposits into very small pieces. This prevents larger pieces of plaque from causing an embolism; meaning, the artery is blocked by a blood clot.

The suggested dosage for L-Lysine is 3-6 g/day. The dosage for L-Proline is 1-2 g/day.

One of the most prominent promoters of this “vitamin C therapy” is Linus Pauling, the recipient of two unshared Nobel Prizes. I have included links below so you can get more detailed information.

Coming up next, is Number 6. “Vitamin E”.

Did you know there are eight types of antioxidant vitamin E? There are four tocopherols and four tocotrienols, and all eight should be present on the back of the supplement bottle.

The recommended dosage is 400-800 mg/day. Vitamin E can make your blood less prone to clot, so it’s important to consult your doctor if you’re on blood-thinning medication.

Studies have shown that this antioxidant has the potential to significantly reduce oxidized LDL; this is the dangerous type of cholesterol that increases inflammation in plaque deposits.

Foods that are rich in vitamin E include sunflower seeds, almonds, spinach, avocados, squash, kiwifruit, trout, shrimp, olive oil, wheat germ oil, and broccoli.

Moving on to Number 5, we have “Vitamin K2”.

Did you know that vitamin K2 can prevent calcium buildup in the arteries? A lack of vitamin K2 may be the most important cause of calcified arteries.

First off, there are two main kinds of vitamin K: K1, which comes from green leafy vegetables such as spinach and is important for blood clotting; and vitamin K2, which is mostly found in animal foods and fermented ones as well.

Most people do not get enough vitamin K2. The best foods that are rich in K2 are natto, sauerkraut, pastured egg yolks, grass-fed beef liver and butter, eel, and some types of cheeses (for example, raclette, gouda, Jarlsberg, and Edam).

Vitamin K2 moves calcium away from the arteries and kidneys to the bones and teeth, where it is needed, by activating the hormone osteocalcin.

However, we also need Vitamin D; otherwise, our bones cannot absorb the calcium they need to stay healthy! The best way to get our vitamin D is from the sun.

When supplementing, choose the MK-7 form of K2, as it remains in your bloodstream longer. The recommended dosage is 100 to 200 mcg/day. MK-7 is often paired with vitamin D3 in one supplement, so this is a good option to choose.

Next on the list is Number 4, “B Vitamins”.

B vitamins are essential for heart disease patients in two significant ways.

First, people with high blood pressure will have to make their hearts work harder to pump blood. This requires more energy usage by the heart muscle and therefore a better supply of B vitamins.

Second, high homocysteine levels caused by vitamin B deficiency and certain disease states can irritate artery walls and increase the risk of blood clots. This is a serious problem that can be easily resolved by getting enough B6, B12, and folate.

Luckily, it is easy to load up on foods rich in B vitamins. These include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and leafy green vegetables such as cabbage, kale, spinach, peas, beans, poultry, fish, eggs, and liver.

If you are taking a vitamin B supplement, always opt for natural methylcobalamin over synthetic cyanocobalamin. For even better absorption, try liposomal methylcobalamin. Follow the dosage on the bottle.

Coming into the top 3, we have Number 3. “CoQ10”.

Coenzyme Q10 is required for the production of collagen fibers. It’s needed in large amounts where there’s high energy usage. And, since the heart is the one muscle that never stops working, it needs a lot of CoQ10 to function properly.

Although our bodies naturally produce CoQ10, its production declines with age. Therefore, individuals over 40 years old would benefit from supplementation.

Heart patients, especially those with high blood pressure, which forces the heart muscle to use more energy, can benefit from taking CoQ10 supplements. If the CoQ10 levels of these patients get too low, they might experience congestive heart failure.

Since taking statins to reduce cholesterol also reduces CoQ10 production, supplementing with CoQ10 is a must.

The recommended dosage is at least 100 mg/day.

Moving on next, we have Number 2. “Copper”.

Copper is required for the creation of collagen fibers. A copper deficiency can cause microcytic anemia, wherein the red blood cells are too small, and ischemic heart disease, where there is weak blood flow to the heart due to narrow arteries.

It is best to take zinc with copper if you are deficient in either or both minerals. Zinc is likely to be deficient in a vegetarian diet, and it is also important for healing damaged tissues, including artery walls.

Copper dosage should be in the area of 2 mg/day, and zinc should probably be 30 mg/day.

And at Number 1, we have “Magnesium”.

Many people do not think of magnesium as an electrolyte, such as potassium. As an electrolyte, magnesium helps maintain the electrical current flowing through your heart and blood vessels.

If your diet is poor in magnesium, your heart and arteries will become prone to contractions or muscle spasms, thus increasing the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack.

That’s because magnesium is a powerful vasodilator. It helps your blood vessels to relax, thus it stops calcium from building up in plaque.

Studies have found magnesium lowers high blood pressure, reduces chest pain, and prevents abnormal blood clotting.

Taking 200-400 mg/day of this mineral can help treat many heart conditions. The recommended type is magnesium malate for easy absorption, or even better, take a supplement that contains all seven forms of magnesium.

There you have it! A “vitamin therapy” to help your body reduce plaque deposits.

Combine this with an anti-inflammatory diet that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Some of the best food sources of inflammation-lowering omega-3s are sardines, wild salmon, mackerel, walnuts, macadamia nuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds, seaweed, spirulina, and chlorella.

If you think about it, an anti-inflammatory diet is really an anti-plaque diet. Click the link below to get your free anti-inflammatory diet plan.

Next, let’s touch on what causes your artery walls to be damaged.

So, the inner lining of the arteries can become damaged due to things such as homocysteine, insulin, glucose, lead, arsenic, mercury, bacterial toxins, and gut bacteria that can get into the arterial wall and trigger inflammation that leads to plaque deposits. Watch out for an upcoming video, where we’ll discuss what causes inflammation in the arteries.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/lemon-and-baking-soda-a-miraculous-cancer-fighting-combination/,Lemon and Baking Soda: A Miraculous Cancer-Fighting Combination,"Drinking lemon water is great, but there is a way to take it to a whole other level by adding one household ingredient. By adding a spoonful of baking soda into the mix, you can actually protect yourself against chronic inflammation and cancer. (Updated June 6, 2023)

How it Works

Lemons contain compounds called limonoids, which have the ability to fight breast cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis (1). These compounds also work against other hormone-sensitive cancers, like cervical or ovarian cancer (2). Roughly 11 different limonoids contribute to fighting the disease, killing cells in as little as 12 hours (3).

Studies have shown that consuming four or more 150-gram portions per week of citrus fruit decreased the risks of throat cancer by 58%, oral/pharyngeal cancer by 53%, stomach cancer by 31 percent, and colorectal cancer by 18%. Another study found that women who had never experienced hormone replacement therapy and consumed roughly 75 grams daily of citrus fruits experienced a 22% reduction in breast cancer risk (4).

The high vitamin C content of these fruits also improves cancer survivability, fights aggressive colorectal cancers, and suppresses tumor growth. Lemon seeds, pulp, and skin contain even more antioxidants than the juice alone. Its aglycones and glucosides have chemopreventive and cytotoxic effects, but that’s not all (5).

The fruit also has the ability to:

Lower cholesterol
Fight inflammation
Kill harmful bacteria
Regulate high blood pressure
Combat depression and stress
Detox your kidneys and liver

Baking Soda, on the other hand, fights cancer by fighting inflammation and pro-cancer acidity (6,7). It serves as a buffer to alkalize the extracellular fluid in your body without harming your healthy cells. This also prevents tumors from metastasizing and protects your lymph nodes (8,9). Case studies have found that baking soda can effectively reverse late-stage prostate cancer and prevent cancer recurrence.

To help prevent cancer, combine 2 teaspoons of freshly squeezed organic lemon juice and half a teaspoon of baking soda in a tall glass of water and drink it on an empty stomach before breakfast.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"June 3, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-taking-ibuprofen/,Top Doctors Are Warning Anyone Over 40 To Stop Taking Ibuprofen Immediately. Here’s Why…,"What do you do when a headache settles in? Chances are, you probably do the same thing as when you experience back pain or a toothache: take an ibuprofen. (Updated June 2, 2023)

As we’ve grown more and more dependent on drugs, we’ve also prioritized symptoms over illness. Instead of getting more sleep and rehydrating to cure the cause of a headache, you can simply take a pill that will ease your symptoms.

Like any other quick fix, taking ibuprofen will only make your headache return as soon the pill wears off. Ibuprofen is widely used today, but doctors warn that the regular use of ibuprofen and other drugs takes a toll on the liver and heart.

Better Safe Than Sorry

Ibuprofen works by blocking the formation of prostaglandin, prostacyclin and thromboxane products, which are important mediators of inflammation and pain (1).

Since the drug is metabolized by the liver, it most strongly affects this organ, causing injury, liver failure, or disease (jaundice) over time (2).

The FDA has also warned against the use of these drugs since 2005 because it increases your risk of heart attack (3). The organization has since emphasized the warning with the following information (4):

Heart attack and stroke risk increase even with short-term use, and the risk may begin within a few weeks of starting to take an NSAID.
The risk increases with higher doses of NSAIDs taken for longer periods of time.
The risk is greatest for people who already have heart disease, though even people without heart disease may be at risk.

Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs can also raise blood pressure and cause heart failure, even with short-term use. This can be potentially deadly for people over 40, who have a much higher risk of heart disease than younger adults (5).

Because it takes a long to feel the destructive effects of NSAIDs, most people simply ignore these warnings and underestimate the danger of these drugs. Instead, they continue to rely on pills for daily aches and pains.

The Natural Alternative

Turmeric isn’t just a spice, it’s nature’s “medicine“. In some cases, it works better than drugs in fighting health problems such as fatty liver disease, arthritis, weight loss, depression and even cancer.

The active compound in turmeric, curcumin, has analgesic properties comparable to ibuprofen. It dulls the sensation of pain by triggering a response in the opioid receptors in the brain. Unlike drugs, though, turmeric doesn’t cause addiction.

In a study, published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, turmeric was shown to be effective in treating osteoarthritis. Over a period of six weeks, a portion of the participants received 800mg of ibuprofen and the remaining subjects took 2,000mg of turmeric.

At the end of the study, those who ate turmeric demonstrated better results showing that the all-natural spice is not only more effective but also safer than popping pills. To use the spice outside the kitchen, make your own turmeric supplements by following the recipe below.

DIY Turmeric Supplements

Ingredients:

1/3 cup organic, ground turmeric
big pinch of ground black pepper
3 tbsp raw, organic honey
1 tbsp melted coconut oil

Instructions:

Mix all ingredients together in a bowl to make a paste.
Take pinches of the turmeric paste and roll them into small balls.
Place in freezer for about 1 hour and remove.
Store in a glass container and keep it in your refrigerator.
Take 2-3 a day.

You can also opt to drink the spice with the following recipe.

Mix one tablespoon of turmeric powder, one cup of honey and the juice of one squeezed lemon in a glass
Stir the combination
Add a teaspoon of this mixture to a cup of warm water or tea
Enjoy the pain-relieving cocktail three times a day and you will see results in no time

https://dailyhealthpost.com/calcium-alone-wont-prevent-osteoporosis-these-other-3-nutrients-are-just-as-important/,Calcium Alone Won’t Prevent Osteoporosis…You Also NEED These 2 Essential Nutrients!,"We know that calcium is needed for tooth and bone support. What you may not know is that calcium doesn’t work on its own, requires other vitamins and minerals to do its job. Like the three musketeers, calcium needs magnesium and vitamin D to be  effectively absorbed. The body doesn’t produce calcium, so the mineral must be sourced form the foods you eat. (Updated June 1, 2023)

How It Works

Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that regulates blood calcium and potassium levels. Calcitonin also inhibits bone cell breakdown. The more calcium in the body, the more calcitonin is produced (1).

When these nutrients are taken together, each component can do its job for bone health: calcitonin stalls bone cell degeneration while new calcium is absorbed. Magnesium, on the other hand, affects bone mineral density: as calcium moves into the bone cells, magnesium makes sure it stays there.

You could say that without necessary amounts of magnesium, your calcium levels are almost inconsequential.

When Your Bones Get Weak

Osteoporosis is a condition in which bone density is low, making bone and bone tissue weak and susceptible to fracture. Fractures from osteoporosis are more common than the incidence of breast cancer, stroke, and heart attack combined (2).

There are no symptoms of osteoporosis and it’s a cumulative condition so it’s important to ensure you regularly get enough calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium in your diet to keep osteoporosis at bay.

Many people take calcium supplements to keep their bones strong. Supplements do have their place in a healthy lifestyle but the best source of nutrition is always whole foods.

Depending on the kind of supplement you buy, the calcium it contains may not be bioavailable and will collect in your arteries and kidneys instead of in your bones. This can lead to cardiovascular problems and kidney stones—not a happy scenario.

A researcher in New Zealand went so far as to say, “Evidence that calcium supplements prevent fractures is weak and inconsistent.”(3). This goes for fortified foods like milk, too.

Any processed food with added vitamins—D included—is almost always made using synthetic materials.

Other important nutrients for bone health are vitamin K2, which is responsible for transporting calcium through the body, and omega 3 fatty acids, which improve bone strength (4, 5).

The body may not produce calcium, but it does create its own vitamin D— All you need is sunshine. Twenty percent of your skin exposed to sunlight for thirty minutes a day is enough to get your daily dose. The sad fact is that most people don’t spend enough time outside to get that much.

Foods vs. Supplements

Fruits and vegetables often contain the appropriate combinations of nutrients to support each other.

That’s why it’s so important to each a variety of them each day. While not an exhaustive list, below are common foods that contain significant amounts of calcium and vitamin D.

It’s also a good idea to eat leafy vegetables and green grasses, which contain chlorophyll—a pigment that makes them green. The central atom in chlorophyll is magnesium.

Example of bone-healthy foods include:

Almonds
Brazil nuts
Collard greens
Cottage cheese
Eggs
Kale
Dried wheat grass or barley grass
Okra
Parsley
Sardines
Salmon
Sea vegetables: hijiki, wakame
Seaweeds: kelp, kombu
Spirulina
Sunflower seeds
Turnip greens
Watercress
Yogurt and other fermented dairy foods, like kefir

Food sources high in magnesium include:

Seaweeds, fresh and dried
Beans
Beet greens
Broccoli
Cucumbers
Whole grains
Nuts
Peas
Seeds
Squashes, including pumpkin
Leafy greens

It’s also important to avoid foods that strip your body of these nutrients, like refined sugars ,which inhibit the absorption of calcium and magnesium.

How much calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D you need on a daily basis depends on your sex and age.(6,7)

https://dailyhealthpost.com/clearing-negative-energy/,Scientists Have Proven That Negativity Makes Cancer Grow Inside The Body,"Everybody feels negative emotions once in a while, but these emotions have a stronger effect on your health than you may realize. Every time you think about regrets, experience resentment or replay bad memories in your head, your body suffers just as much as your mind. That’s why harboring negative emotions can lead to devastating long-term disease. (Updated May 29, 2023)

But there is one simple solution: forgiveness. Trouble is, our culture seems to perceive forgiveness as a sign of weakness, submission, or both. This makes it harder to actually do the work to forgive people who’ve done you harm.

Clearing Negative Energy: Why It’s Worth It

According to The Greater Good Science Center, “psychologists generally define forgiveness as a conscious, deliberate decision to release feelings of resentment or vengeance toward a person or group who has harmed you, regardless of whether they actually deserve your forgiveness.” (1).

It’s important to stress that forgiveness is a process, not an event. That’s why there’s such a big difference between decisional forgiveness and emotional forgiveness.

Some researchers have described the distinction as such: “Decisional forgiveness is a behavioral intention to resist an unforgiving stance and to respond differently toward a transgressor. Emotional forgiveness is the replacement of negative unforgiving emotions with positive other-oriented emotions. Emotional forgiveness involves psychophysiological changes, and it has more direct health and well-being consequences.” (2).

As such, a study published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that a forgiving personality was related to better subjective well-being and psychological well-being (3).

In other studies, forgiveness was linked to improved physical symptoms, fewer medications used, better sleep quality, less fatigue, and fewer somatic complaints (4).

Plus, forgiveness has heart-protective properties. A study published in the American Journal of Cardiology found that anger and other negative emotions  had cardiotoxic effects, while forgiveness has a more cardioprotective profile.

The researchers concluded: “These findings suggest that interventions aimed at decreasing anger while increasing forgiveness may be clinically relevant.” (5).

Forgiveness Improves Your Life

To examine the effects of negative emotions, researchers from Hope College’s Psychology Department, examined 35 female and 36 male participants as they revisited hurtful memories and grudges. They focused on blood pressure, heart rate, facial muscle tension, and sweat gland activity (6).

Participants were then asked to imagine granting forgiveness toward real-life offenders. Not surprisingly, researchers found that “forgiving thoughts prompted greater perceived control and comparatively lower physiological stress responses.”

Simply put, while negative emotions increased stress response and sweat production, forgiveness lowered blood pressure and relaxed facial muscles.

They further explained that “…chronic unforgiving responses may erode health whereas forgiving responses may enhance it.”

What About Cancer?

Unforgiveness is classified in medical books as a disease, according to Dr. Steven Standiford, chief of surgery at the Cancer Treatment Centers of America. He insists that refusing to forgive people who’ve done you wrong makes people sick and keeps them that way (7).

“It’s important to treat emotional wounds or disorders because they really can hinder someone’s reactions to the treatments, even someone’s willingness to pursue treatment,” said Standiford.

When it comes to the most feared disease of the last century, forgiveness may play a role in cancer prevention too. Dr. Michael Barry, author of the book The Forgiveness Project estimates that 61 percent of cancer patients have forgiveness issues.

“Harboring these negative emotions, this anger and hatred, creates a state of chronic anxiety,” he explains.”Chronic anxiety very predictably produces excess adrenaline and cortisol, which deplete the production of natural killer cells, which is your body’s foot soldier in the fight against cancer.”

Put It In Practice

Forgiveness can be as simple as letting go of hurtful memories and remembering that the person who hurt you is human too. But before you can do that, you have to forgive yourself for carrying around the weight of resentment for far too long. Let go of the past and you’ll feel healthier and lighter than ever before.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 29, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/detox-fatty-liver-naturally/,#1 Powerful Way To Detox Fatty Liver Naturally,"There is a silent and serious disease affecting millions of people around the world. Fatty liver disease is becoming increasingly common, especially in the United States. It impacts one in five people globally and can lead to liver failure, diabetes, heart attack, and even cancer. In the U.S., 30-40% of the population is affected by it.

This disease goes by the name NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) or just fatty liver. It’s strongly connected to fructose, vegetable seed oils, and excessive eating. So, what’s it all about?

Well, the main characteristic of this disease is that there is too much fat stored in the liver. So much so that the liver cannot function properly. When more than 5% of the liver is composed of fat, it is considered “fatty.” And, make no mistake, a fat-clogged liver is a toxic one.

Now, the biggest problem with fatty liver is that it usually does not show symptoms, so most people do not even realize they have it. However, as fatty liver progresses, you may experience symptoms such as fatigue, upper right abdominal pain, itchy skin, nausea, and vomiting.

Studies show that one in five cases of NAFL (non-alcoholic fatty liver) eventually turn into NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), a more severe form. That is when inflammation and fat start damaging the liver cells, and this can lead to scarring (fibrosis) and cirrhosis (permanent damage).

When the liver reaches the NASH stage, it isn’t functioning well anymore. What’s worse, NASH can be life-threatening and might even lead to liver cancer, which is an aggressive and tough-to-treat type of cancer.

The good news is that the effects of NAFLD can be reversed through diet and lifestyle changes. Today, we look at a 2-stage process to help detox fatty liver naturally.

Watch this video until the end, to learn about the #1 vitamin that can protect you from fatty liver disease.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

To detox a fatty liver, we start with Stage 1: “Clean Up”.

In this stage, you help your liver by cleaning up your diet and environment; this means avoiding the main culprits when it comes to fatty liver and making simple lifestyle changes.

First, reduce all refined carbohydrates by avoiding added sugars, particularly high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in sugary drinks. Avoid refined grains such as bread, pasta, snacks, and desserts.

When the liver gets overloaded with sugar or starch, it starts making fat like crazy. That is how your body usually handles extra glucose.

However, fructose, particularly in the form of HFCS, kicks the liver into overdrive and sends fat production through the roof. HFCS is present in most processed food items and beverages, and it is the primary cause of fatty liver.

As well as high blood sugar, increased inflammation, and insulin resistance that pave the way to diabetes and obesity.

As fat accumulates in the liver and surrounding organs, this visceral fat increases LDL cholesterol and inflammation, thereby raising the risk of heart attacks.

Next, avoid vegetable seed oils like soybean, cottonseed, corn, canola, sunflower, safflower, and peanut oil. These unhealthy fats are chemically processed and cause inflammation in the liver and digestive system. Linoleic acid, a primary component of these oils, may contribute to elevated liver enzymes and a fatty liver.

Cut your consumption of processed foods. These man-made foods are taken apart and put back together again with added sugar, salt, vegetable oil, fillers, and additives.

Avoid pesticides and GMOs by eating organic foods where possible, or buying from your local farmer.

Cut back on alcohol obviously, as it is highly inflammatory to the liver.

Steer clear of toxins in the water you drink, the air you breathe, and the personal care products you use.

Consuming processed foods and chemicals stresses your liver, creating conditions for NAFLD to develop.

Burn off excess glycogen stored in the liver with exercise and intermittent fasting. When the liver is full of glycogen, any extra carbs or sugar will turn into fat, often in the liver. Depleting liver glycogen helps to decrease stored fat.

Also, stay well-hydrated and get quality sleep.

Before we get into Stage-2, here’s a quick rundown of what your liver does: it removes toxins from the blood, processes nutrients, regulates blood sugar, and produces bile for digestion.

Plus, it generates glutathione. This is the body’s “master” antioxidant that fights off pollutants, pathogens, and carcinogens.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

In Stage 2, “Reset,” we add 6 foods and supplements to rejuvenate the liver.
Let’s start with Number 6. “Cruciferous & Sulfur-Rich Vegetables”.

Cruciferous vegetables are great for your liver as they boost its detoxification abilities and protect it from damage. Research on sulforaphane, found in broccoli sprouts, shows that it improves liver function and reduces oxidative stress. One animal study found that sulforaphane even prevented liver failure. These veggies also increase the activity of enzymes which help break down and neutralize harmful substances.

Cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, broccoli sprouts, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, bok choy, Swiss chard, cauliflower, watercress, turnips, and radishes.

Sulfur plays a role in detoxification because your liver cannot make glutathione without this mineral. While you can get sulfur from animal foods like beef, poultry, and fish, it’s best to reduce these when you’re trying to detox, because they can contain residues of animal medications and pesticides.

Thankfully, you can get plenty of sulfur from allium vegetables – garlic, onions, shallots, scallions, leeks, and chives. These sulfur compounds are antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-boosting.

Next, we have Number 5. “Antioxidant-Rich Foods”.

Antioxidants neutralize free radicals in the liver and all your cells, which is important as you’re trying to get rid of toxins.

Grapefruits contain the potent antioxidants naringenin and naringin and have been shown to fight chronic inflammation that triggers liver scarring, as well as reduce fat accumulation in the liver.

This citrus fruit is also an excellent source of the antioxidant quercetin, which significantly improves liver inflammation. Other foods rich in quercetin are capers, red onions, dark red or blue fruits (such as blueberries, grapes, apples, and cherries), spinach, asparagus, sweet peppers, and broccoli.

Another antioxidant, resveratrol, has been shown to reduce fat buildup in the liver; it also decreases liver fibrosis, protects against oxidative damage, and kills liver cancer cells. Resveratrol-rich foods include grapes, peanuts, cacao, pistachios, blueberries, and cranberries.

Moving on, we have Number 4. “Omega-3 Fats.”

Studies have found that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids reduces liver fat and improves liver enzymes in patients with fatty liver and NASH.

The 3 types of Omega-3 needed for good health are ALA, EPA, and DHA.

The best sources of omega 3 are seaweed and algae (wakame, nori, kombu, spirulina), chia seeds, hemp seeds, flax seeds, walnuts, edamame (tofu, tempeh), kidney beans, and olive oil.

You may want to avoid ocean fish and fish oils if you are trying to detox your liver.

Coming into the top 3, Number 3 is “Extra Fiber & Probiotics”.

Fiber is a form of complex carbs that will not spike your blood sugar levels. It helps you stay fuller for longer, so you won’t overeat, and keeps your bowel movements regular to eliminate toxins quickly.

Furthermore, soluble fiber helps to replenish the beneficial bacteria, by feeding the beneficial bacteria (probiotics) in your gut.

Since 70% of the blood that arrives at the liver for filtering comes from the intestines, an increase in beneficial gut bacteria helps reduce liver inflammation and the likelihood of developing fatty liver. For more information, see our video, “5 foods that cause gut inflammation“.

Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like substance. Sources of soluble fiber are garlic, chicory root, apples, barley, beans, carrots, citrus fruits, oats, and peas.

Most plant foods also contain insoluble fiber but tend to be richer in one type than the other. Insoluble fiber absorbs fluids and sticks to other substances to form stool. Foods high in insoluble fiber include mushrooms, beans, nuts, vegetables, and berries.

To add more probiotics, choose from fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, natto, and some cheeses like aged cheddar and Gouda.

Next up, we have Number 2. “Herbs & Supplements”.

The two recommended herbal supplements for your liver are Milk Thistle and Dandelion Root.

Studies found that Silymarin, the active compound in milk thistle, shields the liver by blocking toxins and aiding in their processing. Artichokes are another great source of silymarin.

Dandelion root has been found to reduce oxidative damage to the liver and help increase glutathione production. It also helps increase levels of a liver enzyme responsible for improving insulin sensitivity and reducing fat accumulation.

And at Number 1, we have “Choline”.

The #1 nutrient you should eat more to protect from fatty liver is choline! It is found primarily in egg yolks and beef liver. Most choline is metabolized in the liver, where it assists in ridding the liver of excess fats. Post-menopausal women need to get more choline.

One more thing: Curb the habit of overeating, such as stress eating, to prevent weight gain and diabetes! Statistics show that at least 50% of people with diabetes have fatty liver. Researchers have found that one of the principal ways NAFLD develops is through insulin resistance, the root cause of diabetes. We will talk about insulin resistance in a future video.

There you have it! The 2-stage process to detox your fatty liver naturally.

While it’s best to only buy organic homemade or traditional products, here are 7 possible cancer causing products and household items you should replace as soon as possible.

1. Shampoo

Respected academic and scientist David Suzuki reports that 80% common household products contain at least one of the 12 most toxic chemicals, which include carcinogens and endocrine disruptors like parabens, sodium laureth sulfate, formaldehyde-releasing preservatives and p-phenylenediamine (1).

When it comes to shampoo, parabens, fragrance, color and cocamide diethanolamine are the worst offenders. But these chemical aren’t just in shampoo : it’s estimated that 1 in 8 of the82,000 ingredients used in personal care products are industrial chemicals, including carcinogens, pesticides, reproductive toxins, and hormone disruptors. Even some “organic” or “natural” shampoo brands can contain harsh chemicals,

Instead just make your own or ditch the shampoo once and for all.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 19, 2023"

There is no secret formula; it’s quite simple and focuses on whole foods straight from the earth, such as fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, spices, nuts, seeds, and herbal teas.

These nutrient-packed foods help create a healthy gut microbiome, which in turn not only boosts our immune system but also helps protect us against diseases such as cancer. As you may already know, a huge part of our immune system is located in the gut!

What’s more, certain plant foods have powerful nutrients that can prevent and stop the growth of cancer cells in various ways.

But first, did you know that all of us have potentially cancerous cells in our bodies?

These cancer cells cannot grow into tumors larger than two millimeters unless they first form new blood vessels through a process called angiogenesis.

Cancer occurs when a group of abnormal cells grow and hijack the body’s normal, balanced system of angiogenesis. But without angiogenesis, these cancer cells would never become dangerous.

That’s because tumors need nutrients and oxygen to grow and spread, and they do this by sending out chemical signals that create new blood vessels in the area. This allows blood, oxygen, and nutrients to reach the tumor and help it keep growing. But if we block angiogenesis, we can actually slow down tumor growth and starve the cancer cells!

According to the research of Dr. William Li, the president, medical director, and co-founder of the Angiogenesis Foundation, there are many foods with remarkable anti-angiogenic properties; that is, they prevent blood vessels from feeding cancers so tumors simply can’t grow.

Some of these are green tea, ginseng, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, oranges, grapefruit, lemons, apples, pineapples, cherries, red grapes, kale, maitake mushrooms, turmeric, nutmeg, lavender, artichokes, pumpkins, parsley, garlic, (cooked) tomatoes, olive oil, and my personal favorite, dark chocolate.

Many of these plant-based foods are not only anti-angiogenic, but they are also packed with compounds that can cause cancer cells to commit suicide, prevent them from spreading, and mess with their metabolism. Even more astonishingly, research has shown that when foods are combined, their anti-cancer effects become stronger.

Now, an anti-cancer diet or an anti-angiogenic diet is essentially the same as an anti-inflammatory diet. That is because inflammation is like the fuel that ignites and accelerates cancer’s relentless progression. By focusing on foods that help fight inflammation, we are also helping our body prevent and heal from cancer.

In this video, we showcase a few of the most powerful anti-cancer fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices that reduce inflammation and help your body prevent and kill cancer cells. These have been proven through lab, animal, and human studies.

Watch this video until the end to discover one tea that is 4 times more powerful than green tea.

Let’s begin with Number 3, “Anti-Cancer Fruits”.
The #1 anti-cancer fruit is “Berries”.

Berries contain ellagic acid, anthocyanins, and other compounds that can reduce mutations and shield our cells from free radicals and DNA damage, as well as slow down or stop cancer cell growth for many types of cancer.

In a 2011 study, patients with early-stage throat cancer took 60 grams of powdered, freeze-dried strawberries daily for six months. After that time, half of them were disease-free and their tumor markers had dropped significantly. All thanks to the strawberries!

And it’s not just strawberries. Animal studies have shown that cranberries can have anti-cancer effects on 9 types of cancer, including colon, bladder, stomach, prostate, and others like lymphoma and glioblastoma.

In another study, athletes who ate two cups of blueberries daily for six weeks almost doubled their blood’s cancer-destroying cells – from 2 billion to 4 billion!

Did you know that the Indian gooseberry, or amla, has the highest known antioxidant content of any food? It has 200 times more antioxidants than blueberries!

A 2010 study found that an amla extract stopped cancer growth, killed over half of the existing cells, and greatly reduced the spread of cancer.

Now, you might be thinking, “But doesn’t fruit sugar feed cancer?” Well, natural sugars in fruits and vegetables actually give energy to cells and offer anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer benefits. That’s totally different from refined sugars, which are processed and contain chemicals.

Next, Cayenne pepper contains capsaicin.

This active compound can actually alter cancer-related genes linked to cancer cell growth. It is similar to curcumin in turmeric, which targets multiple cancer-related pathways. What’s interesting is that Habanero peppers have even more capsaicin; however, be careful—they’re super spicy!

Coming up at Number 2, we have “Anti-Cancer Vegetables”
The #1 anti-cancer vegetable is “Garlic”.

Thanks to its unique mix of phytochemicals and organosulfur compounds like allicin.

Numerous studies have shown that garlic lowers the risk of all cancers, particularly colon, stomach, intestinal, and prostate. It has antibacterial properties, can fight cancer-causing substances, helps with DNA repair, slows down cancer cell growth, and even triggers apoptosis. To help your body with healing, consume several cloves of fresh garlic per day. You can also choose an aged garlic extract.

All members of the allium family – garlic, leeks, yellow onions, and green onions – have been shown to halt the growth of cancer cells.

Next, Broccoli contains Sulforaphane.

Eating lots of broccoli and cauliflower, as well as other cruciferous vegetables, may help lower the chances of certain types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer.

These veggies, including Brussels sprouts, kale, bok choy, and cabbage, contain an anti-cancer compound called indole-3-carbinol. This compound has been shown to supercharge intestinal immune cells.

And let’s not forget about sulforaphane, another compound found in broccoli. It’s produced when raw broccoli is chopped or chewed, and it’s been shown to slow tumor growth, neutralize toxins, reduce inflammation, and block mutations in DNA that lead to cancer. To reap these benefits, just chop broccoli about 30-40 minutes before cooking.

Want even more benefits? Try broccoli sprouts! They have 25 times more sulforaphane and 100 times more indole-3-carbinol. Eating them raw allows you to enjoy their immune-boosting and detoxifying perks.

Next, Mushrooms contain Beta-Glucan.

Certain mushrooms, like maitake, reishi, cordyceps, turkey tail, and shiitake, are commonly used in Japan and China to complement cancer treatments. I came across a study that found people who ate mushrooms could actually tolerate more chemotherapy treatments, possibly because they experienced fewer side effects, which could indirectly help them live longer.

These mushrooms contain a powerful anti-cancer fiber called beta-glucan, which has an incredible ability to boost the immune system.

Another interesting fact is that breast cancer rates in Asian women are six times lower than in America. Green tea and mushrooms have been identified as protective dietary factors. A 2009 study discovered that Chinese women who consumed 15 mushrooms and 15 cups of green tea monthly had a whopping 90% lower risk of breast cancer compared to those who didn’t regularly consume them.

And at Number 1, we have “Anti-Cancer Herbs & Spices”
The #1 anti-cancer spice is “Turmeric”.

It’s astonishing that while most cancer drugs target only one cancer pathway, curcumin, the active anti-cancer compound found in turmeric, actually targets at least 80 cancer-linked cell-signaling pathways. Curcumin may even hinder cancer development at every stage, including formation, tumor growth, and metastasis (spreading to other parts of the body). What’s more, it induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in various cancer cells without harming normal cells. Combine turmeric with freshly ground black pepper to boost curcumin absorption by 2,000%.

Next, Oregano is more than a spice.

Did you know oregano is a fantastic spice with anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties? It’s actually one of the top ten spices richest in antioxidants – just a teaspoon has the same antioxidant power as two cups of red grapes! Plus, it’s loaded with the anti-cancer flavonoid, quercetin, as well as vitamin K, and iron. Lab studies have shown that oregano extracts can cause cancer cell death in colon, breast, and prostate cancer.

Next, Green Tea is full of EGCG.

Green tea and matcha green are packed with anti-cancer phytonutrients called catechins, like epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG, and has about 13 times more antioxidants than blueberries and pomegranates. Drinking green tea regularly has been linked to a lower risk of death from heart disease and other causes. Plus, it’s been shown to reduce the risk of certain cancers, like breast, prostate, and colon cancer.

Next, Hibiscus Tea is surprisingly powerful.

Recent studies reveal that hibiscus tea has over 400% more antioxidants than green tea! This blood-pressure-lowering tea is also full of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. What’s even more interesting is that lab tests found that hibiscus extracts can stop cancer cell growth and have positive effects on inflammation, atherosclerosis, liver disease, diabetes, and other metabolic issues. This makes hibiscus tea a fantastic drink to choose from!

To recap, to prevent cancer and even slow down its progression, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, which are naturally high in fiber and starch. To get your free anti-inflammatory diet plan, click the link below.

At the same time, avoid all the fast food, junk food, or processed food we covered in detail in our video “5 foods that cause gut inflammation“. Your microbiome plays an absolutely important role in preventing cancer, so be sure to watch this video as well as “8 ways to improve your gut microbiome“.

What’s interesting is that researchers have discovered that a high-fiber diet increases the production of butyrate in the gut. Butyrate is a byproduct of fiber metabolism with powerful anti-cancer effects. Additionally, people who live beyond 100 years have higher levels of butyrate and gut bacteria that produce it.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-prevent-pancreatic-cancer-with-vitamin-c/,How To Prevent The Deadliest of All Types of Cancer By Eating This ONE Thing!,"Pancreatic cancer is no joke. Because it’s difficult to spot in the early stages, the disease is one of the most deadly: Only 1% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the UK survive their disease for ten years or more (1). And survival rates in the the Unites States aren’t any better. (Updated May 11, 2023)

This is because the early warning signs of the disease are easily mistaken for everyday health complaints. By the time the disease has been diagnosed, it’s almost impossible to completely remove all the cancerous cells (2).

Processed Meat – The Biggest Culprit

For a long time, scientists believed the disease was caused by excess body weight, pancreatitis, diabetes and smoking, which raises cancer risk by 74% (3). However new research has discovered that meat products may also be to blame.

A recent study published in BMC medicine found that a high consumption of red meat was related to higher all-cause mortality, including death by cancer. Processed meat had the highest association to cancer and cardiovascular disease while poultry had little to no association (4).

And this isn’t the first study to link meat consumption to cancer.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 11, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/boost-nitric-oxide-levels/,Top 6 Vitamins to Boost Nitric Oxide,"Today, we look at what happens to your body when you have low nitric oxide levels, and what causes this deficiency. We also look at 6 vitamins that boost nitric oxide production in your body.

By vitamins, we refer to the foods, nutrients, and antioxidants, you get from your diet.

Watch until the end to learn about one critical mineral that boosts nitric oxide, which 80% of people do not get enough of.

And to learn about a 10-second trick to boost your nitric oxide levels by 200% in 20 minutes, click the link below at the end of this video.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule that acts as a vasodilator, which means it dilates blood vessels and increases blood flow.

Here are nine health benefits of nitric oxide:

Improves blood circulation: Nitric oxide signals the arteries to relax and open wider, which allows for healthy blood pressure and reduces the risk of heart-related diseases.

Increases energy and stamina: Nitric oxide provides the body with a long-lasting energy surge that boosts stamina and overall performance.

Boosts cognitive function: It helps improve brain function and speed up signal transmission, allowing for better thinking and alertness.

Promotes healthy bones: Nitric oxide aids in bone formation while slowing down bone breakdown, resulting in stronger and healthier bones.

Supports heart health: It is known to promote healthy cholesterol levels, keeping the arteries healthy and clear, thus supporting heart health.

Enhances immune function: Nitric oxide signals to the immune system to eliminate harmful invaders, thus providing an added defense.

Improves mood: It can lift your mood and bring a sense of well-being, leading to a happier life.

Enhances muscle and joint recovery: Nitric oxide helps muscles and joints recover faster, allowing for greater mobility and activity.

Boosts sexual health: Nitric oxide increases blood flow to the genital organs, improving erectile health in men and enhancing arousal and pleasure in women.

The problem is that most people in their 40s and beyond are only getting as little as 15% of the nitric oxide levels they had in their twenties.

So, what causes nitric oxide deficiency?

While there are many reasons why your body produces less nitric oxide as you age, it all begins in the endothelium.

The endothelium is the delicate lining inside all blood vessels, from the largest arteries in your heart to the smallest capillaries.

It is responsible for delivering vital oxygen and nutrients, and it is where nitric oxide is produced to keep the body healthy.

In the endothelium, enzymes called Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) are responsible for most of the nitric oxide your body produces.

Nitric oxide signals the muscles in your arteries to relax and widen, allowing blood to flow freely.

A young, healthy endothelium produces plenty of nitric oxide, keeping your body youthful and healthy.

As you age, however, your endothelium deteriorates, leading to a decrease in your nitric oxide levels.

Moreover, factors such as diabetes, smoking, poor diet, inactivity, obesity, chronic stress, genetics, and environmental pollutants contribute to this decline.

But that’s not all.

Using mouthwash regularly can decrease nitric oxide levels, as mouthwash kills the good bacteria that produce nitric oxide.

Plus, taking acid blockers for indigestion or an upset stomach can also interfere with the production of nitric oxide.

So, how can you know if your body is deficient in nitric oxide?

Here are 7 signs of low nitric oxide, caused by reduced blood flow to different parts of the body.

Poor Athletic Performance: Low oxygen supply to muscles results in reduced exercise tolerance, increased fatigue, and diminished athletic performance.

Erectile Dysfunction: A reduced ability to achieve and maintain an erection can lead to impotence in men.

Lowered Immune Function: White blood cells (macrophages) may produce low nitric oxide in response to harmful pathogens, which can lead to increased susceptibility to infections and slow wound healing.

Poor Cognition: Low blood flow to the brain can lead to poor memory, lack of mental clarity, and reduced cognitive function.

Cardiovascular Health Issues: Contributes to plaque buildup in arteries, hypertension, and impaired blood flow to and from the heart.

Poor Vision: Low levels of nitric oxide disrupt the drainage of fluids from your eyes, causing pressure to build up and weakening vision.

Low Energy, Poor Movement: Feeling sleepy too often, not being able to move comfortably as before, and experiencing lingering aches and soreness.

In short, low nitric oxide levels can make you feel “old” before your time!

Luckily, here are 6 vitamins that boost nitric oxide levels and increase the circulation of blood, nutrients, and oxygen throughout the body.

Let’s start with Number 6. “L-citrulline”.

L-citrulline is an amino acid that is efficiently converted into L-arginine in the kidneys, which then helps to produce nitric oxide.

Arginine is used in the production of nitric oxide, while citrulline is used in the production of arginine.

Studies have shown that supplementing with L-citrulline can increase nitric oxide levels significantly more than supplementing with arginine alone.

This is because arginine needs to be absorbed in the small intestine and liver before being released into circulation; whereas, citrulline can bypass all this and get quickly into the bloodstream.

Therefore, citrulline ends up being a better booster of blood arginine levels than arginine, and it does not cause the same digestive discomfort that arginine can cause in some individuals.

The recommended dosage of L-citrulline is 2-6g per day.

Did you know that watermelon is the king of citrulline-rich fruits?

Besides watermelon, other fruits that are high in citrulline include Casaba Melons, Cucumbers, and Cantaloupes.

Next up, we have Number 5. “Beetroot Extract”.

Beets contain high amounts of dietary nitrates, which are converted into nitrites and then into nitric oxide in the body.

Additionally, beets are an exceptional source of antioxidants that prolong the half-life of nitric oxide.

Other antioxidant-rich, nitrate-rich vegetables are spinach, arugula, kale, lettuce, and cabbage. The goal is to incorporate 2-3 servings of nitrate-rich foods into your daily diet.

Studies have shown that supplementing with beetroot extract can significantly increase plasma levels of nitric oxide. In general, 2-3 teaspoons of beetroot powder per day is enough to get your daily nitrate levels.

Coming up next, is Number 4. “Hawthorn Berry”.

Hawthorn berry increases blood flow, supports healthy circulation, and helps you get even more benefits from l-citrulline and beetroot extract.

Hawthorn berries contain compounds that activate Nitric Oxide Synthase in the endothelium, significantly increasing the production of nitric oxide from arginine. The recommended dosage is 160-1200 mg per day.

Coming into our top 3, Number 3 is “Vitamin B12”.

Most people over 50 are deficient in Vitamin B12. Your cells need B12 to increase nitric oxide production by reducing levels of an amino acid called homocysteine in the blood.

An elevated homocysteine level blocks nitric oxide production, and increases the risk of atherosclerosis, which can lead to coronary artery disease (CAD), heart attack, and stroke.

Your brain, nerves, and muscles need adequate levels of Vitamin B12 for optimal functioning. The recommended dosage for adults over 18 years of age is 2.4 mcg per day of methylcobalamin.

The top foods rich in vitamin B12 include nutritional yeast, fortified cereals, animal liver, beef, clams, sardines, and salmon.

Next up, we have Number 2. “Vitamin C”.

This powerful antioxidant is necessary for boosting nitric oxide.

That’s because it increases the activity of the enzyme needed for producing it in your body.

Vitamin C has also been observed to increase levels of L-citrulline.

Additionally, Vitamin C reduces cortisol and inflammation, to aid in opening the arteries.

To supplement, choose vitamin C made from whole foods, not ascorbic acid. The recommended dosage is 75 – 90 mg per day for adults over 18 years old.

Other antioxidant-rich sources of vitamin C are tart cherries, pomegranate juice, blueberries, strawberries, and citrus fruits.

And at Number 1, we have “Magnesium”.

Did you know that a whopping 80% of the population may not be getting enough magnesium? This crucial mineral is needed to relax smooth muscle cells in your arteries, thus increasing nitric oxide production, and allowing for better circulation throughout the body.

It is also essential for keeping your heart rhythm in check and preventing calcium buildup in vital organs such as your brain, joints, and heart.

The recommended dosage for adults over 19 years old is 400–420 mg per day.

Our recommended magnesium supplement has the highest absorption, see the link below.

Foods such as spinach, pumpkin seeds, almonds, dark chocolate, and avocados are all high in magnesium and can help increase nitric oxide production.

Other ways to increase nitric oxide production include aerobic exercises such as running, cycling, swimming, and dancing, as well as nasal breathing and humming.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/anti-cancer-foods-that-you-need-to-eat/,Top 10 Surprisingly Anti-Cancer Foods That You Need to Eat,"Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people globally. But did you know that what we eat can help prevent or slow down its progression?

Today, we look at ten anti-cancer foods that contain powerful compounds scientifically proven to fight against cancer cells.

Cancer is a sneaky and complex disease that causes cells to grow uncontrollably and even spread to other parts of the body.

This happens because of damage to the DNA in your cells that build up over time. These changes are called “gene mutations“.

So, what causes gene mutations? Researchers at the University of Texas found that genetics account for only 5-10% of cancer cases. The majority of cases, about 90-95%, are caused by a combination of diet, lifestyle, and the environment.

Not surprisingly, 25-30% of all cancer deaths are attributed to smoking. But, the most significant factor researchers identified was poor diet, which accounts for 30-35% of cancer cases worldwide, resulting in over two million deaths annually.

There are many types of cancer, but they all start from abnormal cells that divide and grow uncontrollably. When these cells stick together to form a lump, it is called a tumor. If left untreated, the tumor can damage nearby organs and tissues.

Even worse, some cancer cells can break off and travel to other parts of the body through the blood or lymphatic system. Fortunately, if cancer is detected early on, it is possible to reverse it.

Now, let’s get into the 10 anti-cancer foods you need to eat that may prevent, and even stop cancer.

Let’s begin with Number 10. “Mushrooms”.

Mushrooms aren’t just great in your cooking—they have bioactive compounds, like beta-glucans and polysaccharides, that have been studied for their effects on stomach, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers.

These compounds help stop cancerous blood vessels from growing and cancerous cells from spreading, among other anti-cancer benefits.

A study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that consuming white button mushrooms daily for four weeks led to an increase in natural killer cell activity, which plays a key role in fighting cancer.

Other studies show that Shiitake, Maitake, Turkey Tail, and Reishi mushrooms activate immune cells, prevent cancer growth, and induce cell death, or apoptosis, in cancer cells.

What’s more, mushrooms protect against breast and other hormone-related cancers because they inhibit an enzyme called aromatase, which produces estrogen.

Finally, mushrooms are rich in antioxidants that help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation; two factors that contribute to cancer development.

Coming up next is Number 9. “Garlic”.

The anti-cancer effects of garlic are attributed to its organosulfur compounds, which have been proven to inhibit cancer cell growth and induce cell death.

According to studies, eating garlic can provide protection against certain types of cancer such as breast, colon, lung, prostate, and stomach cancer.

Raw garlic is deemed to be more effective at preventing cancer than cooked garlic, as heat destroys some of the beneficial compounds in it. Black or aged garlic extract has also proven effective at inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.

A study of 41,387 Iowa women found that those with the highest garlic intake had a 50% lower risk of certain colon cancers than those with the lowest garlic intake.

Next on the list is Number 8. “Berries”.

Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, or any other type of berry are not only delicious but also packed with cancer-fighting compounds.

One of the key anti-cancer compounds is ellagic acid. Research by the American Institute of Cancer Research has shown that ellagic acid inhibits tumor growth and utilizes multiple cancer-fighting methods simultaneously.

Firstly, it acts as an antioxidant, which helps to neutralize free radicals that can cause cell damage leading to cancer. Additionally, ellagic acid assists the body in deactivating certain carcinogens and has been shown to slow the spread of cancer cells.

Berries also contain anthocyanins and resveratrol, two other powerful antioxidants that protect your cells against skin cancer, as well as cancers of the bladder, lungs, breast, and esophagus.

Moving on we have Number 7. “Turmeric”.

The vibrant orange spice, turmeric, is a staple in Indian curries and contains a potent anti-cancer polyphenol called curcumin.

Thousands of studies have shown that curcumin supports the body’s natural cancer-fighting mechanisms by reducing inflammation, enhancing immune function, and forcing cancer cells to self-destruct. Talk about a superhero spice!

Turmeric is particularly effective against several types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, lung, liver, and pancreatic cancer.

But here’s where things get really exciting: research suggests that turmeric could be just as effective as chemotherapy drugs in treating certain cancers.

Furthermore, curcumin can improve chemotherapy’s effectiveness by destroying multidrug-resistant cancer and cancer stem cells. It can also protect against damage caused by radiation.

Coming up next, Number 6 is “Cruciferous Vegetables”.

Researchers have found that eating cabbage and other vegetables from the crucifer family, such as broccoli, arugula, cauliflower, kale, and turnips, may help protect against certain types of cancer. In particular, these vegetables have been linked to a reduced risk of breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers.

These vegetables contain two important chemicals, glucosinolates and myrosinase, which work together to produce anti-cancer compounds called isothiocyanates (ITCs). ITCs can remove cancer-causing agents, kill cancer cells, and prevent tumors from growing.

Plus, cruciferous vegetables also reduce inflammation, activate anti-cancer enzymes, and “turn on” genes that slow cancer cell growth and promote cancer cell death.

They are also rich in vitamins and minerals like vitamin C, manganese, folate, potassium, fiber, and carotenoids that promote cell communication, regulate abnormal cells, and support the immune system.

The benefits of these cancer-fighting veggies are maximized when you, chop, blend, or chew them.

Next, at Number 5, we have “Dark, Leafy Greens”.

Leafy, dark green vegetables such as kale, collards, spinach, chard, certain kinds of lettuce, bok choy, and mustard greens are truly superheroes in the plant world.

They contain the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which work together to block early cancer development.

Plus, the carotenoids in these greens, which are responsible for their rich green color, are linked to a reduced risk of breast, skin, stomach, mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancer.

Coming up next is Number 4. “Red Grapes”.

Red grapes are packed with special nutrients that help the body fight diseases, including anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. The skin of red grapes is rich in an antioxidant called resveratrol. Studies show that resveratrol can stop the development or worsening of skin and breast cancer, and 12 types of leukemia.

Coming into the top 3, Number 3 is “Legumes”.

Did you know that legumes such as beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, and soybeans are cancer-fighting powerhouses? These amazing foods are brimming with fiber, which has been linked in some studies to lower rates of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer.

One study found that people who ate beans and lentils had a reduced risk of cancer of the entire digestive tract, including cancers of the mouth, stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as cancer of the kidney.

But wait, there’s more! Legumes also contain phytochemicals, folate, lignans, and saponins, all of which can help protect against cancer and promote overall health.

Next, our Number 2 is “Walnuts”.

Walnuts are more than just a tasty snack––they’re also chock-full of cancer-fighting compounds! Ellagic acid and gamma-tocopherol (a type of vitamin E), found in these nuts, both have anti-inflammatory and cancer-fighting properties. Studies have found that walnuts, in particular, are especially protective against breast and prostate cancers.

And at Number 1, we have “Celery”.

Did you know that celery packs a powerful punch against cancer? It may be around 95% water, but this mighty green stalk contains two anti-cancer compounds: apigenin and luteolin.

Apigenin, an anti-tumor compound, has been shown to cause cell suicide in various cancer types and rivals commercial anti-inflammatory drugs in reducing inflammation.

Meanwhile, luteolin can disrupt the replication cycle of cancer cells. One study found that luteolin can block pathways necessary for the growth of colorectal cancer cells.

Celery has also been shown to be effective against ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, breast, liver, and lung cancer cells.

Chinese research even suggests that eating two medium stalks of celery two to three times weekly could help reduce the risk of lung cancer by 60%.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/prednisone-side-effects/,"This Anti-inflammatory Drug Destroys Your Immune System, Fight Inflammation With These Foods Instead","Prednisone is a corticosteroid drug used to treat inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, blood disorders, and breathing problems (1). But prednisone side effects are pretty serious. (Updated Apr 10, 2023)

According to the NHS (National Health Services):

“Corticosteroids, often known as steroids, are an anti-inflammatory medicine prescribed for a wide range of conditions. They’re a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands (two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys).” (2)

Other uses include severe allergies, skin diseases, cancer, eye problems, crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune diseases. It’s typically taken orally in tablet or liquid form.

Oddly enough, the drug is also used to treat skin rashes, lupus, fungal infections, and even to prevent transplant rejection. You can find a whole list of the conditions treated by the drug here. But prednisone can have some serious side effects.

Why Prednisone Is Prescribed

Prednisone is a prescription drug that can only be obtained through licensed health care professionals like a doctor or pharmacist. It is a synthetic version of the hormone cortisone, a metabolite of cortisol, also know as the “stress hormone” (3).

This is because the hormone regulates, modifies, and influences your body’s reaction to stress, including:

Blood sugar (glucose) levels
Fat, protein and carbohydrate metabolism to maintain blood glucose (gluconeogenesis)
Immune responses and white blood cell count
Anti-inflammatory actions
Blood pressure
Heart and blood vessel tone and contraction
Central nervous system activation

Having too much cortisol in your system can lead to (4):

Impaired cognitive performance
Dampened thyroid function
Blood sugar imbalances, such as hyperglycemia
Decreased bone density
Sleep disruption
Decreased muscle mass
Elevated blood pressure
Lowered immune function
Decreased white blood cell count
Slow wound healing
Increased abdominal fat

On the opposite end of the spectrum, too little can lead to:

Brain fog, cloudy-headedness, and mild depression
Low thyroid function
Mood swings
Blood sugar imbalances, such as hypoglycemia
Fatigue – especially morning and mid-afternoon fatigue
Sleep disruption
Low blood pressure
Lowered immune function
Inflammation and inflammatory Conditions

In short, prednisone and other corticosteroids acts as an immunosuppressant by blocking the production of antibodies. This helps control an over-active immune system. The drug also works against inflammation to reduce heat, redness, swelling, and provide pain relief.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 10, 2023"

Arthritis is a common medical condition characterized by inflammation and swelling of the joints, which can lead to stiffness, pain, and reduced range of motion.

There are over 100 different types of arthritis; however, two primary forms dominate: Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, wherein cartilage gradually deteriorates over time due to wear and tear or injury. While rheumatoid arthritis involves an autoimmune response that causes inflammation of the joints and can also affect other organs in your body.

Other types of arthritis include:

Psoriatic arthritis: another autoimmune disease that affects some people who have psoriasis—a skin condition characterized by red patches of skin with silvery scales.

Gout: a painful condition caused by the buildup of uric acid in the joints, particularly the big toe.

Fibromyalgia: a chronic disorder marked by widespread muscle pain, fatigue, and tenderness near joints.

While each type of arthritis has its unique symptoms and associated risk factors, they all share a common theme: inflammation plays a major role in their development.

Let’s begin, with the first food that makes your joint pain worse.  Then, we’ll reveal the real root cause of inflammation in arthritis.

Number 6. “Vegetable Oils & Trans Fats”.

Vegetable oils are one of the worst culprits when it comes to exacerbating symptoms of arthritis and inflammation.

Also known as refined seed oils, these oils, such as corn, sunflower, safflower, and soybean oils, are commonly used in households and restaurants.

It’s hard to escape from vegetable oils, as they are also found in large amounts in packaged or processed foods, such as potato chips, hot dogs, white bread, fried chicken, French fries, and salty snacks.

The reason these oils are bad is their high amounts of omega-6 fatty acids, which are easily oxidized by heat and light. Oxidation means that the oil has been damaged by chemical reactions and has turned bad. These rancid oils greatly fuel inflammation in your gut lining, joints, and blood vessels, contributing to chronic pain and disease.

Another form of vegetable oil that is even worse is “artificial trans fats.” These are labeled as “partially hydrogenated oils” on some food labels.

The main culprits that contain trans fats are vegetable shortening for making soft and flaky cakes and pastries, microwave popcorn, margarine, fried fast foods, and nondairy coffee creamers.

To reduce inflammation, replace vegetable oils with healthy fats like avocado oil, macadamia oil, coconut oil, grass-fed butter, and extra virgin olive oil.

Before we get to the next worst food for arthritis, let’s look at the root cause of joint pain. You may have been told it’s inflammation, but that is not the whole story.

The real root cause is an excess of fibrin around the joints, which leads to chronic inflammation and pain.

So, what is fibrin? Fibrin is an insoluble protein that is involved in wound healing. It also forms the base material for clots, scabs, and scars.

Here’s how fibrin works:

When your body experiences an injury, even if it’s just a small bump, scratch, or sudden temperature change, it triggers a reaction by:

#1: Sending white blood cells to the affected area to fight infection, which results in inflammation and swelling.

#2: Releasing fibrin to form a strong, protective mesh-like web to seal off the site, and begin the healing process.

This mesh is critical for capturing the platelets and red blood cells needed to form blood clots.

Normally, once the injury has healed, the fibrin breaks down, and inflammation subsides.

However, in arthritis, fibrin continues to accumulate in the blood vessels and connective tissues surrounding the joints.

As excess fibrin thickens and hardens to form scar tissue, it restricts blood flow and oxygen. This slows down the healing process and keeps you stiff and in pain for longer.

This is why pain meds become less effective over time; they completely ignore the REAL cause of the problem.

Fibrin doesn’t just affect the joints. As long as there is excess fibrin in your circulatory system, red blood cells are prevented from getting to the areas where they are needed most.

The result is that your heart is forced to work harder, and your blood pressure increases. Excessive levels of fibrin in the body increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Before we reveal how you can break down fibrin, let’s look at the other worst foods that cause fibrin accumulation and inflammation.

Next at Number 5, we have “Soda And Sugar”.

The high amount of refined sugar in soda has been found to worsen knee osteoarthritis. Consumption of soda causes spikes in blood sugar and insulin, leading to increased inflammation throughout the body.

In addition, high-fructose corn syrup-packed sodas and other sweetened beverages contain a lot of empty calories, which contribute to weight gain—another factor that exacerbates arthritis symptoms.

To reduce inflammation, replace sugary beverages with unsweetened tea or water.

Coming up Next, Number 4. “Refined Carbohydrates”.

Do you notice that your joints become more achy, after consuming a lot of pizza, bagels, cookies, doughnuts, or pasta? This is because these refined carbohydrates are easily broken down into sugar, causing a spike in insulin levels that leads to body-wide inflammation, just like soda.

To reduce unwanted inflammation, replace white bread and pasta with healthier options like whole-grain bread, and sweet potato. But you may want to skip the gluten.

This brings us to Number 3. “Gluten”.

If you have celiac disease or are sensitive to gluten, your body may provoke an innate immune response that can trigger joint pain and other symptoms. A study published in the Oxford Journal of Rheumatology revealed that 41% of participants with rheumatoid arthritis experienced symptom improvement on a gluten-free diet.

If you suspect you have gluten intolerance, eliminate all foods containing gluten for two weeks. Then, observe if your joint pain worsens when you reintroduce it. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

Coming into our Number 2, we have “Char-Broiled And Blackened Foods”.

If you have arthritis, it’s best to avoid high-temperature cooking methods like broiling, frying, and grilling, as they create advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that can exacerbate inflammation and joint pain. This means you should steer clear of foods like grilled meats and fried potatoes.

And at Number 1, we have “Nightshade Vegetables”.

People with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or other joint problems such as gout may want to eliminate nightshade vegetables like tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes, and peppers from their diets. This is because nightshades contain alkaloids that can lead to the accumulation of calcium deposits in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and joints that can cause inflammation and pain.

Now, let’s look at how we can eliminate the root cause of arthritis.

The answer lies in proteolytic enzymes.

Here is the one thing you need to take away from this video: Proteolytic enzymes have powerful anti-inflammatory properties and are essential for a pain-free life.

Proteolytic enzymes, also known as proteases, are a type of systemic enzyme that breaks down proteins into smaller, more digestible units that your body can utilize.

The most important thing that proteolytic enzymes do is to break down excess fibrin present in your circulatory system and connective tissues, including your muscles.

So, the key to stopping your arthritis pain is to get enough proteolytic enzymes.

These enzymes eat away at the fibrin and scar tissue, bringing much-needed oxygen and nutrient-rich blood into your tissues to remove the metabolic waste that is causing you pain and inflammation.

Even though your body produces proteolytic enzymes in your pancreas, their production significantly decreases after the age of 27. So it’s important to get them from food sources or dietary supplements.

Two of the best food sources of proteolytic enzymes are pineapple and papaya. Bromelain (from pineapple) and papain (from papaya) are effective at reducing symptoms of pain, swelling, and joint stiffness in people with arthritis.

I have provided a link to a “Pineapple Joint Elixir“ Recipe below.

Other foods rich in proteolytic enzymes include kiwi fruit, figs, ginger, asparagus, and fermented foods such as sauerkraut, yogurt, kefir, and miso.

Other than fighting inflammation and pain, proteolytic enzymes have other important functions, such as easing sore muscles, speeding up wound healing, regulating blood pressure, boosting the immune system, and killing viruses.

In summary, to fix your arthritis pain, eat more pineapple and papaya. However, food alone, may not boost your enzyme levels high enough to relieve pain.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-clean-your-blood/,Top 12 Foods that Clean Your Blood Naturally,"The bloodstream carries life-sustaining oxygen and nutrients to your organs and tissues. But if your liver and kidneys are not functioning properly, it becomes difficult to eliminate waste and toxins from your blood, and this causes your blood to become toxic.

This can result in a weakened immune system that is unable to effectively fight off infections.

Unfortunately, chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity are rampant, and these can take a toll on the liver and kidneys.

In addition, everyday stressors—such as poor nutrition, exposure to environmental toxins, sleep deprivation, and a sedentary lifestyle—can make your blood sluggish and unable to cleanse itself of toxins and waste.

So, how can you ensure that your liver and kidneys are working at optimal levels to keep your blood running clean?

Today, we look at twelve foods that can cleanse the blood, fortify the liver, and nourish the kidneys.

Whether it’s removing harmful fats from the liver, helping the body flush away toxins, regenerating liver cells, or boosting levels of glutathione, these liver and kidney-friendly foods can ease your toxic burden and promote overall health.

Watch this video until the end to learn about the BEST fruit you can eat for your liver.

Let’s start with a refreshing fruit, Number 12 is “Lemons”.

Not only are fresh lemons and lemon juice packed with the antioxidant vitamin C, but they also increase levels of another powerful antioxidant in the body: glutathione.

Glutathione, often called the “master antioxidant,” reduces inflammation and assists the liver in purging harmful toxins from the body.

One recent study published in Phytotherapy Research concluded that hesperidin – one of the active ingredients found in lemons – can help reduce liver fat deposits and inflammatory markers for those suffering from fatty liver disease. 

Lemons contain citric acid, a natural diuretic that flushes toxins from the kidneys. Furthermore, citrate, a salt found in citric acid, can prevent kidney stones from forming.

The next time you’re using lemons in juices or recipes, consider washing and grating the peels into your dishes for a detoxifying boost.

Next, promote kidney health and efficient digestion with Number 11, “Ginger”.

Enjoy the many benefits of ginger for your kidney and liver health!

Rich in antioxidant compounds such as gingerols, ginger helps ward off type 2 diabetes and therefore protects your kidneys, while at the same time boosting digestion by stimulating bile and gastric secretions.

Ginger may also support your weight loss goals – recent studies suggest that consuming this root helps reduce body fat levels as well as improve insulin resistance.

Fresh or powdered forms can be used in salads or recipes to add a delicious kick – or why not brew up some creamy ginger tea?

Next, this trusted herb can help to regenerate your liver. Number 10 is “Milk Thistle”.

For centuries, natural healers have used milk thistle to cleanse the blood and detoxify the liver. Recent scientific research from around the world has confirmed this ancient wisdom.

Milk thistle’s remarkable resilience against toxins comes from silymarin, an antioxidant flavonoid that not only protects liver cells but may also help them regenerate!

In a review published in the Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Science, researchers credited silymarin with shielding the liver from damage and reducing inflammation.

Other research shows that silymarin helps to boost levels of glutathione and protect mitochondrial cells from oxidative damage.

Integrative healthcare practitioners recommend taking 420-600 milligrams of silymarin plus vitamin E for the best results.

Next, your kidneys will thank you for this root vegetable. Number 9 is “Carrots”.

This brightly-colored root veggie can offer serious therapeutic effects.

A recent study published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis showed that beta-carotene—the orange pigment found in carrots—can not only reduce inflammation but also help repair damaged kidney tubules.

And pectin, a type of soluble fiber in carrots, can decrease creatinine levels. (A high creatinine level may be a sign that the kidneys are not working properly.)

The researchers reported that pectin may be more effective in treating kidney failure than a prescription diuretic. Adding carrots to your diet is a smart move to support kidney detoxification and blood cleansing.

Next, this root vegetable is “nature’s antibiotic”. Number 8 is “Garlic”.

Garlic is believed to purify the blood through its powerful antibacterial and antifungal effects.

This pungent root vegetable contains allicin, a potent antioxidant, which reduces oxidative stress on the liver and kidneys.

Furthermore, studies show that consuming fresh garlic and aged garlic extract boost nitric oxide levels, improving blood circulation. And improved blood flow means lower blood pressure and a reduced risk of damage to the kidneys.

So, go ahead and use fresh garlic to spice up your salads, soups, sauces, marinades, and dips.

Coming up, cleanse your blood and improve digestion with, Number 7. “Artichokes”.

The artichoke is part of the milk thistle family, and unsurprisingly, a powerhouse protector of your liver.

This veggie is loaded with chlorogenic acid and flavonoids, such as luteolin and cynarin which help the liver flush out toxins by promoting bile flow.

A study published in the Journal of Ayurvedic and Herbal Medicine suggested that artichoke leaf extract has powerful liver-protecting properties.

Moving on, improve blood flow with this juice. Number 6 is “Beets”.

Beetroot juice can do wonders for your heart, liver, kidneys, and skin by dilating blood vessels, cleansing the blood, and increasing oxygen levels.

Beets are a powerful detoxifying agent for the liver. They contain a group of phytonutrients called betalains that increase enzymes to support the liver in Phase 2 detoxification. They also enhance the liver’s ability to produce glutathione and superoxide dismutase; these two are powerful antioxidants that protect liver cells from damage.

You can roast beets as a delicious side dish, cook them with carrots or kale, drink beetroot juice, or add beets to salads or smoothies.

Coming up next, detoxify heavy metals with, Number 5. “Cilantro”.

Cilantro or coriander has a reputation as a powerful detoxifying agent for the kidneys.

Many researchers believe that its effectiveness is due to its rich chlorophyll content, which helps to neutralize toxins and reduce kidney damage caused by exposure to heavy metals.

In a study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, researchers found that supplementing with cilantro for one month helped to reduce kidney damage after exposure to lead.

To chelate or bind to heavy metals, such as mercury, aluminum, and cadmium, which have bio-accumulated in the central nervous system and bones for years, it is best to use cilantro in combination with chlorella to completely remove them from the body.

Next, this golden spice is a natural health superstar. Number 4 is “Turmeric”.

Turmeric is well-known for its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and detoxifying effects. Scientists believe that the orange pigment curcumin is the primary source of its healing power.

Studies show that consuming curcumin helps protect the kidneys and liver from the damaging effects of pollutants, especially heavy metals such as mercury.

When using turmeric in recipes, make sure you pair it with plenty of black pepper to greatly increase curcumin’s bioavailability.

Additionally, do not take turmeric with certain medications; to see the list of these medications, click the link below.

Coming into the top 3, scrub your system clean with Number 3. “Apples”.

Apples are rich in polyphenols, or beneficial plant compounds, which activate a process called autophagy: the cleaning out of damaged cells in order to regenerate newer, healthier cells.

In other words, apple polyphenols “scrub away” the unwanted waste in the tissues and blood.

Additionally, apples are rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber, which can help to lower fat and cholesterol levels in the blood.

Also, the highest concentrations of antioxidants are found in the skin, so you will want to enjoy apples without peeling them.

Next, normalize your blood pressure with Number 2 “Cruciferous Vegetables”.

Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, and mustard greens are perfect for nourishing the kidneys and liver due to their high content of sulfur-containing compounds called glucosinolates.

Glucosinolates help protect the liver and kidneys from damage caused by free radicals and toxins.

Additionally, cruciferous vegetables contain indole, a natural compound that has been found to combat fatty liver disease.

Arugula or rocket deserves special mention, as both a leafy green and a cruciferous vegetable.

Arugula is not only rich in toxin-cleansing chlorophyll but also in natural nitrates that, when consumed, are converted into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide dilates the blood vessels, easing blood pressure and protecting the kidneys.

You can use arugula in salads, sandwiches, pasta dishes, sauces, and more.

And at Number 1, we have a blood-purifying superfruit, “Blueberries”.

When it comes to reducing liver and kidney inflammation, blueberries are arguably the best fruit you can eat.

This is because wild blueberries have the highest concentration of anthocyanins, antioxidants that counteract oxidative stress and reduce liver inflammation.

Studies have shown that blueberries can help to reduce liver fat and improve blood sugar and blood pressure.

Furthermore, their high levels of fiber confer cleansing and cholesterol-lowering effects, while their high water content helps with hydration.

For maximum benefit, eat fresh or frozen organic blueberries.

Other than blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, cranberries, currants, and strawberries are all excellent sources of anthocyanins—the deeper and richer the color the better!

Other important ways to ease the toxic burden on your liver and kidneys are drinking lots of water, getting regular exercise and adequate sleep, and eating an anti-inflammatory diet that includes detoxifying foods.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/thyme-essential-oil-kills-cancer/,"Thyme Essential Oil Shows Signs of Killing Lung, Oral and Ovarian Cancer","Studies have found that this essential oil potently kills cancer cells. The essential oil of common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) which is generally known as “oil of thyme” contains 20-54% thymol. Thymol belongs to a naturally occurring class of compounds known as “biocides”. Biocides are substances that can destroy harmful organisms. (Mar 25. 2023)

When thymus is used alongside other biocides, such as carvacrol, it has strong antimicrobial attributes. Scientists tested thyme for its antibacterial activities in vitro toxicology against three human cancer cell lines. What they found is that thyme kills lung cancer cells, oral and ovarian cancer.

Thyme is native to the Mediterranean, and is often used in cooking with olive oil. Oil from the common herb thyme was discovered to kill up to 97% of human lung cancer cells.

Thyme Brings Out The Best of Olive Oil

Recent research has shown that if you mix thyme and olive oil it will enhance the availability of hydroxytyrosol, olive oil’s most potent anti-cancer compound.

Thyme essential oil, has also been used in Ayurvedic and traditional medicine due to its strong antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal (kills Candida) properties.

Also, oncologist researchers at Celal Bayar University in Turkey carried out a study to find what effect Wild Thyme (Thymus serpyllum) might have on breast cancer cells. They looked at the effects of Wild Thyme on cell death and epigenetic events in breast cancer cells. Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression caused by mechanisms that do not involve alterations in DNA sequence.

They reported in the journal Nutrition and Cancer that Wild Thyme caused cell death in the breast cancer cells. The study authors concluded that Wild Thyme “may be a promising candidate in the development of novel therapeutic drugs for breast cancer treatment.”

Fresh thyme also makes a great addition to a healthy diet focused on organic fruits, vegetables and whole foods and can be used as a herb in cooking or simply prepared as a tea.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-trigger-acid-reflux/,Here Are 8 Foods That Trigger Acid Reflux – AVOID,"Today, we look at the worst foods that trigger acid reflux and should be avoided. We also look at the best foods that reduce heartburn and GERD.

Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux occurs when the sphincter muscle at the lower end of your esophagus relaxes when it should not. This allows stomach acid to back up into the esophagus, resulting in heartburn and related symptoms like pain in the chest, difficulty swallowing, and regurgitation of bitter-tasting food.

When the foods you eat trigger or worsen acid reflux, it is due to increased pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which causes it to malfunction and become leaky. There are two ways in which this happens:

One. Bacterial overgrowth causes bloating and puts pressure on the LES.

This starts with low stomach acid – usually measured in people with heartburn and GERD – creating the perfect conditions for bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and small intestine. These bacteria feed on undigested carbohydrates and produce gas that increases pressure in the stomach, causing the LES to malfunction and allow acid to enter the esophagus.

Two. Other factors cause bloating and result in LES malfunction and GERD.

These factors include overeating, obesity, hiatal hernia, pregnancy, reclining after eating, and eating certain trigger foods.

Now that we understand what causes the LES to malfunction, let us look at the foods and drinks that trigger and worsen acid reflux and GERD in people with existing conditions.

Removing these foods usually makes heartburn and other symptoms go away.

It is important to note that these trigger foods do not cause reflux in those who do not suffer from it. However, the wrong combination of food and other factors can cause reflux in anyone.

For example, overeating too late and consuming too much alcohol, or having a fatty meal followed by mint chocolate chip ice cream, can all trigger reflux.

Let’s begin with Number 8. “Fried, Fatty & Processed Foods”.

High-fat foods can contribute to acid reflux. These foods include:

deep-fried food (French fries, onion rings),

full-fat dairy (cheese, cow’s milk),

fatty meats (fatty cuts of beef, lamb, hamburgers, bacon, hotdogs, sausages),

processed snacks (beef jerky, potato chips),

and other fast food (pizza, chicken nuggets),

Fried and fatty foods usually contain high amounts of harmful vegetable oils, artificial trans fats, fructose, and artificial sweeteners, as well as other chemicals. These processed ingredients increase bacterial overgrowth, delay stomach emptying, and worsen reflux symptoms.

Also, fatty foods stimulate the release of a hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes the LES to relax.

Moreover, processed foods, such as white bread and cookies, are high in refined or simple carbs, which contribute to bacterial overgrowth and increased gas output.

A study in 2022 by researchers at Vanderbilt University showed that reducing the consumption of simple carbs can reduce the frequency and severity of heartburn and other GERD symptoms.

Next up, we have Number 7. “Gluten-containing Grains”.

Studies show that consuming gluten-containing grains (wheat, barley, and rye) in starchy foods such as bread and pasta, as well as cereals, can lead to symptoms associated with acid reflux and GERD, especially in people with undiagnosed celiac disease or gluten intolerance.

Some acid reflux sufferers find that once they remove gluten from their diets, their heartburn fades away.

Moving on, we have Number 6. “Mint”.

Avoid spearmint and peppermint, as both are LES-relaxing reflux triggers. This includes anything mint-flavored, such as tea, alcohol, candy, and desserts.

Coming up next, we have Number 5. “Nuts”.

When it comes to nuts, the recommendation for those with reflux is to choose nuts that are lower in fat and not to eat too many. According to one doctor, pistachios and walnuts are far less likely to cause reflux than peanuts, macadamia nuts, or cashew nuts.

And as for almonds, they possess a property that can help reduce reflux symptoms; they are alkaline, not acidic. This may explain why some people report that eating a few raw almonds before or after a meal helps their acid reflux go away.

Are you enjoying the information?  Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

And at Number 4, we have “Acidic Foods and Drinks”.

Reports from heartburn patients show that certain acidic foods and drinks irritate the stomach lining and trigger or exacerbate acid reflux symptoms.

One. Avoid soft drinks or sodas, as they are more acidic than anything found in nature. This acid damages the LES. Furthermore, they are carbonated, thus increasing stomach pressure and causing the valves to open.

Two. Avoid or reduce citrus fruits and juices, such as oranges, limes, and lemons, which are high in citric acid, as they can trigger heartburn symptoms. Instead, go for low-acid, non-citrus fruits such as apples, melons, and pears.

Three. Tomatoes have a lot of citric and malic acid, which can cause heartburn. Fresh tomatoes are less likely to trigger reflux compared to prepared, canned, or bottled tomato products such as ketchup, marinara sauce, and pizza.

Four. Onion and garlic, especially in their raw forms, are common triggers for heartburn. These two vegetables are hard to digest because they contain fructans. So they stay in your stomach longer and make your heartburn and burping worse. You can use parsley, dill, or basil instead to give your food flavor.

Five. Also, avoid vinegar such as apple cider vinegar, as these contain acetic acid and are likely to cause heartburn.

Coming into our top 3, Number 3 is “Spicy Foods”.

People with acid reflux, esophageal issues, and ulcers often experience heartburn more quickly and intensely when they eat spicy foods.

That’s because spices like chili powder, curry, and hot peppers contain capsaicin, which slows digestion and delays stomach emptying through adverse effects on vagal nerve function, which controls the gastrointestinal tract.

At the same time, these spices are often combined with other reflux-triggering foods like onions, garlic, and fatty meats. To cook with herbs that do not trigger reflux, use rosemary, basil, parsley, oregano, cumin, and turmeric.

Moving on, we have Number 2. “Caffeine and Chocolate”.

Chocolate is probably the single most common trigger for people with acid reflux (GERD and LPR). That’s because it contains theobromine, caffeine, and fat – three ingredients that relax the LES.

Also, eating milk and dark chocolate can cause a surge of serotonin, which makes your LES relax and gastric contents rise.

Next, we have coffee. For some people with reflux, drinking coffee can trigger heartburn, but this is not because of its acidity. Soda, orange juice, and wine are more acidic than coffee. Coffee triggers reflux in 2 ways:

One. Some people are sensitive to coffee beans; for these people, both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee are equally bad.

Two. For anyone else, drinking a high volume of caffeinated coffee, such as a pot of coffee before lunch, is going to open up any LES.

For most people with reflux, drinking one or two cups of caffeinated coffee per day will not cause any symptoms.

If you want a strong kick in the morning, black tea is better than coffee if you have acid reflux. However, you should limit yourself to one or two cups.

Finally, soft drinks and energy drinks have levels of caffeine and acid high enough to increase the risk of reflux.

And at Number 1, we have “Alcohol”.

This may be the number one reflux trigger, and it is dose-related.

Alcohol or ethanol is a powerful trigger for all types of acid reflux: GERD, LPR, Respiratory Reflux, and Silent Reflux. The mechanism is that alcohol directly relaxes the LES, and the more you drink, the more likely you are to have acid reflux. If you must drink, just have one.

In general, wine is better than beer because there is no carbonation. Red wine is also better than whites such as Chardonnay and Champagne, as they are more acidic and carbonated. Additionally, avoid any mixed drinks or cocktails with citrus juice, seltzer, and soda, as this can cause a severe reaction.

And if you must drink liquor, gin, tequila, and non-grain vodkas have the least amount of acid.

Lastly, stay away from any alcoholic drink made with peppermint (peppermint white Russian), chocolate (mudslide), or coffee (Irish coffee).

To recap, the reflux-trigger foods that affect a lot of people are fatty meats, fried food, fast food, high-fat cheese, processed snacks, chili powder and hot peppers, chocolate, mint, some nuts, onions, tomatoes, garlic, coffee, citrus fruits (including juice), apple cider vinegar, energy drinks, soda, and alcohol.

To this list, add any other trigger foods that are unique to you; pay close attention to what you eat!

Now, let’s look at the foods that are “reflux-friendly”. These foods help reduce heartburn and GERD and promote healing in the lining of the stomach and esophagus.

A low-carb diet can work wonders for people with GERD or other digestive disorders. In one study of 144 obese women with GERD, a low-carb diet helped all patients completely resolve their GERD symptoms within weeks, and they discontinued their medications.

In a low-carb diet, the focus is on protein-rich whole foods and vegetables. This includes foods such as:

Fatty fish such as trout and salmon (preferably wild-caught).

Animal protein such as lean chicken, beef, and pork (preferably grass-fed and grass-finished).

Pasture-raised eggs.

Fruits, such as bananas, berries, apples, pears, melons, and peaches, in moderation.

Non-starchy vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus; and starchy vegetables, such as beans, peas, butternut squash, and sweet potatoes. These are usually cooked for easier digestion.

For snacking, these choices are reflux-friendly: raw almonds, melons such as cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, banana, apple, carrots, plain popcorn, avocado toast, and baked potatoes.

For people with reflux, the best beverage choices are water, tea (no mint), and low-fat milk such as almond, rice, and soy milk.

To improve your gut microbiome, add sauerkraut, or fermented pickles. These fermented foods have probiotic effects and help reduce acid reflux.

Also consider bone broth, as it is rich in collagen, gelatin, glutamine, and proline–all of which help to heal the gut.

In addition, herbal teas can soothe the lining of the stomach and esophagus and promote better digestion. Herbal teas that provide acid reflux relief include camomile, slippery elm, marshmallow root, licorice, and ginger tea.

Also, you can eat bitter foods to improve digestion and stomach acid. Some reflux-friendly bitter foods are arugula, dill, dandelion greens, Brussels sprouts, Jerusalem artichokes, kale, turmeric, and ginger.

Eating an anti-inflammatory diet can prevent and reduce acid reflux. Get your free anti-inflammatory diet plan by clicking the link below.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/the-tea-that-lowers-blood-pressure/,You Won’t BELIEVE What This Tea Can Do To Your Blood Pressure And How Effective It Is!,"If you’re concerned about your heart, then you should consider drinking hibiscus tea. Turns out, hibiscus tea is just as effective as hypertension drugs when it comes to lowering your blood pressure. And it does so without any negative side-effects such as, lack of strength, impotence, fatal liver damage and so on. (updated March 12, 2023)

Historically, folk medicine has used hibiscus for the treatment of high blood pressure, liver diseases, and fevers. The tea’s benefits were first confirmed in 1996, when researchers in Nigeria showed that hibiscus flowers reduced blood pressure in laboratory animals. (1)

Then in 2008, researchers in Iran showed the same benefit in people (2). Another study published in 2010, showed that anthocyanins and other antioxidants present in hibiscus tea worked together to protect blood vessels from damage and becoming narrow. (3)

It’s recommended to drink three cups daily to get the full benefits of the hibiscus.

How Does Hibiscus Lower Blood Pressure?

It has diuretic properties, it opens the arteries, and it appears to act as a natural angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which means it slows the release of hormones that constrict blood vessels. (4)

This is exactly what the prescription combo of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide does, but to a milder degree and without side effects.

In addition, hibiscus boosts immune function and provides valuable antioxidants.

Hibiscus Tea Recipe

Here’s a simple recipe for a delicious and refreshing hibiscus tea.

Ingredients:

3 cups of water
3 tbsp dried or 4-5 tbsp fresh hibiscus flowers
1 cinnamon stick
1 tbsp raw honey
juice of 1 orange

Instructions:

Bring water to a boil.
Add the cinnamon stick and hibiscus.
Let it steep for 15-20 minutes. (a minimum of 6-10 minutes is required for the tea to be effective)
Strain the tea.
Add the honey.

Enjoy!

Warning

While hibiscus tea is good at reducing blood pressure it’s also highly acidic, hence the reason why it’s so sour. (5) In fact, if you drink any kind of tea (citrus, green, dark, herbal), make sure to swish your mouth with water to remove the acid from your teeth. (6) Another more effective method would be to use coconut oil instead of just plain water.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 12, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-accupressure-points-for-stress-relief/,5 Acupressure Points You Can Do By Yourself To Relieve Stress And Anxiety In Under 3 Minutes,"It’s normal to get stressed out every once in a while, but being stressed all the time can become a major health problem. (updated Mar 8 2023)

Our bodies experience stress to help us survive in the face of danger. In fact, stress activates the sympathetic nervous system to prioritize blood flow to the muscles and the production of energy to help you run away from what’s threatening your life.

Unfortunately, as humans evolved the stresses they face every day have evolved too. Instead of worrying about predators, people worry about deadlines and responsibilities. Since theses factors of life never really go away, it can lead some people to feel chronically stressed (1).

Over time, this can lead to insomnia, digestive problems, headaches, diminished sexual desire and low energy.

Other symptoms of stress include (2,3):

Heart disease
High blood pressure
High blood sugar
Reproductive disorder
Diabetes
Depression
Anxiety disorder
Weight gain, frequent and severe illness
Memory and concentration impairment
Upper Respiratory Diseases
Speed progression of HIV
Inflammation
Impaired immune system
Tissue Damage
How To Manage Stress

It’s no surprise that eating right, meditating and exercising can help you manage stress, but sometimes you just need an extra boost.

Acupressure is one of the easiest methods you can use to relieve stress quickly and non-invasively. It’s been a staple of good health for the last 5 thousand years.

The concept is to target pressure points, that lie along meridians, or channels, in your body. These meridians are believed to connect specific organs or networks of organs and ensure that life force or «qi » flows through them.

When chi is blocked, illness occurs (4).

While modern medicine hasn’t been able to explain why it works, the treatment, like acupuncture, is still recommended as a complimentary treatment. It’s used to reduce stress, improve energy levels, relieve pain, and lessen other symptoms of cancer and help manage treatment (5).

How To Use Acupressure

Before beginning treatment, breathe deeply and stretch your hands and body in the area of the pressure point you’re about to tackle. You can also massage the skin lightly before applying pressure.

Use your thumb, fingers, knuckles or palms to apply pressure to the spot of your choice, gradually increasing the strength of your hold over 3 minutes. Try to find the best balance between relief and pain and breathe deeply throughout.

Here are 5 points that can relieve anxiety and stress.

1. Nei Guan

Place three fingers on your forearm, keeping your ring finger parallel to your wrist. Slide your finger to the middle of your forearm and keep your index finger where it lies. This is where your pressure point lies. You can either apply pressure with your index or use your thumb. After 2-3 minutes, gently move your finger in a circular motion for as long ad you need to let stress melt away.

2. Union Valley

Place your hand in front of your face down, and find the webbing between your thumb and index finger. Spread out your left hand and place your right thumb right where the skin of your webbing meets the muscles of your hand. Reach your index around and grip the underside of your hand in the same spot. You should be pressing the same spot on both sides of your hand, breathing deeply to exhale all the tension in your body. Repeat on both hands for best results.

3. Shoulder Well

Looking the mirror to find the spot right between your neck and shoulder. Use your index to apply pressure directly in this spot and repeat on both sides to get Qi flowing through your whole body. It may make your feel tense at first, but just close your eyes and keep breathing to loosen up your body.

4. Central Treasury

If you’re having trouble managing your breath, work the pressure points in your chest. Start by placing your finger in the spot where your shoulder blade meets your chest muscles, about halfway between the armpit and your neck. Apply moderate pressure on one side of your body at a time.

5. Heavenly Pillar

To relieve insomnia, a stiff neck and exhaustion, bend your neck forward and reach back to bring both thumbs to the back of your neck. Inch your thumb towards your head until you find the base of your skull. Next, locate your spine and find the long muscles on either side. Use both thumbs on these muscles, applying one on each side. Lengthen your spine so that you’re sitting up straight and apply pressure on these spots",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 8, 2023"

According to the American Cancer Association “Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States when men and women are considered separately, and the second leading cause when both sexes are combined.”

These scary statistics are mainly due to the fact that colon and rectal cancer both have subtle and often overlooked symptoms. This means that by the time you know you have it, the cancer is so advanced that it’s hard to treat.

Most Commonly Overlooked Signs Of Colorectal Cancer
1. Cramps

Perhaps one of the most difficult symptoms to diagnose, cramps are the first sign that something may be up. Unfortunately, it’s also a symptom of many other less serious conditions, like excess gas and poor digestion (2).

Like the odd cramp isn’t a cause for concern, chronic, intense, and long-lasting pain accompanied with any other symptom below should be reported to your general practitioner as soon as possible.

2. Fatigue

Again, this symptom isn’t straight forward, making it harder to pin to colorectal cancer. Fatigue can be caused by poor diet, lack of sleep, excess or lack of physical activity, and medication (3).

It may also be a sign of more serious conditions like anemia, acute liver failure, diabetes, heart disease, hypothyroidism, and much more. However, being constantly tired, even when you eat and sleep well and have a clean bill of health, may be a sign of colorectal cancer.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/control-blood-pressure-naturally/,7 Key Nutrients to Control Blood Pressure Naturally,"High blood pressure, also referred to as hypertension, is often called a “silent killer”. This is because, most people with high blood pressure, won’t have any symptoms, and feel perfectly fine. And one in three of them are not even aware that they have it.

However, blood pressure that is consistently high damages the arteries. This causes your heart and blood vessels to work harder, yet more inefficiently, in circulating oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your body. If left untreated, this dramatically increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and vision loss.

Now, about 90-95% of cases of hypertension are not caused by a medical condition, but rather the result of genetics and lifestyle factors such as obesity, stress, insulin resistance, consuming excessive sugar and salt, and leading a sedentary lifestyle. This is called essential hypertension.

One important factor that contributes to hypertension is nutrient deficiencies that make it difficult to manage your blood pressure. Often, these nutrient deficiencies can be overlooked by your doctor.

Today, we look at 7 key nutrients that control blood pressure. Luckily, getting enough of these nutrients often helps to reverse high blood pressure.

Watch this important video until the end, then click the link below to learn about our recommended solution for removing high blood pressure permanently.

Let’s begin with Number 7. “Potassium”.

Studies consistently show that a potassium deficiency can raise blood pressure, and correcting low potassium levels can markedly lower blood pressure in those with existing hypertension.

One of the ways potassium helps to keep your blood pressure normal is by balancing out the effects of sodium. The more potassium foods you eat, the more sodium is excreted through urine. When extra fluid leaves the body, blood pressure goes down.

Also, potassium is important for muscle function. This includes the relaxation of the walls of the blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and prevents muscle cramping.

And potassium is needed to keep electrical signals moving through the nervous system and the heart. This protects against an irregular heartbeat.

To fight hypertension, you should aim to get at least 4,700 mg of potassium per day.

Fruits and vegetables are the best sources of potassium. Some excellent choices to include in your diet are potatoes, bananas, legumes, mushrooms, and spinach. One strategy to significantly increase your potassium levels is to replace grains with root vegetables like potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, turnips, and pumpkin throughout the week.

However, if you take a diuretic for high blood pressure, heart failure, or edema, food alone may not be sufficient to keep your potassium levels normal. This is because these medications cause potassium to be excreted in the urine. In such cases, your doctor may prescribe potassium supplements.

Coming up next, Number 6 is “Magnesium”.

Research has shown that a magnesium deficiency is strongly linked to elevated blood pressure, regardless of whether you are overweight or not. Other studies have shown that correcting low magnesium by taking 365-450 mg of magnesium per day for three months can significantly reduce high blood pressure.

So, how does magnesium help lower blood pressure?

First, magnesium blocks calcium from entering the smooth muscle cells of the heart and arteries, thus resulting in blood vessel dilation. Because of this, magnesium is sometimes called “nature’s calcium channel blocker”.

Second, magnesium lowers blood pressure by increasing nitric oxide, a compound that dilates and relaxes blood vessels, thus improving blood flow. For a list of nutrients that increase nitric oxide, see our video “7 vitamins to increase blood flow and circulation”.

It has been estimated that 50-75% of U.S. adults are not getting enough magnesium. So, it is easy to see how increasing magnesium-rich foods, such as pumpkin seeds, almonds, cashews, and spinach, can make it easier to manage blood pressure.

To fight hypertension, you should aim to get at least 310 to 420 mg of magnesium per day.

Since magnesium is involved in over 300 bodily processes, such as energy production and bone development, it is super important to get enough of this mineral.

And, just like with potassium, the use of diuretics can cause an excessive loss of magnesium through urine. So supplementing may be required. Consider magnesium glycinate or magnesium malate, as they are easier on the digestive system and are easily assimilated into the body.

Now, here’s something important to know:

Because magnesium helps transport calcium and potassium ions in and out of cells, a lack of magnesium can lead to low levels of calcium and potassium.

Next up is Number 5, “Calcium”.

Calcium influences blood pressure by regulating the proper narrowing and widening of blood vessels.

A review of 23 studies found that increasing calcium intake decreases both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a small amount in people with normal blood pressure. These studies are mostly based on supplement intake of 1,000-1,500 mg per day.

Now, most people are not getting enough calcium from their diet. So, it is recommended to increase your intake of calcium from food sources, including dairy (such as yogurt, milk, cheese), fish (such as salmon, canned sardines), and dark leafy greens (such as kale, bok choy, collard greens).

Other than its role in regulating blood pressure, calcium is needed to build bones and teeth and is required for proper nerve transmission and muscle contraction.

To effectively absorb calcium, your body needs Vitamin D.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

This leads us to Number 4. “Vitamin D”.

Vitamin D is both a nutrient that we eat and a hormone that our bodies make. For your body to absorb calcium from food, optimal levels of vitamin D are needed. Without enough vitamin D, only 10-15% of calcium can be absorbed by the intestines.

In a review of 35 studies published in 2014, researchers found that not getting enough Vitamin D can lead to high blood pressure later in life. The same review also showed that people with higher levels of Vitamin D had lower diastolic and systolic blood pressures, and were 8% less likely to develop hypertension.

The best way to get enough Vitamin D is to spend 10-30 minutes in midday sunlight several times a week. The best food sources of vitamin D are fatty fish such as salmon and sardines, cod liver oil, egg yolks, mushrooms, and fortified foods such as milk and cereals.

If you are supplementing, taking 2000 I.U of vitamin D3 per day, should be enough in most cases.

Now, vitamins D2 and D3 are considered biologically inactive until they are converted into their active form, calcitriol. For this conversion to happen, the enzymes present in your liver and kidneys require sufficient amounts of magnesium to draw upon.

This means that if you have low levels of magnesium, your body will not be able to make full use of the vitamin D you are receiving. This is yet another reason to ensure that you have optimal levels of magnesium.

Coming into the top 3, Number 3 is “Vitamin K2”.

A 2017 study published in Hypertension found that the combination of low vitamin D and low vitamin K was associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Your body needs vitamin K2, or menaquinone, to activate the proteins that keep calcium in the bones and out of the arteries. Therefore, vitamin K2 prevents calcium from sticking to the walls of the arteries, where it would otherwise form calcified plaques, thus limiting blood supply and increasing blood pressure.

Essentially, vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, while vitamin K2 routes the calcium away from your heart, kidneys, and arteries and sends it to the bones and teeth. For this reason, it is important to take vitamin K2 MK7 and vitamin D3 together when supplementing.

There aren’t many foods that are high in vitamin K2. These include sauerkraut, natto, miso, eel, beef liver, egg yolks, grass-fed butter and cheese, and pastured eggs. If you don’t eat a lot of these foods, you may want to supplement with 100-300 mcg of vitamin K2 MK7 per day.

Next up, we have Number 2, “CoQ10”.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is an antioxidant produced by your body. Studies have shown that CoQ10 can lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension. One study in China found that supplementing with CoQ10 countered the effects of a high-salt diet and kept blood pressure healthy.

CoQ10 affects blood pressure through a mechanism related to nitric oxide, protecting the blood vessels and enhancing blood flow, much in the same way as beetroot juice does.

Several factors can deplete CoQ10 levels over time. Long-term use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs is the main culprit. Aging and some disease states, such as after a heart attack, fibromyalgia, and depression, also cause CoQ10 depletion.

You can get CoQ10 from foods such as fatty fish, grass-fed beef, chicken, organ meats, such as heart, liver, lungs, Non-GMO soybeans, such as tofu, kefir, and soy protein, and nuts and seeds, such as pistachios, sesame seeds, and peanuts.

Supplementing with 100-200 mg of a high-absorption CoQ10 per day is an option, especially if you use a statin drug to lower cholesterol.

And at Number 1, we have “Omega-3 Fatty acids”.

Studies have revealed that consuming ample amounts of omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce blood lipid levels, LDL cholesterol, inflammation, and high blood pressure.

The Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, are best sourced from fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and herring. Additionally, alpha-linolenic acid – a plant-based Omega 3 – is found in high amounts in flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts.

The cardiovascular benefits of Omega-3s are related to the ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3. An ideal ratio is 1:1; however, today’s average diet contains a ratio up to 16:1. This is largely due to the consumption of oxidized Omega-6 in refined vegetable oils, such as soybean and corn oil, that are used in processed foods. Studies show that improving the ratio to just 4:1 is associated with a 70% decrease in cardiovascular-related death.

When supplementing, take 2-3 grams of a high-quality purified fish oil or krill oil per day.

There you have it: the seven nutrients you need to stay on top of to lower your blood pressure. Essentially, you have just been given seven reasons to include more fish, nuts, and vegetables in your weekly diet.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/improve-your-gut-microbiome/,Top 8 Ways to Improve Your Gut Microbiome,"If you want to live long and well, your number one priority must be focusing on your gut health. Because modern-day research shows that almost every aspect of your health and longevity—from a sharp brain and strong immune system to a healthy heart, lungs, liver, even muscles and skin—is at least in part dependent on it!

Today, we’ll discuss 8 ways you can improve your gut microbiome and change your life.

First, let’s understand how the gut microbiome can impact your overall health.

Your gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microbes that live in your gastrointestinal tract. These include not only bacteria but fungi, parasites, and viruses.

Now, when your gut is healthy, there is a diverse population with the right balance of species. But when beneficial bacteria are scarce or nonexistent, the harmful bacteria take over and throw your microbiome out of balance.

This is called dysbiosis, and it promotes inflammation, prevents nutrient absorption, and makes the gut lining “leaky”.

Now, if you suffer from bloating, constipation, excess gas, and other gut issues, you are well aware that your gut is where digestion occurs.

But did you know your gut also has a “second brain”?

This “second brain” is a network of 100 million nerve cells that line your gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the esophagus down to the rectum.

So, your gut and your brain can “talk to each other” in both directions via the vagus nerve.

If your gut is in distress, it could either be caused by, OR, the result of anxiety, stress, or depression.

Also, consider that 70-80% of your body’s immune cells are in your gut lining. And your gut lining is like a “security fence” designed to keep “foreign invaders” out of the bloodstream.

Unfortunately, when this physical barrier becomes leaky due to dysbiosis, it can spread inflammation throughout the body, causing joint problems, brain fog, food sensitivities, fatigue, skin issues, and respiratory issues.

Furthermore, scientists now believe, that not having enough beneficial bacteria in the gut, may cause autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, and even neurological conditions, like cognitive decline.

So, the bottom line is, gut health is important because it equals overall health and vibrant longevity!

And you should do everything you can, to improve your gut microbiome.

Make sure you watch till the end, to learn about the 1 fatty acid, that is absolutely crucial to a long healthy life.

Let’s begin with Number 8. “Avoid things that destroy the gut microbiome”.

First, you want to limit or eliminate the things that damage the gut microbiome.

These include highly processed foods, refined carbohydrates, sugar, artificial sweeteners, vegetable oils, gluten, some non-organic foods, GMO foods, excessive alcohol consumption, antibiotics, birth control pills, and overly sterile environments.

Highly-processed foods support pathogens and bacteria that produce endotoxins. These unhealthy gut species increase blood sugar, oxidized cholesterol, and inflammation levels.

Some non-organic foods and “all GMO foods” are damaging, as they contain high levels of the herbicide glyphosate. The World Health Organization (WHO) has labeled glyphosate as a probable carcinogen, meaning it is capable of causing cancer. Furthermore, glyphosate contributes to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria.

We need to mention sugar, as it is hard to maintain a healthy microbiome if you regularly consume large amounts of sugar and sugary foods. This includes processed sugar and sugar from sources such as refined grains and fruits.

That’s because fast-digesting sugar starves beneficial bacteria and feeds pathogenic bacteria and fungi, such as Candida, leading to an overgrowth.

See our video “5 Foods That Cause Gut Inflammation” after you finish watching this video.

One often overlooked source of chemicals is tap water. Depending on where you live, tap water can contain chlorine, fluoride, and aluminum, which alter the composition of your gut microbiome.

Next, avoid chemicals that disrupt your hormones in personal and household products such as plastic bottles, cookware, detergents, fragrances, cosmetics, and other hidden sources.

Also, watch out for exposure to mycotoxins produced by mold in damp and poorly ventilated areas, and even in your food such as grains, coffee beans, nuts, chocolate, and wine.

These chemicals and toxins disrupt the gut microbiome and increase the risk of infection.

Next, we have Number 7. “Balance Stomach Acid”.

If you have low stomach acid, this should be the most important thing for you to address.

This is because low stomach acid makes it difficult for your body to get nutrients from food.

When you have low stomach acid, food stays undigested for longer and this leads to an overgrowth of harmful microbes, resulting in dysbiosis.

So, how do you know you have low stomach acid?

The common symptoms include:

gas and belching, acid reflux,

bloating and cramping,

chronic bad breath, bad body odor,

feeling tired after meals,

feeling full yet still hungry,

weak fingernails, anemia,

and frequent nausea.

You can test for low stomach acid by using baking soda, as explained in our video “5 Ways to Stop Bloating Fast”. Or have your doctor perform a diagnostic test.

Now, for healthy digestion, stomach acid must range from 1.5 to 2.2 pH.

Here are THREE ways to stimulate your body to produce hydrochloric acid (HCL):

One. Chew on a small slice of ginger before a meal, get the juice out of it, and then throw away the remaining pulp.

Two. Add raw apple cider vinegar to your meat and veggies. Or take it with water before meals.

Three. You can supplement with Betaine HCL. This can make a huge difference.

Take it halfway through the meal or at the end, but NOT before the meal.

Also, do NOT take Betaine HCL with NSAIDs.

If you plan to take Betaine HCL for acid reflux, see our video, “3 ways to Stop Acid reflux Naturally”.

When you balance your stomach acid, it can help with food sensitivities.

This is because many food sensitivities result from undigested proteins leaking out of the gut and triggering an immune response.

Are you enjoying the information? 

Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

Moving on, we have Number 6. “Prebiotics, Probiotics, Fermented Foods”.

You may have been told to eat more fiber to prevent constipation.

Fiber is a prebiotic that feeds your beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, or probiotics. In other words, prebiotics is food for the probiotics.

Prebiotics help to curb the growth of harmful bacteria. And also move waste through your digestive tract in a timely manner.

Some excellent high-fiber foods include beans, peas, edamame, lentils, chia seeds, oatmeal, artichokes, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, and leafy green vegetables.

Many fruits are also high in fiber but also contain lots of sugar. High-fiber fruits that are relatively low in sugar include strawberries, blackberries, grapefruits, avocados, green apples, and oranges.

Now, once you are eating lots of fiber, you can add fermented probiotic foods to your diet.

Probiotic foods improve the good bacteria, so you have a flourishing and diverse microbiome. Some fermented foods that provide a diverse set of bacteria are sauerkraut, kimchi, natto, miso, kefir, gluten-free tempeh, plain yogurt, cottage cheese, and some aged cheeses with live cultures.

When probiotics feed on prebiotics they produce a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate. Butyrate is super important because it is the main fuel for the cells that line the gut, known as “colonocytes”.

Butyrate helps these cells perform their job of nourishing and sealing the gut lining so that it can keep out foreign invaders. Researchers have found that people who live beyond 100 years have higher levels of butyrate and bacteria that produce butyrate.

Next, we have Number 5. “Heal the Intestinal Barrier”.

Healing a leaky gut is one of the most important things you can do to improve your overall health.

Leaky gut occurs when waste products and toxins, food proteins, and bacteria seep through the gut lining and enter the bloodstream due to the “gut microbiome destroyers” we mentioned earlier. This causes your immune system to “misfire” and destroy healthy tissues.

See our video “5 foods that cause inflammation” for a detailed discussion of leaky gut.

Supplements that help repair your intestinal barrier include L-glutamine, vitamin D, vitamin A, and zinc carnosine. Also, sipping on bone broth throughout the day can help.

Moving on, we have Number 4. “Herbal Remedies.”

Herbs that help heal the gut barrier include slippery elm, aloe vera, deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), and medicinal mushrooms such as Turkey Tail, Reishi, Lion’s mane, and Chaga.

To destroy harmful bacteria in your gut, you can add antimicrobial herbs to your meals.

These herbs include rosemary, oregano, basil, thyme, turmeric, and raw garlic.

Cooked garlic is good, but raw garlic is ten times more effective.

To alleviate gut symptoms such as bloating, constipation, abdominal pain, and heartburn, drink herbal teas such as chamomile, ginger, wormwood, lemon balm, fennel, and peppermint.

In the top 3, we have Number 3. “Eat Real Food.”

By now, you know that gut health equals immune health and overall health.

When you have gut dysbiosis, this damages the absorption structures in your intestines, called villi, thus making it more difficult for your body to get the nutrients it needs.

Now, if you have ongoing digestive issues, such as excess gas, bloating, acid reflux, and constipation, or if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system is in overdrive and burning through nutrients.

Therefore, it is important to replenish your nutrients by eating antioxidant-rich, real food so that your body can contain inflammation.

You’ll be surprised, that simply eating anti-inflammatory real food, can often be a game-changer for your gut health.

Here’s what real food means:

Food that comes in its whole form, not in a package.

Think of a grass-fed steak with buttered broccoli and sweet potato, NOT a deli-meat sandwich with a bag of chips.

Food that is nutrient dense.

Organ meats and shellfish have the most nutrients, followed by other meats, eggs, seafood, and dairy. Then come properly prepared vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds. Nutrient-poor choices include refined grains and virtually all processed foods.

Food that is properly prepared.

For grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, this means soaking and sprouting before eating, to break down phytates and lectins.

For leafy greens such as spinach and kale, this means boiling and steaming to reduce oxalates.

For dairy, this means full-fat, pasture-raised, and fermented dairy.

For bread containing gluten, this means slow-rising, sourdough-leavened varieties.

Food that is properly sourced.

Try to source produce that is organic or from local farms.

Eat meat, dairy, and eggs from pasture-raised animals that are free to move in the sun and eat what they are supposed to eat; for example, cows eating grass instead of corn.

Seafood should be wild-caught whenever possible.

Grains should be non-GMO to ensure they are free of pesticides. 

To get your FREE anti-inflammatory diet plan, click the link below at the end of this video.

Next, we have Number 2, “Exercise, Sleep, Manage Stress”.

Stress can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as cramping, bloating, inflammation, and loss of appetite. You may have experienced this yourself.

It can also worsen existing gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), peptic ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

When you are stressed, your digestive secretions can slow down or even stop.

Studies show that high levels of stress can negatively alter the composition of the gut microbiome and increase intestinal “leakage”.

Eventually, this can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases such as Graves’ Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

So, learning to manage your stress is key to maintaining a healthy gut.

Moving your body every day through fun exercises and gentle physical activities is an effective way to reduce stress.

In human studies, exercise has been linked with increases in the number of beneficial microbial species, as well as enriching microbial diversity.

Specifically, there was an increase in the gut microbes that help with the production of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), butyrate, we mentioned earlier.

This important nutrient helps to repair the gut lining, reduce inflammation, reduce the risk of bowel diseases, combat obesity and diabetes, and protect the brain.

Other ways to keep stress at bay are meditation, journaling, taking a bath, talking with a friend, deep breathing exercises, and yoga.

Getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep every night is one of the best ways to beat daily stress and improve your gut microbiome.

It is only during sleep, when the body is in fasting mode, that certain species of microbes can clean out the gut and the rest of the body. These microbes also trigger processes to repair cells, thereby preventing disease.

And at Number 1, we have “Diagnostic Testing”.

Do you want to know what your gut health looks like? Testing can help you figure this out.

If you want to get a clear picture of your microbiome makeup, get a stool test or a microbiome mapping (GI-MAP) test.

To figure out your food intolerances or allergies, you can do a food sensitivity test, also known as an Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Blood Test.

And a breath test can determine if Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is an issue.

Testing is best done by a health professional who can also interpret your results for you.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/increase-oxygen-in-blood/,Top 6 Ways to Increase Oxygen in Blood Naturally,"Today, we look at what happens when there is not enough oxygen in your body. We’ll also discuss what causes this problem, and how you can improve it by eating certain foods and making lifestyle changes.

Oxygen is needed to create energy, so every cell in your body can function. Without oxygen, life is short. You get oxygen from breathing in air, but there is more to it than just breathing.

First, you need to be able to get the air from your lungs into the blood. You might take this for granted, but many people have had difficulty with this in the past three years.

Then, once the oxygen is in the blood, you need to have a protein called hemoglobin in your red blood cells to carry the oxygen around the body.

Now, if a person has anemia, it becomes hard for oxygen to reach all the organs and tissues.

And one of the organs most affected is your brain. That’s because your brain cells use at least 20% of the body’s oxygen supply.

Now, unlike your muscles, your brain cannot store energy; it needs a steady flow of nutrients and oxygen to work well. So, if your brain is deficient in oxygen, it can cause problems like sleep apnea, poor judgment, lack of focus, poor memory, mood swings, restlessness, depression, and low energy.

Now, to increase oxygen in your body, it’s important to understand how the oxygen you breathe turns into energy for your cells.

So, the mitochondria in your cells take oxygen from the air and glucose and fat from the food you eat to make energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.

The mitochondria are the “power plants” in your cells that produce ATP. And ATP is the energy source that fuels cell function in every tissue–your muscles, skin, brain, you name it–so they can be healthy and strong.

So, what happens when your cells cannot get enough oxygen to make ATP?

When tissues of your body do not get enough oxygen, this condition is called hypoxia.

A hypoxic state is a sure indicator of disease. People with respiratory problems and poor blood circulation tend to have hypoxia. They may feel weak, tired, and sleepy because of this.

A hypoxic state can cause abnormal cell growth, and cell death, and increases free radicals and inflammation. If hypoxia is untreated, it can lead to migraines, heart disease, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, autoimmune disorders, autism, and cancer.

Next, how can you know if you have low oxygen levels?

Many people think that they can measure oxygen levels directly, with a pulse oximeter that they clip to their finger. However, what this device measures, is the percentage of hemoglobin that is loaded with oxygen.

So, be aware that this device only provides an indirect estimate of oxygen levels.

Having said that, the normal blood oxygen saturation or level is usually between 95-100% as measured by a pulse oximeter.

However, what is “normal” can vary, and depends on factors such as altitude and overall health.
In general, if the oxygen levels in your blood are below 90%, it is considered low and you will need to see a doctor.

Your doctor can perform an arterial blood gas test (ABG). This test measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood, as well as the acidity.

Next, let’s look at 9 factors that cause hypoxia, other than air pollution.

1. “Anemia”.

People with anemia have symptoms such as shortness of breath, headache, confusion, restlessness, and rapid heart rate.

2. “Lung and Nasal Problems.”

Your lungs need to breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide to keep your oxygen levels normal. If you have asthma, COPD, pneumonia, lung scarring, or any other respiratory disease that affects your lungs, it can cause hypoxia.

Nasal blockages and excess mucus in the lungs, can also make it hard to breathe. An effective way to clean out mucus from your lungs is to use an OPEP or “Oscillating Positive Expiratory Pressure” device. Click the link below to see our recommended OPEP device.

3. “Obstructive Sleep Apnea”.

Sleep apnea is a dangerous condition that can lower oxygen levels, since individuals may stop breathing several times during the night.

4. “High Altitude”.

There is less oxygen in the air at high altitudes, so people who live in elevated locations often have more red blood cells and hemoglobin.

5. “Heart Disease”.

Children and adults who are born with heart defects may have low oxygen levels.

6. “Poor Blood Circulation”.

Some people have low oxygen levels even though they have healthy blood cells, hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation. Their hypoxia could be caused by poor blood flow. See our video, “7 vitamins to increase blood flow and circulation”.

7. “Low Blood Pressure”.

Severely low blood pressure can reduce the body’s oxygen levels. This can cause damage to the heart and brain.

8. “Chronic Stress”.

Stress can trigger your body’s fight-or-flight response and lead to lower oxygen levels in the blood. People who are stressed and anxious tend to experience shortness of breath.

9. “Chronic Inflammation”.

Cytokines and other pro-inflammatory messengers can reduce the amount of oxygen that reaches your tissues from capillaries.
All the diseases we mentioned earlier—such as heart disease, COPD, sleep apnea, and asthma—involve chronic inflammation.

Next, what are the benefits of getting enough oxygen?

Studies have shown that oxygen helps:
Increase energy levels and improve strength and endurance.
Maintain good cognitive function, memory, and concentration.
Detox your blood and prevent lactic acid build-up.
Reduce stress, calm anxiety, and improve sleep quality.
Promote healthy blood vessels and prevent hypertension and heart disease.
Strengthen the immune system and promote wound healing.
Delay aging and maintain a youthful appearance.

Next, let’s look at 6 ways to increase oxygen levels.
Let’s begin with Number 6. “Exercise and Breathe Fresh Air.”

Improving oxygen levels can be as simple as opening your windows or going for a short walk in nature.
Getting quality sleep and regular physical activity helps to increase your oxygen intake and reduce stress.
Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening exercises can benefit your lungs.

Next is Number 5. “Practise Deep Breathing.”

The average person breathes 12-18 times per minute. When you take short, shallow breaths, your body automatically goes into a “fight-or-flight” mode as a result of being stressed.

For optimal breathing, take long, deep breaths at a rate of 6 times per minute. Doing this will ease your body into a restful and healing mode.

Doctors recommend diaphragm breathing, or deep belly breathing, to open your airways and increase the amount of oxygen in your body.

Breathe in through your nose till the air fills up in your belly. Then breathe out through your mouth 2 or 3 times longer than you breathe in. Practise this for at least 5 to 10 minutes every day.

At Number 4, we have “Lung Cleaning Device.”

If you suffer from a lung condition, such as asthma or COPD, you may have mucus blocking your airways. This makes it hard to breathe, even when you try hard. You may feel that your lungs simply won’t fill up with air. And no matter how hard you cough, you can’t get the mucus out of your lungs. The feeling is worse than uncomfortable–it’s terrifying.

To clean out your lungs and open your airways, try an OPEP device like the one we recommend below.

Getting into the top 3, Number 3 is “Quit Smoking.”

When you quit smoking, oxygen levels in your blood increase. That’s because cigarettes contain carbon monoxide, which binds to your hemoglobin and reduces oxygen in your bloodstream. Also, your lungs can work up to 30% better when you quit smoking.

Next, at Number 2, we have “Foods and Supplements that Increase Oxygen.”

Let’s look at the key nutrients that help to increase oxygen levels in the blood and tissues.

Iron is needed to make oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in red blood cells. About 70% of the body’s iron is found in hemoglobin. The top iron-rich foods are liver, red meat, and seafood.

Vitamin B12 and folate help your body produce red blood cells. These B vitamins are found in shellfish like oysters and mussels, pasture-raised eggs and dairy, fatty fish, and liver.

Copper and zinc are also involved in making hemoglobin and red blood cells. You can get these minerals from shellfish, meat, and seeds.

Vitamin C helps the body make collagen, a protein that keeps blood vessels healthy, so oxygen can be delivered to the tissues. Some vitamin C foods are bell peppers, kiwifruit, strawberries, oranges, and broccoli.

Vitamin E protects cells from the stress and damage caused by free radicals, and helps improve lung function. The top foods rich in vitamin E are almonds, sunflower seeds, hazelnuts, spinach, and sweet potatoes.

Magnesium is essential not just for producing but also sustaining healthy ATP levels and cellular energy production. Some magnesium-rich foods are dark leafy greens, nuts and seeds, avocados, whole grains, and dark chocolate.

Beetroot juice is rich in nitrates, which your body converts into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide relaxes and dilates blood vessels, improves blood flow, and increases the delivery of oxygen to the cells. Other nitrate-rich foods include spinach, carrots, arugula, cabbage, garlic, broccoli, kale, and celery.

Creatine is an amino acid that is stored in the muscles and provides energy for muscle contractions. It can help improve your oxygen uptake and performance during exercise. Some good sources of creatine are red meat, salmon, herring, tuna, and sardines.

CoQ10 or Coenzyme Q10 is a molecule found in the mitochondria of cells where it helps to generate ATP energy. Good sources of CoQ10 are organ meats, oily fish, meat, soybeans, broccoli, and pistachios.

Finally, herbs such as hawthorn berry, ginkgo biloba, garlic and ginger help improve circulation and increase oxygen uptake.

And at Number 1, we have “Anti-inflammatory Oxygen Therapy.”

Atmospheric air is comprised of roughly 21% oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or HBOT, involves breathing in 100% oxygen at 1.5 to 3 times the normal atmospheric pressure inside an airtight chamber.

Using oxygen at a higher pressure allows 20 times more oxygen to be taken up by the bloodstream and transferred to injured organs and tissues.

This speeds up healing and recovery time.

Any condition that causes inflammation in the body can benefit from HBOT because oxygen is a natural antibiotic.

Doctors use HBOT to treat different conditions. These include wounds that are difficult to heal and infections in which tissue is oxygen-starved.

HBOT is also used for treating cancer, autism, multiple sclerosis, and fibromyalgia.

A “mini” version of HBOT, called a mild HBOT, can be purchased for home use.

Mild HBOT uses around 95% oxygen at 1.3 to 1.4 atmospheric pressure and has been known to produce significant results at little to no risk.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/,5 Ways To Reduce Inflammation Naturally,"Today, we look at the major causes of inflammation in the body, and how we can reduce inflammation with vitamins and lifestyle changes.

Inflammation begins in the gut when certain factors cause an imbalance in gut flora or dysbiosis.

These factors include things like a poor diet, toxins in the environment, and stress.

Now, because the gut microbiome is not in an optimal state, the mitochondria in your cells are not getting the nutrients and oxygen needed to convert food into energy.

You can think of mitochondria as the “power plants” in your cells.

Now, to convert energy from food into energy the cells can use, your mitochondria need to make an “energy converter” molecule called ATP.

ATP is the reason that every cell in your body–muscles, skin, brain–you name it–can successfully convert energy from food to complete all cellular tasks.

So your tissues can be healthy and strong.

The problem with chronic inflammation is that it hinders the energy production of mitochondria and ATP.

So your cells do not have enough energy to perform the body’s processes.

This immediately puts your body at a higher risk of any disease.

Now, as inflammation persists, and cells cannot perform at peak capacity, our immune system weakens, and this often leads to diseases like autoimmunity and cancer.

Autoimmunity is when your immune system mistakes your healthy cells as foreign and attacks them.

Unfortunately, many people find out that they have chronic inflammation, ONLY when they get an autoimmune disease, such as Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or Type 1 diabetes.

As you can see, it’s important to reduce inflammation in the body, and this is exactly what we’ll be talking about in the rest of this video.

So, what are the symptoms of chronic inflammation?

Low-grade chronic inflammation is systemic and can last for months or years, damaging the tissues and causing autoimmune reactions.

Some of the symptoms of chronic inflammation include:

Memory loss and cognitive decline.

Increased cardiovascular risk.

Abnormal growth of healthy cells.

Weakened digestive function.

Loss of muscle tone.

Insulin resistance and weight gain.

Accelerated skin aging.

Joint pain and loss of mobility.

Next, what causes chronic inflammation?

Before we get into the strategies for reducing inflammation, let’s look at 7 major factors, that trigger your immune system to over-react, and cause massive inflammation.

Eating inflammatory foods and foods that are hard to digest and cause reactions.

Leaky Gut Syndrome that causes gas, bloating, constipation, food allergies, autoimmunity, and reduced nutrient absorption.

Fluctuating blood sugar that causes insulin resistance and elevated blood sugar.

Chronic stress that increases cortisol and activates your body’s “fight or flight” response, causing your digestive process to slow down or even stop.

Poor sleep habits that make your sugar levels spike, and cortisol levels increase.

Long-term exposure to toxins in the food we eat, the air we breathe, the products we use, and the water we drink, that overloads your body’s natural detoxification system.

Chronic infections from viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites like hepatitis, herpes, Epstein-Barr virus, and Candida, that are left unresolved.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

Next, let’s look at 5 ways you can reduce inflammation in the body.
Let’s begin with, Number 5. “Stay well-hydrated”.

As mentioned earlier, we are exposed to toxins every day, even though we may not realize it.

One simple way to make sure your body can effectively detox is by staying well-hydrated. When your body has enough water, oxygen and nutrients can move easily through the blood to all cells in the body. And cells need adequate water to carry out their functions.

Drinking lots of water helps to clear the bowels.It keeps toxins moving through the liver and kidneys, and eliminates them via sweating.

In general, the better hydrated you are, the less inflammation you have in your body.

One important tip, is to make sure your water does not contain contaminants such as chlorine, fluoride, and heavy metals.

Coming up next, is Number 4. “Get your body moving”.

To lower inflammation, you have to keep your body moving. Movement includes any kind of activity you do at low intensity, such as walking and stretching.

This helps to keep your organ systems flowing, including the bowel, urinary tract, sweat glands, circulatory system, lymphatic, and even muscles.

When you become stagnant in any of these areas, it can cause a lot of inflammation-related problems.


Exercising daily is an effective way to stimulate your body’s lymphatic system and improve blood flow. It is important to deliver fresh blood to your tissues to reduce inflammation.


This helps to flush away metabolic waste and provide nutrients to inflamed tissues. Avoid sitting for extended amounts of time.

One powerful way to improve the circulation of blood and lymph is rebounding. Other ways to increase blood circulation include taking cold showers, sweating it out in a sauna, and getting a massage.


Regular movement and exercise can help reduce stress and improve mental clarity.

At Number 3, we have “Reduce stress and improve sleep”.

Chronic stress with poor sleep is a surefire recipe to make inflammation worse.


One of the best ways to counteract the stressors of daily life is to get the best possible sleep. When you get enough sleep, your brain flushes out toxins and your body heals itself.


One of these toxins is beta-amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease.

Optimizing sleep has a lot to do with regulating your circadian rhythm, or your body’s natural sleep-wake cycle.


Some things you can do to get quality sleep are:
Avoid artificial light 1-2 hours before bed. You can wear blue light-blocking glasses.
Be in bed by 10 PM if possible; an hour of sleep before midnight is worth two after. That’s because your melatonin production peaks well before midnight.
Make your room completely dark.
Only take caffeine in the morning.
Have a before-bedtime routine.
Practice gratitude to relax your mind.
Go outdoors and get morning sunlight.
Take a magnesium supplement to calm your brain for sleep.

Next, Number 2 is “Heal your gut with an anti-inflammatory diet”.

Gut inflammation causes digestive tract disorders, autoimmune conditions, and brain fog. So, the key to healing your gut is to eat an anti-inflammatory diet.


First, remove refined sugar and grains from your diet as much as possible. These are easily broken down into sugar and should be limited to help balance blood sugar.


Then, get rid of over-processed vegetable oils like canola, safflower, and soy as these are highly inflammatory.


Cook with healthy fats like coconut oil, grass-fed butter, MCT oils, olive oil, and avocado oil. Include other healthy fats like coconut milk, avocados, nuts and seeds, and pasture-raised meats and eggs.


For a detailed discussion of pro-inflammatory foods to avoid and their healthy substitutes, see our video, “5 foods that cause gut inflammation”.

Next, add other antioxidant-rich foods to support a healthy inflammatory response. These include fatty fish, turmeric, berries, leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, mushrooms, and bone broth.

And don’t forget carminative herbs to soothe your digestive tract, such as arugula, basil, black pepper, cilantro, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, peppermint, rosemary, sage, fennel, and thyme.


Would you like to get a FREE anti-inflammatory meal plan? Click the link below.

And at Number 1, “Use key nutrients to support healthy inflammation”.

To reduce inflammation, consider supplementing your diet with 5 key nutrients.

1. Vitamin D.

Vitamin D is a powerful nutrient that helps to control and coordinate the immune system. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system has a difficult time recognizing the difference between its own cells and foreign invaders.


Vitamin D helps the immune system figure out which cells are harmful and which are not. This reduces inflammation in the body.

Now, a lot of people are deficient in vitamin D. That’s because of sunscreen use, and not getting enough sun exposure. And not eating organ meats, such as liver, and certain fish to get their vitamin D.

For most people, taking 2,000 IU per day of vitamin D3 should be enough to meet their needs. This should be taken together with vitamin K2.

2. Omega 3 fatty acids.

The diets of most people today are comprised of highly processed foods sky-high in Omega 6 fats and deficient in Omega 3. An elevated omega 6 to omega 3 ratio is strongly associated with higher levels of inflammation seen in autoimmune conditions.


We need to focus on DHA and EPA omega 3’s because they can help a lot with autoimmunity. The best sources for these fatty acids are wild Alaskan sockeye salmon, sardines, and anchovies.


They have high levels of omega 3 without the heavy metal concerns of other fish. Also, they are excellent sources of vitamin D.


To supplement, take 2 to 5 grams of a high-quality, purified fish oil that has been third-party tested for mercury. Or go for a krill oil supplement.

3. Probiotics.

If you have symptoms of gut inflammation, such as bloating, indigestion, low energy, and brain fog, the right probiotics can help.


Try fermented probiotic foods such as sauerkraut, natto, kefir, or yogurt. See if you are reactive to them and if they help with the bacterial imbalance in your gut.


Or, choose a broad-spectrum probiotic supplement that can deliver live probiotics directly to your gut. Now, the best probiotic supplement should include prebiotics to support the growth of probiotics while helping to crowd out undesirable bacteria.


Or take prebiotic foods such as dandelion greens, leeks, onions, garlic, asparagus, bananas, chicory root, and artichokes. See our recommended probiotic supplement in our free anti inflammatory diet plan.

4. Turmeric.

Curcumin is one of the most well-studied anti-inflammatory compounds. This compound, derived from the Indian root spice turmeric, holds immense healing power because of its ability to reduce inflammation.


Curcumin has been shown to alleviate autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.


You can turmeric to your food and drinks. Or choose a high-absorption liposomal supplement, to get more turmeric into your system. See our recommended turmeric supplement below.

5. Zinc.

A weakened immune system promotes chronic inflammation and autoimmune conditions.


Zinc is a critical nutrient to support a healthy immune system. This mineral is important for supporting the thymus gland and the formation of T helper cells. T helper cells activate other immune cells to fight infections.


To prevent zinc deficiency, consume rich sources of zinc such as oysters, pumpkin seeds, liver, and pasture-raised lamb and beef.


To supplement, take 20 to 40mg of zinc glycinate per day to help relieve autoimmunity symptoms.

Next, how can you test for inflammation?

The most common way to measure inflammation is by doing a blood test for C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). This protein is a marker that shows inflammation.

Doctors also measure homocysteine levels to find out if there is chronic inflammation. Finally, doctors test for HbA1c, a measurement of blood sugar, to assess damage to red blood cells.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/drinks-to-clear-sinuses-and-relieve-cold-and-flu/,3 Easy Drink Recipes That Clear Sinuses and Relieve Cold Symptoms!,"Cold and flu season is unavoidable and most people get infected at least once before spring comes around. In fact, colds are the #1 reason for missed work or school (1). (Updated Jan 17, 2023)

Colds are contagious during the first two to three days, so it’s best to rest and avoid contact with the public. Because it is a viral infection, antibiotics are not effective in treating a cold.(2)

As for the flu, it’s best to treat the illness with fluids and rest (3). Drinking hot teas and taking steam baths can help loosen up phlegm and relieve throat pain.

Here are just a few go-to teas that will quickly help you recover from the common cold:

1. Hot Pineapple Tea

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-bloating-fast/,The #1 Way To Stop Bloating Fast,"Today, we’ll look at 5 major causes of stomach bloating, and what you can do to stop bloating fast.

Bloating happens when your gastrointestinal tract gets filled with gas or air. This makes your stomach distended, swollen, painful, and tight. Now, you might not think twice about bloating, if it only happens once in a while. But if you regularly have a bloated stomach, this could be a sign that your gut has an overgrowth of bacteria or yeast.

Abdominal bloating can lead to digestive disorders, allergies, autoimmune dysfunction, and in some rare cases, cancer. Some of the common triggers of bloating include a poor diet, increased stress, exposure to toxins, and certain prescription drugs.

Watch this video till the end, because we’ll reveal the #1 way to get immediate relief from bloating.

Now, to get rid of bloating forever, you’ll have to target the root cause of bloating and eliminate it. Let’s get into the 5 major causes of bloating and their natural solutions.

We start with root cause Number 5. “Low stomach acid levels”.

Having a bloated stomach may be a warning sign that you have low stomach acid levels. Now, when your stomach doesn’t make enough hydrochloric acid, the food can stay undigested in your stomach for too long.

This allows bacteria to grow. And bad bacteria like H. pylori can cause cramping, belching, heartburn, and bloating. As bacteria overgrows, it further prevents your stomach from making acid.

Now, bad bacteria have been found to release toxins that can damage the stomach lining and cause ulcers. And increase gastric inflammation that can lead to stomach cancer.

If you have low stomach acid, you will experience other symptoms such as iron-deficiency anemia, nausea, being tired a lot, not liking certain foods, smelling bad, and having undigested food in your stool.

So, what causes low stomach acid? The causes include a poor diet, eating too quickly, antibiotic use, H. pylori infection, and stress.

So, how can you tell if you have low stomach acid? One way is to test with baking soda.

Mix 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda with 4 to 6 ounces of cold water.

As soon as you wake up in the morning, drink this mix.

Do not eat or drink anything else before you drink it.

Time how long it takes you to burp or belch after drinking the baking soda.

If it takes longer than 5 minutes, your stomach probably isn’t making enough acid.

To stop your bloating, you can use Betaine HCL to improve stomach acid. The exact way to do this is explained in our video, “3 ways to stop acid reflux“.

Next, root cause number 4 is “Poor gallbladder health”.

The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that is located in the upper-right abdominal area, just below the liver. This tiny organ’s main job is to release enzymes that help break down dietary fat. To assist the enzymes in digesting fat, the gallbladder releases bile.

Bile is a greenish-brown liquid. It is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder until you eat. It acts as an “emulsifier”. This means it helps to mix fat and water so your small intestine can absorb fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E, and K.

Bile also helps your body to break down sugar and get rid of waste products from the liver. If the tube that carries bile from the gallbladder to the small intestine is blocked, you may experience upper abdominal pain, nausea, gas, and bloating after eating a high-fat meal.

High-fat foods include coconut oil, butter, avocado, eggs, fatty meat, and nuts. If your bloating is caused by poor gallbladder health, you can try adding bitter herbs to your diet.

Bitter herbs help to cleanse the liver and improve gallbladder function. These include ginger, arugula, endive, cilantro, turmeric, dandelion, cumin, fennel, mint, milk thistle, yarrow, leeks, and parsley.

Next, root cause Number 3. “Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth”.

Normally, your small intestine doesn’t have a lot of bacteria. When you have too many bacteria in your small intestine that shouldn’t be there, this is called Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth or SIBO.

Bad bacteria in the small intestine produce methane gas and sulfur. This can lead to abdominal bloating, cramping, gas, diarrhea, heartburn, food sensitivities, leaky gut syndrome, and body-wide inflammation.

Many things can cause an imbalance in gut bacteria. Common causes of SIBO include taking antibiotics, steroids, or acid-blocking drugs (PPIs). Or damage and blockages in your gut, such as scarring or diverticula.

One simple way to test for SIBO is to eat a bowl of steamed broccoli and observe how you feel over the next 3 hours.

If you experience bloating, gas, cramping, acid reflux, or other digestive symptoms, it means there are too many bacteria and your pancreas is not producing the necessary enzymes to break down food in your gut.

The best treatment for bloating caused by SIBO is to eat a low-FODMAP diet. High FODMAP foods, such as wheat, lentils, beans, dairy, onions, garlic, artichokes, cabbage, and cauliflower tend to increase SIBO symptoms, including abdominal bloating.

Coming up, root cause number 2 is “Candida Overgrowth”.

If your bloated stomach is often accompanied by mood swings, cognitive impairment, sugar cravings, and fatigue, your bloating may be due to Candida overgrowth. 

Candida is a type of yeast that lives in your gut flora alongside other microbes. Under normal circumstances, candida should only exist in small amounts to aid in digestion and nutrient absorption. 

However, factors like too much sugar, an inflammatory diet, and toxic overload can cause yeast to multiply beyond what is deemed healthy.

When this happens, Candida can reach your bloodstream and secrete more than 70 different toxins into your entire body. This can lead to liver dysfunction, overactive immune response, and even cancer growth. 

Common symptoms that warn of Candida overgrowth may include the following: Athlete’s foot, toenail fungus, skin rashes, mood swings, UTIs, brain fog, autoimmune diseases, seasonal allergies, and low energy.

To get rid of bloating caused by Candida, you need to first control the Candida population and then repair the gut lining.

Some of the anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory foods that are strong candida killers include coconut oil, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, ginger, garlic, cloves, cinnamon, lemon, wild-caught salmon, and cruciferous vegetables.

To repair your gut lining, see our video, “5 foods that cause gut inflammation“.

And, the number 1 root cause is “Food sensitivities”.

Abdominal bloating may be one of the first signs of food sensitivity or intolerance. Other symptoms associated with food sensitivities are often unique to each individual.

Keeping a journal of everything you eat, while you go on an elimination diet, can help you figure out your food sensitivities. The major food allergens that cause bloating are dairy, wheat, corn, eggs, gluten, soy, shellfish, and peanuts.

Each time you eat foods that cause you to bloat, you’re unknowingly contributing to inflammation in your gut, which can lead to skin rashes and autoimmune diseases. Eating inflammatory foods can cause an imbalance of bacteria like Candida, which can trigger leaky gut syndrome.

To start an elimination diet to figure out what is causing your bloating, take out the following foods from your diet for 2 weeks:

Vegetable oils, gluten, dairy, refined sugar, corn, soy, eggs, grains, shellfish, tree nuts, legumes, and nightshade vegetables.

After two weeks of not eating these foods, start to add them back into your diet one at a time.

Try a new food for two or three days. See if you have any symptoms. If you have symptoms, stop eating the new food.

In general, stop eating highly inflammatory foods like gluten, refined sugar, and vegetable oils.

Now, let’s talk about the #1 way to get immediate, short-term relief from bloating. 

The best way to reduce gas and bloating is by ingesting something called “activated charcoal”.

“Activated” means the charcoal has been treated with oxygen at very high temperatures to make it more porous.The extra spaces in the charcoal trap gas molecules, which reduces the amount of gas that causes bloating.

Just like with gas, activated charcoal “locks away” heavy metals, chemicals, and other toxins in the tiny spaces, and passes them quickly through the digestive system.

That is why doctors use activated charcoal in poisoning or drug overdose emergencies to prevent the body from absorbing harmful substances.

Studies have found that activated charcoal can effectively reduce symptoms of stomach bloating, cramps, flatulence, and diarrhea.

So, when should you take activated charcoal? Activated charcoal should be taken on an empty stomach, with a large glass of water.

One suggestion is to take it 2 hours away from meals, supplements, and medications. That’s because activated charcoal also absorbs food nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.

For gas and bloating, you can try 500 to 1,000 mg per day. Be aware, there may be side effects, such as a black tongue, black stools, and constipation.

Activated charcoal should be taken on an “as-needed” basis and is not a long-term solution.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"January 14, 2023"

It’s not just full of bacteria and faecal matter, it can also harbor unhealthy mold. In fact, mold loves warm, damp, and humid conditions, where it spreads easily and can cause major respiratory problems, such as asthma (1,2). This is especially true if you’re not cleaning your shower enough. (Updated Jan 11, 2023)

Common symptoms of household mold are : 

Nasal stuffiness

Most people treat their home with bleach to kill off mold, especially on bathroom grout, where soap scum creates a spore-friendly environment. However, these chemicals are so toxic that it’s recommended to use protective clothing, eye wear and use it in a well-ventilated space. Breathing fumes from bleach can cause light headedness and nausea.

Luckily, there are lots of natural alternatives that you can use to clean your home while killing mold and harmful bacteria.

How To Make An All-natural Grout Cleaner

This easy recipe is all your need. Plus, it only requires a few minutes to make!

Ingredients:

1 teaspoon of liquid dish soap
1/2 cup of baking soda
1/4 cup of hydrogen peroxide

Instructions: Combine all the ingredients in a small squeeze top bottle, like a clean ketchup bottle.

The hydrogen peroxide will whiten and clean the stains and tiles naturally while the baking soda acts as a scrub to remove soap scum between the tiles and stubborn stains.

How To Use:

Mild stains: Apply the mix on a soft wet sponge and gently scrub the tiles and bathroom areas with it. Rinse with water immediately.

Harsh stains: Apply the mixture on the grout and tiles and leave it on for 5-10 minutes. After that,  scrub and wipe stains away and rinse.

Maintenance: To prevent mold and gunk from accumulating on grout, mix water and vinegar in a ratio 1:1. Next, pour it in a spray bottle next to the shower and spray down the grout 2-3 times a week.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-vitamin-deficiency/,20 Signs of Vitamin Deficiency You Need to Know,"Vitamin deficiencies are alarmingly common, even in developed countries like the United States. So, how are you supposed to know you’re lacking in essential nutrients, other than by getting tested at the doctor’s office?

Today, we look at 20 signs of vitamin deficiency. Some of these signs are surprising, so stick around till the end.

First, let’s look at the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.

Number 20. Dry Eyes.

A lack of vitamin A can cause problems with your eyesight; a well-known one is dry eyes.

Vitamin A is essential for the health of the cornea, the clear outer layer at the front of the eye which allows light to enter.

It helps to make tears, which keeps the eye lubricated and comfortable.

When the body is deficient in vitamin A, the conjunctiva can dry out.

The conjunctiva is the thin membrane covering the white of the eye, which helps to lubricate the eyes.

When there are not enough tears or mucus, the cornea can become abnormally dry or inflamed.

Number 19. Night Blindness.

One of the early signs of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness-the inability of the eye to adjust to the dark.

The underlying cause of night blindness is the lack of a vitamin A-rich substance called rhodopsin in the retina.

Rhodopsin is a light-sensitive protein that absorbs low light levels when we enter a dark environment, allowing us to distinguish shapes, objects, and movements in dim lighting.

Low levels of vitamin A hinder the production of rhodopsin, which ultimately impairs a person’s ability to see in the dark.

Number 18. Anemia.

You may be surprised to find out that low levels of vitamin A can be a root cause of anemia. That’s because people with vitamin A deficiency tend to have low iron status, which can lead to anemia. Normally, vitamin A helps the body absorb iron to make new red blood cells.

Without vitamin A, the ability of the body to produce iron-rich red blood cells decreases dramatically. A 2013 study published in the journal Nutrients found that vitamin A supplements can both prevent iron deficiency anemia and reverse it.

Luckily, it’s easy to correct vitamin A deficiency through your diet. There are two main food sources.

Plants with beta-carotene, which converts to vitamin A in the body.

These are the yellow, red, and green fruits and vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, kale, and cantaloupe.

And animal-based foods with retinol, the active form of vitamin A. These include liver, salmon, mackerel, milk, cheese, and egg yolks.

Next, let’s explore the signs of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Number 17. Mouth Ulcers.

An interesting sign of vitamin B12 deficiency is mouth ulcers, otherwise known as canker sores.

This happens because lower levels of B12 can cause the body’s oral mucosa-the tissue that lines your inner mouth-to become weaker and less able to protect itself from bacteria and other invading agents.

The vitamin B-mouth ulcer connection was proven in 2009 when Israeli doctors gave subjects a nightly dose of vitamin B12 and found that it prevented canker sores.

Number 16. Dizziness.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is an often overlooked cause of dizziness.

One common cause of B12 deficiency is pernicious anemia. In pernicious anemia, the intestines cannot absorb B12 properly, so your body cannot produce enough red blood cells. As a result, you have a low red blood cell count and less oxygen circulates to your brain and other parts of your body. 

Vitamin B12 deficiency itself ALSO causes anemia which results in dizziness, shortness of breath, and difficulty walking.

In addition, not having enough vitamin B12 causes problems with your nervous system, including feeling off-balance, pins and needles, and blurry vision, which all contribute to dizziness.

Number 15. Heart Palpitations.

Does your heart sometimes feel like it’s about to burst out of your chest? Anemia brought on by a vitamin B12 deficiency can cause this scary experience. This is because your blood pressure drops and your heart rate increases significantly, and this gives rise to palpitation episodes.

Number 14. Skin Inflammation.

Besides B12, you should also pay attention to your levels of riboflavin – or its other name: vitamin B2. A deficiency in vitamin B2 can cause inflammation of the skin like a rash or dermatitis. Severe cases show up as cracks in the corners of the mouth and a swollen, red tongue. 

If you are on any kind of restrictive diet or have a digestive issue like celiac disease, then it is vital to pay extra close attention to this subtle warning sign.

Fortunately, all the symptoms we’ve mentioned can be counteracted by increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins B12 and B2 or through supplements.

These include beef, animal liver, shellfish, fish, meat, eggs, milk, nutritional yeast, and B12-fortified foods.

Next, let’s discuss the symptoms of Vitamin C deficiency.

Number 13. Wrinkles.

Too little vitamin C will increase signs of aging, such as wrinkles. That’s because vitamin C helps produce collagen, the protein that keeps your skin elastic and youthful.

So what can you do if your vitamin C levels are low? Just by increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables such as citrus fruits, bell peppers, broccoli, kale, and spinach, you could see a dramatic effect on your skin.

Number 12. Broken Blood Vessels.

A lack of vitamin C not only makes wrinkles more visible but can also cause broken blood vessels on the skin. Also known as spider veins, these small, dilated blood vessels appear close to the surface of the skin and are usually red, purple, or blue.

Eating vitamin C-rich foods can prevent spider veins, but cannot make them go away.

Number 11. Swollen Gums.

Vitamin C deficiency often shows up in the mouth in the form of red, swollen, and irritated gums. If your gums feel especially sensitive, try eating foods that contain vitamin C.

Now, let’s explore the warning signs of vitamin D deficiency.

Number 10. Sleep Issues.

Vitamin D doesn’t just help our bones—it’s also essential for a good night’s sleep.

Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to sleeping problems, such as shorter hours in bed and restless nights.

It can also increase inflammation of the nose and tonsils, which can cause snoring or obstructive sleep apnea.

Recent research has found that those with a vitamin D deficiency have an astounding 50% higher risk of sleep disturbances. To avoid these issues, make sure to get plenty of sun exposure or take a vitamin D supplement.

Number 9. Hair Loss.

One surprising sign of a vitamin D deficiency is hair loss. This is because vitamin D is involved in the production of keratin, a protein that makes up your hair.

When there isn’t enough vitamin D to stimulate your hair follicles, new hair growth can be stunted.

Number 8. Mood Changes.

If you have a vitamin D deficiency, you may notice changes in your mood, such as feeling down or tired or experiencing signs of depression.

That’s because Vitamin D helps maintain levels of serotonin—better known as the ‘happiness hormone’—within our brains.

Many scientists believe that depression may be caused by low levels of serotonin in the brain.

Number 7. Slow-Healing Wounds.

If you find that it’s taking your body a long time to heal scrapes, cuts, and other skin wounds, this could be a symptom of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is essential for proper recovery. It helps regulate cell growth—so getting enough is necessary for forming new healthy skin cells in injured areas.

Moving on, let’s examine the telltale symptoms of a vitamin E deficiency.

Number 6. Balance Issues.

Vitamin E deficiencies are uncommon, but they can occur in people with cystic fibrosis, Crohn’s disease, and celiac disease. A common symptom of a vitamin E deficiency is “balance problems”.

If you’re falling more often than usual and you think you might be deficient in vitamin E, it’s time to get your levels checked.

Number 5. Nerve Pain.

Nerve pain, which is often described as burning, stabbing, or shooting pain, can be caused by a vitamin E deficiency. Studies show that vitamin E injections can help to reduce neuropathic pain.

This is because vitamin E protects the fatty sheaths around our nerve cells; and when we don’t have enough, these sheaths can become damaged.

Number 4. Muscle Pain.

It may come as a surprise, but vitamin E plays an important role in maintaining our muscles. A 2013 study published in the International Journal of Preventive Medicine found that people who took 400 IU of Vitamin E every day had less muscle damage.

So you should pay extra attention if you are not very active, but your muscles are weak and sore.

You can prevent vitamin E deficiency, by increasing your intake of foods like sunflower seeds, avocado, spinach, broccoli, almonds, and peanuts. However, skip “vegetable oils” as these are highly processed. See our video on foods that cause gut inflammation.

Next, let’s get into the signs and symptoms, of a vitamin K deficiency.

Number 3. Clotting Issues.

Vitamin K is important for hemostasis, or blood clotting.

The body needs vitamin K to produce proteins for blood clotting, so that wounds can stop bleeding and heal.

People who are living with absorption issues such as cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and short bowel syndrome should pay extra close attention to how they clot, since they are at increased risk for vitamin K deficiency.

Number 2. Easy Bruising.

Do you bruise like a peach? If you bruise at the slightest bump, you should consider getting bloodwork done. Easy bruising may be a sign that there is not enough vitamin K circulating in your bloodstream.

Number 1. Blood in the Stool.

Spotting blood in your bowel movements is almost always a cause for concern. And this could be a symptom of excessive bleeding caused by vitamin K deficiency. No matter what the cause is, it’s worth getting checked out by a doctor.

Both vitamin K1 and K2 foods support normal blood clotting, so it’s important to get enough of these two vitamins.

Vitamin K1 foods include green leafy vegetables such as collard and turnip greens, kale, spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and lettuce.

And vitamin K2 foods include natto, sauerkraut, pastured egg yolks, and some cheeses.

While the causes of each vitamin deficiency are different, they almost always involve insufficient intake, poor absorption, underlying health concerns, and medications.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/remove-toxins-from-your-body-with-3-days-cleanse/,"Remove All Toxins From The Body In 3 Days (Prevent Cancer, Excess Fat and Water Retention!)","If you’re feeling tired or sluggish, it may be time to cleanse and detox your body. Things like stress, poor diet, inactivity and environmental pollutants can build-up in your body over time and leave you with low energy and frequent bouts of illness. (Updated jan 3, 2023)

Toxic build-up can even lead to inflammation and obesity. Every year or so, it’s important to do a full body detox to clear your digestive tract and lymph nodes and get your body back into optimal shape!

Before The Cleanse…

In the days leading up to your cleanse, stop consuming dairy products. Dairy is slowly digested and contain unwanted antibiotics and hormones.

Recombinant bovine somatotropin, is a popular artificial growth hormone that increases milk production and is illegal in Canada and many European countries but is commonly used in the USA (1).

Cut Back On The Meat

It’s also a good idea to completely restrict or at least reduce your consumption of meat, poultry and fish during the cleanse.

USDA researchers have found that eating 2 ounces of chicken per day—the equivalent of a third to a half of a boneless breast—exposes a consumer to 3 to 5 micrograms of inorganic arsenic, the element’s most toxic form (2).

Daily exposures to lower levels of arsenic have been associated with skin, respiratory and bladder cancers.

Meat, dairy and fish also contain dioxin, a highly toxic and carcinogenic compound which can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage to the immune system, and can interfere with hormones (3).

Nearly 95 percent of your dioxin exposure comes in the concentrated form of meat, fish, and dairy products, because when you eat animal products, the dioxin that animals have built up in their bodies  (through environmental exposure and contamination of their feed) is absorbed into your own (4).

The night before your cleanse, drink a cup of herbal laxatives to flush out your intestines to give your body a fresh start.

Make sure that you have whole food, vegetarian options for your meals to come. You should not be eating any processed foods, sugar, fish, meat of any kind or dairy throughout your cleanse. Go to the next page…",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"January 3, 2023"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-cause-gut-inflammation/,Top 5 Foods that cause Gut Inflammation – Avoid!,"Today we talk about the foods that cause gut inflammation and how you can reduce the symptoms and heal your gut.

Now, the symptoms of gut inflammation go beyond the bloating, gas, “stuck poop”, digestive discomfort, or irregular bowel movements you may have experienced.

Millions of people suffer from autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis.

All of these have a lot to do with gut inflammation.

An autoimmune disease happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks your body.

Did you know, 80% of your immune cells are in your gut?

When we talk about the gut, we’re really focused on the intestines-even though the gastrointestinal tract goes from the mouth all the way down to the rear.

Now, because your gut is closely tied to your digestive, nervous, and immune systems, inflammation that goes on in your gut can affect your entire body, including your immune, brain, mental, and skin health, energy levels, and overall wellness.

So, that’s why it’s important to reduce gut inflammation and keep your gut healthy.

Now, the inflammation we’re talking about is NOT acute inflammation.

Acute inflammation is when your body responds when you are injured, have an allergy, or get sick, and it goes away after you recover.

Like when you fall off your bike and bruise your knee.

Or when you have seasonal allergies and you start sneezing.

The inflammation that concerns us is chronic inflammation, which is when your body experiences triggers all the time and constantly reacts with inflammation.

This chronic inflammation is the root cause of many major chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

So, when we talk about gut inflammation, it means your intestines are inflamed all the time.

So, the next question is, how does gut inflammation come about?
There are two ways that inflammation can happen in the gut.
The first way is when your microbiome gets out of balance.

Now, your microbiome comprises bacteria, viruses, and fungi that inhabit your gut. These microbes are either helpful or harmful.

When there are too few good guys, too many bad guys, or a mixture of both, an imbalance or “dysbiosis” happens.

The disease-causing bad guys are called pathogens and they form colonies called biofilms.

Now, when your body lacks the good guys or probiotics, because of poor food choices, the pathogens overgrow and release inflammation-promoting substances.

These biofilms, also make it hard for your intestines to absorb vitamins and fats that help put out inflammation.

So, the second way that gut inflammation happens is when the epithelium or single layer of cells that make up your intestinal lining becomes permeable or “leaky”.

When this happens, large molecules from the gastrointestinal tract enter your bloodstream.

Now, this is NOT supposed to happen, so your immune system tags these molecules for destruction and sparks a chain reaction of inflammation.

Usually, the permeability of your gut lining is controlled by “tight junctions”.

These are the seals between adjoining cells that prevent “leakage”.

Now, the job of the tight junctions is to allow beneficial nutrients to pass through and keep out larger inflammatory particles like pathogens, toxic chemicals, and undigested food.

But these tight junctions become porous when we do not eat enough foods to repair and strengthen the gut’s protective layer, such as bone broth and vitamin C-rich foods like citrus fruits and dark leafy greens that help build collagen.

Or when we eat foods we’re sensitive to, and cannot digest well, like gluten.

Also, the pathogens in biofilms cause the tight junctions to loosen up.

Now that you know the two pathways for gut inflammation, let’s look at the symptoms of an inflamed gut.

If you have gut inflammation, your digestive function is weakened, and you will start experiencing both gut and non-gut symptoms.

The symptoms of gut inflammation may include:

Bloating, gas, or excess flatulence.

Acid reflux and heartburn.

Diarrhea or constipation.

Nausea and vomiting.

Abdominal pain or cramping.

Bloody or unusual stools.

Unintentional weight loss.

Sugar cravings and weight gain.

And the non-gut-related symptoms include:

Low energy and fatigue.

Brain fog and mood issues.

Sleep problems and night sweats.

Headaches or migraines.

Skin issues such as dermatitis, psoriasis, or acne.

Hormonal issues such as PCOS.

Joint discomfort and joint issues.

Sniffles and mucus.

Next, let’s look at the 5 worst food ingredients that cause inflammation in the gut and the rest of the body.
We begin with our Number 5, “Processed Sugar”

Processed sugar refers to refined sugar and carbs, and “added sugar”, like high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).

Added sugar, is sugar that’s been removed from its source, and added to foods and drinks as a sweetener, and to increase shelf life.

Processed sugars and carbs trigger the release of inflammatory messengers called cytokines.

When sugary and starchy foods make it to the intestines, they selectively feed the pathogens and starve the beneficial bacteria, which prefer low-sugar plant fibers.

Sugar also damages the protective intestinal barrier, especially when there is a lack of fiber to feed the probiotics.

In one study published in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in 2016, researchers followed over 360,000 participants from several European countries who ate a diet high in sugar and soft drinks.

The researchers found that this eating pattern increased the risk of ulcerative colitis.

They also found that eating a lot of vegetables helped reduce the risk of getting ulcerative colitis, even among people who ate a lot of sugar and soft drinks.

As you may already know, soft drinks use HFCS as a sweetener, as do a lot of seemingly “healthy” packaged foods like salad dressings, sweetened yogurt, and granola bars.

HFCS is inflammatory, and over the last few decades, the overconsumption of HFCS has been linked to dramatic increases in inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, fatty liver, and type 2 diabetes.

While processed sugars cause a cytokine storm, natural sugars in whole foods have NOT been linked to inflammation.

So, to keep gut inflammation in check, we must avoid or reduce processed sugar. This includes:

Refined sugar like white table sugar, cane sugar, and brown sugar.

Foods with added sugars or fructose, including ice cream, chocolate bars, and sugar-sweetened drinks such as soda, fruit juice, and energy drinks.

Artificial sweeteners with names like aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and agave syrup.

Instead, to sweeten your food and drinks, use natural sugars from whole foods like:

Yacon syrup, raw honey, raw dates, coconut crystals, and pure whole-leaf stevia (NOT processed stevia extract).

Now, let’s talk about the other type of sugar we need to cut back on: refined carbs.

These are refined grains that have been processed to the point that almost all the bran, fiber, and nutrients have been removed.

They break down easily into simple sugars and cause rapid spikes in blood sugar and insulin, which lead to weight gain, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

These inflammatory “empty carbs” are the comfort foods many of us crave, such as white bread, pizza dough, pasta, pastries, white flour, white rice, sweet desserts, and breakfast cereals.

So instead of refined carbs, eat the following types of carbs to soothe inflammation in the gut.

Prebiotics, or natural fibers that feed the good bacteria like dandelion greens, garlic, onions, chicory root, artichokes, bananas, whole oats, and apples.

Probiotic fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and unsweetened yogurt.

Gluten-free whole grains like quinoa, buckwheat, millet, and wild and brown rice. These complex carbs help your blood sugar rise more slowly.

Nutrient-dense, complex carbs like fruits and starchy vegetables like potatoes and legumes with lots of fiber.

Next up, our Number 4 is “Gluten”.

You may want to consider eating less wheat, even if you do not carry the gene for celiac disease, are not gluten-sensitive, and do not have Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

This is because one fragment of gluten found in wheat, called gliadin, stimulates the release of the protein zonulin in the gut barrier.

Zonulin expands the tight junctions and increases the “leakage” of harmful compounds into the bloodstream.

So eating gluten can contribute to a continuous state of low-grade inflammation.

A study published in the Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology in 2006 found that gluten increases intestinal permeability for everyone, but especially for celiac patients.

Common grains that contain gluten include wheat, rye, and barley.

Next, we have Number 3, “Ultra Processed Foods”.

Ultra-processed foods (UPF) are laden with more than just added salt and sugar.

They include artificial colors, hydrogenated fats, preservatives, and additives to increase shelf-life, stability, and taste.

The Brazilian researchers who came up with this term defined UPF as “industrial formulations with five or more ingredients.”

Examples of UPF include flavored potato chips, hot dogs, salami, frozen pizzas, white bread, chicken nuggets, fried chicken, French fries, soft drinks, chocolate, candy, ice cream, whipped toppings, salty snacks, baked goods, and sweetened breakfast cereals.

These highly-modified foods disrupt the gut microbiome and weaken the gut barrier.

According to a study published in The BMJ, UPF makes up 58% of the calories eaten in the U.S. and contributes almost 90% of the energy from added sugars.

Studies show that eating larger amounts of UPF significantly increases the risks of inflammatory bowel disease.

Also, processed meats have been associated with a higher risk of colon cancer because they fuel gut inflammation.

Avoid UPF and eat anti-inflammatory whole foods, including anti-bacterial foods like garlic and ginger, to promote good gut bacteria.

Click the link below to get your free anti-inflammatory diet plan.

The next two ingredients are commonly found in UPF.

At Number 2, we have “Vegetable Oils”.

Vegetable oils are also known as refined seed oils, which is a more accurate name for these industrial oils.

They are widely used for cooking in restaurants and for extending the shelf life of packaged foods.

So these processed oils include canola, corn, cottonseed, soybean, sunflower, safflower, grapeseed, and rice bran.

Now, they’re really bad for your gut and clog up your arteries.

This is because they contain high levels of polyunsaturated Omega-6 fatty acids which are easily oxidized by heat and light, and form unnatural molecules.

These molecules irritate your gut lining and cause inflammation that leads to a leaky gut.

The problem is most people ingest far more Omega-6 than anti-inflammatory Omega-3.

To lower gut inflammation, replace vegetable oils with healthy fats like avocado oil, macadamia oil, coconut oil, grass-fed butter, and extra virgin olive oil.

And at Number 1, we have “Trans fats”

Artificial trans fats are another type of vegetable oil.

They are often listed as partially hydrogenated oils on food labels.

These are formed by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil, so the oil becomes solid at room temperature.

Even though the FDA banned artificial trans fats in the U.S. in 2018, they can still be found in some foods.

These are vegetable shortening which is used for making soft and flaky cakes and pastries, microwave popcorn, margarine, fried fast foods, and nondairy coffee creamers.

You’ll want to stay far away from these heart-disease-causing vegetable oils.

So, these are the top 5 worst foods that cause gut inflammation you’ll want to avoid.

Other factors that increase harmful gut bacteria and inflammation include:

Food sensitivities like dairy, corn, soy, and nightshades.

Chronic stress and poor sleep.

Problems with bile flow.

Low stomach acid levels.

Gut infection and Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

Medications like NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

Drinking too much alcohol.

Finally, if you’re looking for vitamins to heal a leaky gut, the best ones are zinc carnosine, L-glutamine, ginger, and aloe vera.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/toxic-food-additive-in-bread-potassium-bromate/,The Toxic Food Additive In Bread You Didn’t Know You Were Eating…And How To Avoid It,"The use of Potassium Bromate in the bread making process is wide spread within the United States; however, it has been banned in several other countries. (Updated Dec 18, 2022)

It is used to allow dough to rise further than normally possible while strengthening it. The IARC, or International Agency for Research on Cancer, has classified potassium bromate as being a possible carcinogenic risk to humans and placed it in the 2B carcinogen category.

Brazil; China; Canada; the United Kingdom; and European Union have all prohibited the use of this chemical compound. via TakePart

Potassium Bromate Uses

The practice of using potassium bromate was patented because it was found to dramatically speed up the mixing process as well as produce stronger dough and make bread whiter.

Here’s Why It Got Banned…

The Division of Toxicology at the National Institute of Hygienic Sciences in Tokyo, Japan revealed that potassium bromate does produce carcinogenic effects.

This study was the precursor for the banning of the chemical compound in countries spanning the globe. The United States is an exception and has issued only regulations for the commercial use of “bromated flour.”

California is the only state that regulates potassium bromate, requiring a Prop. 65-mandated warning label on food containing it. via LaTimes

The USDA Still Allows The Use Of Potassium Bromate

The USDA mandate says that enriched flour cannot contain more than 25 potassium bromate parts per billion in the finished product.

This may only be achieved by baking it above certain temperatures and for a specific amount of time.

If these are not strictly controlled, the product result may exceed this mandate and contain harmful quantities of this ingredient.

Today, many small and commercial bakeries voluntarily avoid using bromated flour. However, it’s still found in many fast food buns, pizza crusts and some flours, among other products.

Scientific Substantiation

Experiments were performed by the Environmental Carcinogenesis Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in North Carolina to determine the carcinogenic effects of potassium bromate when used to disinfect drinking water through ozonation.

The results demonstrated risks for both kidney and thyroid cancer as well as the mesothelium and renal region within male subjects. The same study resulted in the following incidences:

Renal cell polyps developed around the 52nd week mark of administration within those fed increased doses.
Mesotheliomas were found at the same time mark of treatment on the serous membrane of the testes.
After the 78th week mark mesotheliomas developed in other areas and it is believed those in the testicular region metastasized to the new sites.
Thyroid follicular polyps developed in one subject as soon as the 26th week.
Avoid Potassium Bromate

The best method for eliminating this toxic ingredient from your diet is to read your food labels. Be on the lookout for the words “bromated flour” and “potassium bromate.”

In addition, here’s a list of 86 products containing potassium bromate that you should try to avoid:

https://dailyhealthpost.com/best-remedy-to-unclog-arteries/,Top 7 Natural Ways to Unclog Arteries,"Today, we talk about the best natural remedies to help reduce plaque in your arteries and prevent cardiovascular disease. But first, we need to understand what is going on behind the scenes that cause plaque to form.

When the arteries are damaged, and blood flow is obstructed or even completely blocked, this condition is called atherosclerosis.

It starts when the endothelium becomes inflamed and develops silently over many years. The endothelium is the single layer of cells that lines the inner surface of your arteries.

At the sites where the endothelial cells are damaged, plaque starts to form. Plaque is a fatty substance made up of cholesterol, calcium, cellular waste, and a blood-clotting protein called fibrin.

As plaque grows larger, it further damages the endothelium and triggers even more inflammation. The damaged endothelial cells cannot produce nitric oxide properly. Nitric oxide is needed to relax and dilate the blood vessels.

As a result, your arteries become stiff and narrow. Blood flow to your heart, brain and other vital organs is reduced. This forces your heart to pump harder to push blood throughout the body.

As your immune system continues to send white blood cells to attack the plaque, it becomes unstable. The plaque ruptures and forms a clot or thrombus that blocks the artery and triggers a heart attack or stroke.

Keep watching to learn the FIRST thing you must do to reduce plaque in your arteries.
Next, what are the symptoms of atherosclerosis?

When an artery is severely damaged, symptoms may occur, depending on which arteries are affected.

The arteries that lead to your heart:

-Pain and pressure in the chest.

The arteries that lead to your brain:

-Arms and legs that feel numb or weak.

-Difficulty speaking and slurred speech.

-Temporary vision loss in one eye.

-Weakened facial muscles that droop.

The arteries in your arms and legs:

-Pain in the legs when walking.

The arteries that lead to your kidneys:

-High blood pressure.

-Kidney failure.

So, what causes plaque to form in the first place?

You may have heard that “bad cholesterol” or LDL cholesterol causes plaque.

However, LDL particles do NOT grab onto artery walls on their own. What turns LDL cholesterol into deadly plaque is “oxidation”.

An example of “oxidation” is when iron forms rust when it meets oxygen.

Now, imagine LDL “rusting”.

Studies show that people who are at serious risk of heart attack to the extent that they need bypass surgery have high oxidized LDL cholesterol, NOT normal LDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is highly prone to oxidation.

Next, where does oxidized cholesterol come from?

One. We acquire them straight from our diets when we eat oxidized fats, oils, and sugars. Processed vegetable oils, sugar, and starches are easily oxidized.

Two. Our body makes oxidized cholesterol when there is a high level of fats and LDL cholesterol relative to HDL cholesterol (or “good” cholesterol) in the blood. High LDL cholesterol is usually caused by poor diet, inactivity, obesity, smoking, and diabetes.

To reduce artery plaque, the first thing we must do is adjust our diet and lifestyle to limit these TWO sources.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

Next, what is the best remedy, to unclog arteries and even prevent plaque from building up?

The best remedy involves reducing oxidized cholesterol and adding the following nutrients as food or supplements.

Let’s start with Number 7. “Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10”.

Not only does oxidation cause plaque, but it also kills the energy-producing mitochondria in your cells, like your heart cells.

CoQ10 supports the mitochondria in energy production. It is critical for heart cells because your heart needs to pump harder when your arteries are blocked by plaque.

CoQ10 is a powerful antioxidant, so it can help stop LDL from being oxidized.

It’s a lot stronger than vitamin E supplements-which some studies have linked to increased risks of cancer.

Supplementing with CoQ10 has been shown to significantly increase HDL cholesterol, reduce inflammatory markers, lower blood pressure, and even help people who have suffered a heart attack avoid complications.

While we can get CoQ10 from organ meats and grass-fed beef, the quantities are small, so it’s best to supplement. This is especially true if you’re on statins as this medication depletes your body’s natural store of CoQ10. If you’re over 45, consider taking 100 mg of a high-absorption CoQ10 daily, like Ubiquinol, to protect your heart.

Next up, at Number 6, we have “Vitamin C”.

You know vitamin C is vital for a strong immune system. But did you know vitamin C also keeps your arteries strong, yet pliable, as they flex and contract with the pulsing of blood?

It helps manufacture collagen–the glue that holds your tissues together, and this includes your blood vessels. When there is a deficiency of vitamin C, micro-tears appear in the arteries and cholesterol enters these cracks.

As an antioxidant, vitamin C has been shown in one study to stop LDL from oxidizing by 64%.

To get these cardioprotective benefits, eat vitamin C from whole foods, or get it from a whole foods supplement, and NOT synthetic ascorbic acid.

Foods that are rich in vitamin C include bell peppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and citrus fruits.

Coming up next, Number 5 is “Vitamin B6, B12, folate”.

Vitamin B does more than keep your brain young and healthy. A deficiency can damage the endothelium through high levels of homocysteine in the blood.

Homocysteine is an amino acid used by the body to build and sustain tissue.

When you eat red meat and dairy products, the amino acid methionine converts to homocysteine.

Your body needs vitamins B6, B12, and folate to use homocysteine properly. When levels of these B vitamins are low, homocysteine levels rise.

This causes the smooth muscle cells that lie just beneath the surface of the artery to multiply out of control.

Eventually, the cells create a bulge that protrudes abnormally into the artery. Inflammation attacks this micro-fracture, causing rough and uneven surfaces. To cover and repair the bumpy surface, fats and cholesterol stick to the arterial walls.

Fortunately, it’s easy to load up on foods rich in these B vitamins. They include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, leafy green vegetables, such as cabbage, kale, and spinach, peas, beans, poultry, fish, eggs, and liver.

When taking a Vitamin B supplement, choose a liposomal one for better absorption.

Our Number 4 is “Vitamin K2”.

Vitamin K2 is one nutrient that is difficult to get enough from your diet. So you need to plan to take it.

It has the important job of helping to move calcium away from the blood vessels and kidneys to the bones and teeth where it is needed, by activating the hormone osteocalcin.

This helps prevent calcification in the coronary arteries. When your body has calcium floating around without a home, it becomes more likely that it will end up as plaque.

When supplementing, choose the MK-7 form of K2. This is because it has a very long half-life in the body compared to other forms of vitamin K2, which quickly disappear from circulation.

The recommended dosage is 100 to 200 mcg of MK-7 per day. MK-7 is often paired with vitamin D3 because they work together to move calcium.

There are only a few foods that are rich in vitamin K2 MK-7. These are fermented probiotic foods like natto, sauerkraut, kefir, and yogurt, as well as hard cheeses like Jarlsberg and Edam.

Natto has the highest amounts of MK-7 but if you’re not Japanese, you may not like the taste. Instead, consider a Nattokinase supplement. This enzyme extracted from Natto has the amazing ability to dissolve blood clots and reduce blood thickness, which prevents blood vessel blockages.

When consuming vitamin K2 as food, include a mix of MK-4. These are goose liver and leg, pastured eggs, grass-fed butter, chicken liver and leg, eel, and salmon.

Be aware that vegetable oils block the absorption of vitamin K2, as do medications like statins.

Getting into our Top 3, Number 3 is “Magnesium”.

As many as 80% of adults are deficient in magnesium because it’s depleted in the soil. This is serious because your heart cannot function properly without adequate magnesium.

Magnesium prevents muscle spasms of the heart arteries, which increases the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack. Together with vitamins K2 and D3, magnesium stops calcium from forming inside the plaque. Studies have found magnesium lowers high blood pressure, reduces chest pain, and prevents abnormal blood clotting.

Taking 800-1,000 mg of this supplement every day can help protect your heart and treat many heart conditions. If you’re wondering which form of magnesium to take, the magnesium supplement I recommend contains all 7 forms. See the link below.

Magnesium-rich foods include dark leafy greens, seeds, beans, fish, whole grains, nuts, dark chocolate, yogurt, avocados, bananas, and more.

Our Number 2 is “Omega-3 Fatty Acids.”

Many experts agree that the healthy ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is 2:1. The reality is the average person on a typical western diet has a 25:1 ratio, thanks to Omega-6 polyunsaturated fats in vegetable oils used for cooking and extending shelf life in packaged foods.

These oils and fats are oxidized when they are heated, dried, aged, exposed to light, and chemically processed, even BEFORE entering your blood vessels.

This is a pro-inflammatory state that gives rise to increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels. All these conditions increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Increasing omega-3 fatty acids in your diet helps reduce inflammation.

For supplementation, avoid cheap, big-box brand fish oil because they are likely to have oxidized and gone bad.

Go with clean fish oil with high absorption, from a brand you can trust, or consider krill oil.

Excellent food sources of heart-healthy Omega-3s are sardines, wild salmon, mackerel, walnuts, macadamia nuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds, seaweed, and algae (spirulina and chlorella).

And at Number 1, we have “Garlic, Cocoa, Beetroot”.

I have grouped these three foods because they work synergistically to increase nitric oxide levels and improve blood flow, which helps lower high blood pressure.

Nitrate-rich vegetables like spinach, arugula, and beetroot increase your blood levels of nitric oxide, which improves blood flow. Cocoa helps maintain those high nitric oxide levels. Garlic enhances signaling for more nitric oxide production–so you can get your heart pumping strong!

Take these 3 foods daily as part of a heart-healthy routine: One cup of nitrates, 30-40 grams of dark chocolate with a 75% cocoa content, and 3 to 6 cloves of garlic over several meals.

Garlic, whether in its raw or aged form, protects your heart in FIVE other ways that are backed by studies: prevent coronary artery calcification, reduce arteriosclerotic plaque, increase HDL and decrease LDL, prevent blood clots, and reduce oxidation and inflammation in blood vessels.

If you dislike the smell of garlic, take an aged garlic extract supplement.

Three other amazing foods you can add to your diet to reduce inflammation and open your arteries are cayenne pepper, ginger, and pomegranate juice. See our other videos.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/symptoms-of-low-potassium/,Top 10 Symptoms of LOW Potassium You May Be Ignoring,"Does your heart regularly skip a beat? Do your muscles cramp up often? Is your thinking slower than it used to be? If any of these sounds like you, this could be because you have lower-than-normal levels of potassium in your body. The medical name for this condition is hypokalemia.

A full 98% of the potassium in your body is found in your cells-and for good reason!

Potassium is an electrolyte-this means it helps carry electrical signals to cells in your body. Your body uses this electricity to keep fluid balance, transmit nerve signals, and contract muscle cells, particularly the heart muscle cells.

Potassium helps your heartbeat stay regular, your kidneys function properly and stop your sodium levels from spiking too high.

Potassium deficiency is more common than you think. Studies show that 9 out of 10 Americans—that’s upwards of 290 million people—are only getting about half the 4.7 grams of this essential mineral they need each day.

The normal range for blood potassium is between 3.5 to 5.5 mmol/L. Below this level, hypokalemia occurs. Very low levels of potassium in the body (less than 2.5 mmol/L) can lead to irregular heart rhythms and trigger cardiac arrest—which can be deadly.

So, what causes a potassium deficiency, and what are the symptoms that warn you of low potassium? How can you restore your potassium? This is exactly what we’ll talk about in the rest of this video.

First, let’s look at what causes hypokalemia.

A potassium deficiency is rarely caused by a low intake of fruits and vegetables alone.

The most common cause of low potassium is excessive loss through urine. This happens in people who take prescription medications called diuretics or water pills, which make them urinate more often. These medications are often prescribed for high blood pressure or heart disease.

Another reason is the excessive loss of potassium in your digestive tract. This may be due to frequent vomiting, diarrhea, or laxative use.

Other physical conditions that contribute to potassium loss include:

Eating disorders such as bulimia.

Excessive sweating.

Chronic Kidney Disease.

Other medications such as insulin and antibiotics.

Excessive alcohol use.

Low magnesium levels. Magnesium actively transports potassium across your cells. So when your magnesium levels dip, your potassium levels suffer too.

Next, what are the symptoms of hypokalemia?

Often, the symptoms of low potassium are easily overlooked, until they become serious.

Let’s begin with our Number 10. “High Blood Pressure”.

High blood pressure, or hypertension, can be caused by excess weight, genetics, or eating a lot of processed foods that are high in sodium. Maintaining healthy blood pressure requires the perfect balance of electrolytes.

Potassium and sodium are electrolytes that work inversely in the body. When you eat potassium-rich foods, your kidneys get rid of excess sodium through urine. If your cells don’t have enough potassium, the kidneys reabsorb sodium back into the blood vessels, and your body holds on to more water. Extra water in your blood means there is extra pressure on your blood vessel walls, and this raises your blood pressure. Potassium helps to widen blood vessels and lower blood pressure.

Coming up next, Number 9 is “Irregular Heartbeat”.

For most people, heart palpitations or a skipped heartbeat now and then are not a big deal. But if you have low potassium levels, this can cause cardiac arrhythmias or an irregular heartbeat, especially for people who are at risk of heart disease.

This is because low potassium levels change the flow of potassium in and out of heart cells. As a result, electrical signals that control your heartbeat don’t work properly, and your heart beats too fast, too slow, or irregularly. If you notice any changes to your heart rate, seek medical attention right away.

Next up, we have Number 8. “Muscle Weakness and Cramps”.

If you often experience painful cramps in your legs, a lack of potassium could be to blame. This is because you lose electrolytes, including potassium, after an intense workout.

Potassium is important for muscles because it helps relay signals from your brain to make them contract. It also helps end these contractions by leaving the muscle cells. When blood potassium levels are low, your brain cannot relay these signals as effectively. This can be a problem for athletes because it can lead to reduced blood flow and problems with the muscles contracting.

Cramps are unlikely with mild or moderate hypokalemia, but they may occur if potassium levels drop below 2.5 mmol/L. In rare cases, severe hypokalemia can also cause rhabdomyolysis in which muscle tissue breaks down quickly, often resulting in kidney damage. Therefore, it’s recommended to take electrolytes before, during, and after vigorous exercise.

Our Number 7 is “Weakness and Fatigue.”

A lack of potassium can lead to weakness and fatigue for two reasons.

First, potassium helps regulate muscle contractions. When blood potassium levels are low, your muscles produce weaker contractions.

Second, low potassium also causes your body to release less insulin. This leads to high blood sugar levels, which means less sugar is converted by your cells into energy.

Many factors can make you feel weak, which makes it hard to pinpoint low potassium as the cause. However, if you’re feeling exhausted after working out and getting enough sleep, low potassium levels might be the cause.

Coming up, Number 6 is “Digestive Issues”.

Low levels of potassium can cause constipation. Potassium helps relay signals from your brain to the muscles in your digestive tract so they can contract and propel food along. When potassium levels drop, the contractions become weaker and the churning of food slows down. If potassium levels drop too low, the intestines may stop moving and this can cause nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, bloating, and abdominal pain.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

Next on the list is Number 5, “Frequent Urination”.

Low potassium levels may prevent your kidneys from concentrating urine and keeping electrolyte levels balanced. This can lead to excessive urination (polyuria) and excessive thirst (polydipsia). Excessive urination may lead to lower potassium levels. Seek medical attention if your frequency of urination changes suddenly.

Next up, Number 4 is “Tingling and Numbness”.

Low potassium levels can weaken nerve signals and lead to tingling and numbness in the hands, arms, legs, and feet. This condition is called paresthesia.

When you sit in an uncomfortable position, this may cause tingling and numbness—and is no cause for concern. However, when these symptoms persist, it’s time to seek medical attention.

Getting into our top 3, Number 3 is “Breathing Difficulties”.

If your blood potassium levels are severely low, it can cause shortness of breath by restricting the expansion and contraction of your lungs. This is because potassium is vital for sending the right signals to the lungs so they know when to contract and expand.

One study found that people with low blood potassium levels or high blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia) were at a much higher risk of respiratory failure and needing a ventilator in the hospital, compared to people who had healthy potassium levels.

As mentioned earlier, low potassium levels can cause an irregular heartbeat because of faulty electrical signals in the lower heart chambers. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body. Less blood means less oxygen delivered and this may cause shortness of breath.

Number 2 is “Brain Fog and Mood Swings.”

When potassium levels are low, the neurons in your brain cannot fire electrical signals rapidly. This results in confusion, forgetfulness, and difficulty concentrating.

A lack of potassium can reduce blood circulation and disrupt hormone production. This includes the mood-regulating hormone, serotonin.

A potassium deficiency may manifest through severe changes in mood and behavior, such as increased depression, anxiety, or irritability.

One study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that people who ate a low-sodium, high-potassium diet enjoyed reduced stress and depression while also having more energy.

And at Number 1, we have “Kidney Stones”.

It is estimated that over 1 in 10 people will have a kidney stone in their lives. If you develop kidney stones, they may be a sign of low potassium.

In one study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993, men who took in less than 2.9 grams of potassium daily were twice as likely to develop kidney stones as those who took in over 4 grams of potassium daily.

Kidney stones are hard masses of minerals and other substances that form crystals inside your kidneys. These small stones are most commonly made up of calcium and oxalate. When these stones become lodged in the urinary tract and block the flow of urine, they can cause excruciating pain.

Potassium helps your kidneys flush excess calcium through your urine. If you don’t get enough potassium in your diet, this can cause the masses to form.

Next, how do you get more potassium?

The best way to replenish potassium is to add fruits and vegetables to each meal. This includes bananas, but there are plenty of other foods that contain potassium. You can find it in whole foods like leafy greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant, avocado, pumpkins, potatoes, carrots, raisins, beans, dairy products like milk and yogurt, meat, poultry, fish, and nuts.

Your doctor may prescribe supplements if you have a medical condition or are taking specific medications. If your case is more severe, your doctor may give you potassium intravenously. If you decide to supplement with potassium on your own, talk to your doctor first.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-prediabetes-from-causing-clogged-arteries/,STOP Prediabetes from Causing Clogged Arteries,"Today, we look at what you can do to stop prediabetes from advancing to diabetes and prevent it from causing clogged arteries.

Many people think prediabetes is no big deal. But researchers at the American College of Cardiology found that people with prediabetes were significantly more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke, even if they never develop diabetes.

When your blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes, this condition is known as prediabetes.

In prediabetes, the fasting blood glucose level is between 100-125 mg/dL, whereas in diabetes it’s 126 and greater. And the A1C level is 5.7-6.4% in prediabetes, and 6.5% and greater in diabetes.

Did you know, up to 70% of individuals with prediabetes will eventually develop diabetes–even though prediabetes is fully reversible?

Statistics reveal that over 96 million U.S. adults live with prediabetes–and 90% of them don’t know they have it. That’s more than 1 in 3 adults! Or they simply brush off the symptoms as minor health problems — sometimes for months and even years!

However, diabetes is anything but minor. Early diagnosis and treatment can mean the difference between living a long, healthy life and suffering from complications.

Uncontrolled high blood sugar can cause damage to the blood vessels, nerves, heart, and kidneys.

First, let’s talk about what causes prediabetes.

Prediabetes usually occurs in people who already have insulin resistance or whose beta cells in the pancreas don’t make enough insulin to keep blood sugar in the normal range. Let’s explain what this means.

After you eat, the carbohydrates in your food are broken down into glucose, or sugar. This sugar enters your bloodstream.

Sugar then enters the body’s cells with help from insulin (a hormone produced by the pancreas) so that it can be used as energy.

Insulin also tells the liver, muscle, and fat cells to store any excess sugar as glycogen for later use.

When sugar enters our cells, it decreases the amount of sugar in our blood to a normal level. In response, the pancreas makes less insulin.

However, when your cells don’t react to insulin the way they’re supposed to, the extra sugar stays in your blood.

This condition is called insulin resistance, and it’s the underlying cause of prediabetes.

It isn’t exactly clear what causes insulin resistance. But researchers think excess weight and lack of physical activity are major factors.

Another cause of prediabetes is when beta cells in the pancreas can no longer produce enough insulin.

This happens as a result of eating a lot of sugar and carbohydrates at a high frequency. The pancreas has to work extra hard to keep releasing insulin to control blood sugar levels. Eventually, the beta cells become exhausted and can no longer pump out that much insulin. So sugar rises and stays in the blood after you eat.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

Next, not many people are aware that prediabetes can cause clogged arteries, so let’s look at how this happens.

As sugar builds up and reaches dangerous levels, it creates the perfect environment for widespread inflammation. Inflammation damages the lining of your blood vessels and creates uneven surfaces in the smooth muscle cells. This allows cholesterol to lodge in your artery walls and form plaque along with fats, calcium, and other substances.

Plaque can grow large enough to significantly reduce blood flow through an artery. But that’s not all. Plaque accumulation also makes your body release immune cells to attack the plaque, which may cause it to rupture and trigger a blood clot to form. A clot is dangerous because it may further narrow the artery or completely block it, which could lead to a heart attack or stroke.

So, how can you know if you have prediabetes? Here are 11 symptoms.
Number 11. Unexplained fatigue.

This is because glucose in the blood cannot be easily converted into energy after eating.

Number 10. Slow-healing wounds.

This is due to poor circulation in damaged blood vessels. Open wounds are called diabetic ulcers.

Number 9. Unexplained mood swings.

Too much sugar in the brain makes a person anxious, irritable, and unable to focus. As stress increases, more cortisol is released and raises sugar levels by releasing stored glucose into the bloodstream.

Number 8. Hunger, weight fluctuations.

When sugar stays in the blood, it causes your cells to burn fat and muscle for energy, and this can cause sudden weight loss. However, insulin resistance makes you hungry all the time, so you eat more. Your body stores the extra sugar as fat, which leads to weight gain. Both overweight and thin people can be prediabetic.

Number 7. Frequent urination, excessive thirst.

When there is too much sugar in the blood, your kidneys can’t re-absorb all the sugar, so it leaves your body through urine. This makes you go to the bathroom more often. As a result, your body craves more water, your mouth feels dry, and you feel thirsty all the time. And the cycle continues.

Number 6. Numbness and tingling of feet and hands.

This is because high blood sugar damages the nerves and causes them to misfire. This condition is known as neuropathy.

Number 5. Digestive issues.

Researchers have found that people with prediabetes often have higher rates of gas, bloating, feeling full quickly, nausea, heartburn, and constipation. This may be because their vagus nerve is damaged. The vagus nerve helps control how quickly the stomach empties. When it’s damaged, food stays in the stomach for too long. This is called gastroparesis. If you have unexplained digestive problems, have a doctor check for prediabetes.

Number 4. Painful joints.

People with prediabetes often have extra body weight. This can be hard on their joints, particularly in the lower body, and increase the risk of osteoarthritis.

Number 3. Skin conditions.

Some people with prediabetes experience recurring bacterial infection that starts with itchy skin. The person can’t stop scratching the itch, and then their skin turns red and dissolve. Swelling follows and it becomes a weeping sore. This is caused by naturally-present bacteria that feed on glucose and go out of control.

Other skin conditions include acanthosis nigricans–a darkened area of skin on the back of your neck, armpit, groin, or elsewhere that feels like velvet. Skin tags on the eyelids, neck, armpits, and groin are another symptom of high blood sugar.

Number 2. Blurred Vision.

When the tiny blood vessels that supply your retina are damaged by excess sugar, they can leak blood into the retina and distort vision. This condition is known as diabetic retinopathy, and it can happen in the prediabetic stage. Early symptoms of diabetic retinopathy include blurred vision, floaters, loss of central vision, and dark spots in the field of vision.

Number 1. Kidney Damage.

The kidneys can be damaged even before the onset of diabetes. In one extensive study, over one-third of people with prediabetes had signs of kidney disease. The stage of kidney disease was 3 or 4, the same as for people with diabetes.

Next, how can you reverse prediabetes?

The most important thing you can do is to reduce the amount of sugar and refined carbs in your diet. If you eat carbs and sugar, make sure you get fiber along with it. Fiber will keep your insulin and glucose levels balanced so you don’t get a spike. Some fiber-rich foods are green beans, mushrooms, artichokes, asparagus, okra, celery, lettuce, spinach, and cruciferous vegetables.

Choose anti-inflammatory foods that are medium to low on the glycemic index. Control your portion sizes.

Drink lots of water to dilute the sugar in your bloodstream and help your kidneys flush out excess sugar. It will also help reduce hunger.

Get nutrients that improve sugar control, such as chromium, magnesium, berberine, ALA (alpha-lipoic acid), apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, probiotic foods, and omega-3 fatty acids.

Exercise regularly, as this is a good way to lose weight and take the load off your pancreas. When you work out, your muscle cells can absorb glucose for energy, whether or not insulin is available. Even walking 30 minutes every day works wonders.

Get enough quality sleep. Sleep deprivation increases your hunger for high-carbohydrate foods. It also increases cortisol levels and triggers higher blood sugar.

Manage your stress levels to balance your hormones. Yoga, deep meditation, or working on a hobby you enjoy will do wonders for your body.

Get rid of excess body fat. This will reduce the risk of metabolic problems.

Lastly, who is at risk for prediabetes?

If you are aged 45 years and over, carry extra belly fat, lead a sedentary lifestyle, or have a family history diabetes, consider getting tested to know if you have prediabetes.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/increase-blood-flow-and-circulation/,Top 7 Vitamins to Increase Blood Flow and Circulation,"Today, we look at the symptoms and causes of poor circulation in the body, and how we can fix this with vitamins that improve blood flow.

Poor circulation means either a lack of blood flow to certain parts of the body, such as the extremities, or a lack of blood flow throughout the body.

In either case, it’s not good news. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to every cell in the body. This is necessary for the cells to function properly. Blood also carries away waste. If blood flow is poor, waste can accumulate in the cells, which further affects their function.

As we age, our circulation decreases, and this can lead to accelerated aging. Cells that are deprived of vital nutrition are damaged more easily by free radicals, and over time, the body’s systems start breaking down. The heart has to work harder to pump blood because your body isn’t getting enough oxygen.

Poor circulation is a widespread problem that doesn’t get the attention it deserves. This condition can lead to a variety of symptoms and contribute to disease.

The symptoms of poor circulation include:

Numbness and tingling in feet and hands.

Hands and feet that are always cold.

Swelling and fluid buildup, known as edema.

Digestive problems such as cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and bloody stools.

Poor memory, concentration, and confused thinking.

Muscle cramps and joint pain in the hands, feet, legs, and arms.

Chronic exhaustion or fatigue.

Varicose veins in the legs that get worse.

Leg ulcers that are difficult to heal.

Discolored skin that appears pale, blue, or purple.

Conversely, improved blood flow can take you to a whole new level of radiant health! The benefits include:

More energy.

Better sleep.

More stable blood pressure.

A better sex life.

Better cognition and focus.

Improved heart health.

Youthful-looking skin.

Increased exercise performance.

Faster metabolism.

Improved detoxification.

Better digestion.

Reduced risk for chronic disease.

Reduced signs of early aging.

So, what causes poor blood circulation?

The factors that cause chronic diseases also give rise to poor blood circulation.

One. A diet high in processed foods including refined sugars and carbs, and inflammatory oils, and low in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats from fish and protein.

This type of eating contributes to poor circulation because:

-You may be missing the nutrients you need to produce nitric oxide and support other processes for blood circulation. For example, deficiencies in iron, vitamin B12, folate, vitamin C, and magnesium can reduce the body’s ability to produce red blood cells that carry oxygen.

-When blood sugar rises, it damages the micro vessels and decreases the body’s ability to produce nitric oxide.

-Inflammatory food triggers inflammation in the body, which then affects circulation.

-Making poor dietary choices leads to obesity and chronic disease. Obesity increases the risks of varicose veins and blood pressure problems.

Two. A sedentary and lifestyle. Too much sitting constricts blood flow.

Three. Chronic stress. When we’re stressed, blood flow is directed away from the digestive system and internal organs, and toward the muscles to prepare for “fight or flight.” Chronic stress contributes to high blood sugar, weight gain, and lower moods—all of which can lead to poor circulation.

Four. Chronic diseases cause narrowing of the arteries and reduced blood flow. This includes atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in blood vessels), Raynaud’s disease (an autoimmune disease that affects fingers and toes), diabetes, and neuropathy (nerve damage).

Five. Smoking. This habit interferes with blood flow and increases the risks of stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular disease.

Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video.

Next, to understand how we can increase circulation, we need to understand nitric oxide.

Nitric oxide is a vasodilator or a compound that relaxes and widens your arteries and veins.

The endothelial cells that line your blood vessels produce nitric oxide. Enzymes called nitric oxide synthase make nitric oxide from the amino acid called l-arginine. This process requires oxygen and micronutrients—both of which are important for healthy circulation.

Having poor circulation makes it difficult for cells to produce nitric oxide, and herein lies the problem. To optimize circulation, you need healthy nitric oxide levels, but to optimize nitric oxide production, you need healthy circulation.

The rest of this video will explain how you can get out of this vicious cycle of low-nitric-oxide poor circulation.

Besides circulation support, nitric oxide is essential for a functional immune system, relaying nerve signals and reducing inflammation.

The micro vessels in the body, which make up 74% of the entire vascular system, rely on nitric oxide to deliver oxygen and nutrition to the heart and the rest of the body.

When there isn’t enough nitric oxide, circulation decreases and results in the symptoms mentioned earlier.

Next, let’s look at the vitamins that improve blood flow by increasing nitric oxide levels.

We use the word vitamins broadly to include natural compounds like amino acids and antioxidants.

Let’s begin with our Number 7. L-arginine.

As mentioned previously, l-arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide in the body. When you increase the amount of l-arginine available to cells that produce nitric oxide, they produce more.

However, l-arginine alone may not be enough to have sustained effects in dilating blood vessels. After you turn 45, your digestive system has a harder time converting l-arginine into nitric oxide.

So, just taking an l-arginine supplement, or eating protein-rich foods that contain l-arginine, like fish, red meat, poultry, soybeans, whole grains, beans, and dairy products, may not have much effect on nitric oxide levels. The solution is to combine this amino acid with the next nutrient.

Our Number 6 is L-citrulline.

L-citrulline is a non-essential amino acid that is efficiently turned into L-arginine in the kidneys. This makes it a good supplementation choice for increasing nitric oxide synthesis in the body.

L-citrulline supports healthy blood pressure, promotes sharper memory and focus, and boosts your libido. Studies show that l-citrulline works well, even if you’re in your 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond.

L-citrulline is a byproduct of l-arginine production and is recycled back to l-arginine. Studies show that when you combine l-arginine and l-citrulline, nitric oxide is produced more effectively at a lower dose, than if you used more of either amino acid.

Watermelon is the king of citrulline-rich fruits. The word citrulline comes from “Citrullus,” which is the Latin word for watermelon. Other citrulline-rich fruits include Casaba Melons, Cucumbers, and Cantaloupe.

Coming up next is Number 5. Beetroot Extract.

Beetroot is an excellent source of dietary nitrates. When you eat foods high in nitrates, bacteria in your saliva convert them into nitrites, which are then converted into nitric oxide. Other nitrate-rich foods include spinach, lettuce, carrots, arugula, cabbage, garlic, broccoli, kale, and celery.

Supplementing with concentrated versions of these foods can help improve vasodilation and blood flow. Beetroot extract helps to boost your energy and endurance, plus it can help you walk longer and think more quickly on your feet.

Next up is Number 4. Vitamin C.

Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps to improve nitric oxide synthase activity. When Vitamin C is combined with dietary nitrates, it helps to increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide.

Getting into our top 3, Number 3 is Hawthorn Berry.

In traditional Chinese medicine, hawthorn berry is one of the most commonly used foods to treat high blood pressure. This small, red fruit is packed with antioxidants that help open up your arteries to stimulate blood flow. Not only can hawthorn berry increase nitric oxide levels, but it also helps your body absorb significantly more el citrulline and beetroot extract when you take these nutrients together.

Our Number 2 is Glutathione.

Glutathione is a molecule that helps with detoxification, cell repair, and immune system function. This powerful antioxidant helps increase nitric oxide levels by getting rid of free radicals that damage nitric oxide molecules. To keep glutathione levels high as you age, eat plenty of sulfur-rich foods like mushrooms, garlic, onions, and cruciferous vegetables. Or supplement with glutathione precursors like N-acetyl-cysteine or glutamine.

And at Number 1, we have Trans-resveratrol.

Trans-resveratrol is a type of polyphenol that is found in grapes, red wine, and berries.

This antioxidant helps increase the activity of enzymes that are involved in nitric oxide synthesis. It has also been shown to increase the half-life of nitric oxide, allowing it to remain active for a longer period. Trans-resveratrol may help to improve blood flow and circulation.

Other than these 7 nitric oxide nutrients, consume anti-inflammatory whole foods and nitrate-rich foods to support healthy blood flow.

Last but not least, here are two simple ways you can release more nitric oxide and improve blood flow: exercise regularly and breathe through your nose.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/top-10-herbs-for-joint-pain/,Top 10 Herbs For Joint Pain,"A debilitating condition, joint pain can be experienced as a result of ageing, over-use, or autoimmune diseases attacking the joints and their surrounding tissue. If you have tried all available traditional medications yet failed to get the results you expected, this would not be surprising as many drugs only alleviate the symptoms without targeting the underlying cause. (Updated Nov 24, 2022)

Several alternative herbal treatments have been researched – and lab studies suggest that these may even have the potential to address both symptoms and origin in lab studies. Below are 10 herbs considered useful for managing joint pain:

1. Arnica

This is a popular herb present in various commercial ointments externally applied to the skin. When applied as a balm or cream, arnica has been shown to serve as a natural pain reliever to alleviate soreness and stiffness.

The evidence of arnica’s clinical value is rich that when a study was conducted to compare its effects with ibuprofen in 204 patients with active hand osteoarthritis, there was no difference found in pain and hand function improvements between ibuprofen and arnica tincture after 3 weeks of treatment. This study suggests that arnica formulation is comparable to ibuprofen in treating hand osteoarthritis, yet without the potential side effects of ibuprofen.

2. Ginger

Ginger is traditionally known to aid nausea but research has also found convincing evidence of its success in combating arthritis. Its active ingredients, gingerols, possess anti-inflammatory characteristics responsible for its medicinal actions. Ginger has been found to relieve pain by preventing cytokine formation, an immune chemical that triggers inflammation. Consequently, one 3 year study discovered that 75% of the participants with rheumatoid arthritis experienced improvements in pain and swelling after using powdered ginger.

3. Stinging Nettle

Its name may sound daunting but once you have infused this herb in tea, skin rash that would be brought about by this plant’s hairs will naturally be neutralized. After concocting tea made from dried or fresh leaves of stinging nettle, it may be used to alleviate pain linked to joint pain, arthritis and gout. Exploratory studies that investigated the value of stinging nettle as a useful, safe and cheap therapy in treating joint pain have discovered nettles as being very effective to the extent that some subjects believed they have been cured by it without any major side effects.

4. Cayenne

Researchers discovered how the interesting mechanism behind rubbing cayenne works to relieve joint pain; cayenne, through the presence of its active ingredient capsaicin, acts as a counterirritant to the pain by producing mild irritation to distract your nerves from the more severe joint pain. Eventually, repeated application of cayenne pepper can significantly reduce arthritic pain. Because of cayenne’s anti-inflammatory properties, experts believe that it can also ease gout and gut-related pain like ulcers.

5. Boswellia

This tree commonly found in India attributes its therapeutic value to its gum which promotes anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and analgesic activities. A 2003 randomized controlled study that evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of boswellia extract in 15 patients with osteoarthritic knees concluded that this herb can decrease knee pain and frequency of swelling, increase knee flexion and walking distance after 8 weeks of usage with minimal side effects. Moreover, boswellia is believed to prevent invasion of inflammatory white cells into damaged issue making it a natural pain killer for osteoarthritis, gout and possibly, other types of arthritis as well.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 24, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamins-to-shrink-enlarged-prostate/,7 Best Vitamins to Shrink Enlarged Prostate Naturally,"Today, we look at what happens when there’s excessive cell growth in the prostate in men and the vitamins that help shrink an enlarged prostate.

Click here for our recommended BPH Supplement

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a health condition characterized by an enlarged prostate. It may also be referred to as benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Hyperplasia and hypertrophy are simply fancy ways to describe excessive cell growth. The prostate develops benign nodes that grow in such a way that they squeeze the urethra – the tube that allows urine to exit the bladder – and trigger bladder problems.

The prostate gland is located between the lower part of the bladder and the rectum and wraps around the urethra. Imagine a normal walnut-sized prostate that can grow to the size of a lemon while clamping on the urethra, and I’m sure you can picture the problem.

So, what are the symptoms of BPH?

These include:

Waking up frequently during the night to urinate.

An urgent need to pee more often.

Feeling that the bladder is not empty.

A stream that’s weak, slow, or stops and starts, and dribbles after urination.

Pain and burning sensation after ejaculation or during urination.

Urinary incontinence or leaking urine by accident.

If prostate problems go untreated, the bladder will not empty fully. As the volume of residual urine increases, it creates the perfect humid environment for bacteria to thrive.

This can cause infections in the lower urinary tract, resulting in symptoms like pain and fever. As BPH reaches the final stage, acute urinary retention occurs. This is extremely painful.

It should be pointed out that BPH, prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), and prostate cancer often produce similar symptoms in their early stages, making it difficult to differentiate between them.

The only way to know for sure is to have a doctor perform a PSA test to see if your levels are abnormally high for your age, and also examine your prostate. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a fluid that is produced in the prostate.

Statistics show that roughly 25% of men in their 40s have BPH, and this number skyrockets to a startling 80% for men in their 70s.

Next, what causes BPH?

With aging, the amount of testosterone in the body decreases, and this leads to an increase in estrogen activity, which makes the prostate cells grow faster.

An enzyme called aromatase converts testosterone into estrogen. Studies have shown that high levels of estrogen-related enzymes lead to prostate decline.

A modern-day problem is that men are exposed to many estrogens in processed foods, commercial meats and dairy, plastics, and personal care products. Elevated levels of estrogen in men can lead to problems like a loss in muscle strength and mass, excessive body fat, hair loss, and an enlarged prostate. Additionally, having more visceral abdominal fat increases the risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

Worst of all, high estrogen levels decrease the body’s ability to produce testosterone and free testosterone. As you can see, it is particularly important to keep estrogen from harming prostate health.

Another theory about BPH focuses on dihydrotestosterone or DHT and the activity of an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. This enzyme converts testosterone in the body to DHT, which is at least ten times more powerful than simple testosterone. As men age, the activity of 5-alpha-reductase increases, which leads to a decrease in the ratio of testosterone to DHT.

DHT may make prostate cells grow, leading to hyperplasia. Lower levels of testosterone or a faster decline over time are important factors that trigger BPH.

Now, let’s look at the 7 vitamins that help shrink an enlarged prostate by targeting the causes.

We use the word “vitamins” broadly to include minerals and phytosterols or natural compounds found in plants. These have few, if any, side effects compared to BPH medications.

It’s important to note that one ingredient alone may not get the job done. Instead, it’s best to combine nutrients to effectively address BPH.

First up, we have Number 7. Zinc.

Did you know the prostate has the highest levels of zinc in a man’s body? Zinc is important for making testosterone and keeping the prostate healthy.

Zinc intake helps prevent and reverse prostate enlargement in two ways.

One. Zinc helps to prevent the excessive breakdown of testosterone into DHT by the enzyme 5-alpha- reductase.

Two. Zinc helps to block the conversion of testosterone by the enzyme aromatase to estradiol, the main type of estrogen.

The Journal of Nutrition published a study that found that a zinc-deficient diet leads to lower levels of testosterone and excess estrogen.

A study from 2011 showed that men with BPH had less zinc in their prostate tissue than normal. The study also found that these men were losing more zinc through their urine.

The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for zinc is only 11 mg, but most men do not get even this amount.

Pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil are excellent sources of zinc. You can significantly increase your zinc levels by eating 2 ounces of pumpkin seeds per day.

Pumpkin seed oil contains carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids. Studies have found that men who consume more carotenoids have a decreased chance of developing BPH.

See our recommended pumpkin seed oil in the link below.

Other excellent sources of zinc are meat, fish, and seafood.

For zinc supplements, the best results for treating BPH are seen with zinc picolinate. Many men experience improved urine flow, more complete bladder emptying, and less sleep disruption from nighttime bathroom visits.

If you decide to supplement with zinc, take 30 mg one to two times daily with food. Remember to also take a copper supplement of 2 mg per day, since these two minerals compete for absorption. If you don’t, zinc will win out and you may develop a copper deficiency.

Coming up next is Number 6, Vitamin C & Lycopene.

A recent 4-year study in China looked at the effects of diet on BPH symptoms in 2,000 men aged 65 and older. Researchers found that men with diets high in fruits and vegetables — especially leafy, dark vegetables and tomatoes — had less BPH, fewer symptoms of BPH, and were less likely to worsen their BPH. Researchers believe it’s not just one nutrient, but the combinations found in a healthful diet and lifestyle that are beneficial.

Oxidative stress is thought to be a contributing factor in BPH, so this may explain why powerful antioxidants such as vitamin C (in fruits and vegetables) and lycopene (in cooked tomatoes) may help reduce symptoms of hyperplasia.

Moving on to Number 5, we have Beta-sitosterol.

Beta-sitosterol is a phytosterol that helps reduce blood levels of cholesterol. In studies where men received 130 mg of beta-sitosterol daily, there was reduced swelling in the prostate and a significant improvement in urinary flow and symptoms. This was not the case for men who received a placebo. Foods rich in beta-sitosterol include peas, avocados, peanuts, almonds, kidney beans, soybeans, wheat germ, walnuts, and lentils. The next four nutrients also contain beta-sitosterol.

Next on our list is Number 4. Saw Palmetto.

Saw palmetto (Serenoa Repens) berry extract may be the most well-known natural treatment for prostate problems. However, it is most useful only for men with mild-to-moderate BPH symptoms.

If you supplement with saw palmetto extract, take 320 mg a day of a high-quality liposterolic extract, standardized for 80 to 95% fatty acids. This extract can help improve your prostate health by lowering your levels of DHT.

Research showed that saw palmetto in combination with lycopene and selenium helped to reverse lower urinary tract symptoms and shrink the size of the prostate in men with BPH. 

Saw palmetto is not a prostate panacea. To receive the full desired effects, it needs to be combined with the additional nutrients listed here.

Getting into our top 3, Number 3 is Pygeum.

Pygeum africanum is an extract of the African cherry tree that contains beta-sitosterol and other chemicals that help shrink the prostate in men with BPH. It has been used for centuries to treat various urinary problems.

At typical doses of 100 mg per day, the extract can significantly improve International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS), reduce the frequency of nighttime urination, and increase peak urinary flow rates and quality of life. This extract has also shown evidence of potent anti-cancer effects.

Studies have shown that the benefits of saw palmetto and pygeum extracts are significantly enhanced when taken with beta-sitosterol and pumpkin seed oil.

Our number 2 is Rye grass pollen extract.

Studies have shown that rye grass pollen extract can significantly improve self-rated urinary symptoms in men with BPH. Men who use this extract are twice as likely to show improvement in nocturnal urination. In addition, these men showed a significant reduction in prostate size and improvements in reported pain and quality of life.

And at Number 1, we have Stinging nettle root.

Stinging nettle root (Urtica dioica) blocks DHT production and has been used as a therapy for BPH and hair loss for a long time.

Studies have shown that nettle root extract is effective in relieving BPH symptoms and in shrinking the size of the prostate.

Repeated studies also show that saw palmetto, when combined with nettle extract, can reduce nighttime urination by one episode per night. This is a significant difference. 

An added benefit of stinging nettle is that it promotes increases in the levels of serum-free testosterone with no increase in total testosterone.

Amounts used in successful studies range from 6 to 12 mL of tincture per day in divided doses, or 120 mg capsules twice a day.

Before supplementing, talk with a healthcare professional first, if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

In addition, incorporate these lifestyle habits to take care of your prostate.

Stay lean to keep estrogen levels in check.

Avoid commercial toiletry products, these contain estrogenic and toxic chemicals. Use natural soap and shampoo.

Eat a healthy, balanced diet that is high in fiber, protein, carbs, healthy fats and nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables, and low in sugars and processed foods.

Avoid processed vegetable oils and cut back on refined carbs.

Limit alcohol, sugary drinks, and caffeine.

Boost your testosterone levels with zinc, exercise and lift weights, minimize stress and cortisol levels, get enough sunlight or vitamin D and have plenty of restful high-quality sleep.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-acid-reflux-naturally/,3 Ways to Stop Acid Reflux Naturally,"Today, we look at the root cause of acid reflux and heartburn, and what you can do to stop the pain and discomfort forever.

Contrary to popular belief, that burning sensation you get in your chest after eating a full meal or certain foods isn’t caused by having too much stomach acid.

Acid reflux and heartburn occur when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to close completely, allowing stomach acid to splash into the esophagus.

Ninety percent of the time, the reason for the LES malfunction is due to low stomach acid, also known as hypochlorhydria. That’s because adequate stomach acid levels are required to signal the lower esophageal sphincter to close.

Unfortunately, stomach acid levels decline with age, poor nutrition, and stress.

Studies have found that 30 to 40% of men and women over the age of 60, have little to no acid secretion because of atrophic gastritis-chronic inflammation of the stomach lining.

If hypochlorhydria is untreated, and heartburn happens more than twice a week, it can develop into GERD or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. This can lead to serious complications, like scarring, ulceration, and cancer of the esophagus.

GERD is a very common disease.

Researchers estimate that about 20 percent of people in the United States have GERD.

Other than heartburn, acid reflux and GERD may cause symptoms like tasting regurgitated acid, difficulty swallowing, sore throat, dry cough, hiccups, bloating, dark bowels, nausea, vomiting, severe cramping, and pain when lying down.

For decades, the medical establishment has treated people suffering from heartburn and GERD by prescribing antacids or acid blockers.

Although these drugs can alleviate symptoms, they don’t address the underlying cause.

As a result, many people who take acid blockers end up relying on them for the rest of their lives.

This is serious because the side effects of these medications may lead to other problems like osteoporosis, bacterial infections, and damage to both the kidneys and liver.

To stop acid reflux at the root, it’s important to understand why low stomach acid causes acid reflux.

When food enters the stomach, it releases a strong acid called hydrochloric acid, which has a pH of 1.5 to 3.0.

Stomach acid, also called gastric acid, is extremely important for digesting food, particularly proteins and meats.

It helps kill bacteria in the food and produces enzymes needed for digestion such as pepsin.

Gastric acid signals the pyloric sphincter at the bottom of the stomach, to open and empty the mixture of food, hydrochloric acid, and enzymes (called chyme) into the small intestine when it reaches the right pH.

If you have low stomach acid, the chyme will not be broken down properly, and this creates an environment that is friendly to the growth of bacteria. These bacteria eat the carbohydrates fermenting in the stomach. The bacterial overgrowth and poorly-digested food cause excessive pressure in the stomach.

When there’s too much pressure in the stomach but the pH isn’t acidic enough for the pyloric sphincter to open, the only way for the body to release that pressure is by opening up the LES.

The pressure released into the esophagus causes the symptoms of heartburn and acid reflux, which are often misdiagnosed as high stomach acid.

Even if you have little stomach acid, any amount of it going from your stomach to your esophagus will cause discomfort or pain. This is because your esophagus was never designed to handle stomach acid.

When this happens regularly, the LES weakens and becomes “leaky”, making the problem worse.

Having low stomach acid leads to inflammation in the gut and throughout the body. Chronic Inflammation damages your small intestine, makes it hard to digest and absorb nutrients, increases your food intolerances, triggers small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and causes leaky gut.

Now, you may ask: what causes low stomach acid?

A variety of factors can lead to low stomach acid. These include aging, poor diet, chronic stress, chronic inflammation, medications like antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and deficiencies in nutrients necessary to make stomach acid.

Another cause of low stomach acid is hypothyroidism which goes untreated. This is because thyroid hormone is required to produce stomach acid.

An H. pylori infection (a bacterial infection of the stomach) can make it harder for your stomach to produce acid. This leads to poor absorption of iron and vitamin B12 and can cause SIBO.

Next, here are the 3 steps you can take to increase stomach acid and stop acid reflux, heartburn, and GERD.

The first thing you can do to increase your stomach acid naturally is to take betaine hydrochloride or betaine HCL.

Betaine is a compound that is found in food, such as grains or beets. Betaine HCL is an acidic form of betaine that works the same way as hydrochloric acid in your stomach.

Before you supplement with HCL, take two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, ACV, to test if your stomach lining is ready. ACV helps stimulate stomach acid production. If you feel gastric burning, you are not yet ready for supplementation.

Instead, take a tablespoon of ACV with each meal for 4 to 6 weeks to improve your digestion. Dilute it in water until you can tolerate it. If you do not experience any discomfort after drinking ACV, you are ready to take 1 to 2 capsules of betaine HCL with a meal. This helps reduce bloating and discomfort after eating protein-rich foods.

You may need to increase your dosage until you no longer feel burning or discomfort, and then lower your dosage over time.

Next, you need to make sure you’re getting enough potassium, sodium, and zinc in your diet. These nutrients are needed by your body to produce stomach acid. Keep watching for a list of the best and worst foods for acid reflux.

Third, you will want to reduce your stress levels. Stress can cause your stomach muscles to tighten up. Researchers found that people with acid reflux and GERD who were anxious and stressed became more sensitive to smaller amounts of acid in the esophagus, and reported more painful symptoms.

It takes time to fix low stomach acid. If you already suffer from acid reflux, here are FOUR things you can do to reduce inflammation and relieve the pain and discomfort.

First, avoid foods that trigger or aggravate symptoms of acid reflux and GERD.

Cut back on carbohydrates (especially refined carbs) because they can cause bacterial overgrowth, gas, and bloating.

Go gluten-free, because foods that contain gluten are a common cause of heartburn.

Limit your intake of high-fat foods because they contribute to heartburn. Unfortunately, it’s not just fried foods, pizza, potato chips, and fast food. It also includes healthy fats like cheese, nuts, and avocados. High-fat foods stimulate the release of a hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK) which relaxes the LES and triggers heartburn.

Also avoid foods and drinks that trigger acid reflux like peppermint, coffee, carbonated drinks, chocolates, alcohol, citrus fruits, onion, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, and spicy foods.

Next, add these anti-inflammatory foods and drinks to soothe acid reflux and help make stomach acid.

Root, leafy vegetables, and legumes like potatoes, sweet potatoes, turnips, carrots, spinach, broccoli, green peas, lentils, and mushrooms. These are fiber-rich and help digestion.

Non-citrus, low-acid fruits like watermelon, apple, banana, and pear.

High-fiber, whole grains like oatmeal, brown rice, and quinoa.

Fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and yogurt. These contain probiotics and help increase stomach acid.

Low-fat, lean protein like chicken, fish, seafood, tofu, and egg whites that are baked, broiled, poached, or grilled;

Ginger, chamomile tea, and lots of good, clean water.

Third, make some lifestyle changes.

If heartburn is keeping you up at night, try sleeping on your left side. Sleeping on your right side can worsen reflux symptoms because it makes it easier for stomach acid to flow into the esophagus and cause heartburn.

For the same reason, you can elevate the head of your bed, or use a wedge to raise your upper body while sleeping.

Eat smaller, more frequent meals and have dinner at least 3 hours before bed to allow more time for digestion.

Obese or overweight? Consider losing at least 10% of your body weight. Excess belly fat squeezes your stomach, so more fluid is pushed upwards into your esophagus.

And If you smoke, quit smoking. Nicotine can cause the LES to relax and malfunction.

Last but not least, try these proven natural remedies for acid reflux:

In studies, participants who took melatonin were able to reverse their GERD symptoms, while only about two-thirds of those taking PPIs were successful.

Licorice extract known as DGL has been found to block inflammation and reduce heartburn by 50% without disrupting gastric acid production.

Demulcent herbs like slippery elm and marshmallow root powder are known to relieve reflux symptoms fast. When you mix them with water, they become very sticky and coat the esophagus and stomach lining. This barrier protects the mucus layer and reduces inflammation.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/6-steps-to-prevent-alzheimers-disease/,6 Steps To Prevent Alzheimer’s Disease,"Alzheimer’s is a disease that many fear developing later in life because it can come with little warning and does not yet have a cure. While there is no proven treatment to cure Alzheimer’s, there are many steps that you can take to prevent it. Many different studies have linked certain diets, exercising your body and mind, connecting with others, and improving the quality of your sleep to a decreased risk for Alzheimer’s. Learn more about how the following 6 steps can bring your risk of developing Alzheimer’s down. (Updated Nov 6, 2022)

1. Improve Your Diet


Many different changes to your diet can assist in brain health and prevent Alzheimer’s disease. First, you can consider the Mediterranean diet, which consists of foods such as fish, grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, olive oil, and nuts. This diet is proven to be better for your heart and may also help your brain.

Other healthy options for brain health include eating foods with a lot of omega-3 fatty acids, eating produce in a wide variety of colors, trying other heart healthy diets, avoiding trans and saturated fats, having a cup of tea each day, and eating 4-6 small meals instead of 3 large meals over the course of the day.

2. Read More Fiction

Studies have shown that another way to decrease your risk of Alzheimer’s is by keeping your mind active [1]. Reading, along with writing and other activities that engage the mind, can prevent cognitive failure. This “use it or lose it” hypothesis also argues that if you continue working and retire later, you will stimulate your brain longer and prevent the development of Alzheimer’s as well as other forms of dementia.

3. Lift Weights

Exercise is another component of both overall physical health and brain health. In preventing Alzheimer’s, resistance training [2], such as lifting weights, has been linked to significant improvement in both memory and cognitive function. Resistance training can come in forms other than lifting weights or using an exercise machine as well, such as using rubber exercise bands, water jugs, large books, or another object to make your muscles contract.

4. Eliminate Stressors

Another important part of preventing Alzheimer’s is eliminating stressors from your life [3]. Recent studies have shown that there may be a connection between the chemicals that our brain releases when in a state of stress and Alzheimer’s. To reduce stress on a daily basis, you can try meditation, taking a walk, adopting a pet, or other relaxing activities.

5. Get Quality Sleep

While getting the right amount of sleep can help with preventing Alzheimer’s, it’s more important to get good, deep sleep. First, most adults should be getting a minimum of 8 hours of sleep each night. Second, you should ensure quality sleep by regulating your sleep schedule, taking short naps only, and relaxing before bedtime. Getting deeper sleep will be much more effective in keeping your brain healthy.

6. Form Relationships

Finally, research has also shown that forming relationships [4] with others and maintaining connections can improve brain function and prevent Alzheimer’s. Along with staying in touch with family and friends, you should try volunteering, taking a class at your community college, or joining a club.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/hands-health-kidneys/,4 Things Your Hands Could Be Telling You About The Health Of Your Kidneys,"The kidneys are small organs, but they do a lot of important work. If they send you warning signals, it is important to pay attention. The kidneys filter out waste from the blood and get rid of water that we produce in the form of urine. All the blood in our body passes through the kidneys around forty times a day, and they do this job with the help of around one million tiny units called nephrons.

You might not expect it, but problems with your kidneys can actually show up in your hands. Keep reading to discover the warning signs and when you should visit a doctor.

1.Changes to your fingernails

Your fingernails and toenails can reveal a lot about your overall health. For example, changes in your nails can be an early sign of heart problems, diabetes, thyroid disease, or cancer. There are several things to look for in nails if you have kidney disease, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA). These include “a white color on the upper part of one or more nails and a normal to reddish brown color below (half-and-half nails); pale nails; and white bands running across one or more nails (Muehrcke’s nails).”

Your kidneys typically filter out nitrogen waste; however, when they can’t do so, the waste accumulates and changes the look of your fingernails and toenails. If you identify with any of these symptoms, it would be beneficial to consult a doctor.

2.Changes in skin color

Kidney problems can cause skin on the hands and other parts of the body to change color. The AADA says when kidneys stop working as they should, toxins build up in the body. This can cause different colors on the skin, like an unhealthy pale color, grayish, yellowish, or darkened skin. There can also be thick skin with bumps and deep lines. Cysts and whitehead-like spots might also form after a long time of scratching itchy skin.

3.Dry and itchy skin

An often overlooked symptom of kidney disease is dry, itchy skin. This is caused by an imbalance in minerals and is called pruritis. Dry and itchy skin can be a sign of mineral and bone disease, which often accompanies advanced kidney disease, says the AADA. This happens when the kidneys are no longer able to keep the right balance of minerals and nutrients in your blood.

Dry, itchy hands can be a sign of other potential problems, including dehydration and using too much hand sanitizer. If it occurs with other signs of kidney disease, such as the frequent urge to urinate, the two may be related.

When the filters in the kidneys get damaged, it can make someone feel like they have to go to the bathroom more often. The person might feel a lot of pressure when they go to the bathroom, and their urine might start looking bubbly or foamy. This happens because there is more protein in their urine, which is a sign that something is wrong with their kidneys.

4.Swelling

There are many reasons your hands could be swollen. A fracture, sprain, or dislocation can lead to swelling, as can arthritis. Another potential cause of swollen hands is kidney problems.

The kidneys play a vital role in filtering waste from the blood and producing urine. When they don’t do their job correctly, fluid stays in the system instead of being excreted. This extra fluid may cause swelling in fingers and hands, as well as feet and ankles. If you see swelling in these extremities along with other symptoms of kidney problems, it’s important to talk to your doctor.

If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your physician to see if they could be indicative of kidney problems.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/heart-disease-not-your-fault/,4 Reasons Why Your Heart Disease Isn’t Your Fault,"When people talk about heart disease, it’s often with the thought that it only happens in old age. However, in recent years, heart disease has also become a problem for younger adults. This is partly because the conditions that lead to heart disease like stress, lack of sleep, and bad eating habits are all happening at younger ages.

Almost half of all Americans have at least one of the top three risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.

But heart conditions such as heart attacks, strokes and other types of heart disease aren’t always caused by age. Sometimes, heart disease can be caused by factors that are out of your control. Here are four reasons why your heart disease may not be your fault after all.

1. Depression

Depression doesn’t just affect the mind, it can also impact your entire body, including your heart. Depression causes your body to release high amounts of stress hormones. This causes inflammation throughout your body and damages your arteries, which can lead to artherosclerosis.

This mental condition can also affect your lifestyle. Depression can make you lose your appetite, so you end up eating less than you usually do. The less you eat, the less energy you have. Consequently, without energy, you don’t feel like exercising. You also don’t sleep well. Lack of sleep has been found to negatively impact heart and brain health.

According to the American Heart Association, teenagers who suffer from depression or bipolar disorder should be monitored for early heart disease because their mental illness puts them at early risk for cardiovascular disease.

2. Air Pollution

There’s a lot of scientific evidence that proves air pollution can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. Outdoor particle pollution in particular is known to trigger heart attacks and deaths in people with pre-existing conditions, and can also lead to increased risk of mortality in the long-term. All of this research is compiled by the EPA and other similar organizations.

When you breathe in poor quality air, the air pollutants can travel deep into your bloodstream through your lungs, and to your heart. These air pollutants can damage your blood vessels causing them to become narrower and stiffer. This increases your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases.

Major sources of air pollution include power plants, factories, automobiles, and wildfire smoke. These places are well-documented to produce the highest amount of PM2.5.

PM stands for particulate matter (also called particle pollution), which can be found year-round and is responsible for the air quality problems in many developed countries.

How small is 2.5 micrometers? The largest PM is 30 times smaller than your average human hair, which is about 70 micrometers in diameter. These microscopic particles can remain in the air for days to weeks.

The latest research shows that some populations may be at higher risk of PM2.5-related health effects, which may include heart disease. These include people who have health conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol levels, and obesity.

3. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)

Having high cholesterol levels is a warning sign of heart disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder that affects about 1 in 250 people and increases the likelihood of having coronary heart disease at a younger age. The genetic condition FH causes your body to reach levels above 190 mg of low density lipoprotein, which is also known as the “bad” LDL cholesterol.

People born with this condition tend to have problems associated with high cholesterol such as atherosclerosis. Studies have found that 50% of men with untreated FH will develop a heart attack or angina before they turn 50. For women, 30% will have a heart attack before they turn 60.

FH causes the body to develop artery disease earlier in life and more rapidly compared to people born without the condition.

Awareness is crucial, because only 10 percent of all FH cases are diagnosed. Meaning that a lot of people go through life without ever knowing they have this condition. Here are some physical signs that may show up if you’re young and have FH:

Bumps or lumps around your knees, knuckles, or elbows.
Swollen or painful Achilles tendon.
Yellowish areas around your eyes.
A whitish gray color in the shape of a half-moon on the outside of your cornea.
4. Pregnancy complications

Women who develop certain conditions like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes or gain excessive weight or go into preterm labor during pregnancy have a higher risk of early heart disease. That’s because pregnancy-exclusive conditions are often linked to artery-related problems.

For example, gestational diabetes raises your risk of high blood pressure, as well as preeclampsia, which causes high blood pressure in pregnant women. Both of these complications can damage your blood vessels and arteries causing them to become narrower.

If you or a loved one experiences pregnancy-related problems make sure to consult with your doctor, or even a cardiologist about it.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 4, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/cleanse-your-lungs-of-phlegm/,1 Cup to Cleanse Your Lungs of Phlegm and Toxins,"Do you ever feel like you can’t shake the common cold? Or that your allergies are just getting worse? If so, you’re not alone.

Millions of people suffer from chronic respiratory conditions that cause extra mucus to collect in their noses and lungs. This phlegm is the body’s way of protecting against infection and irritants, but it can be really uncomfortable and challenging to get rid of.

Sneezing and coughing are the body’s mechanisms for getting rid of mucus, but they can interrupt your day. Luckily, there are some things you can do to make the process a little easier.

Let’s Look at the Natural Alternatives

Herbs are part of Nature’s pharmacy. There are many different plants all over the world, and we can choose which one is best for us. Just like the stuff from the drugstore, some herbs can have bad effects on people or be dangerous in high doses. But unlike pharmaceuticals, plants have a lot of vitamins and minerals that our bodies can easily use.

Benefits of Mullein

Mullein is an amazing plant (weed) with many incredible benefits! Not only does it have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antibacterial properties, but it can also be used to clean and strengthen the lungs.

It grows in sunny, unkempt places and has fuzzy leaves and yellow flowers. The roots, leaves, and flowers can all be taken as a tea to reduce inflammation in the respiratory tract. Mullein is also effective in treating ear aches and infections when applied topically infused in olive oil.

Mullein has been found to be effective against streptococci (a bacteria that causes strep throat), respiratory infections, and trichomoniasis. The weed contains saponins, which help to expel mucus. Mullein’s iridoid, flavonoid, vitamin and mineral content are responsible for the weed’s efficacy and versatility.

Excess Mucus? Try Drinking Hot Tea!

If you’re experiencing an excess of mucus, hot tea can help to loosen and expel it from your respiratory tract.

Mullein tea is especially effective at doing this, so drink it with a bit of honey to fight inflammation and soothe a sore throat. Not only will you feel better quickly, but you’ll also be killing off any bacteria or viruses that may be causing your symptoms.

To make this excellent mullein tea, you’ll need these ingredients:

1 ½ cups – water

2 teaspoons – mullein leaves

1-2 teaspoons – raw, local honey (optional)

1 teaspoon – dried spearmint (optional)

Follow these instructions:

Boil the water.

Put the mullein leaves in a strainer or tea ball, then steep them in boiling water. (Alternatively, you can put the leaves directly into the pot with the water and strain after steeping.)

Steep spearmint leaves separately from mullein leaves, and then combine the teas just before drinking.

Steep mullein leaves in a covered teapot or saucepan for 15 minutes.

Add honey to taste, then drink while hot.

What About Cough Medicine?

Cough medicine often come with accompanying problems. For one, synthetic medications may provide temporary relief from symptoms, but they never cure the underlying cause. Additionally, these medications often come with adverse side effects, such as allergic reactions, dizziness, drowsiness, and itching.

Labels on these products also warn of interactions with other drugs used for conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, liver disease, and steroids. So before you head to the store to buy any over-the-counter medication, be sure to speak with your doctor about any potential risks and interactions.

What About Asthma Medication?

Asthma medications are an important part of managing the disease. There are a variety of medications available, both inhalers and oral tablets, that contain corticosteroids. These medications help to reduce inflammation in the lungs and make it easier to breathe. While their use is safe and widespread, it’s important to be aware of the potential side effects.

When taken for long periods of time, steroid tablets can cause a variety of harmful side effects. These can include mood changes, forgetfulness, hair loss, easy bruising, high blood pressure and diabetes, thinning bones, suppression of the adrenal glands, muscle weakness, weight gain, cataracts, and glaucoma. When they are swallowed, these tablets are absorbed throughout the body and have far-reaching effects.

Corticosteroids can cause some serious side effects, including eye disease, blood sugar irregularities, headache, and ulcers. It’s often hard to tell if the remedy is worse than the illness.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 3, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/lungs-mold-exposure-signs/,5 Signs Your Lungs are Being Exposed to Mold,"If you’re sneezing, coughing, and feeling down or tired, there’s a chance that you’re being exposed to mold without realizing it. In addition to respiratory issues, mold exposure has been linked to early onset dementia and Alzheimer’s. It’s important to clean your home regularly to control mold, and be aware of the signs of mold exposure.

1. You can’t stop sneezing…

Do you often experience allergy-like symptoms at home? Sneezing, coughing, itchy eyes and throat, stuffy nose, skin irritation and rashes can all be early signs of mold exposure.

When you develop mold toxicity, unusual allergies start to manifest themselves. For example, you may notice that you’re getting sick more often or maybe you keep getting a stuffy nose indoors.

These mold exposure symptoms can occur either immediately or slowly.

2. You’re having trouble breathing.

Asthma symptoms such as shortness of breath and wheezing are also things you may experience when exposed to mold, according to the CDC.

Even if you don’t have seasonal allergies, this is something that can happen to anyone. And in the event that you already have asthma, the exposure to mold can aggravate your symptoms.

3. You’re always feeling tired.

There are a lot of things that can cause fatigue. It’s a common symptom for lots of us. But did you know that feeling fatigued or sluggish can also be the result of mold exposure at home?

Mycotoxins are a type of mold that tend to grow well on food as well as under warm and humid conditions within the home. A 2013 study published in Toxins found exposure to different kinds of mold can cause feelings of chronic fatigue.

4. You can’t seem to focus.

People often experience brain fog and feelings of forgetfulness when exposed to mold. This is because mold can cause inflammation, which in turn can lead to inflammation of the brain.

Mold is an irritant. When present in the body, it can cause an inflammatory reponse. One 2009 neuropsychology study found that when the brain is chronically inflamed due to mold exposure, it can cause long-term cognitive impairment.

5. You’re always feeling down.

In recent years, many studies have found that mold is detrimental to people’s mental health. people’s anxiety and depression,” Rubino says. According to one study published in Environmental Health Perspectives, exposure to damp, moldy households can increase your risk of depression by 34% to 44%.

Another study done in 2020 showed that mold exposure can increase anxiety-like behavior.

Bottom Line

We don’t realize it but unlike our ancestors we spend nearly 90% of our time indoors. And it’s only recently that scientists have begun to look at how it impacts our health. One theme that’s been recurring in all of these studies is that if we want to improve our health, we need to pay attention to the air we breathe.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 2, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/detox-your-arteries-with-this-drink/,Detox Your Arteries With This Drink,"Today, we look at how you can lower bad LDL cholesterol and detox your arteries with three natural foods. We also give you a recipe for a drink made with these 3 ingredients.

Although cholesterol is essential for the body, having too much of one type can be dangerous.

If you eat a lot of junk food and sugar, it can ruin your cardiovascular health. This is because when you eat unhealthy foods, it can cause bad cholesterol and fat to build up in your arteries. This makes it harder for your heart to function properly.

Many people use blood thinners and statins to lower their cholesterol levels. However, you can also manage your cholesterol levels by eating the right foods. In this article, we will show you how to do this.

High cholesterol specifically refers to high levels of oxidized cholesterol. When cholesterol is oxidized, it can cause a build-up of plaque in the artery walls. This can lead to a condition called atherosclerosis, which is when the arteries become narrower and hardened.

Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, cellular waste products and fibrin that build up on the inside of our arterial walls, which damages the existing cells and cause inflammation.

This makes it harder for cells and tissues to get the oxygen and nutrients they need.

Arteries that are stiff and narrow can impair blood flow throughout the body, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke in the brain.

Now, what is oxidized cholesterol?

Cholesterol is mainly comprised of two main types: LDL and HDL.

HDL or “good” cholesterol helps to take away cholesterol that is not needed. This type of cholesterol goes back to your liver so it can be cleared away.

LDL cholesterol is “bad” because it transports fat and cholesterol throughout your body. Too much of it can build up in the walls of your arteries, which can lead to health problems.

We now know that LDL cholesterol only poses a health risk if it is oxidized.

Cholesterol and fat that have been oxidized are the enemies of a healthy body.

Our bodies treat these as harmful substances and stimulate cytokines to damage and kill them with inflammation.

Because LDL cholesterol is highly oxidation-prone, an increase in LDL cholesterol levels normally causes a corresponding rise in coronary artery disease risk.

There are two sources of the oxidized cholesterol that clogs our arteries and causes coronary artery disease.

One. Some of the fats and oils we eat are oxidized. That means that they turn into chemicals that can damage cells.

Two. We produce the rest of it internally.

Oils and fats go rancid more quickly when they’re heated, dried, aged, exposed to light or otherwise chemically processed. A diet rich in vegetable oils is unquestionably dangerous, and should be avoided.

Did you know that sugar oxidizes just like oils and fats? Many oxidation products are produced when glucose, and especially fructose, is heated or processed in any way.

Numerous studies have illustrated that individuals who are in danger of heart attacks and require bypass surgery often have high oxidized LDL cholesterol, not normal LDL cholesterol.

The good news is, you can consume antioxidants through food to stop free radicals and repair the damage they’ve done to cells and organs.

Next, a 3-ingredient cholesterol-lowering recipe:

This drink is packed with nutrients that help break down unhealthy cholesterol and clear your arteries, perfect for aiding your journey to a healthier lifestyle.

Ingredients:

1 gallon (4 liters) of clean water.

Organic lemons – 8

Organic garlic – 8 cloves

1.9 inches (4-5 cm) of organic ginger

Instructions:

Thoroughly clean the lemons by scrubbing the rind, but do not peel them.

After you slice the lemon, peel the ginger and garlic.

After you crush the garlic, let it sit for 15 minutes.

This will activate the allicin, which is a powerful and medicinal compound. that gives garlic its benefits.

Add all ingredients to the blender except for the water and pulse until smooth.

In a saucepan, add the paste to water and heat over medium flame.

As soon as it starts to boil, take the mixture off the heat.

After the liquid has cooled, strain it.

Pour your drink into glass jars or bottles with lids and store them in the fridge.

How to Use:

For best results, drink this daily on an empty stomach two hours before meals.

Combine this protocol with exercise three times a week for best results.

How It Works.

Ginger. Dried ginger powder, administered at 0.1 g/kg of body weight per day, has been shown to reduce the risk of atheroma by up to 50% in as little as 75 days.

Atheroma and plaque are terms used to describe the build-up of fatty deposits and scar tissue in the walls of arteries. This can restrict blood circulation and increase the risk of blood clots.

Ginger can help prevent heart disease by keeping platelets from accumulating in arteries. It also reduces plasma cholesterol.

Not only does it not have the negative side effects, but it is just as effective as other medication such as aspirin.

Garlic. Garlic has been used for centuries as a preventative measure against heart conditions such as atherosclerosis.

Not only does it lower cholesterol and blood pressure, but it also strengthens the immune system.

A 4-year study concluded that those who took 900 mg of standardized garlic powder daily had a significantly lower development of atherosclerosis.

In addition, it contains antioxidants that scavenge harmful free radicals, helping to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease.

Lemons. The regular intake of lemons and daily walks helped to lower blood pressure and increase the number of red blood cells.

Lemon also helps the liver detox and clear excess cholesterol.

And that’s your cholesterol-lowering drink!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/causes-of-urinary-tract-infections/,10 Causes of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) You Need to Know,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common ailment, affecting as many as 8.1 million Americans annually. The urinary tract is an amazing system that helps us get rid of waste from our bodies. It’s composed of the bladder, kidneys, urethra, and the tubes that run between them, the ureters.

UTIs can be caused by bacteria entering the system from the genital opening, and they may affect the upper or lower urinary tracts. UTIs are more common in women, though men can also develop them. See 5 Signs of a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) You Need To Know

Number 1. Wiping The Wrong Way

When it comes to proper bathroom hygiene, wiping from front to back is key for avoiding infection. This prevents bacteria from the anal area from spreading to the vaginal area. There are other risks associated with incorrect cleaning, such as developing candidiasis (thrush) or bacterial vaginosis.

Number 2. Tight Underwear

It’s important to wear the right kind of underwear to avoid developing a UTI. Tight underwear, pants, or jeans can restrict air flow and cause the vaginal area to become sweaty and moist. This can create an ideal environment for bacteria to grow and lead to an infection. Choose cotton or other natural fabrics instead of synthetic materials like nylon or spandex, which can be more constricting and lead to a higher risk of UTI.

Number 3. After Intercourse

UTIs are a very common infection that can be contracted after intercourse. This is because vaginal discharge, semen, and lubricants can reach the urethra, causing bacterial overgrowth and inflammation. In some cases, women also have negative reactions to the unfamiliar flora of a new sexual partner. It’s recommended to always urinate after intercourse so as not to risk any future health problems by flushing out foreign fluids and bacteria.

Number 4. Weakened Immune System

People with weak immune systems are more likely to get urinary tract infections. This is because the vagina is home to many substances and friendly bacteria that help prevent harmful bacteria from multiplying. However, when the immune system is weak due to poor diet, illness, or other infections, the bacteria can overgrow and affect other parts of the body. Additionally, diet and gut flora can play a big role in developing UTIs, so taking a probiotic can help ward them off.

Number 5. Certain Diseases

Have you ever wondered why people with spinal cord injuries and other nerve damage are more susceptible to urinary tract infections? It’s because these conditions can make it difficult for the bladder to completely empty, which gives bacteria a chance to grow. In addition, kidney stones, enlarged prostates, and other obstructions can cause a UTI. Diabetes can also be a problem because it weakens the body’s natural defenses.

Number 6. Birth Control Use

There are many types of birth control, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. For example, diaphragms coated with spermicide can increase your risk of UTIs. Spermicide can kill the good bacteria in the vagina and cause an imbalance in pH levels. This can create an environment where bacteria can easily travel to the urinary tract and bladder. Additionally, using spermicides or condoms can also increase your risk of Candida infections.

Number 7. Dehydration

Dehydration is no joke – it can lead to all sorts of health problems, including urinary tract infections (UTIs). Staying well hydrated is particularly important to prevent and ease the symptoms of urinary tract infections. When you have a UTI, increase your fluid intake substantially. Drink water, herbal teas and unsweetened cranberry juice to help prevent future UTIs.

Number 8. Going Through Menopause

As a woman goes through menopause, her estrogen levels fall and this can lead to urinary tract infections. This is because the vaginal wall and the urethra change, making it harder for women to control their bladder. If you have difficulty or pain when you urinate, or if you often wet yourself, you might have a UTI.

Number 9. Extended Use of Catheter

If you need to use a catheter to urinate, there is a risk of getting a urinary tract infection. This is because it is not natural for there to be a foreign object in the urethra for an extended period of time. People who are hospitalized generally have to use indwelling urinary catheters, which increase the risk of bladder, kidney, and urinary tract infections.

Number 10. Your Gender

Urinary tract infections are more common in women than in men. This is because the shorter urethra in women makes it easier for bacteria to travel to the bladder and cause infection. However, men can also get UTIs, and about half of all women will experience one at some point in their lives. For some women, UTIs can be a recurring problem, and the risk increases with age.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 2, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-a-urinary-tract-infection/,5 Signs of a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) You Need To Know,"If you’re experiencing pain and burning when you pee, it might be time to seek treatment for a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are caused by bacteria making its way to your bladder, and can affect both men and women. However, women are at a higher risk for UTIs than men due to their shorter urethras. While many UTI symptoms are obvious, some can be more subtle. If you’re experiencing any of these 5 symptoms, don’t hesitate to see your doctor.

1.You frequently feel the urge to go

You may have a UTI if you frequently feel the urge to urinate, even if you don’t actually go.

There are two types of reasons why you might feel like you always have to pee. Feeling like you can’t fully empty your bladder is one. This happens when there is swelling in the urethra or when the bladder is weak. The second is that you’re not emptying your bladder all the way and this is a sign of a UTI.

It’s definitely uncomfortable and a sign that you may need to seek treatment. Untreated UTIs can cause serious health problems, so if you think you might have one, see a doctor right away.

2. Your urine smells strange

A strong or strange odor from your urine may be a sign of a UTI.

If you’re noticing a change in the smell of your urine, it could be a sign that you have a UTI. Urine that smells sweet, ammonia-like, or fishy can indicate an infection. The bacteria present in the urinary tract is often the cause of this odor. However, it’s important to note that these changes in odor can also be a sign of something more serious.

3. You have flu-like symptoms

Some lesser-known symptoms of a UTI are fever, chills, and aches.

UTIs don’t have to be debilitating – here are some of the lesser-known symptoms to look out for if you think you might have one: 

A fever can be caused by any type of infection, while pain in the bladder area can be caused by inflammation. If the infection causes your abdominal muscles to contract, this can lead to stomach pain. 

These symptoms might not automatically indicate a UTI, but it’s worth discussing with your doctor just in case. An untreated UTI can spread to one or more kidneys, which can cause permanent damage to kidney function.

4. Your urine is bloody or cloudy

If your urine is cloudy or has blood in it, this could indicate an infection.

You should know what your urine looks like on a regular basis, so you will know if there is a change. Healthy and hydrated people have urine that is either colorless or light straw and honey colored. If you don’t drink enough fluids, your urine will be more concentrated and turn a darker yellow or amber color. If your urine is cloudy or milky, it might mean you have an infection. Blood in your urine can make it look red, pink, or brown like cola.

5. You have no symptoms at all

A urinary tract infection may have no symptoms at all, but can be treated with antibiotics.

The subtlest sign that you may have a urinary tract infection is when there’s no obvious symptoms. This is called asymptomatic bacteriuria and it can only be identified by testing your urine for bacteria. This type of infection needs treatment in some cases such as if a person is pregnant or about to undergo surgery near their urethra. Otherwise they will resolve on their own without any intervention from us! If you do need treatment for a UTI, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics.

Summary:

•Approximately 12 percent of men and 60 percent of women will suffer from a UTI at some point in their lifetime.

• UTIs occur when bacteria finds its way to your bladder. Women are at higher risk for UTIs than men because women have shorter urethras.

• Symptoms of a UTI can include: a frequent urge to urinate, strange-smelling urine, flu-like symptoms, cloudy or milky urine, and no symptoms at all.

• If you think you may have a UTI, consult your physician right away as an untreated UTI can spread to one or more kidneys and cause permanent damage.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-warning-signs-your-brain-is-infected/,5 Warning Signs Your Brain is Infected,"Brain infections are rare, but they can still happen. Brain infections occur when some infectious agent (bacteria, virus, fungi, or parasites) manages to make its way into the tissues of your brain.

If the cause is a virus, it can lead to meningitis, encephalitis, and cerebral palsy. Infections caused by bacteria are less common but can still lead to meningitis or abscesses. Fungal infections are also rare but can occur in people with compromised immune systems. The most dangerous infections are parasitic in nature because they can lead to seizures or coma.

Since brain infections can be lethal, early diagnosis and treatment is essential for preventing any complications. Here are some warning signs that your brain is infected.

1. You suddenly have memory problems

Dementia is a medical term used to describe a serious decline in cognitive function. For example, having problems with memory, language, attention, and executive functioning. While dementia is oftentimes simply due to aging, it can also be caused by an infection.

Many studies have shown that people with Alzheimer’s disease, which is one of the most common forms of dementia, are more likely to have had previous infections.

Additionally, some studies have suggested that certain viruses, like the herpes simplex virus type 1, may contribute to the formation of amyloid plaques. These plaques are believed to be one of the main causes for Alzheimer’s disease.

2. You’ve got a terrible headache that won’t go away

A headache after a night of partying or not drinking enough water is completely normal. Under normal circumstances, headaches shouldn’t occur too often or last for long periods of time.

If you have a headache that won’t go away, it could be a sign that your brain is infected. While this may sound concerning, brain infections are treatable with antibiotics.

However, it’s important to see a doctor as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis. Patients who have recently undergone surgery or sustained a head injury are most at risk for brain infections by bacteria.

Symptoms of a brain infection can vary depending on the cause but may include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and seizures.

3. You have trouble remembering words and can’t understand others

When you haven’t been sleeping well, you might experience difficulty understanding speech or speaking coherently. You might also just be having trouble hearing what someone is saying because of the surrounding noise. But if you keep forgetting words and have trouble understanding speech, it could be a sign that your brain is infected.

Brain infections often cause short term impairment in cognitive functions (including cognitive and motor capabilities as well as emotional and behavioral functions).

Brain infections that are left untreated can lead to more widespread inflammatory changes in your brain. These changes can lead to alterations of intracranial pressure. In the worst case scenario, you fall into a coma. When this occurs, it can lead to more long-term complications related to thinking, motor functions, and psychological signs and symptoms.

4. You’re having seizures

Seizures have a variety of reasons why they happen. But if they happen suddenly and without warning, it may be because of an infection in the brain. This is usually due to a viral or bacterial infection that has made its way into your nervous system.

Seizures caused by an infection may also be followed by other neurological symptoms, like altered consciousness, confusion, and memory loss. If you experience any of these symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.

5. You’re experiencing changes in mood or behavior

It’s normal to feel under the weather sometimes, but any change in mood or behavior that is seen long-term could be a sign that something is wrong.

Infections of the brain can be very serious, and even life-threatening, so it’s vital to pay close attention to any changes in your mood or behavior and seek professional help if needed. Some things to look out for include changes in energy levels, sleep patterns, appetite, and mood; feeling confused or disoriented, and experiencing tremors or seizures.

Your brain is the control center for your entire body. So when it gets infected, an inflammatory response of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord can occur. This can cause delirium, a condition where you feel confused and disoriented.

Similarly, encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain itself, can lead to changes in personality and even hallucinations. In short, infections of the brain can have a wide range of psychological effects, depending on the specific infection and the individual’s own physiology.

Bottom Line

A brain infection can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Among the different types of brain infections like encephalitis, brain abscesses, and cerebral toxoplasmosis, meningitis is usually caused by bacteria. It’s a deadly illness that can kill even healthy people within days.

The most common symptoms of brain infection include fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, and seizures. In severe cases, a brain infection can lead to coma or death.

It’s important to remember that each type of infection has its own set of symptoms. Treatment usually requires hospitalization and the use of antibiotics or other medication. In some cases, surgery may also be necessary to remove the infection.

With early diagnosis and quick treatment, the majority of individuals with a brain infection can make a full recovery. However, there are still some cases where permanent damage or even death can occur.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 1, 2022"

When used together, almond oil and vitamin E oil help treat under-eye puffiness and lighten dark circles. This is because of the combination of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties these two oils offer. Almond oil is also a source of retinol and vitamin K, which helps keep the sensitive skin around your eyes smooth, when combined with vitamin E. Mix a drop of each oil and apply it onto your under-eye area, lightly dabbing.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-stops-calcium-buildup-in-arteries/,1 Vitamin Stops Calcium Buildup in Arteries and Heart,"Did you know that vitamin K2 can prevent calcium buildup in the arteries? This is an important compound for our cardiovascular system. I’m going to talk about how it works, and then we’ll get into some great sources of this super-vitamin! Ready?

First off: There are two main kinds of vitamin K:

K1 which comes from green leafy vegetables like spinach and is important for blood clotting; and vitamin K2 found mostly in animal foods and fermented ones too. Many people don’t know about vitamin K2. It can prevent calcium buildup in the arteries and thus prevent clogging, helping to keep your heart healthy!

Let me first tell you some common foods where vitamin K2 is found.

If we look closely, there’s really nothing that can compare to a healthy diet. No supplements required!

Natto is a Japanese dish that is made from fermented soybeans. It is high in vitamin K2. Some other good food choices that are high in vitamin K2 are eel, many types of cheeses (raclette, gouda, Jarlsberg, edam are some examples), beef liver, grass-fed butter, dark meat like goose leg, sauerkraut and egg yolks – especially from pastured chickens.

You can get calcium from many different sources…

such as dark green leafy vegetables, dairy products, and almond milk. You don’t need to take a supplement unless your doctor tells you to.

What is important is vitamin D…

and the best way to get our vitamin D is from the sun. But sunlight can be dangerous if you’re exposed to too much ultraviolet radiation, or you may not be getting outside as much as you should. That’s why many people are deficient in vitamin D.

Without Vitamin D, our bones can’t absorb the calcium that they need to stay healthy. But it gets worse! If this calcium builds up in your blood vessels or heart and blocks your blood from delivering oxygen and nutrients to your cells and tissues – you could have a stroke if the block is in your brain or heart attack if the block is to your heart.

Vitamin K2 reduces the amount of calcium that gets into your blood vessels and helps to keep your bones strong, which can prevent osteoporosis.

If you’re looking to supplement K2, here’s what you need to know.

There are two types of vitamin K2 supplements: MK4 and MK7. MK4 has a shorter half-life than MK7. This means that it doesn’t stay in your system as long as MK7 does. Additionally, MK4 gets into your system more quickly, but it doesn’t stick around as long.

Mk7 can be taken once daily. You may notice that the supplement label says you should take between 90 and 100 micrograms, and up to 200 micrograms can be taken if your want. Taking Mk7 with vitamin D is optional, although it is recommended because vitamin D plays an essential role in many chemical changes that occur throughout our body. When selecting a form of Vitamin D, choose D3 and not D2 as this is the one which will be most bioavailable to your body for optimal results .

However, there is nothing better than getting vitamin K2 from your food. It will make a big difference for you.

Summary:

•Vitamin K2 is important for preventing calcium buildup in the arteries and clogging of the arteries.

• Vitamin K2 can be found in animal foods, fermented foods, and some cheeses.

• Natto, eel, beef liver, chicken, grass-fed butter, sauerkraut, egg yolks are all high in vitamin K2. 

• Vitamin D is also necessary for calcium absorption into bones. 

• You can supplement with MK4 or MK7 forms of vitamin K2, but whole foods are best.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/eat-carbs-without-spiking-blood-sugar-levels/,3 Ways to Eat Carbs Without Spiking Your Blood Sugar Levels,"Keeping your blood sugar levels under control isn’t easy. This is especially true for the millions of people living with type 2 diabetes. Having high blood sugar levels too often can put you at risk of long-term complications like heart or kidney disease, and nerve damage.

While quitting or cutting back on junk food and soda pops is a great way to prevent your blood sugar levels from spiking, it’s not the only thing you can do. Not many people know this, but there are ways for you to still enjoy foods like bread, rice, and potatoes. Keep on reading to learn how you can eat carbohydrates without having to worry about your blood sugar levels spiking.

1. Cook it and let it cool

Cooking and cooling carbohydrate-rich foods like rice, potatoes, and oats before eating them can significantly lower their impact on your blood sugar and insulin levels.

One study found that cooking rice and then cooling it for 24 hours before reheating it for consumption greatly lowered the glycemic response when compared to eating freshly cooked rice. 

Another study found similar results with potatoes. Researchers concluded that high glycemic and insulinemic features commonly associated with potato meals can be reduced by refrigerating the potatoes before eating them.

So, what’s going on?

How can these carb-rich foods have such different impacts on your blood sugar and insulin just by changing their cooking method?

According to the research, when these foods cool down after being cooked, some of the starch they contain slowly transforms into resistant starch.

As the name implies, these types of starches are resistant to digestion. They pass through your gut without being digested, which is similar to soluble fiber. And because they’re not being digested and broken down into glucose, they don’t require any insulin.

In recent years, resistant starch has been found to improve insulin sensitivity, lower blood sugar levels, reduce appetite and offer various other benefits for digestion.

All you have to do to get all these amazing benefits is to cook your rice, potatoes or oats and then leave them in your fridge overnight. And you can just reheat them right before you eat.

2. Save your carbs for last

The order in which you eat your food can affect your blood sugar levels. That’s why this strategy requires that you eat your carbohydrate-rich portion of your meal after the other foods that are on your plate.

Here’s what the food consumption order for better blood sugar control looks like:

dietary fiber (vegetables)
protein (beans, eggs, fish, meat)
starch (rice, bread, pasta)

So, imagine you’re having a steak with green beans and mashed potatoes. In this case, you would eat the green beans first, followed by your steak, and then finish with the potatoes.

One study had participants with type 2 diabetes eat the same meal three days in a row. On the first day, participants ate the carbohydrate portion of the meal first followed by their protein and vegetable portion.

On the second day, researchers had the patients eat the protein and the vegetables first and kept the carbs for the end. On the last day, the participants ate everything together without any clear order.

Study participants had their Insulin levels tested before eating and after eating every 30 minutes for the following three hours.

The results showed that insulin levels were significantly lower after the meal when the carbohydrate portion was eaten last.

So how can you make use of this if you’re eating something like a pasta dish or a rice dish where everything is mixed together?

A simple solution is to try eating a salad or a protein based appetizer first. Just make sure the appetizer you eat has little to no carbs. Doing this before you dig into the carb portion of your meal will greatly improve your blood sugar and insulin levels.

3. Just add vinegar

Did you know that consuming vinegar before or with your carbohydrates can help to lower your blood sugar and insulin response. And it’s as simple as drinking a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar diluted in water before your meal. You also have the option of adding white vinegar to your meal.

In one study, researchers found that adding vinegar to a meal helped lower glycemic and insulinemic response. 

Participants in the study were given one and a half tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (ACV), two minutes before a high carb meal that included a bagel and orange juice.

The results showed that the group that consumed the ACV were up to 34 percent more insulin sensitive an hour after eating compared to the group that consumed the placebo.

The reason why vinegar works is because it contains acetic acid, which increases the speed at which our muscles can absorb glucose.

Each time we consume carbs, they are broken down into single sugar molecules and absorbed in our gut to enter our bloodstream. The presence of glucose in our blood triggers the release of insulin to signal our cells, mainly our muscle cells to absorb the glucose. Apple cider vinegar and regular vinegar helps to speed up this process.

If you don’t like the taste of ACV, you can add a squirt of lemon juice or try diluting it in sparkling water instead. As mentioned previously, you can also add vinegar to a salad as an appetizer if you don’t want to drink the vinegar directly.

Bottom Line

One last thing to note is to avoid apple cider vinegar in the form of supplements or gummies. They are not as effective as the liquid form.

If you can apply all of these three tips together or on their own, you’ll be able to enjoy carbs while keeping your blood sugar levels under control. It may seem like a lot of work, but any changes to your eating habits will require some getting used to.  

If you already have type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance, you’ll have to still manage your carb intake. But with these effective strategies, you won’t have to completely remove your favorite carbs from your diet.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 31, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/surprising-signs-of-heart-disease/,4 Surprising Signs of Heart Disease Most People Ignore,"There is a good reason that heart disease is often referred to as a “silent killer.” According to Harvard Medical School, nearly half of all heart attacks are misdiagnosed as less serious issues. In addition to the obvious signs of heart disease—such as chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and nausea—there are more subtle signs to look for. Being aware of these unexpected signs may save your life, so keep reading.

1.Radiating Jaw and Neck Pain

Discomfort associated with heart conditions is not limited to chest pain. It is possible to experience jaw and neck discomfort as a result of heart issues such as heart disease or heart attack. Pain that radiates to the jaw and neck from the chest could be a sign of an irregular heartbeat or heart disease.

Heart attack symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating, though jaw or neck pain may be signs of heart problems if they worsen when you are active and cease when you rest. It’s important to seek medical attention if you experience jaw or neck pain.

2.Sexual Problems

Clinical research has demonstrated that heart disease can have a detrimental effect on sex lives, including both men and women.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) may be an early indicator of arterial damage and heart disease for men. It is caused by hardening of the arteries or endothelial dysfunction, in which the blood vessels are unable to expand and contract properly. Arterial injury and heart disease are connected with the reduced blood flow to the penis and endothelial dysfunction.

Eighty-seven percent of women with heart failure were reported to have a high degree of sexual dysfunction, including vaginal dryness, discomfort during intercourse, and low libido in a 2007 study. Endothelial dysfunction is the reason behind all of these symptoms, and it may lead to circulatory problems, plaque buildup in the arteries, blockages, and heart attacks.

3.Calf Cramping

If you experience leg pain or discomfort while walking, it might be a sign of heart issues. Calf cramping, aching, or numbness while walking could be due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is a condition in which the blood vessels supplying your organs and limbs become obstructed, resulting in lower blood flow.

Other PAD symptoms include leg ulcers, poor hair growth, and skin colour changes. This is a common condition that causes calf pain while exercising and relief while resting. Atherosclerosis (a buildup of plaque in the arteries) can disrupt blood flow to the legs, leading to heart attack or stroke. PAD can be caused by atherosclerosis.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), nearly half of Americans have atherosclerosis and do not know it. If you experience calf cramping, pain, numbness, or discomfort while walking, talk with your doctor about whether it may indicate heart problems.

4.Bad Breath

What is the connection between bad breath and heart disease? Gum disease is the connection. Gum disease might be connected to a number of heart problems, including hardening of the arteries, blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes, according to Dentistry IQ.

People with gum disease are twice as likely to develop heart issues such as heart attacks and strokes. Bacteria accumulate on the tongue, teeth, and gums, leading to bad breath.

According to the AARP, this bacteria may enter the bloodstream through bleeding or diseased gums, which are associated with clogged arteries and strokes. As a result, bacteria entering the bloodstream may also cause high blood vessel inflammation, which may increase your risk of heart disease.

Gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, is an infection of your gums that can cause tooth loss and pain. It’s caused by bacteria from plaque buildup in the spaces between your teeth. Plaque is composed of bacteria, food particles, and other substances that can build up over time if you don’t brush and floss regularly.

When gum disease starts, the bacteria that live in your mouth spread to the areas around your mouth and start to multiply. This causes an inflammation on the surface of your gums. When this happens, the gums become red, swollen, and painful.

After this happens, the bacteria begin to break down tissue around your teeth. This can cause tooth decay or even damage to bone surrounding your teeth. This can result in loose teeth and a bad experience with eating and drinking.

Talk to your physician if you’re concerned about your heart health. They can assess your symptoms and determine the optimal course of care for you.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/spice-reverse-clogged-arteries/,1 Spice May Help Reverse Clogged Arteries and Lower Blood Pressure,"Cayenne pepper has been used as a natural medicine for centuries, and its popularity is only increasing. Cayenne pepper contains capsaicin, which is a compound that has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardio-protective properties.

THIS spice reverses hypertension…

When it comes to heart health, read on to learn about the powerful benefits of what cayenne pepper can do for you.

In animal studies, cayenne pepper was found to improve blood flow and regulate cardiac function. It also inhibited the growth of cancer cells in test tubes.

These findings suggest that cayenne pepper may be able to help reduce the risk of heart disease or stroke.

The anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties of capsaicin in cayenne pepper help to reduce the formation of fatty plaques, arteries, and blood vessels.

By lowering blood pressure and increasing the release of nitric oxide and other vasodilators, capsaicin promotes blood flow to tissues.

Your arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to all parts of the body.

Arteries have smooth muscle cells that help control blood pressure and contract the vessel walls in response to stress or excitement.

Now, because we’re under lots of stress, and cortisol and adrenaline being raised, what happens is the sympathetic nervous system causes your blood vessels to constrict.

Vasoconstriction is the term used to describe the narrowing of blood vessels due to a decrease in blood flow. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, icy hands and feet, dizziness, headache, and fatigue.

Now, in order for blood to flow through the arteries to those cells and organs of the body, the heart must pump harder, thus increasing blood pressure. However, cayenne pepper and nitric oxide boosters help to keep the arteries open.

Capsaicin keeps your blood pressure in check, and takes pressure off your heart, allowing for adequate circulation to all cells of your body so you can stay healthy.

By increasing blood circulation, cayenne pepper helps lower plaque formation in the arteries.

The anti-inflammatory properties of cayenne pepper are what make it so powerful.

It inhibits the development of inflammation in the arteries which triggers plaque accumulation.

It also helps reduce LDL, or bad cholesterol, which is the nasty cholesterol that forms as plaque in the inner layer of our arterial walls.

Capsaicin and cayenne pepper, according to studies, also boost your metabolism.

When your metabolism rises, you use energy faster to burn fat stores, resulting in an increase in metabolism. It also decreases your appetite, resulting in a sense of fullness that encourages you to eat less.

So here’s the bottom line. Yes, cayenne pepper may help you burn more calories. It may help you lose weight by stimulating your metabolism.

And when your arteries are healthy, it will have a significant impact on your cardiovascular system.

By taking cayenne pepper, hopefully we can avoid heart attacks and strokes, but the most important thing is the powerful anti-inflammatories and antioxidants can be really beneficial for your health.

So how often should you take it?

There isn’t enough scientific evidence to recommend any specific dosage schedule for cayenne pepper; however, experts usually recommend taking small doses regularly throughout the day (for example, adding 1 or 2 tablespoons to your food or take it raw). Taking large doses at once might not be effective because it could cause nausea or other side effects.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 30, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/eating-habits-fight-anxiety-depression-stress/,"5 Eating Habits That Fight Anxiety, Depression, and Stress","We’re taught from a young age that eating healthy helps us look and feel our best. But what we’re not always told is how important nutrition is to our mental health. A well-balanced diet can help us think clearly, increase our focus, and help us feel more alert. It can also improve concentration and attention span.

Conversely, a diet that’s loaded with processed foods can lead to fatigue, impaired decision-making, and slower reaction time. In fact, a poor diet can actually aggravate stress and depression. Here are five eating habits you should follow instead.

1. Stop eating junk food.

One of the biggest problems plaguing society is our reliance on processed foods. People who consume chips and cookies on a regular basis are more likely to experience “everyday mental lapses” in the form of low productivity and forgetfulness. If that wasn’t bad already, eating junk food has also been found to increase your risk of depression, anxiety, and stress.

Why you’re always craving junk food

A lot of the processed foods we eat are highly addictive because their ingredients stimulate the dopamine centers in our brain, which are associated with pleasure and reward. In other words, the more junk food you eat, the more you crave them.

Highly inflammatory

Processed foods tend to be high in refined carbs and sugar. These ingredients are highly inflammatory and can spread throughout your body and brain. This can contribute to mood disorders, including anxiety and depression.

Eating a poor diet during periods of stress and depression will only make things worse. But quitting junk food isn’t easy. Luckily, there is something you can swap your chips for that’s also convenient to prepare and tasty to eat – fruits. And this brings us to our next eating habit you should develop…

2. Snack on the rainbow!

There is no shortage of studies that support the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. One peer-reviewed study published the journal Nutrients in 2020 found that eating fresh produce can benefit mental health by improving sleep quality, mood, and energy levels, while lowering stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.

Fruits and veggies deliver nutrients like vitamins and minerals, as well as fiber and water. These things are needed by the body to support brain function. For example, vitamin C, which is found in many fruits, provides key protection to our organs, including the brain.

In addition, one study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that eating fruit on a regular basis decreased levels of depression and anxiety regardless of the portion size or type of fruit. So next time you’re feeling down in the dumps, try snacking on fruits!

The feel good hormone

Fruits and vegetables can also help with the synthesis of serotonin, which regulates mood. That’s because your gut produces about 95 percent of the serotonin in your body. So eating foods that promote bacteria that improve gut-brain communications and cognitive function will lead to a better mood.

3. Eat more fermented foods.

Within your gut exists a communication network called the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is two thin layers of more than 100 million nerve cells lining your gastrointestinal tract from esophagus to rectum.

Through this enteric nervous system, your gut and brain are constantly in communication with each other. Studies show that an unhealthy gastrointestinal tract can alter the gut-brain relationship and negatively impact your mood, cognition, and mental health.

Your gut-brain connection relies on a healthy gut microbiome. This means that you need to eat plenty of foods that promote the good bacteria in your gut. Eating fermented foods that are high in fiber, probiotics, and phytonutrients has been linked with improved cognition including memory, mood, and executive function.

Try eating up to 30 different kinds of fresh produce each week or try adding kimchi or sauerkraut to your diet. This will help build a diverse gut microbiome, which will improve digestion, strengthen your immune system and ultimately better your mental well-being.

4. Don’t skip the fish!

Along with eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, eating fish regularly can boost mental health and reduce the risk of dementia. The essential omega-3 fatty acids found in fish have been proven to decrease the risk of depression and prevent age-related mental and cognitive decline.

It’s recommended to consume one or two three-ounce servings of fatty fish per week. You can eat fish like salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines. Getting more omega-3 fatty acids into your diet will reduce your risk of depression and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as heart disease and stroke.

5. Practice mindful eating

Very few people do this, but paying attention to how you feel after a meal, is a great way to make sure that you’re eating a well-balanced diet. Taking the time to document what, where and when you eat is a great way to gain insight into your eating patterns.

If you find you overeat junk food whenever you’re stressed, it would be better to stop what you’re doing when the urge to eat arises, and to write down your thoughts. Doing this may not seem like much but it can help you discover what’s really bothering you instead of trying to cover it up with junk food.

Sometimes, stress and depression are severe and can’t be managed through your diet alone. If you find it hard to control your eating habits, you should seek professional counseling. You don’t have to face every difficult situation alone. Just remember, asking for help is never a sign of weakness or failure.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 30, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/eyes-reveal-brain-health/,4 Things Your Eyes Reveal About Your Brain Health,"Your eyes tell a story. They can reveal information about your cognitive health, your stress levels, and your overall health. In this article, we explore four things your eyes may reveal about your brain health. As you’ll discover, changes in your vision may be signs of neurological problems.

Perfect Vision in 7 Seconds? Just do this…

Your eyes can see up to 200 degrees in all directions and recognize millions of colors. They are connected straight to your brain, and therefore can provide important clues about your cognitive function.

Vision accounts for almost 70% of your brain function and 80% of all sensory data goes through your eyes. According to the American Optometric Association (AOA), the eyes are often the first to display a problem in many neurological disorders.

Read on to learn what signs to look out for, as well as when it is time to contact your doctor.

Number 1.Peripheral vision is reduced.

We are using our peripheral vision when we see something out of the corner of our eye.

Peripheral vision is the ability to see things that are not directly in front of you. It’s important for tasks like driving, using a computer, and avoiding obstacles.

The central part of your eye focuses on what you’re looking at while the peripheral parts of your eyes take in information from all around it. This allows you to see everything close to or far away from what you’re focusing on.

When peripheral vision is decreased, it could be an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. In people with Alzheimer’s disease, even if their eyes are physically healthy, their brains are not adequately processing visual information.

People living with Alzheimer’s disease often experience mild to severe vision impairment. This is because of the cognitive decline and memory loss that are common symptoms of this condition.

There are several factors that may contribute to vision decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease, including decreased blood flow to the eyes; nerve damage; confusion about where things are located in space; and difficulty focusing on objects because of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation.

Make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible if you notice changes in your peripheral vision or other eye abnormalities that concern you.

Number 2.Blurred vision.

A variety of factors may cause blurry vision, and a few of them are simple to fix. Maybe your desk is near an air conditioner blowing air into your eyes all day, or perhaps you need a new eyeglasses prescription. But other reasons for blurry vision are serious causes for concern.

Uncorrected refractive errors, binocular vision impairment, ocular and systemic illnesses, and fatal situations such as brain tumors may also cause blurred vision.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is another potential serious cause of blurred vision. This is a serious inflammatory condition that affects the brain and spinal cord.

MS causes damage to the myelin sheath, which is a protective layer surrounding nerve cells. This damage can cause vision problems, including blurry or double vision. There are several reasons MS might cause blurred vision.

First, MS may attack the optic nerves directly, leading to blindness in one or both eyes.

Second, blood flow to the eyes may be impaired because of inflammation and scarring in the eye area.

Third, damaged nerve cells may not be able to send clear signals to the eyeballs about where objects are located.

Number 3.Double vision.

Do you see stars when you accidentally hit your head? Jokes aside, visual problems are a common sign of a brain injury.

A brain injury can cause double vision because there is a disruption in the visual pathway. This disruption may be caused by damage to the eye itself, or to nerves that lead from the eye to the brain.

Double vision can also be caused by problems with your eyesight, such as refractive errors, or by abnormalities in how your eyes move and focus.

The most common type of brain injury that leads to double vision is called an optic neuritis. This condition occurs when inflammation and swelling inside the sheath surrounding nerve fibers in the eye damages them.

When you suffer any kind of brain trauma, no matter how insignificant it may seem, it’s vital to get examined by a doctor.

Number 4.Loss of vision.

A detached retina may cause a loss of vision, but so can a brain tumor.

A brain tumor can cause loss of vision because it may obstruct the pathways that carry visual information to the body’s periphery. This can lead to several problems, including decreased depth perception and difficulty reading. Sometimes, tumors may also affect a person’s eyesight directly, causing them to lose their sight completely.

Your eyes can tell us a lot about how healthy your brain is. When you notice changes in vision, visit an eye doctor for a complete checkup. That way, you can get the best treatment for any issues that may be brewing inside your head.

This New “Dream Machine” Has Been Putting Me Into A Deep, Drug-Free Sleep Every Night – In 8 Minutes Flat!

When we aren’t getting enough sleep, it impacts our health. Sleep deprivation has been linked to weight gain, depression, heart disease, reduced cognitive function and more.

One fruit, however, may make a significant difference in how quickly and deeply you sleep.

Pineapple is a delicious fruit loaded with fiber, minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients, and offers many health benefits.

Bromelain, a proteolytic enzyme that aids in reducing inflammation and swelling inside our bodies, is found in this fruit. It’s great for aches, sprains, as well as joint problems.

Pineapple is filled with vitamin C, which can do a lot of wonderful things for our body. It aids in the formation of collagen and is a powerful antioxidant. It nourishes our skin while strengthening muscles and blood vessels. And it boosts our immune system.

This tropical fruit gives you lots of satiety, so you won’t overeat. It aids in weight loss. It helps control levels of glucose and insulin by slowing digestion down from the stomach to the small intestine.

And potassium is found in pineapples, which helps prevent muscular cramps and other fatigue-related symptoms. Potassium also helps keep your body’s electrolyte equilibrium in check.

Because of their enzymes and antioxidants, pineapples are a fantastic detoxifier. If you’re constipated, eating pineapple will help stimulate peristalsis. Peristalsis refers to the wave-like muscular contractions that enables food to move through the digestive tract.

Since bromelain may protect the body against autoimmune disorders, pineapples are an excellent food for the thyroid gland.

Having one cup of pineapple before bed can make a tremendous difference, because pineapple is filled with melatonin.

Pineapple is rich in melatonin, which may help you sleep better after eating one cup before bed.

Melatonin is a hormone which is produced by the pineal gland in our brain and can help reset our circadian rhythm, also known as our 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. It can help us fall asleep much faster and sleep more deeply at night.

Researchers found that after eating pineapple, your body’s melatonin levels could increase by 266%. This is powerful because melatonin can help people sleep without being invasive.

If you have a little pineapple at bedtime, it may help ensure a good night of sleep. It’s best if the pineapple is in whole rather than juice form.

Why is that? Fiber aids glucose entry into cells, prevents blood sugar from rising, and helps the body relax so it may sleep better.

If you’re fighting insomnia, why not try pineapple before bed tonight? It may just help give you the restful sleep you desire.

Bonus: another fruit that is naturally abundant in melatonin is cherries (particularly sour cherries like the Montmorency variety).

https://dailyhealthpost.com/belly-fat-slowly-killing-you/,5 Ways to Know If Your Belly Fat Is Slowly Killing You,"Most of us are well aware of the health risks that are associated with having too much body fat. But did you know that not all belly fat is bad for you? Belly fat that is found directly under the skin is called subcutaneous fat.

The belly fat that is harmful is the unseen fat around your organs, otherwise known as visceral fat. Having a high waist-to-hip ratio is usually a sign of having too much visceral fat. This type of fat is associated with a higher risk of developing certain health conditions.

1. Decreased Lung Function

A team of Finnish researchers found that a large waist circumference is related to decreased lung volume and function. In comparison with other healthy, non-smoking adults who did not have excess abdominal fat, those who carried more fat performed far more poorly on spirometry (breath measurement) tests.

Over time, this decreased lung function can lead to a narrowing of the airway and ultimately chronic lung diseases like asthma.

2. Arterial Degeneration

One study found a significant correlation between abdominal obesity and high incidence of atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness.

The researchers studied both individuals with abdominal obesity and general obesity, as well as healthy individuals, and discovered that for every 0.1 increase in the waist to height ratio, arterial issues worsened.

This tendency was particularly pronounced in people with excess abdominal fat. Arterial degeneration can lead to stroke and various forms of heart disease.

3. Poor Blood Sugar Regulation

Visceral fat produces a number of hormones that can wreak havoc on your metabolic system. These hormones can trigger changes to insulin receptors in your body, meaning that insulin starts to become less effective in helping to regulate your blood sugar levels. This is, of course, one of the major causes of diabetes.

4. Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease

It turns out that what’s going on in your gut can have a big effect on your brain. One study found that a high waist-to-hip ratio, as well as the presence of abdominal visceral fat in general, is linked with low brain volume. Low brain volume is linked with general dementia and may also be a contributing factor in Alzheimer’s disease.

5. High Cholesterol

Visceral fat can be turned into free fatty acids by the body, which results in the production of LDL (also known as “bad”) cholesterol and triglycerides. In addition, the free fatty acids also reduce the body’s level of HDL (also known as “good”) cholesterol. Along with abdominal obesity’s relationship with arterial degeneration, the cholesterol-related effects of excess belly fat are a perfect storm for heart disease, high blood pressure, and stroke.

How to prevent visceral fat?

Where you tend to store your fat is largely dictated by your genes, but if you have excess abdominal fat, there are ways to minimize your risk.

According to the experts, exercise is the best way to get rid of that visceral fat, even more so than calorie restriction (although sticking to a healthy diet is always a good idea).

Aim for half an hour to an hour of exercise most days of the week, and with determination, you should be able to shrink your belly and your chances of developing any of these long-term health problems.

How to calculate the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)?

To calculate your WHR, all you have to do is divide your waist circumference by your hip circumference. Measurements can be recorded in either centimeters (cm) or inches (in) without affecting the ratio.

For example, if a person’s waist circumference is 80 cm (31.5 in) and their hip circumference is 90 cm (35.5 in) then their WHR ratio would be 0.89 cm.

What is a healthy ratio?

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), having a WHR of over 1.0 may increase the risk of developing conditions that relate to being overweight, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

A healthy WHR for women is 0.85 or less and 0.9 or less for men.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 28, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/hands-lung-health/,What Your Hands Could Be Telling You About Your Lung Health,"Traditional respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort, are frequently present in lung disorders. Yet, according to experts, your lungs may impact other organs in your body as well, some of which you may not realize.

For example, your hands may reveal surprising signs about your pulmonary health. Read on to learn about additional subtle symptoms to watch out for, as well as how your hands can signal trouble with your lungs.

1.Rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of autoimmune condition that results in inflammation in the joints. RA sufferers frequently have stiffness, pain, and swelling in their wrist and hand, as well as other body parts such as the eyes, lungs and heart.

There are no definite factors that cause RA, but scientists have identified a few genes that may be responsible for the disorder.

According to experts, having rheumatoid arthritis increases your risk of certain lung disorders. Interstitial lung disease, lung nodules, pleural disease, and minor airway restriction are the most prevalent lung disorders linked to rheumatoid arthritis, according to the Mayo Clinic.

If you have rheumatoid arthritis and experience any unexpected breathing difficulties, contact your physician promptly, Mayo Clinic specialists recommend.

Treatment may be focused on the rheumatoid arthritis. In some situations, the immune system is suppressed with medicine or fluid around the lungs is removed via surgery. If you are over 65 years of age, have asthma, or respiratory problems caused by smoking, your doctor may also consider lung function tests.

2.Finger clubbing

When the tip of a finger swells as a result of extra soft tissue beneath the nail beds, it is referred to as finger clubbing. Most finger clubbing cases are linked to lung cancer, according to Mount Sinai. Other lung disorders, such as persistent lung infections and interstitial lung disease, may also induce clubbing.

Infectious endocarditis (an infection of the heart muscle lining), liver illness, or an overactive thyroid are rare non-lung causes that may be responsible. Bring it to your doctor’s attention if you notice your fingers have become rounded and bulbous at the tips, or if your fingernails have changed shape.

3. Blue nail beds

Pulmonary hypertension occurs when blood pressure increases in the lungs’ arteries because of the narrowing of blood vessels. Some patients who experience pulmonary hypertension develop heart failure as the right ventricle of the heart weakens under the strain of elevated blood pressure.

When blood pressure in the lungs’ arteries rises due to narrowed blood vessels, pulmonary hypertension occurs. The right ventricle of the heart weakens under the strain high blood pressure. Some patients with pulmonary hypertension may progress to heart failure.

Your likelihood of pulmonary hypertension can be assessed by looking for a blue tint in the nail beds, according to the Cleveland Clinic. This discoloration is linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and may develop as a consequence of decreased oxygen in the bloodstream if pulmonary hypertension worsens.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of lung disease that causes airflow limitation. As COPD worsens, the air sacs in the lungs may over-expand and eventually break down. This can lead to a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream and an increased risk for developing complications such as pulmonary hypertension that could be life-threatening.

4.Poor grip strength

Cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, exhaustion, and chest tightness are just a few of the symptoms that can occur with COPD. Meanwhile, some doctors believe you may detect another sign in your hands: reduced grip strength.

Around 72% of individuals with COPD experience this symptom, while 28% do not, according to a 2021 research published in the BMC Pulmonary Medicine journal.

Within a year of the study’s start, those with decreased grip strength were 3 times more likely to seek treatment for their COPD symptoms in the emergency room than those with normal grip strength. This implies that as COPD progresses, grip strength in many patients decreases.

5.Pain and swelling

Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease triggered by unknown causes. The lymph nodes become enlarged and persistently enlarged, so they look like a mass under the skin. Patients with sarcoidosis may also experience a characteristic set of arthritis-like symptoms that worsen if untreated.

In sarcoidosis, microscopic clusters of inflammatory cells (granulomas) develop in any region of your body, particularly the lungs and lymph nodes, according to the Mayo Clinic. Dry coughing, shortness of breath, and feeling tired are among the most common symptoms.

Sarcoidosis affects different parts of the body besides the lungs. It is linked to the development of cysts in the hands, feet, and other bone regions of the body, which may cause discomfort and swelling. If you experience any of the following or similar symptoms, speak with your doctor.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/feet-liver-health/,4 Things Your Feet Could Be Telling You About Your Liver Health,"It’s important to keep your liver in good condition if you want to stay healthy. Your liver performs over 500 important functions, including blood filtering, waste disposal, and bile production, making it the largest organ in the human body. Recognizing when your liver’s health has been harmed is critical, and certain indicators may appear in your feet if your liver is in trouble.

Keep reading to discover four ways your feet may give you a warning about the condition of your liver, as well as when to visit the doctor.

1. Swelling in your legs, ankles, feet

According to experts, one of the following related liver disorders might cause fluid accumulation in your legs, ankles, or feet: hepatitis B, hepatitis, C, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, or even liver cancer.

The Cleveland Clinic says that if you have hepatitis B or hepatitis C, you have an elevated risk of liver cancer since these illnesses frequently progress to cirrhosis. Any cause of liver disease may progress to cirrhosis, increasing your risk of liver cancer.

Early consultation with your physician about your symptoms may help avoid future liver damage, they say.

2. Numbness or a tingling sensation.

Because of a hepatitis C infection or alcoholic liver disease, people with liver problems may experience tingling or numbness in their feet. Diabetes, which is more prevalent in those with liver issues since the liver controls glucose levels, may also lead to it. Peripheral neuropathy, which affects the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord, is caused by all three conditions.

Any of the aforementioned symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic, would be adequate reason for a visit to a doctor. If you have persistent swelling that doesn’t improve at all after two to five days of home treatment, persistent pain that doesn’t improve after many weeks, or burning pain, numbness, or tingling particularly involving most or all of your foot, they suggest calling your doctor.

3. Pain in your foot joints.

Each of your feet has 26 bones and 33 joints, making them ideal places for arthritis. Liver disorders are among the possible causes of this foot discomfort, which has a broad spectrum of symptoms.

The Cleveland Clinic explains that both cirrhosis-related illness and cirrhosis itself may cause pain.

You may also have osteoarthritis and cirrhosis, which makes your bone and joint pain worse, their experts say, citing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as an example.

In addition, cirrhosis generates an inflammatory condition throughout your whole body. General pain may be caused by inflammation and your body’s response to it.

4. Itchiness in your feet.

Some patients develop itchy skin on their hands and feet in advanced cases of hepatitis.

You may develop a condition called pruritus, which causes your skin to itch terribly. Itching can be isolated to your hands and feet, which is common.

Even without pruritus, side effects of treatment, may dry out your skin and cause itching. As a result, moisturizing techniques must be followed correctly.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 28, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/spine-exercises-lower-back-pain/,Top 7 Spine Exercises to Get Rid of Lower Back Pain Forever,"Lower back pain is the leading cause of global disability and it’s been steadily increasing since the 90s. Nearly 80% of the population will experience lower back pain at some time during their lives.

For most, the clinical course is benign, with 95% of those afflicted recovering within a few months of onset. Some, however, will not recover and will develop chronic lower back pain, which is defined as lasting 3 months or longer.

What causes lower back pain?

Lower back pain can be caused by many things. For example, it could be a symptom of an underlying condition, like kidney stones or acute pancreatitis. But in most cases, lower back pain is usually caused by living a sedentary lifestyle.

While many believe that low back pain is an unsolvable condition, that is simply not true. With the right exercise and consistency, you can strengthen your spine, and end back pain forever. Here’s a list of the top exercises you can do to prevent lower back pain:

1. Walking

Walking is one of the best things you can do for chronic lower back pain. A 2019 meta-analysis found that walking was just as effective as exercise and rehab exercises in treating chronic low back pain. Ten to fifteen minutes of walking twice a day will help ease your lower back pain.

The key to any walking program is to start right away. Here are some tips to prevent lower back pain while walking:

Start with a short, 5 to 10-minute walk every day and gradually work your way up. You may also use a treadmill or an elliptical machine based on your preference.
If regular walking is painful, try walking in a shallow pool. The buoyancy of water may provide enough relief to allow you to complete your walking exercise.
Always use correct posture while walking by keeping your spine naturally curved. Your shoulders must be relaxed with your head balanced on top of your spine (and not flexed forward).
2. Dead Hangs

The dead hang is an exercise that requires you to simply hang from an overhead/pull up bar like a dead weight. No repetitions, no pushes or pulls, just a plain, old, simple hang.

Dead hangs help decompress your entire spinal column and pelvis. Doing this for just 1-2 minutes can give you immediate pain relief. This is especially true for anyone who’s recently had any kind of compressive disc injury.

Fitness experts suggest aiming for the following times based on your level:

Beginner: 10 seconds.
Intermediate: 20 to 30 seconds.
Advanced: 45 seconds +
3. Superman Extensions

These are also called isometric spinal extensions. This exercise helps strengthen the spinal erectors and other nearby muscles to support your spine, promote good posture, and reduce risk of injury.

This is one of the most effective ways to strengthen your spine without the need for equipment. There are many variations of this exercise to make it easier or harder depending on your current level of strength.

4. Seated Trunk Flexion

If getting on the floor is difficult, you’ll want to give these a try. This exercise completely isolates the spinal erector muscles and can be done with your bodyweight or added weight.

While in a seated position, cross your arms over your chest or hold a dumbbell and slowly curl your back forward in order to round your upper back. Then return back to the starting position. Try doing 2-3 sets of 15-30 reps for best results.

5. Horizontal Back Extension

If you have access to this piece of equipment, make use of it. This exercise directly trains your spinal muscles, glutes, and every rep is a decompressive stretch at the bottom of the movement.

Start with your bodyweight and do 2-3 sets of 10-30 reps. You can gradually add weight to this exercise as your spine becomes stronger.

6. Seated Good Morning

This exercise is a great way to strengthen your spine while also improving hip flexibility. You don’t need to start with a bar on your back. Like other exercises it’s best to start with just your body weight, then transition to dumbbells, then eventually the bar.

7. Jefferson Curl

This exercise moves your entire mobile spine from your lower back through your neck into flexion and then extension in one motion. But it’s not for everyone. You need to have the necessary mobility and stability to perform this movement. If you’re able to perform all of the previous exercises with good form then you should be ready to try this.

The weight you use should be light and avoid going to failure. Stick to 3-5 sets of 5 quality reps.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 27, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/tablespoon-of-olive-oil/,"1 Tablespoon of Olive Oil Reduces Heart Attack, Clogged Arteries and High Blood Sugar","We look at people in the Mediterranean region that consume a lot of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and their levels of heart disease throughout these nations are so low, and we wonder why.

Olive oil not only has polyunsaturated fatty acids but also contains monounsaturated fatty acids, which are beneficial for the heart. Monounsaturated fatty acids help prevent plaque formation by reducing inflammation in the arteries.

Too much plaque can impede blood oxygen delivery to the heart, which may lead to a heart attack if it is not treated. Extra virgin olive oil is powerful because of two ingredients.

Oleocanthal is the first. It functions as well as Ibuprofen when it comes to pain – it’s a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. Oleocanthal will ease any kind of discomfort you’re having, such as stomach and joint pain, or knee pain.

Oleic acid is the second ingredient. The inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein, is lowered by oleic acid, which is the primary fatty acid in olive oil. Oleic acid may help put out the flames of inflammation by lowering C-reactive protein that goes into your bloodstream.

Olive oil will do wonders for you if you’re constipated and aren’t regular. It coats and lubricates the intestinal walls and helps you feel better by stimulating peristalsis.

Insulin resistance will be improved by olive oil, making you more insulin sensitive. Since it slows down digestion, it will assist with pre-diabetes and diabetes. It allows glucose to enter the cells gradually, rather than putting demands on the pancreas that is producing insulin.

And you’ll feel satiated after eating olive oil. Guess what? You’re not going to yearn for that junk food. Olive oil is crucial for weight loss since it will make a significant difference if you consume it.

So, how should you take olive oil? The best way is to get up in the morning and take one tablespoon on an empty stomach.

Because of its natural, medicinal anti-inflammatory properties, some studies show it may be taken before bed. Sleeping and resting after taking olive oil can be an enormous help for you if you have a lot of inflammation going on. You’ll wake up in the morning feeling refreshed.

Don’t underestimate the power of extra virgin olive oil because the research is out there.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 27, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/feet-health-arteries/,What Your Feet Could Be Telling You About the Health of Your Arteries,"What can your feet tell you about the health of your cardiovascular system? Actually, quite a bit. Atherosclerosis, the hardening of the arteries due to plaque buildup, can occur throughout the body, not just near the heart. When it occurs in the arteries that lead to your feet, it may be an indicator of an increased risk of heart disease.

The buildup of plaque in arteries leading to the extremities is known as peripheral artery disease (PAD). According to the Cleveland Clinic, some symptoms of PAD include pain the the legs, getting tired easily after exercise, and trouble walking distances. The Mayo Clinic states that sometimes people show no symptoms of PAD, however, many people experience muscle pain and cramping in the legs, usually in the calves.

Other symptoms listed by the Mayo Clinic include leg numbness, one lower leg or foot feeling colder than the other, a change in leg color, changes in hair growth on the legs or feet, shiny skin over the area, leg or foot pain even while resting (in severe cases) and an absent or weak pulse in the feet or legs.

The Cleveland Clinic recommends asking your primary physician to check the pulses in your feet if you show any symptoms of PAD, have a family history of PAD or heart disease, or have a history of smoking. This is a simple test that can be done during a routine examination.

A physician can also do an ankle brachial index, which utilizes blood pressure cuffs and an ultrasound wave to detect a pulse in the region.

While detecting PAD can indeed tell you a lot about your greater cardiovascular risk, the Cleveland Clinic states that healthy individuals who do not smoke and do not have a family history of heart disease generally do not need to be screened, as the test can sometimes give a false positive. However, if you are concerned, talk to a health professional that you trust about your PAD risk, and whether it would be beneficial to check the pulses in your feet.

Even if your leg pain seems relatively minor, a conversation with a health professional is a wise idea, as PAD itself can lead to serious complications, including the loss of a foot or leg, if it worsens to a certain point. It is worth it to have the conversation, for the sake of your overall mobility and health.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 26, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-warning-signs-heart-failure-weak/,5 Warning Signs Your Heart is Abnormally Weak for Your Age,"It’s an unfortunate truth that your body slows down as you get older. What used to be easy like going up a flight of stairs may now feel like a daunting task. While losing some vitality with age is completely natural, fatigue and breathlessness can also be warning signs that your heart is not working properly.

What is heart failure?

Your heart’s primary function is to supply oxygen-rich blood throughout your whole body. When your heart isn’t pumping efficiently as it’s supposed to, you have heart failure.

Heart failure does not mean your heart stops working. It means it needs some support to help it work better. This condition can occur at any age, but is most common in older people and tends to gradually get worse over time.

A lot of individuals often mistake heart failure symptoms as a result of growing older. But in reality, what’s happening is that their heart is getting weaker and they don’t even realize it. Without proper care, heart failure can lead to cardiac arrest.

Know your F.A.C.E.S.

To help both doctors and patients quickly recognize the symptoms of heart failure, the Heart Failure Society of America created a simple acronym called “FACES.”

F = Fatigue. When the heart can’t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the body’s energy needs, a general feeling of tiredness or fatigue sets in.

A = Activity limitation. People with heart failure are often unable to do their normal activities because they become easily tired and short of breath.

C = Congestion. Fluid buildup in the lungs can result in coughing, wheezing, and breathing difficulty.

E = Edema or ankle swelling. When the heart doesn’t have enough pumping power to force used blood back up from the lower extremities, fluid can collect in the ankles, legs, thighs, and abdomen. Excess fluid can also cause rapid weight gain.

S = Shortness of breath. Fluid in the lungs makes it more difficult for carbon dioxide in used blood to be exchanged for fresh oxygen. It may also be harder to breathe when lying down because gravity allows fluid from below the lungs to travel up the torso.

What causes heart failure?

Heart failure occurs when your heart’s muscle tissue gets damaged. This damage can stem from any of the following health complications:

coronary heart disease – where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged up with fatty substances (atherosclerosis), which may cause angina or a heart attack
high blood pressure – this can put extra strain on the heart
conditions affecting the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)
heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation
damage or other problems with the heart valves
congenital heart disease – birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart

In addition, obesity, anaemia, drinking too much alcohol, an overactive thyroid or high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) can also lead to heart failure.

Drugs to avoid when you have heart failure…

People with heart failure are often given many prescriptions. However, several of these meds can intensify heart failure symptoms. To be safe, always make sure all of your medical providers have a complete list of all the medicines, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements you take. Particular things to watch out for include:

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This class of widely used painkillers, which includes ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), can worsen heart failure symptoms by causing the body to retain sodium and fluid.
Heartburn medicines and cold remedies. These over-the-counter aids often contain high amounts of sodium, which can trigger fluid overload.
Supplements. Many of these contain substances that react badly with several common heart medications.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 26, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-unclog-arteries-naturally-and-prevent-heart-attack/,Top 10 Foods that Unclog Arteries Naturally and Prevent Heart Attack,"Today, we look at 10 heart-healthy foods that prevent and even reverse heart disease.

Number 10. Papaya.

Find this tropical fruit at your local market to add its incredible health benefits to your daily meals!

One medium papaya provides 224% of your recommended daily value (RDV) of vitamin C. It also contains high levels of fiber and potassium.

Vitamin C is needed to manufacture collagen – the “glue” that connects your tissues and cells. It keeps your arteries strong, yet pliable, as they flex and contract with the pulsing of blood.

When there is a deficiency of vitamin C, tears appear in the arteries and your body packs cholesterol into these cracks.

Over time, cholesterol builds up into plaque, especially if you eat refined carbs and unnatural fats that are “sticky” like margarine, corn oils, and vegetable oils.

Vitamin C helps to repair damaged arterial walls, and thus prevent hardening of the arteries, lower blood pressure, and regulate blood sugar.

To get these cardioprotective benefits, eat vitamin C from whole foods and NOT ascorbic acid.

Vitamin C is water soluble, which means you must get what you need from your diet every day.

Runners up in vitamin C content are not citrus, as you might expect. Bell peppers (157% of daily value), broccoli (135%), and Brussels sprouts (129%) give you far more of this essential heart nutrient than citrus!

Number 9. Pomegranate.

This exotic fruit contains highly beneficial compounds not found in any other food.

Punicalagin and punicic acid showed scientifically proven results in lowering LDL “bad” cholesterol, removing plaque blockages by 30%, and regulating blood pressure by a whopping 12% across study participants.

These results are based on participants consuming one ounce of pomegranate juice per day for one year. Some patients saw results in as little as two weeks.

The control group that didn’t consume the juice saw a 9% INCREASE in arterial plaque over the course of the study.

Pomegranates are anti-inflammatory, which is a key bio-marker for heart disease.

This fruit not only brings your LDL cholesterol down, it prevents LDL from oxidizing or breaking apart.

Oxidized cholesterol floats in your bloodstream and ultimately clings to arterial walls.

Number 8. Eggs.

One of the best things you’ll find in eggs is vitamin K2, also called menaquinone. Different from vitamin K, K2 is in a category by itself.

Egg yolks contain 30X more vitamin K2 than egg white. And eggs from pastured chicken contain more K2 than grain-fed chickens in cages.

Vitamin K1, which is called phylloquinone, is mostly found in leafy green vegetables. It’s required by your liver to manufacture blood-clotting proteins.

Vitamin K2 is responsible for calcium allocation. It helps to move calcium away from the blood vessels and kidneys to the bones and teeth where it is needed.

This is important to prevent coronary artery calcification. The longer your body has calcium floating around without a home, the more likely that it will end up as plaque.

Your body converts K1 to K2, but it doesn’t do it efficiently, so you need it pre-formed.

In one Danish study involving 53,000 adults over 21 years, those with the highest levels of vitamin K1 and K2 intake, were 21% less likely to be hospitalized for heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.

You’ll also find vitamin K2 in natto, grass-fed butter, goose liver, sauerkraut, dark meat, eel and cheese.

Number 7. Curcumin.

Curcumin is the source of the bright yellow and orange coloring of curry dishes. There are over 3,000 scientific studies on this special compound found in turmeric root.

The health benefits for your entire body are incredible because of its ridiculously effective anti-inflammatory properties.

Turmeric prevents your arteries from hardening and developing fatty deposits.

Adding turmeric to your diet can help reduce inflammation and damage to your endothelium or artery lining, which are leading causes of plaque buildup and blood clots.

Not only is curcumin powerful by itself, it also improves the activity of other antioxidants in your body!

Number 6. Spinach.

Organic spinach is one of the best sources of natural magnesium. Every cell in your body requires magnesium to live.

This essential element is needed for muscle tissue and nerve repair, metabolizing glucose, regulating insulin response, and is especially critical to the heart.

That’s because magnesium is involved in the biochemical reactions in your heart muscle that generate your heartbeat.

Studies have shown that people with higher levels of magnesium have fewer incidents of hypertension, stroke, and diabetes.

Conversely, magnesium deficiency has been linked to a higher risk of arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), endothelial dysfunction (damage to the arterial lining), and sudden cardiac death (SCD).

One serving of spinach provides almost 40% of your RDV and is high in other nutrients as well. In the United States, experts believe that as much as 80% of the population is magnesium deficient.

Other excellent sources of magnesium are pumpkin seeds, lima beans, almonds, avocados and dark chocolate with 75-85% cocoa.

Number 5. Krill Oil.

Considered almost 50% more potent than fish oil, krill oil is used more efficiently by your body. That means every dose provides greater heart health benefit- without the “fishy” burps.

Krill oil is packed with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — omega-3 fatty acids long recognized as necessary for a well-running heart.

Omega-3s lower both cholesterol and triglycerides. Even in people with normal triglyceride levels, omega-3s can reduce inflammation and high blood pressure and the risk of atherosclerosis.

Other outstanding sources of heart-healthy omega-3s are sardines, wild salmon, mackerel, halibut, tuna, walnuts, chia seeds, hemp seeds, flaxseeds, seaweed, and algae (spirulina and chlorella).

Number 4. Garlic.

Freshly cut or chopped garlic is one of nature’s most powerful protections against heart disease, diabetes and many other serious illnesses.

All forms of garlic are good for you and add layers of flavor to a variety of dishes.

However, only fresh garlic emits hydrogen sulfide when chopped or crushed. The gas dissipates when garlic is cooked, dried, or processed.

This compound relaxes your blood vessels, which keeps your blood pressure in check. Garlic also increases nitric oxide, which dilates your blood vessels.

The primary sulfur compound found in garlic is called allicin. It also has significant levels of vitamin B, vitamin C, and manganese.

Studies show that garlic naturally lowers LDL “bad” cholesterol, and is just as effective in reducing hypertension and slowing the buildup of arterial plaque as ACE inhibitor drugs.

Number 3. Coconut Oil.

Don’t listen to the hype about the saturated fat content in coconut oil.

Studies have proven time and again that the medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) in coconut oil are used by your liver for clean fuel called ketone bodies.

This unique property creates better energy levels that result in more efficient fat-burning – as much as 120 more calories per day.

In places of the world where the coconut is a staple of daily diet, the population is incredibly healthy. They have fewer incidents of stroke or heart disease while consuming 60% of their calories from coconut.

Despite being 90% saturated fat, coconut oil helps to lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol.

Some studies have found that it lowers triglycerides and reduces visceral abdominal fat – a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke.

Number 2. Green Tea.

This is the one drink you need for total body wellness. This ancient beverage does more than improve brain function, prevent neurodegenerative disease, and fight cancer.

Any type of green tea will do, so long as it’s loose leaf – and preferably organic. Black tea and oolong tea are also excellent for heart health.

The results of a study of 40,530 Japanese adults showed that people who drank more than five cups of green tea a day had a 26% lower risk of death from heart attacks and strokes compared to those who drank less than one cup a day.

Polyphenols found in the tea leaves, called catechins, fight oxidative stress and inflammation that are major underlying causes of many diseases, including heart disease. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the major active catechin in green tea.

Drinking three cups a day is shown to ease hardening of the arteries, regulate cholesterol levels, and reduce body-wide inflammation.

Number 1. Grass-Fed Beef.

If you’re a meat eater, the type of meat you eat is just as important as how much you eat. Grass-fed cattle are raised on grass, and don’t have any antibiotics or growth hormones. The result is beef with lower unhealthy fat, higher levels of healthy fats such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), more omega-3s, and more nutrients overall.

Commercially raised cattle eat grain feed with a history of bacterial contamination, junk fillers, and GMO ingredients such as corn.

Lean meat with a fat content of less than 10% is best for your heart. The L-carnitine content is the highest in beef. Other lesser sources include seafood, chicken, and dairy products, but red meat has more than triple of this valuable nutrient.

Carnitine is an amino acid that helps get fat cells to where they’re needed for energy. It has been effective in controlling weight, reducing the risk of heart attack, sharpening cognition, and helping the body use oxygen and nutrients more efficiently.

Our bodies can make carnitine, but production decreases as we age.

In several studies, carnitine has been shown to increase the chance of survival after a heart event and improve tolerance of exercise in patients with angina or chest pain.

It also helps regulate LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, and lowers amounts of lipoprotein (a), which places diabetics at a higher risk of stroke and heart failure.

Another huge bonus of grass-fed beef is that it contains coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) – another incredible nutrient that is primarily found in beef, poultry, and seafood. A deficiency of CoQ10 is common in patients who experience severe heart events.

Post-surgery, CoQ10 aids in healing and better blood flow throughout the heart muscle. This enzyme also regulates hypertension and relieves chest pain. You can supplement these vital nutrients if you aren’t a meat eater. However, if you love the occasional steak, choose grass-fed beef as a nutritional boost.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/10-worst-habits-that-cause-bad-breath-bleeding-gums-and-yellow-teeth/,"10 Worst Habits That Cause Bad Breath, Bleeding Gums, and Yellow Teeth","You know what they say: “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” But that doesn’t mean you can’t break old habits that are harmful to your teeth and gums. In fact, it’s never too late to make positive changes to improve your oral health!

Here are some of the worst habits that can do a lot of damage to your oral health. These will leave you with bad breath, bleeding gums, and yellow teeth. If you’re guilty of any of these, you’ll save yourself thousands of dollars in dental bills by quitting them.

1. Smoking and chewing tobacco

Do you chew tobacco? Or smoke? If you do, you’re putting your teeth and gums at risk.

Tobacco products are loaded with harmful chemicals that can cause serious damage. Tobacco can stain your teeth, and it can also make them loose and brittle. And if that’s not bad enough, it can also cause gum disease, which can lead to tooth loss.

2. Nail biting

Nail biting isn’t all that bad but it can lead to bad breath and even infections. If you’re a nail biter, the best thing you can do is to break the habit. It won’t be easy, but it’s definitely worth it in the end. Here are a few tips that might help:

Keep your nails trimmed short so there’s less temptation to bite them.
Try chewing on gum when you get the urge to bite your nails.
3. Using your teeth as tools

You might not realize it, but using your teeth as tools can actually do a lot of damage to your pearly whites.

For example, using them to open a tight jar lid or to tear open a package can cause chips and fractures in your teeth. And if you’re someone who likes to crunch on ice, you’re putting a lot of pressure on your teeth and exposing them to potential cracks and fractures. The amount of force that’s needed to crunch on ice is enough to damage your enamel.

4. Grinding your teeth

Do you ever find yourself grinding your teeth at night? Don’t worry, you’re not alone. In fact, a lot of people grind their teeth without even realizing it.

Grinding your teeth can be a sign of stress, and it can also lead to some serious dental problems. Over time, it can cause your teeth to wear down and even crack. Not to mention, it can also damage your gums.

If you find yourself grinding your teeth, there are a few things you can do to stop it. First, try to relax before bedtime. If that doesn’t work, you might want to try wearing a nightguard.

5. Eating too much sugar

This one is the most obvious one, but eating too much sugar is one of the worst things you can do for your teeth and gums. Sugary drinks and foods can cause tooth decay and gum disease, both of which can lead to serious health problems.

6. Not brushing properly

You might think that you’re brushing your teeth properly, but chances are, you’re not. Most of us think that all we need to do is brush our teeth for two minutes, twice a day. But that’s actually not enough.

The truth is, you need to have proper technique and do it at the right time. For example, you should never brush your teeth right after eating. That’s because brushing immediately after consuming something acidic can damage the enamel layer of the tooth. Waiting about 30 minutes before brushing allows tooth enamel to remineralize and build itself back up.

Also, when you brush your teeth too hard, you can wear down the enamel on your teeth. Over time, this can lead to cavities and even tooth loss. And it’s not just your teeth that can be affected—brushing too hard can also damage your gums, leading to gingivitis and other problems.

So how can you tell if you’re brushing too hard? If you’re feeling a lot of pain or bleeding when you brush, then you’re likely brushing too hard. Try using a softer toothbrush, or check out this article on how to brush your teeth correctly.

7. Not flossing

It’s no secret that not flossing is bad for your teeth and gums. But what a lot of people don’t know is just how bad it can be. Flossing is one of the simplest and most effective ways to keep your teeth and gums healthy, and it only takes a minute or two each day.

Flossing removes plaque and bacteria from between your teeth and under your gums, where a toothbrush can’t reach. Not flossing can lead to all sorts of problems, including gum inflammation, tooth decay, and even periodontal disease.

Just make sure you don’t floss too hard. Flossing too deep can cause your gums to recede over time. Once this happens, you’ll start to experience tooth pain because the areas of the tooth being exposed have thin enamel. With extreme cases, the root of the tooth can be exposed causing even further tooth pain.

8. Misuse of Toothpicks

Toothpicks were created to remove gunk stuck between the teeth. However, misusing toothpicks can cause enamel damage and scratches on the surface of the teeth. Also, shoving toothpick deep within the crack of your teeth causes the teeth to shift and form gaps.

9. Inadequate Hydration

Proper hydration is an under-appreciated secret for healthy teeth. When brushing is not an option, drinking a glass of water helps wash away the food particles, bacteria, and acid from your mouth.

Drinking water after consuming stain-causing foods (like red wine or coffee) will also rinse away the tannins and other stain-causing chemicals, keeping your teeth whiter.

Like your body, your teeth can also become dehydrated, due to inadequate hydration or mouth-breathing. Proper hydration will keep your teeth (and gums) healthier and stronger.

10. Drinking Too Much Coffee

Like cigarette and tobacco smoking, coffee can also stain your teeth. Adding more sugar and drinking several cups of coffee every day can turn your teeth dull and yellow in colour. Sugar can also increase your risk of tooth decay.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 24, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/california-free-school-lunches-students/,California Will Be 1st State To Offer Free School Lunches To Students,"Starting this upcoming school year (2022-2023), California will become the first state in the U.S. to give free lunches to all of its 6 million public school students. That means, no matter what your family income is, your child can get a free meal at school.

The new program, was made possible thanks to the state’s large budget surplus. The program is part of state Assembly Bill 130, which focuses on education finance and was signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year.

The bill received overwhelming support from Democrats and Republicans alike. Republican State Sen. Brian Dahle said kids at his own children’s school would steal leftovers because they couldn’t afford a full meal.

“For a lot of them that was their dinner and they were sneaking it or taking it off someone’s plate when they didn’t finish it,” Dahle told the publication at the time.

Now no child will have to go hungry at school – regardless of their family’s income level. Tony Wold, an associate superintendent of the West Contra Costa Unified School District, said it’s about time school lunches were free.

“Just like you need to give students textbooks and a computer, there are certain things you need to do,” Wold told the publication. “And this is one of them.”",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 23, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/7-brain-killing-habits-wheelchair/,7 Brain Killing Habits That Will Put You in a Wheelchair,"Did you know that you were born with nearly 100 billion cells in your brain? That’s enough to easily last you a lifetime, even if you account for the thousands of brain cells that naturally die off each day.

But some bad habits can speed up the loss of brain cells and negatively impact your mental health. Losing too many neurons early in life can increase your risk of cognitive problems later in life like brain fog, memory loss, and other brain disorders.

Limited amount of brain cells...

Unlike other cells in your body that are constantly replicating themselves, brain cells that you lose aren’t coming back. At least, not in the amounts that would be required to replace the loss.

For example, a stroke can kill two million neurons (type of brain cell) per minute. Meanwhile, your hippocampus, the part of the brain that’s vital for learning and memory can only create about 1,400 neurons per day.

As you can see, even though the brain is one of the most complex structures in existence, it is also incredibly vulnerable. Here are eight destructive habits you’ll want to avoid that’s quickly killing your brain cells.

1. Ignoring your stress levels

Under normal circumstances, stress isn’t harmful. Your “fight or flight” response is there to help you deal with danger or react to emergencies. Stress is only truly harmful when it’s in excess. When that happens, your brain cells pay the price.

Stress triggers the release of a hormone called cortisol. This chemical signals the neurons in the prefrontal cortex to disconnect and stop firing. The prefrontal cortex is the part of your brain in charge of logic and reasoning.

Studies have found that high levels of cortisol wear down the brain’s ability to function properly. In addition, consistent elevated stress levels can kill brain cells, which can cause parts of the brain to shrink.

Some of the best methods for reducing stress include breathing exercises, yoga, adaptogenic herbs, meditation and therapy. Here are some additional ideas on what you can do to help manage your stress levels:

Taking a “time out,” or walking away temporarily from a stressful situation.
Repeating an internal “mantra,” such as “Everything’s going to be okay.”
Going for a walk or taking some other type of physical action to get your energy out of your body.
Using mindfulness, such as focusing on something using your senses.
2. Eating too much sugar

Consuming more sugar than you should occasionally is not a big deal. However, when it becomes a habit to grab a soda for lunch, and have ice cream after every meal, and even start to bring sugary snacks with you in the car, eventually the problems will begin to build up.

Having too much sugar floating inside your head is lethal to brain cells. Neurons are susceptible to damage as a result of poor blood-glucose control. The long-term effects of poor control are associated with the accelerated death of neurons, and dementia – notably Alzheimer’s disease.

3. Being a Couch Potato

It’s time to stand up and do something about it. While leading a sedentary lifestyle doesn’t directly kill brain cells, the effects that are associated with lack of exercise happen to be killers. That’s because exercise helps lower stress levels, improves blood sugar control, and even helps promote neurogenesis.

By not exercising, you indirectly set your brain cells up for an early death. When it comes to exercising you don’t have to workout to the point of fainting or exhaustion. You just need to start somewhere and slowly progress.

4. Skipping nature’s skittles

Every day your body is exposed to thousands of free radicals in the form of air pollution, hazardous chemicals, and so on. These toxic compounds accelerate aging in your whole body, including your brain.

Air pollution has often been shown to be harmful to the lungs and heart, but the latest research shows that some airborne pollutants can also bypass the blood-brain barrier and lead to brain disorders.

Researchers have found that tiny particles from air pollution can travel from your lungs to your blood, and then pass through the brain-blood barrier. Once inside the brain, these harmful particles can cause inflammation and accelerate the aging process of brain cells in a process called oxidative stress.

Fortunately, your body is able to use antioxidants to prevent this from happening. While there are many antioxidants that can be found in nature, some are more useful to the brain. The most well-known include carotenoids and flavonoids, as well as important vitamins and minerals.

The majority of antioxidants you get from your diet are mostly found in fruits and vegetables. The brighter the color, the higher the level of disease-fighting antioxidants in that particular food. Here’s a list of nutrients that help protect your brain:

Carotenoids are found in leafy green vegetables like spinach, kale, and broccoli. They help prevent brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and the negative effects of free radicals.
Flavonoids can be found in blueberries, grapes, cocoa, dark chocolate, and tea.
Vitamin C is in pretty much every plant food you can imagine. The highest amount can be found in bell peppers.
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to memory loss, dementia, and Alzheimer’s. Your body naturally produces Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight.
Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that’s easily able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Good sources of vitamin E include Nuts, seeds, dark-colored fruits, and vegetables.
Selenium is a mineral with antioxidant properties that can be found in shellfish, chicken, and Brazil nuts.
5. Not getting enough beauty sleep

Sleep is probably one of the most important habits for brain health. Losing sleep every now and then isn’t a big issue. At most, you’ll feel groggy or grumpy, and out of focus. But a habit of poor sleep can wreak havoc on your brain and mental health.

That’s because sleep is the time your body uses for recovery. And your brain in particular uses this time to flush out toxins and waste products linked to Alzheimer’s and dementia. If you’re consistently burning the midnight oil, you may be burning out brain cells as well.

One study found that staying awake for too long can damage brain cells and even kill them. Additionally, current research shows a strong correlation between mental health problems and sleep deprivation.

According to the Sleep Health Foundation, almost 60 to 90 percent of patients with depression also have insomnia. And more than half of all insomnia cases are associated with depression, anxiety, or psychological stress, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

If you have trouble sleeping, here are some sleeping tips you can use:

If you can’t fall asleep within 20-30 minutes of trying, get out of bed and do something else for 15 minutes like reading a book, then try again.
Some people work better in the mornings, while others work best at night. Adjust your sleep schedule accordingly.
If you enjoy taking naps. Don’t nap for more than 30 minutes.
If stress is keeping you up, try taking a bath with magnesium, which is a well-known relaxation mineral.
Avoid sleeping on your stomach. It’s considered the worst sleeping position, as it puts a lot of pressure on your body and strains your back.
Listening to calming sounds or white noise can help you fall asleep. There are lots of websites or apps that let you play forest sounds, rain, or static noise.

Interestingly enough, only about 3% of the world’s population possesses a gene that allows them to function just fine with only 6 hours of sleep per day. Researchers still don’t know to this day whether this is healthy or not.

6. Getting drunk too often

Going out for happy hour a few times a month isn’t much of an issue long-term. But if you’re drinking heavily or binge drinking often, you should consider reaching out for help.

Alcohol is a neurotoxin that can damage neurons and even kill them. When this occurs, it makes it more difficult for healthy neurons to communicate. Similar to not exercising, alcohol may also kill brain cells indirectly by increasing your risk of strokes, head injuries, and accidents.

7. Smoking is bad…M’kay?

Everyone knows that cigarettes are terrible for your lungs and heart, but very few know about its effects on the brain.

There are plenty of studies that have found that people who smoke cigarettes experience faster cognitive decline than nonsmokers. Smoking also increases your risk of dementia, a condition that can affect memory, thinking abilities, language skills, judgement, and behavior.

In one study, researchers found that smokers, compared to nonsmokers, had greater amounts of age-related brain volume loss in several areas of the brain.

Bottom Line

Even if you aren’t able to fix all of your bad habits in one shot, taking a small step in the right direction can help slow down brain cell death.

And one last thing before you head off. Losing a few million neurons won’t automatically make you “dumber.” Thanks to something called neuroplasticity, your brain is able to adapt and recover much of its previous function.

This is why some people who survive a stroke can return back to living a normal life. Surviving neurons simply make new connections and take on more work to compensate for the losses. But ideally, you’ll want to avoid having a stroke in the first place. And that involves fixing any bad habits you may have.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 22, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/mom-foster-189-kids-four-decades/,She fostered 189 kids in four decades and has no plans to stop,"Known as Miss Hannah in her tiny town of Marion, South Carolina, Hannah Ford is an incredibly kind person. This is the story about a woman who found purpose in helping the youth. It all began when Miss Hannah started feeling isolated when her own five children began moving out in 1983.

Her home that was brimming with life suddenly became quiet. Sadly, Ford had lost her husband nearly two decades earlier. Living alone in a home that was intended to house several family members just didn’t sit right with the retired seamstress. That stillness felt uncomfortable.

It was around that time that a friend of Ford suggested that she might want to consider becoming a foster mom.

“She said, ‘Hannah, you would be a good one,’” Ford told TODAY Parents. “So I started doing that.”

And the rest is history.

Nearly 40 years later, Ford, who’s now 86, has helped foster 189 kids in her home.

She never yelled or screamed at the children

Erica Woodberry is among one of the seven children she adopted.

Before moving in with Ford at the age of 12, Woodberry and her younger sister spent more than four years switching between foster homes.

“I’ll never forget the first meal she cooked for us — it was pork chops and I’d never tasted meat that was so good,” Woodberry, 48, told TODAY.

“She sat there at the table asking us questions about ourselves,” Woodberry said, her voice cracking with emotion. “We weren’t used to that.”

Ford is “a very special person,” she added.

Woodberry’s biological sister, Carlotta Ford, 41, couldn’t agree more.

“What I’ve always admired is her patience. She never yelled or screamed at us. She would just give you a talk so you knew how to act,” Carlotta shared. “She’s impacted so many lives.”

Genuinely loves to help

At 17, Kendall Givens-Little moved in with Ford and remembers feeling instantly comfortable around her. He described Ford as always having a calming presence.

“She knows how to build trust. She was like a mother figure to me and I needed that,” said Givens-Little, who’s now 38. “I think a lot of people get into fostering for the money, but Miss Hannah genuinely loves to help.”

Like many of Ford’s fostered kids, Kendall-Givens is now living a great life. He got degrees from both Claflin University and Howard University and is currently working as a director of strategic communications at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine.

Woodberry owns her own T-shirt business, a home daycare and devotes much of her time to organizing clothing drives for those in need. She said she learned to give back by watching Ford.

Ford will celebrate her 87th birthday in December. She is currently fostering two teenage boys, while also caring for her two other adopted children Lawanda, 37, and Lawrence, 36, who were born with fetal alcohol syndrome (FASD)

This condition is the result of embryos being exposed to alcohol while in the womb. The effects can include physical complications and problems with behavior and learning. Often, a person with an FASD will have a mix of these problems.

Blair Cieluch, a family support coordinator for the South Carolina Department of Social Services, has been working with Ford since 2017.

“The foster children who have been placed in her home hold a special place in her heart,” said Cieluch. “I know she’s left an everlasting impression on them, because she sure has left one on me.”

No plans to stop

As long as you’re healthy, there are no upper-age restrictions for fostering children.

“I don’t see any end in sight. As long as God continues to give me strength and guidance and wisdom, I’ll keep doing this,” she said. “There are just too many children out there in need. They’re coming out of situations where they’re not fed properly, they’re not loved properly. They need me and I need them.”

Woodberry joked that Ford has more energy than she does.

“I can’t keep up with her,” Woodberry said. “She’s still out there working in her yard, cleaning out her flower beds. I’ll be about to pass out and she’s still going. She never complains.”

“I have nothing to complain about,” Ford said. “I’m truly blessed.”",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 18, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/proven-ways-build-stronger-lungs/,6 Proven Ways to Build Stronger Lungs,"The older we get the more we lose lung capacity. Lung capacity refers to the maximum amount of oxygen your body is able to use at any given time. When lung capacity decreases your risk of heart failure increases.

Unfortunately, the ordinary breathing that we do daily isn’t enough to keep oxygen flowing at peak levels. Just like the rest of your body, your lungs thrive on movement. This means that you need to challenge your lungs with more intense activity.

Here are six ways to achieve this. These proven methods will help improve your lung capacity and make it easier to get all the oxygen your body needs.

1. Cardio training

There’s nothing else that will make your lungs stronger than doing cardio. You can do this by running, swimming or even cycling. Doing cardio teaches your lungs to deliver more oxygen to your bloodstream quicker, as well as becoming more efficient at removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from your body.

What happens to your lungs when you run?

The endurance capacity of your respiratory muscles – including the diaphragm and intercostal muscles – increases, allowing deeper, fuller and more efficient breaths when you run.
With regular training you grow more capillaries, which means you can get more oxygen to your muscles quicker.
The more you run, the more alveoli you grow. These take oxygen and transport it into the capillaries.

There are many ways to go about cardio training. You can do high intensity intervals or you can do zone 2 cardio.

HIT intervals

High intensity intervals should be done once or twice per week. This type of cardio session is physically demanding and pushes your lungs and heart rate to the upper limits.

It requires that you go all out for 30 seconds, followed up by 30 seconds rest. Repeat this cycle for up to 15 to 20 minutes. If you’re just starting out, you can increase the resting period to 300 seconds and gradually decrease it as your body starts to adapt.

Zone 2 cardio

The second type of cardio that helps train your lungs is zone 2 cardio. This is a form of cardio where you’re going just above the intensity of being able to have a conversation. Aim to do 150 to 180 minutes a week of this type of cardio.

While exercising is one of the best ways to build stronger lungs, there are other things you can do to keep your lungs functioning properly. Here are some simple breathing techniques you can do almost anytime of the day.

2. Diaphragmatic breathing

Ever wondered how opera singers never seem to run out of breath? This is the technique that they use to increase their lung capacity. Diaphragmatic breathing uses the awareness of the diaphragm muscle, which separates the organs in the abdomen from the lungs.

By concentrating on lowering the diaphragm as you breathe in, you’ll get a much deeper inhale. These techniques work well for anyone who has lung problems related to asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, as well as healthy individuals.

Step 1 – Inhale through your nose and focus on deeply expanding your belly. Do this for 4 seconds.
Step 2 – Hold for 6 seconds
Step 3 – Breathe out through your nose for 8 seconds.

Do this for 5 to 15 minutes.

3. Fix your posture

Since the lungs are soft structures, they can only take up as much space as you give them. Having good posture can make a big difference.

You’ll want to bring your shoulder blades back, push your tongue against the roof of your mouth and lift your chest upwards. It sounds weird, but the tongue part will automatically put your head in an upright position.

This technique works regardless if you’re sitting or standing. Go ahead and try it, give your lungs the room they need to breathe deeply.

4. Play Music

The same reason why opera singers have terrific lungs can be applied to playing a brass instrument. Not only is this a great way to learn something new or keep your brain engaged, it’s a guaranteed way to build stronger lungs, which results in better air efficiency. Lots of doctors recommend it for people with asthma.

5. ‘Counting’ your breaths

This technique goes hand in hand with meditation and yoga. It can be used to help you find your focus while also increasing your lung capacity.

All you have to do is prolong the length of your inhalations and exhalations. Start by counting how long one of your regular breath takes. If it takes to the count of five to inhale, it should take to the count of five to exhale. Try to keep them to an equal length.

Once you’ve found the count for your average breath, gradually add one more count to each inhale and exhale until you can comfortably extend the length of time it takes to fill and empty your lungs.

6. Nose breathing

This last one isn’t like the other techniques. While it doesn’t directly make your lungs stronger, it does help improve oxygen circulation in your body.

Nitric oxide (NO) is is a vasodilator, which means it helps to widen blood vessels. This can help improve oxygen circulation in your body. During nasal breathing, your nose releases nitric oxide (NO).

So, when you inhale through your nose this NO will follow the airstream to the lower airways and the lungs. Nasally derived NO has been shown to increase arterial oxygen tension and reduce pulmonary vascular resistance.

Breathing through your nose is an efficient way of getting oxygen into your body. It also helps filter out foreign particles and moisturizes the air your breathe in.

You can apply nose breathing to all the previous techniques to further improve lung capacity.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 17, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/3-worst-foods-inflammation-gut/,3 Worst Foods That Cause Inflammation in Your Gut,"Picture New York city on a Monday morning, the sidewalks crammed with people rushing to get to work. Now imagine it on a microscopic level and that’s pretty much what your microbiome looks like inside your body.

Your microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms (also called microbiota or microbes) from thousands of different species. These include not only bacteria but fungi, parasites, and viruses. In a healthy person, these bugs or bad bacteria coexist peacefully along the good ones, and can be found everywhere on the body. Still, the highest concentration of microbes is mostly found within the small and large intestines.

The microbiome is so important to your health that in recent years, medical experts have begun labelling it as a supporting organ. Besides stimulating your immune system, your microbiome also plays an important role in breaking down potentially toxic food compounds, and synthesizing certain vitamins and amino acids, such as vitamin B12 and vitamin K2.

When Bad Bacteria Take Over…

Unfortunately, when the balance between good and bad bacteria is broken, which can be cause by infections, unhealthy diets, or the prolonged use of antibiotics, it can lead to dysbiosis.

Dysbiosis is the scientific term used to describe an “imbalance” in the gut microbial community. When this happens, this imbalance can interfere with your microbiome’s functions and make your body more susceptible to disease.

Eating certain unhealthy foods regularly has been found to cause slow, long-term inflammation in the body. This is associated with higher risks of chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, arthritis and cancer.

That’s why it’s incredibly important to be selective about what you choose to eat. If you don’t feed your gut the right foods, you could be facing some major health concerns down the line.

Healthy foods like fermented vegetables, kefir, fruits and leafy greens, help promote the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut. These good microbes help prevent the overgrowth of harmful bacteria by competing for nutrients and attachment sites to the mucus membranes of your gut. Think of your mucus membrane as an intestinal barrier where the majority of immune activity and production of antimicrobial proteins occur.

In other words, the more good bacteria you have in your gut, the less “leaky your gut” becomes, which also means less inflammation and better overall health.

While indulging in your favorite snack or treat once in a blue moon is fine, since it won’t necessarily cause a dysbiosis, there are certain types of foods that should be avoided. Eating these foods daily can harm your gut by creating an unhealthy environment for your gut’s bacteria.

Number 1. Refined baked goods

Packaged and refined baked goods like store-bought pastries, white bread and bagels are one of the main things you should avoid if you want to keep your gut healthy.

And you’ll want to especially avoid those that contain high fructose corn syrup.

These foods are usually low in dietary fiber, which your gut bacteria require in order to transform them into molecules that help feed healthy colon cells and protect your body from obesity and diabetes.

If you can’t initially stop eating these foods, better options (in moderation) are baked goods that contain whole grains, and that do not have any added high fructose corn syrup in their ingredient list.

Getting 25 to 30 grams of dietary fiber per day in your diet is crucial for keeping the good bacteria in your gut fed. This is relatively easy to achieve if you eat plenty of vegetables and fruits.

When the bacteria in your gut aren’t being fed properly, a 2021 peer-reviewed study in Nutrients found that it can increase your risk for gut-related diseases, such inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

Number 2. Processed meats

Eating bacon, hot dogs, beef jerky and lunch meats too often is associated with a higher risk of colon cancer. That’s because the added additives turn into carcinogens, during the cooking process.

Some better alternatives that can be consumed in moderation is meat from the butcher, especially white meat or grass-fed meat that contain higher amounts of good fats.

Number 3. Sugary drinks

These aren’t just limited to sodas. Some juices and diet sodas can also harm your gut, especially if they contain high fructose corn syrup, saccharin, or sucralose.

These sugary drinks promote the growth of bad bacteria in your colon and can lead to diarrhea, as well as diabetes and obesity.

According to a recent 2022 review in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, both hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels) and excessive sugar intake can increase gut permeability and can cause an imbalance of bacteria in the gut, which is detrimental to your overall health.

Healthier options include regular water as well as unsweetened teas and coffee. If you really feel like drinking something sweet, you can always make your own smoothie with tasty fruits or mix in a teaspoon of honey with your water or tea.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 9, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/4-reasons-why-cardiac-arrests-happen-in-the-bathroom/,4 Reasons Why Cardiac Arrests Happen in The Bathroom,"Most people spend on average 30 minutes per day in the bathroom and that’s perfectly reasonable. What’s surprising is the disproportionately high rate of heart attacks and cardiac arrests that occur during that period of time.

The most critical thing about heart problems is that they are very time-sensitive. If a person gets treatment within minutes, cardiac arrest is reversible.

However, since bathrooms are private places, detection and resuscitation are always delayed, and outcomes are, therefore, extremely poor. According to one expert, the frequency of collapse is 8 per cent, and the chances of revival a dismal 13 per cent.

What is cardiac arrest?

Some people make the mistake of using the terms cardiac arrest, heart attack, and heart failure interchangeably. But each of these conditions is slightly different, even though they are life-threatening.

Cardiac arrest is a medical condition where your heart stops beating. When this happens, your essential organs are no longer being supplied with oxygen-filled blood, leading to collapse and loss of life.

A heart attack, on the other hand, is a condition wherein a part of your heart stops getting oxygenated blood. This usually happens because an artery that sends blood and oxygen to the heart gets blocked.

And lastly, heart failure is a long-term condition that develops after the heart becomes damaged or weakened. This prevents your heart from pumping blood well enough to meet your body’s needs.

So, why do cardiac arrests happen in the bathroom?

A cardiac arrest may be more likely to happen when you’re bathing, showering, or having a bowel movement because of the stress these activities can put on your body.

Number 1. Being Constipated is Bad for Your Heart

There’s a good reason why chronic constipation has been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, sudden cardiac death).

When you’re having a bowel movement, you may find yourself straining yourself. This isn’t out of the ordinary, but it can be especially dangerous in individuals at risk of heart problems.

When constipated, people instinctively perform something called a valsalva maneuver. This increases the abdominal pressure and helps force out the stools.

But this action is also very stressful to the heart and the circulatory system, as it increases the pressure inside the chest, thus reducing the blood flow to the heart.

This causes the pumping of the heart to slow down, and the amount of blood being sent to nourish the brain decreases. As a result, some people faint.

To make matters worse, after fainting, the body suddenly relaxes, which can abruptly increase the blood pressure, and this might cause some arteries in the brain to burst (stroke).

So, if your heart function is already compromised, excessive straining while moving one’s bowels could be a trigger for cardiac arrest, heart attack or stroke.

Number 2. Choosing the Wrong Temperature

Taking a shower that’s either too cold (water temperature below 70°F) or too hot (water temperature above 112°F) can quickly affect your heart rate, which can put stress on your arteries and capillaries.

There’s nothing better than taking a warm bath after a day’s work. While it rarely happens, bathing in water that’s much warmer than room temperature may trigger a cardiac event. This is especially true for individuals who have preexisting cardiovascular conditions, such as high blood pressure or heart disease.

Additionally, you’ll also want to avoid taking a hot bath after consuming a sleeping aid or relaxant medication.

Number 3. Mistaking The Correct Dosage

Mistakes can happen anytime. And taking the wrong dosage for certain drugs and medication can lead to sudden cardiac arrest in some cases.

If you keep the majority of your prescriptions in a bathroom medicine cabinet, this may put you at greater risk of experiencing cardiac arrest in the bathroom.

Number 4. Slipping in the bathroom

Bathrooms tend to have naturally slippery surfaces and are often wet. Furthermore, there are sharp edges that pose additional hazards.

When elderly and frail individuals slip in the bathroom, they can hit their heads, which can lead to fainting or bleeding in the brain (subdural hemorrhage).

While fainting won’t cause a cardiac arrest, it can prove to be just as fatal if no one is on site to help.

One way to prevent this from happening is to spread out bath mats with suction cups to cover slippery surfaces.

You may also want to consider setting up a safety system with a family member who can check on you if you’re in the bathroom beyond a certain amount of time.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"October 6, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/physical-changes-heart-danger/,6 Physical Changes That Happen When Your Heart is In Serious Danger,"The first time people realize that they have heart problems is when they experience a heart attack, which is also called a myocardial infarction. A heart attack occurs when an artery that sends blood and oxygen to the heart is blocked. And unfortunately, once the muscle tissue of the heart has been damaged, your quality of life will never be quite the same again.

Not only will this affect your heart’s rhythm and its ability to pump blood to the rest of your body, it also increases your risk for a second heart attack and other conditions such as stroke, kidney disorders, and peripheral arterial disease.

While your heart isn’t visible to the naked eye, there are still physical changes that can clue you in that something is amiss even before anything happens.

Knowing these warning signs can make a big difference. If you notice several of these on your body, don’t ignore them. This is a wake-up call that you need to start taking better care of your heart. Otherwise, you risk suffering a life-changing or in some cases lethal cardiovascular event.

Number 1. The Mark of a Heart Attack on Your Ear?

Do you have diagonal creases on your earlobes? Though we are not born with it, this physical trait starts to appear later in life and becomes more and more prominent with age.

It’s known as Frank’s sign, named after Sanders T. Frank, an American doctor who first described the sign. In a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1973, he described 20 of his patients with an earlobe crease, who were under 60 years old, with angina (chest pain) and proven coronary artery blockages.

Since then, over 40 studies have found an association between this physical appearance of the ear and an increased risk of atherosclerosis, which is a heart condition where plaque builds up inside your arteries.

A true correlation, not Just a chance finding

The largest study to date, and probably the most powerful was published in 2014. Almost 11,000 Danish participants were followed for up to 35 years. All participants were free of known coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study.

The study found that participants who developed a visible earlobe crease were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing heart disease. And these associations were found to be independent of other, well-established cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, obesity and hypertension.

But why would having an earlobe crease be associated with heart disease?

While researchers are still not clear as to what the exact cause of the association is, some have suggested it may be due to poor blood circulation often seen in patients with heart disease.

Number 2. Are You Seeing This Bump On Your Body?

Another physical sign that your heart isn’t getting as much blood as it should be, is yellow, fatty bumps. These are called xanthomas and can appear on the elbows, knees, buttocks or eyelids. The bumps themselves are harmless, but they can be a sign of heart problems.

Xanthomas are most commonly seen in people with a genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia. People with this condition have exceptionally high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), also commonly known as bad cholesterol.

When excessive amounts of LDL cholesterol are present in the body they can accumulate in the skin. Unfortunately, these fatty deposits also find their way into the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart.

Number 3. Do Your Fingertips Look Like This?

A phenomenon known as nail clubbing may also be a sign that something wrong is going on with your heart. The tips of the fingers enlarge and the nails become extremely curved from front to back.

The reason this visible change occurs is because oxygenated blood is not reaching the fingers properly. When your tissue can’t get enough oxygen, the cells start to produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in an attempt to grow more blood vessels to rectify the problem.

The end result is nail clubbing, where the fingernails change shape, becoming thicker and wider, due to more tissue being produced.

Surprisingly, this physical change is usually painless and happens on both hands.

Number 4. What’s That Around Your Iris?

Fat and cholesterol deposits don’t always end up under your skin. Some of it may also be found in the eye, as a grey or white ring circling the iris, the coloured part of your eye.

This condition is called arcus senilis and naturally develops as people age. It occurs because blood vessels in the eye tend to widen with age, allowing more cholesterol to pass through.

About 45% of people over the age of 40 have this fatty halo around their iris, rising to about 70% of people over the age of 60. Having arcus senilis does not cause vision problems but its presence has been associated with some of the risk factors for coronary heart disease.

If you’re under the age of 40 and have arcus senilis, have your doctor test your cholesterol levels.

Number 5. If a Heart Attack Had a Distinct Smell…

When was the last time you went to the dentist? Not enough people know about this but the state of your oral health can also be a good predictor of your cardiovascular health. Many studies have found that tooth loss and gum disease like periodontitis are markers of heart disease.

That’s because your mouth is full of bacteria, both good and bad.

In a situation where someone has poor dental health, it increases the risk of bad bacteria entering the bloodstream from the mouth and causing inflammation in the blood vessels. This kind of damage can negatively impact your heart valves. This is especially true for those that have artificial heart valves.

Always take the time to brush and floss properly.

Number 6. Is This Part of Your Body Bluish?

Another visible sign from the mouth that you shouldn’t ignore is the color of your lips.

Lips in general tend to be red, but they can also take on a bluish color in people with heart problems. This is because the cardiovascular system isn’t able to deliver oxygen-rich blood in the area.

Keep in mind that people also get blue lips if they are extremely cold or have been at a high altitude. You’ve probably experienced something similar from swimming in a lake on a cold day. In this case, the blue lips are temporary and will resolve itself quite quickly once you’re warmed up.

Bottom Line

The majority of the symptoms mentioned on this list can have a benign cause. But if you are worried or in doubt, get in touch with your healthcare professional for an expert opinion.

And if it turns out that you do have heart problems, don’t panic. Instead, adopt a proactive approach to avoid further complications such as eating a more healthy diet, staying more active and other measures to prevent the progression of coronary heart disease.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/hypertension-purple-smoothie/,Purple Smoothie Fights Soaring Hypertension In Under 5 Minutes,"Pharmaceutical ACE inhibitors are a big business and getting bigger every day. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are medications that help relax the veins and arteries to lower blood pressure. However, they also come with a plethora of side effects. Fortunately, you don’t need to rely on drugs to manage your blood pressure and we’ll show you how.

According to one study, essential hypertension accounts for 95% of all cases of hypertension. Essential (primary) hypertension occurs when you have abnormally high blood pressure that’s not the result of a medical condition.

This form of high blood pressure is often due to obesity, family history and an unhealthy diet, which can cause a deficiency in key nutrients needed to maintain healthy blood pressure. This means that there’s a good chance that your high blood pressure is due to poor lifestyle habits.

In fact, the most common causes for increased blood pressure include obesity, insulin resistance, high alcohol intake, high salt intake (in salt-sensitive patients), living a sedentary lifestyle, stress, low potassium intake, and low calcium intake.

That’s because having either a potassium deficiency, low levels of vitamin D, high insulin, or a combination of the three can lead to stiffened arteries, which ultimately leads to high blood pressure.

So, if you don’t want to rely on prescription drugs in the long-run to manage your blood pressure because of all the unwanted side effects, making changes to your diet is your best alternative.

There is one particular smoothie you can make at home to help lower blood pressure. This drink combines well-documented ingredients that naturally contain antihypertensive compounds.

The recipe takes only 5 minutes to make and calls for seven ingredients, none of which are particularly hard to get.

Number 1. Two Teaspoons of Flaxseed

Flaxseed is a grain that contains high levels of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). ALA is a precursor to EPA and DHA, which are essential omega-3 fatty acids your body requires. When ingested in adequate amounts, it can help restore artery function.

In one study, 110 patients with high blood pressure and peripheral artery disease added 30 grams of milled flaxseed to their diet each day for six months. Results were compared to a similar group of people who added a placebo to their diets.

Can you guess what happened? That’s right, the group with the flaxseed in their diet showed a measurable decrease in blood pressure.

So go ahead and add flaxseed into your blender.

Number 2. Two Celery Stalks

Celery contains a phytochemical called phthalides. As an extract, it’s called NBP, and it helps relax the tissue of your artery walls to increase blood flow and reduce blood pressure.

Additionally, celery stalk contains very little to no salt and is high in fiber, magnesium and potassium, which can all help regulate your blood pressure.

Number 3. Half of an Avocado

Avocados can do wonders for your soaring blood pressure levels. Avocados are packed with oleic acid, which can reduce high blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Avocados are also rich in potassium and folate, both of which are good for the heart. Potassium in particular helps keep your arteries supple and elastic.

Number 4. An Ounce of Lemon Juice

Citrus fruits, including grapefruit, oranges, and lemons, have powerful blood-pressure-lowering effects. They’re loaded with vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds that help keep your heart healthy by reducing high blood pressure.

Number 5. Half a Cup of Blueberries

Daily blueberry consumption can help reduce blood pressure and arterial stiffness, which is due, in part, to increased nitric oxide production.

In addition, blueberries contain a natural compound called anthocyanins, which has been found in many studies to protect against high blood pressure.

Number 6. Half a cup of Plain Kefir

The power behind kefir’s natural ability to lower blood pressure is in its bio-active peptides. Peptides are beneficial compounds derived from the proteins in the milk and mostly created during the fermentation process.

Bio-active peptides can help reduce blood pressure by lowering inflammation, improve immune and insulin modulation, and much more.

The last thing you’ll need for this smoothie is some water. Combining all of these antihypertensive ingredients together will definitely help reduce your blood pressure without the side effects of regular drugs.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-to-fight-visceral-belly-fat/,Top 10 Foods To Fight Visceral Belly Fat (Burn Belly Fat & Lose Fast!),"Today, I’m going to share with you the top 10 foods to fight visceral belly fat.

Many people are unaware that there are actually two types of body fat.

Subcutaneous fat that you can pinch and grab onto, and is found just underneath your skin.

And visceral fat that is stored deep inside your body.

Visceral fat is also known as “hidden fat” and wraps around your abdominal organs like your heart, liver, and intestines.

Too much subcutaneous or visceral fat is bad for your health, but visceral fat is especially dangerous.

That’s because it’s is related to the release of proteins and hormones that can cause inflammation.

This inflammation can damage your arteries, enter your liver, and negatively affect how your body breaks down sugars and fats.

Even in thin people, having visceral fat increases your risk of developing high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol, and insulin resistance.

Here are 10 foods you can add to your diet to help you lose visceral fat fast and boost your overall health.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice. We are not doctors.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 10. “Fatty Fish”.

Wild-caught fish are rich in omega-3 acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial for brain and heart health, and have been shown to reduce inflammation and the risk of heart disease. Fish is also a superb source of protein, which can help keep you fuller longer. Try adding fatty fish like Alaskan salmon, cod, herring, mackerel, rainbow trout, sardines and striped bass in your diet at least twice a week. Farmed fish is significantly cheaper, but contains less omega-3 fats.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 9. “Nuts”.

Adding a handful of nuts to your diet can help you melt visceral belly fat. One study involving 14,000 participants over five years, found that those who ate nuts regularly had lower body weight and reduced waist circumference. Consuming nuts regularly has also been shown to help reduce hunger and prevent spikes in blood sugar levels. This makes nuts the perfect snack for appetite control, which is incredibly beneficial when your goal is to burn off visceral fat. Some of the healthiest nuts are almonds, walnuts, pecans, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, Macadamia nuts, pine nuts, and pistachios.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 8. “Fermented foods”.

Fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, natto, yoghurt, and kefir contain healthy bacteria called probiotics, which can help reduce inflammation and improve insulin resistance. Probiotics also help improve the gut microbiome and can promote visceral fat loss. Greek yogurt is one of the best sources of protein mixed with some probiotics. This protein can also help with satiety.

Watch this video till the end, and download a free report of the top foods that turn your metabolism into a fat-burning machine.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 7. “Pasture-Raised Dairy”.

Studies have linked high-quality dairy products to healthy weight management, mainly because of the calcium-protein combination.

To give your dairy even more fat-burning potential, select pasture-raised dairy products. Free range cows produce milk that is of higher quality.

The protein in dairy has a higher thermic effect than carbs or fats, meaning it boosts your metabolic rate. The protein-fat combination also reduces cravings and helps you keep lean muscle mass.

So if a firm, flat stomach is something you desire, make sure you’re getting a dose of dairy consistently in your diet.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 6. “Apple Cider Vinegar”.

Apple cider vinegar or ACV contains a natural compound called acetic acid, which can help prevent visceral fat accumulation.

Research shows consuming ACV before a high-carb meal can help reduce blood sugar levels, which helps minimize fat-storing insulin.

ACV may also help to increase the enzyme AMPK in the body, which increases the rate of fat oxidation and decreases the speed at which the liver manufactures fat in the body. This means accelerated fat-burning results.

Finally, ACV contains an antioxidant called chlorogenic acid, which helps to protect the bad cholesterol in the body (LDL) from being oxidized. This helps to reduce your overall risk of heart disease.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 5. “Green Tea”.

Green tea is one of the healthiest drinks in the world.

It contains high amounts of antioxidants to promote brain health and clear thinking.

The caffeine also helps improve mental focus and increase your metabolic rate.

Some studies show that green tea may be especially helpful against diabetes because it reduces blood sugar and insulin levels.

It also contains a natural compound known as EGCG, which has been shown to protect your brain, nervous system, and heart.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 4. “Resistant Starches”.

Resistant starch is a type of carbohydrate, that doesn’t get digested in your small intestine. Instead, it ferments in your large intestine, and feeds beneficial gut bacteria that help maintain a healthy weight and a robust immune system. This type of starch provides many health benefits and has fewer calories than regular starch.

Green, unripe bananas, and potatoes which have been cooked then cooled, are amazing sources of resistant starch. Adding more resistant starch to your diet can help increase satiety and feelings of fullness. This reduces your hunger and overall calorie intake.

These unique starches may also increase the thermic effect of food, which increases your daily calorie burn. Also, the short-chain fatty acids formed after consuming resistant starches have been found to help suppress appetite.

Other foods that contain resistant starch include rice and white beans that have been cooked then cooled, uncooked rolled oats, and lentils.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 3. “Beans & Lentils”.

Beans and lentils are substantial sources of fat-fighting fiber and muscle-building protein. They can help you store less visceral fat, according to one study, which found that for every 10-gram-per-day increase in soluble fiber, belly fat decreased by 3.7%. Beans and lentils are also significant sources of magnesium, which helps regulate cortisol levels and promotes a healthy nervous system. Some effective bean and lentil options include chickpeas, black beans, lentils, and kidney beans.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 2. “Whole eggs”.

People used to avoid eating egg yolks because they thought these would raise cholesterol levels. But we now know that whole eggs raise the good cholesterol inside your body, and therefore do not increase the risk of heart disease.

Although the egg white is a significant source of protein, the fatty yolk is even more nutritious.

The calories from egg yolks provide lots of important nutrients like folate, selenium, zinc, iron, phosphorus, vitamin B12 and B6. All these nutrients help keep visceral belly fat from forming.

Visceral Fat-Fighting Food Number 1. “Pasture-Raised Meat”.

Contrary to popular belief, research has found no link between unprocessed red meat and heart disease. In fact, unprocessed red meat is loaded with nutrients that can have a profound effect on health.

For example, pasture-raised red meat is full of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a healthy fat that helps to destroy your stomach fat, increase metabolic rate, and increase muscle mass – all while helping reduce your risk of cancer.

Red meat contains a hefty dose of zinc, selenium, vitamin B3, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and iron. As long as you eat the right type of red meat, you can indulge in your favorite greasy steak “guilt free”—all while extending your lifespan and avoiding storage of visceral fat.

Besides eating the right foods, it’s equally important to avoid inflammatory foods that can lead to visceral fat gain and overall poor health.

Plus, exercise, stress management, and proper sleep, are all crucial for managing visceral fat in your abdominal area.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/bad-dreams-nightmares-dementia-risk/,This Dreaming Pattern Puts You at Higher Risk of Developing Dementia,"People who experience frequent bad dreams in middle age are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia later in life, according to research at the University of Birmingham.

A new study, published in The Lancet journal, eClinicalMedicine, suggests nightmares may become prevalent several years or even decades before the characteristic memory and thinking problems of dementia set in.

Dr Abidemi Otaiku, of the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Human Brain Health, said: “We’ve demonstrated for the first time that distressing dreams, or nightmares, can be linked to dementia risk and cognitive decline among healthy adults in the general population.

“This is important because there are very few risk indicators for dementia that can be identified as early as middle age. While more work needs to be done to confirm these links, we believe bad dreams could be a useful way to identify individuals at high risk of developing dementia, and put in place strategies to slow down the onset of disease.”

In the study, Dr Otaiku examined data from three community-based cohorts in the USA. These included more than 600 adult men and women aged between 35 and 64; and 2,600 adults aged 79 and older. All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and followed up for an average of nine years for the younger group and five years for the older participants.

The study started collecting data between 2002 and 2012. Participants completed a range of questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which includes a question on how often individuals experienced bad dreams.

This data was analysed using statistical software to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline and be diagnosed with dementia.

The research shows that middle-aged people (35-64) who experience bad dreams on a weekly basis are four times more likely to experience cognitive decline over the following decade, while older people were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.

Interestingly, the study found that the associations were much stronger for men than for women. For example, older men experiencing nightmares on a weekly basis were five times more likely to develop dementia than older men reporting no bad dreams. In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 per cent.

Next steps for the research will include investigating whether nightmares among young people could be associated with future dementia risk, and whether other dream characteristics, such as how often we remember dreams and how vivid they are, could also be used to identify dementia risk. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers also plan to investigate the biological basis of bad dreams in both healthy people and people with dementia.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/bathing-cold-water-cut-bad-body-fat/,Bathing in Cold Water May Cut “Bad” Body Fat,"Taking a dip in cold water may cut ‘bad’ body fat in men and reduce the risk of disorders such as diabetes, suggests a major scientific review published in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Circumpolar Health.

The authors say many of the 104 studies they analysed demonstrated significant effects from cold water swimming including also on ‘good’ fat which helps burn calories. This may protect against obesity, cardiovascular disease, they add.

However, the review was inconclusive overall on the health benefits of cold-water bathing, an increasingly popular hobby.

Much of the available research involved small numbers of participants, often of one gender, and with differences water temperature and salt composition. In addition, it is unclear whether or not winter swimmers are naturally healthier, say the scientific expert team of review authors from UiT The Arctic University of Norway and from the University Hospital of North Norway.

“From this review, it is clear that there is increasing scientific support that voluntary exposure to cold water may have some beneficial health effects,” states lead author James Mercer, from UiT.

“Many of the studies demonstrated significant effects of cold-water immersion on various physiological and biochemical parameters. But the question as to whether these are beneficial or not for health is difficult to assess.

“Based on the results from this review, many of the health benefits claimed from regular cold exposure may not be causal. Instead, they may be explained by other factors including an active lifestyle, trained stress handling, social interactions, as well as a positive mindset.

“Without further conclusive studies, the topic will continue to be a subject of debate.”

Weight loss, better mental health, and increased libido are among numerous health and well-being claims made by followers of regular cold-water immersion or arising from anecdotal cases.

This activity takes many forms such as swimming in cold water during the winter, and is the subject of growing interest worldwide.

The main aim of the review was to determine whether voluntary exposure to cold water has health effects in humans. The methodology involved a detailed search of the scientific literature.

Excluded from the review were studies where participants wore wet suits, accidental cold-water immersion, and water temperatures greater than 20 degrees centigrade.

Themes covered by the studies that were eligible for review included inflammation, adipose tissue, blood circulation, immune system, and oxidative stress.

Immersion in cold water has a major impact on the body and triggers a shock response such as elevated heart rate.

Some studies provided evidence that cardiovascular risk factors are actually improved in swimmers who have adapted to the cold. However, other studies suggest the workload on the heart is still increased.

The review provided insights into positive links between cold water swimming and brown adipose tissue (BAT), a type of ‘good’ body fat that is activated by cold. BAT burns calories to maintain body temperature unlike ‘bad’ white fat which stores energy.

Cold exposure in water — or air — appears also to increase the production of adiponectin by adipose tissue. This protein plays a key role in protecting against insulin resistance, diabetes and other diseases.

Repeated cold-water immersions during the winter months significantly increased insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin concentrations, according to the review. This was for both inexperienced and experienced swimmers.

However, the authors point out that the profile of swimmers participating in the studies did vary. They ranged from elite swimmers or established winter bathers to those with no previous winter swimming experience.

Others were not strictly ice bathers but used cold-water immersion as a treatment post exercise.

Education is also needed on the health risks associated with taking a dip in icy water, say the authors. These include the consequences of hypothermia, and of heart and lung issues which are often related to the shock from the cold.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/coffee-linked-longer-lifespan/,Popular Drink Linked With Longer Lifespan If You Follow This Rule,"Drinking two to three cups of coffee a day is linked with a longer lifespan and lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with avoiding coffee, according to research published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology. The findings applied to ground, instant and decaffeinated varieties.

“In this large, observational study, ground, instant and decaffeinated coffee were associated with equivalent reductions in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and death from cardiovascular disease or any cause,” said study author Professor Peter Kistler of the Baker Heart and Diabetes Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia.

“The results suggest that mild to moderate intake of ground, instant and decaffeinated coffee should be considered part of a healthy lifestyle.”

There is little information on the impact of different coffee preparations on heart health and survival.

This study examined the associations between types of coffee and incident arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease and death using data from the UK Biobank, which recruited adults between 40 and 69 years of age. Cardiovascular disease was comprised of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and ischaemic stroke.

The study included 449,563 participants free of arrhythmias or other cardiovascular disease at baseline. The median age was 58 years and 55.3% were women.

Participants completed a questionnaire asking how many cups of coffee they drank each day and whether they usually drank instant, ground (such as cappuccino or filtered coffee), or decaffeinated coffee.

They were then grouped into six daily intake categories, consisting of none, less than one, one, two to three, four to five, and more than five cups per day.

The usual coffee type was instant in 198,062 (44.1%) participants, ground in 82,575 (18.4%), and decaffeinated in 68,416 (15.2%). There were 100,510 (22.4%) non-coffee drinkers who served as the comparator group.

Coffee drinkers were compared to non-drinkers for the incidence of arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease and death, after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption. Outcome information was obtained from medical records and death records. The median follow up was 12.5 years.

A total of 27,809 (6.2%) participants died during follow up. All types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause.

The greatest risk reduction seen with two to three cups per day, which compared to no coffee drinking was associated with a 14%, 27% and 11% lower likelihood of death for decaffeinated, ground, and instant preparations, respectively.

Cardiovascular disease was diagnosed in 43,173 (9.6%) participants during follow up. All coffee subtypes were associated with a reduction in incident cardiovascular disease.

Again, the lowest risk was observed with two to three cups a day, which compared to abstinence from coffee was associated with a 6%, 20%, and 9% reduced likelihood of cardiovascular disease for decaffeinated, ground, instant coffee, respectively.

An arrhythmia was diagnosed in 30,100 (6.7%) participants during follow up. Ground and instant coffee, but not decaffeinated, was associated with a reduction in arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation. Compared with non-drinkers, the lowest risks were observed with four to five cups a day for ground coffee and two to three cups a day for instant coffee, with 17% and 12% reduced risks, respectively.

Professor Kistler said: “Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components. It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival. Our findings indicate that drinking modest amounts of coffee of all types should not be discouraged but can be enjoyed as a heart healthy behaviour.”

https://dailyhealthpost.com/carb-wont-spike-blood-sugar-levels/,This Carb Won’t Spike Your Blood Sugar Levels,"Eating carbohydrates the wrong way can spike your blood sugar levels and lead to insulin resistance. As you probably already know, sugar is one of the worst forms of carbs you can consume if you’re trying to maintain a healthy weight or prevent type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases.

But not all the carbs are bad for you. In fact, there are some types of carbs that your body needs even if you have diabetes or insulin resistance.

The BIG problem with refined carbs.

Complications arise when the majority of your carbs come in processed form like breads, cakes, cereals, muffins, and donuts.

When you ingest these foods, your body converts all those refined carbs into glucose (blood sugar molecule) so that it can be absorbed in the gut.

The problem is that refined carbs are converted into glucose at an incredibly fast pace. It’s so fast, that your pancreas may not be able to keep up with the demand for insulin.

When that happens, blood sugar levels may remain elevated for longer periods of time. And that’s not good because it can damage the vessels that supply blood to vital organs, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, kidney disease, vision problems, and nerve problems.

Too much leftover glucose, not enough insulin…

As we age, the pancreas produces less insulin. That’s because the pancreas undergoes various pathological changes with aging such as increased fatty tissue, fibrosis, atrophy, and decreased perfusion.

And people with diabetes have it worse because by the time you get diagnosed with the disease, your pancreas has already lost 50 to 60 percent of its insulin production capacity.

The worst part is that diabetics are also more likely to have more insulin resistance than anyone else, which makes absorbing glucose by your cells even harder.

So how do you go about picking which foods to eat?

Understanding the glycemic index

Eating foods that rank high on the glycemic index such as bread, potato, rice, and pasta will inevitably result in significant rise in your blood sugar levels.

On the other hand, food sources that rank on the lower side of the glycemic index have a slower release of energy, which means these foods won’t spike your blood sugar levels.

The slower the release, the better. This might not seem like much but it gives your pancreas enough time to produce more insulin, which helps keep your blood sugar levels stable.

In short, high glycemic index carbs should be avoided at all costs. The lower the glycemic index the less impact a particular food has on your blood sugar levels.

Ideally, you’ll want to stick to foods with a glycemic index of 55 or less. Anything under 40 is even better. A score of 70 is considered high and should be avoided.

Now, trying to remember the glycemic index chart by heart isn’t practical. You can download a chart or look it up on your mobile phone whenever you need but there’s an even simpler way to go about it.

The trick is to look at the nutrition labels. The amount of protein and fiber combined together should be greater than the amount of carbohydrates and sugars.

How to naturally lower the glycemic index of foods?

Did you know that certain ingredients can help lower the glycemic index? Adding something as simple as olive oil to pasta can help lower its glycemic index.

Olive oil and other healthy fat sources help slow down the absorption of other foods when eaten together. You can also achieve similar results by taking apple cider vinegar during or after your meals.

Low-fat meals are more than likely to raise your blood sugar levels quickly. If you start your mornings with a cup of orange juice and a muffin or a bowl of cereal with low-fat milk, you can expect your blood sugar levels to spike.

If you were to replace the same amount of carbs that comes in these breakfast meals with something like an apple and peanut butter, you’ll see a big difference when you check your blood sugar one hour after eating.

You can further improve the glycemic index of foods you eat by making sure you get a decent amount of dietary fiber along with healthy fats.

There are two main types of fiber. One is soluble the other is insoluble. They’re both beneficial in their own ways, for example, soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance that helps protect the lining in your gut, lower cholesterol, and prevent blood sugar spikes.

Meanwhile, insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve and helps add bulk to your stool, which is important to prevent constipation and help your body process waste better.

Both types of fiber are essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system but for the purpose of keeping your blood sugar levels stable, soluble fiber is the most important one.

What are good sources of soluble fiber? If you haven’t already checked it, we talk about good sources of soluble fiber in this video:",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 28, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/neuropathy-trigger-foods-avoid/,6 Trigger Foods That Cause Agonizing Pain If You Have Neuropathy,"Neuropathy (nerve damage) is a common complication of diabetes. On average up to 60% of people diagnosed with diabetes also have some form of neuropathy. This is especially true in diabetics who have difficulty keeping their blood sugar levels in check.

Like many other health conditions, the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can be worsened or improved by your diet.

Peripheral neuropathy is a condition that occurs when the nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerves) become damaged. This causes weakness, numbness and pain, in both your hands and feet.

Peripheral neuropathy can also affect body functions such as digestion, urination and circulation.

One of the best ways to avoid peripheral neuropathy is to manage your diet and any medical conditions that put you at risk. This may involve removing junk food from your diet as well as quitting alcohol.

Here are the 6 worst trigger foods you’ll want to avoid if you want to improve your neuropathy symptoms.

1. Gluten

Anything containing gluten should be the first food patients with neuropathy should avoid.  

Celiac disease affects the small intestine and interfere with your body’s ability to absorb essential nutrients, which in turn can deprive your nerves of crucial things like vitamin b12.

Although only 1% of the population may be diagnosed with celiac disease, many individuals tend to have gluten sensitivity and allergies.

Gluten can be found in bread, pasta, noodles, cakes, and pastries.

It’s important to check product labels and look for gluten-free products because gluten can also be found in unexpected foods, such as regular soy sauce.

Despite its name, soy sauce is usually made with wheat, soybeans, salt and water, which means most soy sauces contain gluten. The good news is that some soy sauces are truly gluten-free.

2. Trans fats

High-fat diets that are loaded with trans fats, also known as “unhealthy fats,” can cause 
inflammation and raise the risk of type 2 diabetes, which can worsen peripheral neuropathy.

Consuming a well-balanced diet that’s low in trans fat can help reduce your risk of triggering nerve pain.  

Fried fast foods, such as fried chicken, battered fish, doughnuts, french fries, and mozzarella sticks, can all contain high levels of trans fat.

Instead, focus on eating moderate amounts of monounsaturated fats from food sources like avocados, almonds, and some flax seeds, which have heart-protective omega-3 fatty acids.

3. Alcohol

Having a drink once in a while isn’t a big problem. However, drinking alcohol in excess can not only aggravate your neuropathy symptoms they can also harm your overall health.

Alcoholic neuropathy is characterized by spontaneous burning pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. This happens because long-term excessive alcohol consumption have damaged your nerves. 

If alcohol triggers nerve pain, muscle weakness, tingling, burning, and cramps, it’s time to put the glass down and quit.

4. Refined Grains

Keeping your blood sugar levels balanced is the most effective way to prevent diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

So it makes sense that you’ll want to avoid processed grains, which have a high glycemic index. The higher the glycemic index in a food, the higher its effect on your blood sugar.

Instead of eating pasta, swap it out for zucchini. You can also refrigerate your pasta or rice to lower its glycemic index.

In a previous article we talked about how you can use apple cider vinegar to help lower the glycemic impact of the foods you eat.

5. Salty Foods

The majority of people love eating potato chips. But for your health’s sake, you’ll want to avoid these types of snacks.

The main issue with foods high in sodium is that it can restrict blood flow, which aggravates numbness, a symptom of peripheral neuropathy.  

Potato flakes, wafers, cold cuts, salty junk foods, and processed fast foods in general are all high in sodium and should be avoided.

Too much salt in your body can cause your blood vessels to constrict, thus reducing blood flow and causing your nerves to tingle, burn, or go numb.

Always try to choose lean meats and vegetables over processed meats, cold cuts, fast food, and other foods high in sodium.

6. Sugar 

While it is widely accepted that added sugar has adverse health effects, this is particularly true regarding peripheral neuropathy.

Eating foods that have a lot of sugar can spike your blood sugar levels and cause inflammation, which can damage your nerves and the blood vessels that feed your nerves.

Eating too much sugar too often can speed up the onset of diabetic neuropathy in people with diabetes. 

If you wish to prevent diabetes and diabetic neuropathy from happening in the first place, you must take steps to stop eating sweets.  

And keep in mind that even if you substitute your sweets for fruits, the natural sugars found in fruits is still sugar, so you’ll still need to make sure to consume in moderation.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 27, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/two-tablespoons-of-apple-cider-vinegar-before-bed-for-lower-blood-sugar-levels/,Take 2 Tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar before Bed for Lower Blood Sugar Levels,"Many people unknowingly suffer from blood sugar issues and insulin resistance. Even if you’re not doing keto or intermittent fasting, there are many things that can improve your blood sugars beyond just lowering your carb intake and fasting.

What’s Acetic Acid?

The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar has a very potent anti-glycemic effect, which means it can help buffer the food you eat and bring things down on the glycemic index. This can help stabilize both blood sugar and insulin levels.

In one study, adding vinegar to rice, helped reduce the glycemic index of that rice by 35%. Additionally, if you add vinegar to your cooked potato while it cools down, you will reduce the glycemic index of that potato by 43%.

Taking vinegar with bread will also create a significant decrease in blood sugar and insulin levels. In one study researchers found that supplementation of a meal based on white wheat bread with vinegar reduced blood glucose and insulin levels, and increased satiety. The results indicate an interesting potential of fermented and pickled products containing acetic acid.

So, that is actually very interesting. Anytime you lower your glucose, whether it’d be through eating less carbs or fasting, you lower your body’s demand for insulin. This, in turn, will reduce fat on your liver and may even lead to some weight loss. You will also experience reduced hunger because there is less insulin in your system, as well as fewer cravings.

Look for Undiluted Apple Cider Vinegar

I you’re going to add ACV to your diet, we recommend the Fairchild’s organic apple cider vinegar. That’s because most people buy the bragg organic apple cider vinegar. What they don’t know is that somewhere along the line bragg started diluting their apple cider vinegar. So if you look at the back of the label, you’ll see “apple cider vinegar with water.” But Fairchild’s is not only organic but there’s no added water. That’s why it’s marketed as “undiluted.”

So whether you’re on keto or not, adding apple cider vinegar to your diet has plenty of benefits. This is especially true for those who regularly experience something called “the dawn phenomena.” This occurs when your blood sugars are high even though you did not consume a lot of carbs the day before. This is because the liver is making more sugar through a process called gluconeogenesis.

So how can you prevent your blood sugar levels from spiking in the morning? Very simply: take two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar before bed.

Drinking ACV with water before bed will help to lower your blood sugar levels over time. You should dilute the ACV in 8 to 10 ounces of water for best results. Lastly, because ACV is acidic, it’s recommended to drink the mixture through a straw to protect your teeth.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 26, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamins-for-your-eyes/,Top 10 Vitamins for your Eyes (See More Clearly),"What if you could reverse your blurry vision and see more clearly again? Well, in this video, I’m going to show you exactly how to do just that with 10 of the best vitamins for your eyes.

These nutrients help support your near and far distance vision, protect your low-light vision, and fortify against age-related vision decline.

And at the end of this video, I’m going to show you a simple way to get these important nutrients to strengthen your vision in days.

Are you finding it hard to read a book or look at your phone because it strains your eyes? Do you have trouble making out street signs? Are you worried about driving at night because your vision is blurry and car lights bother you?

Beginning in their 40s, many people start to have problems seeing clearly.

Why does this happen?

This is because of long-term exposure to a damaging kind of oxygen called “Reactive Oxygen Species” or ROS, which causes oxidative stress.

As you age, ROS assaults your eyes more and more, making your lens cells stiff and inflexible. This results in blurry vision and eye diseases like cataracts, dry eyes, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration.

So where do these ROS toxins come from?

Plastic containers, processed food, and chemicals in our water, but most damaging of all, they come from blue UV light emitted from your smart phone, computer screen, LED light bulbs, and even sunlight. In short, there’s no way to escape the ROS triggered by blue UV light.

Luckily, it’s possible to shield your eyes from oxidative damage and keep your eyesight strong and clear by eating the right nutrients.

The first two power nutrients are lutein and zeaxanthin.

Lutein and zeaxanthin are yellow carotenoid antioxidants known as macular pigments. They are usually found together in foods like spinach, swiss chard, kale, parsley, pistachios, and green peas.

The body stores lutein, and zeaxanthin in your retina, a layer of light-sensitive cells on the back wall of your eyeball. These antioxidants help protect your eyes against harmful blue light.

Studies have found that consuming 6 mg of lutein, and/or zeaxanthin per day, replenishes levels in the retina, and can significantly reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration.

Next is number three. “Lycopene”.

Lycopene is the nutrient that makes tomatoes and watermelons red. It protects your eyes from oxidative stress that causes eye diseases.

Studies have found that lycopene can help prevent cataracts and reduce your risk of macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older adults.

Next on our list is number four. “Omega-3 Fatty Acids”.

The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, are important for eye health. DHA is found in high amounts in the photoreceptor cells in your retina, where it helps maintain eye function.

One study in people with dry eyes revealed that taking EPA and DHA supplements daily for three months significantly reduced dry eye symptoms dry eye symptoms by increasing the production of tear fluid.

Another study in middle-aged and older adults with diabetes found that taking at least 500 mg of omega-3s daily helped reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy. The best dietary source of EPA and DHA is oily fish like wild salmon.

Next is a powerful antioxidant. Number five is “Vitamin C”.

The concentration of vitamin C is higher in the aqueous humor of the eye than in any other body fluid. The aqueous humor is the clear liquid inside the front part of your eye. It nourishes your eye and keeps it inflated.

Vitamin C is also needed to make collagen, which provides structure to your eye, particularly in the cornea and sclera.

How much vitamin C you have in the aqueous humor is directly proportional to how much you eat. This means that if you take supplements or eat foods rich in vitamin C, you can increase its concentration.

Several large studies show that vitamin C reduces your risk of developing cataracts, a condition that causes your eyes to become cloudy and impairs vision.

High levels of vitamin C can be found in foods like bell peppers, citrus fruits, kale, and broccoli.

Another powerful antioxidant is number six. “Vitamin E”.

Vitamin E is a group of antioxidants that protect fatty acids from being damaged. It is important for your eye health, because you have a lot of omega-3 fatty acids in your retina.

Not having enough vitamin E can cause retinal degeneration and blindness. Eating more than 7 mg of vitamin E each day can reduce your risk for age-related cataracts by 6%.

Some excellent sources of vitamin E include almonds, sunflower seeds, and flaxseed oil.

Next is number seven. “Zinc”.

This may surprise you, but the retina in your eyes contains high levels of zinc. This mineral is important for your night vision because it helps to form visual pigments in your retina.

Zinc is a mineral that helps your body metabolize vitamin A, which is another nutrient that supports good eyesight.

In one study, older adults with early macular degeneration were given zinc supplements. Their macular deterioration slowed, and they maintained their visual sharpness better than those who received a placebo.

Some natural dietary sources of zinc include oysters, meat, pumpkin seeds, and peanuts.

Next is number eight. “Beta-carotene”.

Beta-carotene is an orange pigment found in many fruits and vegetables. Your body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A, which has antioxidant properties.

These properties help protect your cornea health and prevent dry eyes. Combining beta-carotene with other nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc can help slow the progress of macular degeneration.

Next is number nine. “Astaxanthin”.

Astaxanthin comes from fish and shrimp, and it’s what gives them their pink color. This antioxidant is ten times stronger than beta-carotene and up to 500 times stronger than vitamin E.

The unique structure of astaxanthin allows it to pass the blood-brain-barrier. This means it can directly deliver antioxidant activity benefits to the brain, eyes, and nervous system to protect cells from high oxidative stress.

Astaxanthin has been found in many studies to improve the outcomes of various eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataracts.

And lastly at number ten. “Bilberry Extract”.

Bilberry fruits contain a natural compound called anthocyanins. One 2-year study found that people with glaucoma, who took 120 mg of bilberry anthocyanins daily, had improved vision by around 30%.

Other studies suggest that supplementing with 160–480 mg of powdered bilberry extract daily, can help reduce eye dryness and other symptoms of eye fatigue caused by working with computer screens.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/food-for-toxic-kidneys/,The #1 Food for Toxic Kidneys,"Did you know that there’s one type of food that’s particularly good for toxic kidneys? The big problem when you’re diagnosed with kidney disease, especially if it’s end stage kidney disease, is that there aren’t many good solutions that give you a good prognosis. For example, they might say you have to get kidney dialysis, and that’s just terrible to go through.

Kidney Disease Solution: Don’t give up on your kidneys;

But the thing with kidneys is that it’s a filter, so any drugs that you’re prescribed will end up harming your kidneys in the process.

So when we’re dealing with a damaged filter, it’s best to use something natural that has virtually no side effects.

Why you can’t live without any kidneys…

The kidneys filter out chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, heavy metals, plastics, excess minerals and recycles a lot of things too!

It’s also very efficient and gets rid of excess sugar. But eating a lot of sugar can damage these tiny filters. There’s a good reason why diabetes is considered the number one cause of kidney disease.

Kidneys also help get rid of excess protein byproducts. One of the byproducts that’s produced from digesting protein is ammonia, which is very toxic to several parts of the body, especially the neurons in your brain. This is why if someone has too much ammonia in their blood, they can end up with dementia and neurodegenerative diseases.

In the body, the liver works closely with your kidneys to remove ammonia safely through something called the urea cycle.

Under normal circumstances, the liver breaks down ammonia into urea, and the kidneys remove urea from the blood through tiny filtering units called nephrons.

Because our body is constantly exposed to environmental pollutants, it’s important to keep both your kidneys and liver healthy.

The kidney is the main organ that helps activate vitamin D, and the liver is involved too, but the kidney is even more important in the conversion of the inactive form to the active form of vitamin D, which is vital to staying healthy.

So what are the symptoms of toxic kidneys?

Well, you can have gout, which is uric acid building up usually in the joint of your big toe. This mainly occurs because the kidney is not able to get rid of this uric acid effectively.

You can also have kidney stones, where you have this super concentrated calcium oxalate stone that develops in the kidney. You can prevent stones by consuming enough liquids.

Puffy eyes are another sign that you might have kidney problems, especially if they’re puffy underneath and on top.

You might also experience edema in your lower ankles. If you press on your lower ankles and it leaves an indentation, then your kidneys may not be working properly.

You might also have itchy skin.

If your urine looks dark and foamy, that usually means that the kidneys are not filtering correctly. Just like if you were to change the oil filter in your car, if you haven’t changed it for a couple years, it’s going to be really really dark and filled with all sorts of things. Now, the foamy part is usually caused by the presence of too much protein in the urine because it’s not being recycled properly.

You may even experience high blood pressure.

Okay, so now the question is: what is the best food out of all the foods that can support toxic kidneys? After going over what kidneys are supposed to do and what occurs when you have toxicity in your kidneys, the answer comes down to bok choy.

Now why would bok choy be the number one food?

Well first of all, it is a cruciferous vegetable. And that means that it has enzymes to help with something called phase two detoxification.

Since we’re trying to detoxify the body, consuming more cruciferous vegetables is going to help you in that process because they help convert harmful toxins into harmless substances. This helps reduce the workload on your kidneys.

Number two, bok choy is high in potassium, which helps balance out the electrolytes in your body.

Bok choy is also high in magnesium. And unlike foods such as almonds, spinach, legumes, grains and other foods, bok choy is that has very little to no oxalates. Eating too many foods with high oxalate content can lead to kidney stones.

Bok choy is also low in protein so if you have protein in your urine, you don’t want to be consuming a lot of it because it’s going through you.

You can just steam it, put some garlic on it, maybe a little sea salt, and it’s actually quite healthy.

All right, number Two ACV. Consume apple cider vinegar with some water throughout the day. What is that going to do? The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar is kidney protective – it’ll help you – and it will also help your blood sugars, which again is the big cause of kidney problems in the first place. And of course, I didn’t mention this but you would definitely want to get on the ketogenic diet and do fasting for sure.

Number Three, Lemon Juice. Why? Because lemon juice has citric acid and that can reduce the risk of getting stones. Also, lemon juice even though it’s an acid turns into an alkaline solution in your body and that can help with gout too because any time when you have these uric acid crystals that are depositing into the joint, if you alkalize the body a little bit it’ll stop that process.

Number Four, Celery juice or just celery by itself. Okay, it decreases ammonia and urea. It helps detoxify this ammonia and it helps decrease the risk of stones.

Number Five, Lower Protein. Lower the amount of protein like I just mentioned to about three ounces of protein per meal especially if your protein is high in your urine.

All right, number Six, Increase Potassium. Make sure your diet is high in potassium. You need big salads – small to moderate protein – huge salads no grains or sugars or anything like that but a high potassium diet would be protective to the kidney like I said before. It’s not about lowering your sodium because you need certain amounts of sodium and chloride but you really need the ratios correct so we usually need to increase the potassium and not really touch the sodium.

Number Seven, Distilled Water. Distilled water is water without the minerals and other chemicals. When you consume distilled water, it can help detoxify a lot of poisons in your body. You can take the minerals that you really need without the minerals that you don’t want, like excessive amounts of things like calcium and things like that.

You don’t want too much calcium and other minerals, which is why distilled water is good for kidney stones and gout.

Number Eight, Probiotics. Your gut contributes to making ammonia, so if you eat foods with probiotics, or take a probiotic supplement, it could help take some of the load off your kidneys. The same goes for the liver – you could take something like milk thistle to help take some stress off your kidneys.

Lastly zinc has been known to decrease ammonia and urea in urine, so make sure you have enough zinc in your diet.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 25, 2022"

https://dailyhealthpost.com/treatment-cancer-genes/,A new treatment is turning cancer genes into “eat me” signs for the immune system,"A new cancer treatment is drawing a protein of the cancer causing KRAS gene to the cancer cell’s surface, so that the body’s immune system can target and kill them.

Imagine a future where cancer is gone, never to come back again. This may sound too good to be true, but scientists are one step closer after developing an innovative treatment that could revolutionize how we fight this disease and others like it in the process!

In a study published this month in the peer-reviewed publication Cancer Cell, doctors found they could make use of an immune system marker on cancer-causing KRAS by attaching the protein with something else—a molecular “tag”. This discovery could pave the way for more effective drug treatments and earlier detection in those who are at high risk.

The treatment works by drawing a protein from the cancer-causing KRAS gene, which is responsible for quarter of all tumors to its surface. From there it turns this now exposed strand into an “eat me” signal that will help attract your immune system’s attack force so that you’ll be able to beat these cancer cells.

The study’s co-author, Kevin Shokat, said that the immune system has the potential to recognize mutated KRAS, but it usually can’t find it very well. By adding a marker to the protein, it becomes much easier for the immune system to find.

But KRAS drugs have been slow to take off because they’re difficult for the body’s immune system to detect once inside cells.

In recent years, Shokat’s research into KRAS has allowed scientists to develop drugs that help block the effects of this protein in tumor cells. One such drug is Lumakras, which can be used alongside other treatments and forms part of our body’s natural defense against cancerous growths!

But in order for these medicines to work effectively and fully remove all tumor-causing cells from your body, it was necessary to use another drug: ARS1620.

The researchers in the Cancer Cell study found that when ARS1620 binds to KRAS proteins, it blocks their tumorous effects. Not only that, but the drug-KRAS complex also alerts the body’s immune system to get rid of the cell.

Charles Craik, one of the study’s authors and a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry at UCSF, said that this mutated protein is usually unnoticed because it is very similar to the healthy protein. However, when you attach this drug to it, it gets spotted right away.

The researchers found they could create a new form of immunotherapy to target cancer cells that have the KRAS gene. Even more exciting, the treatment worked on cells that were resistant to the drug.

This is a wonderful development, but more work needs to be done before it can be used on humans. But Charles Craik, the scientist who developed this treatment, is optimistic that it can be used to help other people.

When you can look in the mirror and know that your pores are clear and the dead cells are gone, it’s like getting a new face. (Updated Sep 20, 2022)

Facial scrubs are pricey and many contain chemicals that aren’t particularly healthy. You can spend a great deal of money for someone’s name on a label. And those microbeads that they put in jars to make it look like bubble tea–what on Earth are they? Those are tiny balls of PLASTIC.

When you rinse your face, the plastic goes down the drain and eventually into the oceans where fish can then eat them. Plastic. Illinois is the first state in the Union to ban use of microbeads in cosmetics. Bravo!

Simple Natural Alternatives

There are natural substances that work way better than plastic and won’t kill a living thing. On top of that, you can make facial scrubs yourself with easily obtainable ingredients, mix and match, save yourself a wad of cash, and even eat them if you get hungry.

Many work better than those you can buy because your body responds more readily to natural products. And when you make them yourself, the ingredients are fresh. Who knows how long that bottle has been sitting on the shelf in the supermarket or salon?

How often you exfoliate your face depends on your skin type; once a week is a good starting point and you can see how your skin looks and feels. You should use a scrub at night (don’t forget your neck!) and don’t put anything on your face afterward.

Body scrubs are too abrasive for your face–you can use a facial scrub on your body, but not the other way around. It’s a good idea to test any new mixture on the back of your hand or on the inside of your elbow before applying to your face to make sure there’s no sensitivity.

Here are some recipes for healthy, glowing skin that are good for you and the fishies.

1. Baking Soda and Mineral Water

Great for sensitive skin, the alkalinity of baking soda balances skin, its gentle abrasives exfoliate, and minerals add nourishment.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/six-thousand-daily-steps-for-joint-mobility/,"Forget 10,000 Steps. For Happy Knees, 6,000 Will Do It","For arthritis sufferers, it’s a Catch-22: joints hurt so you don’t want to move but moving regularly makes your joints hurt less. You know that movement and exercise are good and necessary but the conventional wisdom of “10,000 steps a day” is daunting.

Here’s a bit of relief: six thousand steps a day is enough to achieve adequate movement to realize benefit in the joints, according to a newly-released study.[1]

In the study, 1788 people with—or at risk of developing—osteoarthritis of the knee were given pedometers and monitored over a two-year period. Daily number of steps was measured along with knee joint mobility:

“We evaluated the association of steps/day at baseline with developing functional limitation two years later by calculating risk ratios adjusted for potential confounders…More walking was associated with less risk of functional limitation over two years. Walking ≥ 6000 steps/day provides a preliminary estimate of the level of walking activity to protect against developing functional limitation in people with or at risk of knee OA [osteoarthritis].”

You probably walk more than you think you do. Walking isn’t just taking the dog around the block or power-walking at lunchtime; it’s moving around the kitchen while preparing dinner, going to the mailbox, walking to a meeting down the hall.

A simple pedometer that you clip on can tell you how much you walk in a normal day—the number may surprise you. Use that as a starting point and work up to as much as you can, making a minimum of six thousand steps per day as your goal. If you can do more than that, great.

Take it slowly and if it hurts afterward, scale it back a little until you can move a greater distance (and with greater speed, if you can!) without pain. You’ll find the more you move, the more you can move. There are remedies and natural supports for joint pain that will help you ease yourself into greater activity—don’t be afraid to use them. Sesame seeds specifically have been found to be more effective than acetaminophen (Tylenol) for knee pain relief.[2]

There are other exercises that are especially good for people with arthritis, like tai chi, swimming, or water aerobics. What makes regular exercise so critical to arthritis sufferers is that muscle strength and healthy connective tissue support the joints; if the areas surrounding the joints atrophy, joints become more stiff and painful.

Our bodies were meant to move. It is sometimes easier to fall into a sedentary habit but this will cause health problems in one form or another, without fail. Move as much as you can whenever you can for not only joint, but overall, health.

Everyday activities like walking and putting on shoes can disturb your toe and have you screaming in pain. Worst of all, it can also lead to an infection that can quickly get out of hand. (Updated Sept 12, 2022)

When Your Nail isn’t Growing Properly

Onychocryptosis (ingrown toenail) is a common condition that can affect people of any age. It occurs when the toenail curls slightly inwards and the sides begin to grow into the toe instead of sitting flat above it. This leads to tears in the skin under the nail that can easily become infected with bacteria of fungi (1,2). Ingrown toenails are typically caused by improper nail cutting technique, tight-fitting footwear, or trauma to the toe (3).

Less common causes include:

Thickening of the nail plate
Oddly shaped toenails
Hallux valgus or other toe deformities,
Subungual exostosis
Taking isotretinoin (an acne drug)

Ingrown toenails are pretty easy to spot. As the nail digs into the skin, you may feel pain and tenderness in your toe along one or both sides of the nail. This is usually accompanied by swelling and redness around the affected area.

Ingrown toenails occur in three stages (4):

Stage 1 is a mild condition characterized by nail-fold swelling, erythema, edema and pain with pressure.
Stage 2 is moderate and is associated with increased swelling, drainage, infection and ulceration of the nail.
Stage 3 is a severe health problem characterized by chronic inflammation and nail-fold hypertrophy.

Stage 2-3 typically require corrective surgery and medical treatment, but stage 1 can easily be treated at home!

6 Ways to Cure an Ingrown Toenail

These simple cures require a bit of time and effort, but they can get your toenail back to normal. However, if  you suffer from diabetes or any other condition that causes neuropathy or nerve damage, speak to your podiatrist before trying any of these remedies and enlist some help to cut and clean your nails.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 12, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/mineral-to-boost-collagen-production/,#1 Mineral To Boost Your Collagen Production,"Collagen is the most abundant type of protein in the body. It acts as the “glue” that connects your tissues and cells.

See our recommended collagen supplement that actually works

Unfortunately, collagen production declines after age 20. By the time you’re middle-aged, you could be producing HALF the collagen you did in your twenties.

Even worse, lifestyle factors like poor diet, smoking, pollution, stress, and excess sun exposure, can deplete your collagen levels even faster.

Over time, lower levels of collagen in the body can cause sagging skin and wrinkles, weak nails, thinning hair, stiff joints, brittle bones, slow recovery from exercise and digestion problems.

Today, we look at one important mineral you need to boost collagen production.

We also mention two other overlooked minerals your body needs to maximize collagen production.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

The number one mineral to boost collagen is copper.

Copper activates an enzyme called lysyl oxidase that’s required for collagen maturation.

Active lysyl oxidase glues collagen fibers with other supportive fibers, helping to form the frame that supports your tissues.

Because of its role in collagen production, copper keeps your bones, heart, and blood vessels healthy.

Copper is an essential trace mineral that the body needs in very tiny amounts for survival.

According to the Institute of Medicine, adults should consume 900 micrograms of copper daily.

Besides keeping your skin young, copper is also involved in making red blood cells and maintaining nerve cells and the immune system.

While true copper deficiency is rare, many people are not getting enough of this mineral in their diet.

In fact, up to 25% of people in America and Canada may not be meeting the recommended copper intake.

If you are deficient in copper, there are several things that can happen to your body.

Number one, a severe deficiency in copper can lead to a condition called swayback or lordosis.

The spine normally curves at the neck, the torso, and the lower back area.

This positions the head over the pelvis naturally and allows the curves to work as shock absorbers, so that we can move pain-free.

However, when the spine curves too far inward at the lower back, it can cause pain and mobility issues.

Inadequate intake of copper can also lead to fatigue and weakness.

That’s because copper is essential for absorbing iron from the gut.

When copper levels are low, the body ends up absorbing less iron.

This can cause iron deficiency anemia, a condition in which the body cannot carry enough oxygen to its tissues.

Having lower levels of oxygen can make you weaker and feel tired more easily.

As you age, not getting enough copper in your diet can lead to loose and sagging skin.

That’s because copper can help boost the production of elastin.

This stretchy protein that acts like a rubber band does more than just keep your skin tight.

It’s a major component of tissues in your body that require stretchiness, like your lungs, bladder, large blood vessels and some ligaments.

Because collagen is needed to strengthen vein walls, a lack of this protein can lead to the development of varicose veins and spider veins.

Weakened, less elastic vein walls allow blood to pool within the vein, eventually stretching it to the point where it enlarges and forms a visible varicose vein.

Not getting enough copper can also affect melanin formation and cause premature grey hair.

So what are the common causes of a copper deficiency?

Since copper is primarily absorbed in the stomach and then in the small intestine, problems with either organ can affect a person’s ability to absorb copper.

Having digestive issues like low stomach acid, chronic diarrhea, celiac sprue, Crohn’s disease, and surgery can cause decreased absorption of copper.

Regular consumption of antacids, which lowers stomach acid, can also put a person at risk for copper deficiency.

People who take high doses of zinc from supplements can also develop a copper deficiency.

This is because zinc and copper compete for absorption in the stomach, with zinc being the usual winner.

As a result, copper isn’t absorbed.

The same thing can happen if you use excessive amounts of zinc-containing denture creams.

So, what can you do to add more copper to your diet?

The very first thing you can do is to eat more nuts, seeds, mushrooms, whole grains and legumes.

Other foods that are naturally high in copper include organ meat, especially liver, oysters, lobsters, and crabs.

To boost collagen production, your body relies on several nutrients from your diet.

This includes two other minerals that are often overlooked: manganese and silica.

Collagen protein contains proline, an amino acid that helps give collagen fibers their shape, and manganese is required to activate enzymes that your cells use to make proline.

The recommended daily intake of manganese is 1.8 milligrams for women and 2.3 milligrams for men. Brown rice, pecans, black pepper, and green tea can all help you reach your intake goal.

This is a naturally occurring mineral that helps with the production of collagen and has anti-inflammatory properties.

This mineral is important for optimal synthesis of collagen and for activating the hydroxylation enzymes, which improve skin strength and elasticity.

Silica can be found in foods like green beans, bananas, leafy greens, brown rice, cereal, lentils, and beer. All are significant sources of this mineral.

The FDA recommends that you shouldn’t consume more than 10-30 grams (or 2% of your daily food intake) of silica daily.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/17-surprising-home-remedies-for-acid-reflux/,17 Surprising Home Remedies for Acid Reflux,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)—or the simpler “acid reflux”—affects half of all Americans. This is the condition in which food and other stomach contents back up into your esophagus on a regular basis—at least twice a week. (Updated Sep 10, 2022)

The acids from the stomach cause irritation, inflammation, and scarring which can tighten the esophagus, making it even more irritated. GERD symptoms include nausea, wheezing, hoarseness, and eroding tooth enamel caused by acid in the mouth during sleep.

Having GERD increases your risk for esophageal cancer.

The incidence of GERD increases with age due to weakening of the esophageal sphincter and is more common in overweight people because of pressure on the esophagus. Diet also affects the sphincter: caffeine, nicotine, chocolate, and foods that are greasy, fatty, and spicy are huge irritants.

We can’t make ourselves younger but there are some simple things we can do to mitigate—or even alleviate—GERD symptoms.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 10, 2022"

We all know that drinking caffeine-rich drinks before bed is not a good idea but did you know that some drinks can actually help you sleep better? Here’s seven beverages you might want to consider drinking before going to bed.

1. Chamomile Tea

One of the most popular natural sleep aids is chamomile tea and it has been used for generations to help people to relax. It is believed that the sedative effects of chamomile tea may be linked to the flavonoid apigenin which is present in the tea.

Unfortunately not many randomized clinical trials have been done investigating chamomile in the treatment of sleep disorders but it is believed that chamomile may help relieve generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and that in doing so this may hold sleep benefits[1].

2. Almond Milk

According to Bioclinic Naturals, “Serotonin is an important initiator of sleep. The synthesis of Central Nervous System (CNS) serotonin depends on the availability of tryptophan.” Almond milk is high in tryptophan as well as another nutrient important to sleep, magnesium, and so can be beneficial in improving the quality of your sleep.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 9, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/4-things-you-absolutely-need-to-know-about-e-cigarettes/,4 Things You Absolutely Need to Know About E-Cigarettes. Don’t Buy Any Until You’ve Read This!,"As part of a plan to regulate electronic (“e-”) cigarettes, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a new requirement for manufacturers to print warnings on the devices and disclose their ingredients.

In 2011, the FDA was given the authority to regulate under tobacco laws but has not exercised that authority up to now. The National Association of Attorneys General is now calling on the FDA to include regulation of the advertising and sale of e-cigarettes.

1. What are E-Cigarettes?

An e-cigarette looks like a regular cigarette, other than the rainbow of colors available. Powered by a lithium battery, when you take a drag—or “vape”–a heating element boils liquid within the cartridge of the cigarette until vapor is produced which is then inhaled, delivering the nicotine and other chemicals. A tiny LED light at the end turns red to duplicate the look and feel of a traditional cigarette.

2. The Initial Cost Can Be Quite Expensive for Some.

One e-cigarette costs between $30 and $100 with replacement cartridges going for around $600. The price, then, is much less than the yearly $1000+ at one pack of tobacco cigarettes per day.

It’s estimated by the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association that currently 4 million Americans use them.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 9, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-lower-cholesterol-fast/,Top 10 Foods That Lower Cholesterol Fast,"Cholesterol plays a crucial part in helping cells function properly. But when your cholesterol levels are too high, your risk for heart disease and stroke skyrockets. In today’s video, we talk about 10 foods that can help lower your cholesterol levels fast.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Did you know that your liver produces 75% of the cholesterol that circulates in your body? The remaining 25% comes from the foods you eat.

High cholesterol means your total cholesterol level is 200 mg/dL or higher.

There are two main types of cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein (HDL), also referred to as good cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also referred to as bad cholesterol.

When LDL cholesterol is exposed to free radicals, it becomes oxidized.

While oxidation is inevitable and results from normal cellular activity, an overproduction of oxidized cholesterol can be harmful to heart health.

That’s because oxidized cholesterol builds up on the artery walls and leads to the hardening and narrowing of arteries or atherosclerosis.

You can prevent this from happening by reducing LDL cholesterol in your body and increasing your intake of antioxidants to fight off free radicals.

With that being said, the first item on our list is Number 10. “Legumes.”

Legumes are a group of plant foods that include beans, peas, and lentils.

A review of 26 randomized controlled studies showed that participants who ate just half a cup or 100 grams of legumes per day lowered their bad LDL cholesterol by an average of 6.6 mg/dl, compared to those who did not eat any legumes.

Legumes are packed with essential minerals and proteins. They’re also loaded with antioxidants, which are important to fend off free radicals.

But most importantly, legumes contain a good amount of soluble fiber.

In the small intestine, soluble fiber attaches itself to cholesterol and exits the body as waste. This prevents any cholesterol that’s been absorbed by the soluble fiber from entering your bloodstream.

Eating more legumes can also help decrease blood sugar levels and increase healthy gut bacteria.

Next is another food high in soluble fiber. Number 9 is “Oatmeal”.

When we don’t eat enough dietary fiber, our LDL ends up much higher than it is supposed to be.

Just eating 3 grams of soluble fiber throughout the day is enough to lower your LDL cholesterol, according to the American Dietetic Association.

In a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers tested cholesterol-lowering drugs against cholesterol-lowering foods in a group of thirty-four adults with high cholesterol.

Oat products were found to lower cholesterol levels about as well as cholesterol drugs.

Adding oatmeal into your diet is fairly simple.

But keep in mind that not everything with “oatmeal” in the name is healthy.

For example, some so-called oatmeal cookies might contain very little oatmeal and lots of fat and sugar. Always pay attention to the nutrition label.

Next, add this food to your oatmeal to make it even more nutritious. Number 8 is “Almonds”.

Almonds have been found to have a consistent LDL cholesterol-lowering effect in healthy individuals, and in individuals with high cholesterol and diabetes, in both controlled and free-living settings.

In a study published in the journal Circulation, participants who ate about a handful of almonds a day lowered their bad LDL cholesterol by 4.4%.

And those who ate two handfuls lowered it by 9.4%.

Almonds also contain relatively high levels of vitamin E.

Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that can help stop the oxidation process that causes cholesterol to clog the arteries.

One ounce (28.4 g) of plain almonds provides 7.27 mg of vitamin E, which is around half a person’s daily requirement.

The next time you have a bowl of oatmeal, add some sliced or whole almonds to make your own cholesterol-lowering breakfast.

Next is another nut that lowers bad cholesterol. Number 7 is “Walnuts”.

Similar to almonds, walnuts are loaded with vitamin E.

But they’re also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the same heart-healthy fat found in oily fish.

In one study, researchers found that people who ate about half a cup of walnuts every day for two years lowered their LDL cholesterol levels by an average of 4.3 mg/dL.

Walnut-eaters also reduced their number of total LDL particles by 4.3% and small particles by 6.1%.

Not many people know this, but LDL particles come in various sizes.

Smaller, denser LDL particles are often associated with atherosclerosis or plaque that build up in the arteries.

Nuts like almonds and walnuts also contain phytosterols. These plant compounds are structurally similar to cholesterol and help lower cholesterol by blocking its absorption in your intestines.

Coming up next is something you should eat every day. Number 6 is “Dark Leafy Greens.”

Vegetables are good for your heart, and dark leafy greens are particularly beneficial.

Dark leafy greens, such as kale and spinach, contain lutein and other carotenoids, which are linked to a lower risk of heart disease.

Carotenoids act as antioxidants to protect your body against free radicals.

This helps reduce the amount of oxidized LDL cholesterol and can help prevent cholesterol from binding to artery walls.

The fiber in dark leafy greens also helps lower cholesterol levels by binding to bile acids produced by your liver and making your body excrete more cholesterol.

Next is a superfood that’s brimming with antioxidants. Number 5 is “Berries”.

Blueberries, raspberries, black berries and even strawberries, each contain varying amounts of healthy compounds that have cholesterol-lowering properties like pterostilbene, resveratrol, anthocyanins, polyphenols, vitamins, and phytosterols.

In one study, researchers found that drinking a one-liter mixture of freeze-dried and fresh blueberries helped lower oxidized LDL by 28 percent.

Next is a popular berry that has almost no sugar. Number 4 is “Avocados”.

Avocados are rich in heart-healthy nutrients.

They’re an excellent source of monounsaturated fats and fiber.

These two key nutrients help lower “bad” LDL and raise “good” HDL cholesterol

One cup, or 150 g, of avocado contains 14.7 g of monounsaturated fats, which can help lower the risk of heart disease and strokes.

In one study, overweight and obese adults with high LDL cholesterol who ate one avocado daily lowered their LDL levels more than those who didn’t eat avocados.

Another delicious food that can help lower cholesterol is Number 3. “Dark chocolate”.

Cocoa is the key ingredient in dark chocolate.

In one study, healthy adults who drank a cocoa beverage twice a day for a month reduced LDL cholesterol by 6.5 mg/dL.

Their blood pressure also decreased and their “good” HDL cholesterol increased.

Flavanols contribute a bitter taste to pure cacao and dark chocolate.

The flavanols found in cacao include catechins and tannins. Both are also found in tea.

Catechins help prevent the LDL cholesterol in your blood from oxidizing. This is a key cause of heart disease.

However, store bought chocolate is often high in added sugar, which is bad for your arteries.

So make sure to either use cocoa powder alone or choose dark chocolate with a cocoa content of 75–85% or higher.

Next is a food staple that is best enjoyed during Fall. Number 2 is “Apples”.

Apples contain a type of soluble fiber called pectin, which has been found to help lower cholesterol.

Pectin can be found in other fruits, like grapes, citrus fruits, and even strawberries.

The mechanism by which pectin lowers cholesterol is like other water-soluble fibers.

By increasing gut viscosity, it reduces the re-absorption of bile acids, increasing synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, and reduces circulating blood cholesterol.

An analysis of 67 studies in 2,990 adults found that pectin can help reduce LDL cholesterol without affecting HDL levels.

Overall, pectin was found to help lower total cholesterol by 5–16%.

Last but not least, our Number 1 is “Okra”.

Okra, or lady’s fingers, is a warm-season vegetable cultivated throughout the world.

Researchers have found that a gel in okra called mucilage can help lower cholesterol by binding to it during digestion.

There you have it! The 10 foods that lower bad cholesterol and protect your heart and arteries.

For every 10% drop in your total cholesterol level, your heart attack risk drops by 20% to 30%.

In addition, it’s important to reduce your consumption of foods that are high in saturated fat and trans fat, like fast food, fried foods, and commercial baked goods. These foods have been found to increase LDL cholesterol levels. See our video, Top 13 Foods That Cause Inflammation.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-natural-ways-to-detox-your-body/,5 Natural Ways to Detox Your Body (No Juicing Required!),"Many health experts recommend periodic body detoxification to purge undesirable metals and chemicals and optimize body functions. There are many programs out there that involve fasting, drinking juices and teas, taking herbs, and eating only fruits and vegetables for a time.

These all may help to rid your body of toxins but there are other considerations whenever you severely restrict your diet and change your daily activities. Before you do anything drastic to embark on a detoxification regimen, consider the following as simple and safe daily actions you can take to assist your skin, kidneys, liver, and lymph nodes to do what they do anyway: get rid of the bad stuff.

1. Breathe.

Take some time to sit and focus on deep breathing.  The ”conqueror breath” is recommended for its focus on slowing and maintaining awareness. Begin with five minutes and work up to fifteen minutes each day.

2. Soak it up.

Epsom salts have several health benefits including soothing muscle pain, easing stress, and healing skin problems. It’s not really salt but a natural mineral compound also known to draw toxins out of the body through its penetration of magnesium and sulfate—two minerals that are often lacking in the North American diet—via the skin. The sulfur in Epsom salts boosts the antioxidant glutathione in your body, which prevents cell damage and supports liver function. Two cups in a hot bath has a calming therapeutic effect.

3. Get hot and sweaty.

Sauna has been employed all over the world for millennia as a way to soothe muscles, relax, de-stress, and sweat. This is a good thing, as toxins are released via your perspiration. Ten to fifteen minutes two or three times a week is beneficial. Make sure you drink plenty of water before and after to avoid dehydration. If you have any health concerns at all, consult your healthcare provider before stepping in the hot box.

4. Increase intake of cleansing vegetables.

Certain foods contain phytonutrients (compounds found in plants that serve a variety of health functions) that increase your body’s production of glutathione: kale, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, turnips, radish, and broccoli are some. They don’t smell great but these cruciferous vegetables have also been shown to inhibit cancer. [1]

5. ZZZZZ.

Last on this list—but certainly not least—is sleep. So many of us don’t get enough and good quality sleep is absolutely crucial for every aspect of your well-being. One of the many things the body does while you sleep is get rid of waste—part of your glymphatic system [2]. While awake, your brain is concerned with its day-to-day activities. Your glymphatic system waits until your brain is not pre-occupied to do its regular clean-up; it’s almost ten times more active while you sleep. Regularly get a full night’s sleep of seven or eight hours so your body can clean house.

Doing the things listed on a regular basis will support maximization of your body’s waste management without shock or additives. A little lemon in some warm water is good, too.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/detoxify-your-body-immediately-if-you-notice-any-of-these-9-warning-signs/,Detoxify Your Body Immediately If You Notice Any Of These 9 Warning Signs,"Why is it important to detoxify your body?  Even if you eat healthy most of the time, you can’t avoid breathing in the polluted air in your environment or taking in the toxins from household cleaners or even the emissions given off by vehicles that pass by you. It’s inevitable. (Updated Sept 8, 2022)

And while the toxins outside your body are bad enough, did you know that your body is creating toxic free radicals as you are reading this article. That’s right, even things like negative emotions, the hormones emitted when under stress and emotional disturbances like anxiety, all create free radicals that are highly toxic to your body.

But it’s not all doom and gloom! Your body has some pretty effective systems in check to expel these toxins such as sweating, urination or defecation. But even these natural safety protocols can become backed up when the toxins become too much.

And at that point, if you don’t take care of this overload you can become very sick, very fast.  To detoxify your body is like getting a spa after a hard day’s worth of work.  Your body feels better, your mind feels clearer, and you feel more relaxed.

Here are 9 warning signs to watch out for. If you experience any of these, it might be time to start a detox cleanse.

1. White or Yellow Tongue

Whenever you see an excess of yellow or white film on your tongue it is a signal that your body is detoxing itself through your mouth by way of your tongue and breath. Your tongue should be bright pink or pale red so if you see a film on your tongue it is time to detox.

2. Gallbladder Issues

If you are having any issues such as pain when you eat any fats, it is likely your gallbladder telling you it is overloaded. When your body is overloaded with toxins, bile released in the gallbladder from the liver can become too concentrated, which can ultimately clog your gallbladder and increase the risk of gallstones—often the source of the pain.

3. Congested Sinuses

Sinus issues are very common in people who are overloaded with toxins, especially if you regularly inhale high amounts of toxic chemicals either in your home or at work.

4. Headaches

Regular headaches with no obvious cause is a signal that something is not right. So if you find you are reaching for a pain reliever too often, try a detox program to see if the problem can be relieved naturally.

5. Skin Issues

Having skin issues such as chronic dry skin or itchy rashes and/or acne is a sign that your body needs help. To heal your skin you need to rid your body of the toxins causing the skin problems, which is why simply using a topical ointment that may have even more toxins in it, is not going to work.

6. Belly Fat

While not all belly fat is a signal that you need to detox, it is still something you should pay attention to. Toxins stored in your fat cells disrupt your metabolism, which can affect your body’s ability to control glucose and cholesterol levels. Read more here.

7. Insomnia

Your body naturally releases melatonin when it is time to sleep. If your body is full of toxins, it can affect the amount of melatonin your body releases, ultimately causing insomnia or restless sleep. A good detox can help restore your body’s natural sleep/wake cycle.

8. Overheating

If you find that you are having regular hot flashes (that are not connected with menopause), it is probably a result of a toxic build-up that is forcing your heart to work overtime, a situation called “overheating.” This is your body’s way of trying to release the toxins by sweating out the harmful toxins.

9. Lack of Energy

There is a big difference between simply being tired and exhaustion or constant fatigue and low energy. Waking up tired every day and not being able to make it through the day, is a good sign it’s time to detox. So why not start your days with this detox recipe.

There are many ways to help your body get rid of excessive toxins and detoxify your body. Here are just a few of these:

exercising
sauna
juicing/smoothies
jumping on a mini-trampoline
drinking this recipe in the morning
dry skin brushing
lymphatic massage

Combining more than one of these options will give you the best results. Whatever it is that you choose to do, just start with one thing only. It’s better to add on as you get used to a healthier lifestyle than to not start at all because you’re feeling overwhelmed.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 8, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/what-happens-when-you-drink-coffee-on-an-empty-stomach/,What happens when you drink coffee on an empty stomach,"Do you start your mornings with coffee? While it has many health benefits, some research suggests that drinking a cup of java on an empty stomach isn’t the best idea.

In today’s video, we look at three potential side effects when you drink coffee on an empty stomach.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Did you know that your morning cup of Joe can affect your blood sugar levels?

A 2020 study found that consuming strong black coffee on an empty stomach, after a night of poor sleep, could significantly impair people’s blood sugar control.

Since it’s important to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range to reduce the risk of conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, you may want to drink your morning coffee after eating first.

Another side effect you may experience from consuming coffee on an empty stomach is acid reflux.

When you take a bite of bagel or a sip of water, a valve at the top of your stomach called the lower esophageal sphincter opens to allow the food or drink to enter your stomach. Once inside, the valve closes again.

But according to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, coffee relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter.

As a result, the valve may not shut completely.

This allows stomach acid to slip back into your esophagus, which causes a condition called acid reflux.

And the most common symptom of acid reflux is heartburn, which can feel like a burning sensation in your chest.

In addition, coffee also increases the risk of heartburn because it can stimulate acidity in the stomach.

In a 2020 study published in the ​Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology​, participants who replaced two servings of coffee a day with two servings of water had a reduced risk of acid reflux.

Occasional acid reflux isn’t usually associated with long-term or serious complications.

However, when acid reflux occurs frequently and is left untreated, it can lead to conditions such as esophagitis, ulcers, inflammation, and cancer.

If coffee gives you acid reflux, consider switching to green tea.

The next side effect that you may experience from drinking coffee on an empty stomach is feeling jittery or anxious.

That’s because caffeine is absorbed into the body rapidly.

It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours after consumption. And the effects are quicker if you don’t eat prior to drinking coffee.

Whether you feel anxious and jumpy or pleasantly alert after drinking a cup of coffee depends largely on your genes, but eating patterns also play a role.

A 2018 report found that genetic variations determine how your body metabolizes caffeine.

If you’re a fast-metabolizer, drinking one cup of coffee is unlikely to make you edgy, even if it’s on an empty stomach.

But it’s a different story for those who digest caffeine slowly, which can make the effects of caffeine more pronounced and long-lasting.

If you’re a slow-metabolizer, try to drink your coffee over the course of a full hour in order to micro-dose the amount of caffeine you are getting.

Even better would be to have your coffee after eating a fiber-rich meal, which can further slow down the absorption rate of the caffeine.

Next, When Is the Best Time to Drink Coffee?

The best time to drink coffee is shortly after eating breakfast.

If you drink it before you have food in your stomach, you’re at risk for all the symptoms mentioned in this video, blood sugar spike, acid reflux, and jitteriness.

What’s more, your cortisol levels peak around seven in the morning.

Cortisol is a hormone that gives you an energy boost, so unless you’re not getting enough sleep, you should already be feeling energetic early in the morning.

Wait until your cortisol levels start to wane to drink that coffee. Holding off on caffeine for a few hours after you wake up will give you the most bang for your buck.

Also, you may want to avoid coffee in the afternoon after around 2 p.m.

Having it this late in the afternoon or evening could interfere with sleep.

A 2013 study in the ​​Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine​​ found that consuming 400 mg of caffeine or about four cups of home brew, six hours before bed reduced sleep time by more than an hour.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-for-your-brain/,#1 vitamin for your brain (Alzheimer’s prevention),"Are you getting forgetful? Have you misplaced your keys lately? You might be concerned that it’s something serious like Alzheimer’s, but in most cases, being forgetful is perfectly normal.

However, the risk of neurological diseases does increase as we get older. It is estimated that one out of every nine people older than 65 has Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia. That’s why it’s important to develop good lifestyle habits early on to help protect your brain.

Today, we’ll be talking about one group of vitamins you should prioritize, if you want to prevent cognitive decline. And the FOUR foods that cause brain inflammation you’ll want to avoid.

When it comes to keeping your brain young and healthy, B vitamins are absolutely necessary. That’s because depression, dementia and mental impairment are often associated with a deficiency of B vitamins. There are eight different B vitamins, each with its own primary health benefits.

Let’s start with Vitamin B1, also known as thiamin. B1 is crucial for the basic function of our cells and the metabolism of nutrients for energy.

While the brain represents just 2% of a person’s total body weight, it accounts for 20% of the body’s energy use. This makes the brain one of the most metabolically active organs in your body, which means it needs the support of thiamin to prevent neurological problems down the line.

Next, we have vitamin B2, or riboflavin.

B2 acts as an assistant to enzymes in our cells that carry out important reactions, such as in the body and brain. It also helps to grow cells, produce energy and break down fats and external materials like medications.

Next is vitamin B3, or niacin.

B3 interacts with over 400 enzymes to produce materials like cholesterol and fatty acids needed within the body. It also helps to convert energy for all our organ systems. Niacin is also an antioxidant which helps reduce excess inflammation.

Up next is Vitamin B5, or pantothenic acid.

B5 is essential for making coenzyme A. This molecular compound helps our body’s enzymes build and convert fatty acids for energy. B5 also helps our cells generate acyl carrier proteins, helping to produce necessary fats.

Because the human brain is nearly 60 percent fat. This makes pantothenic acid one of the most important vitamins in supporting brain health.

Next is vitamin B6, or pyridoxine.

One study found that high intake of dietary vitamin B6 through food was statistically significantly associated with lower risk of all cancers. B6 is also involved in many chemical reactions in the body that support immune function and brain health. 

Next is vitamin B7, commonly known as biotin.

B7 helps to regulate cell signals for quick and efficient communication throughout the body. In the brain, it plays a vital role in cellular signaling via neurotransmitters.

Next is vitamin B9, often referred to as folate.

B9 is a popular supplement and a key vitamin for supporting brain health, optimal neurotransmitter function, and balanced psychological health. Another benefit is that it helps encourage cellular detoxification.

And last but not least, we have vitamin B12, or cobalamin.

B12 is an essential vitamin for forming red blood cells and DNA and supporting the development and function of the nervous system. This B vitamin also supports the breakdown of homocysteine. Having elevated levels of homocysteine increases your risks for dementia, heart disease and stroke.

Unfortunately, most B vitamins can’t be stored by your body. This means that you need to consume them in your diet.

A person who has a poor diet for a few months may end up with B-group vitamins deficiency. Other things like extended cooking, food processing and excess alcohol consumption can also destroy or reduce the availability of many of these B vitamins.

The good news is that B vitamins are among the easiest to work into your diet. Foods that are rich in one B vitamin often contain many, if not all, of the other B vitamins.

Here are six vitamin B-rich foods that you should add to your diet.

Number 1. Eggs.

One egg contains a third of the recommended daily value of vitamin B7, while also containing small amounts of many other B vitamins.

Number 2. Yogurt.

This dairy product is high in both vitamin B2 and vitamin B12. It’s also rich in probiotics, which support both gut and mental health.

Number 3. Legumes.

Black beans, chickpeas, edamame and lentils all help to boost your mood and brain health. They are an excellent source of vitamin B9, and include small amounts of vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, and vitamin B6.

Number 4. Salmon.

Salmon is naturally rich in all the B vitamins, especially vitamin B2, B3, B6, and B12. It’s also an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which has anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties.

Number 5. Sunflower seeds.

These are one of the best plant sources of vitamin B5. You can get 20% of the recommended daily value of this vitamin from just one ounce of seeds!

Number 6. Leafy greens.

Spinach, Swiss chard, cabbage, and dandelion greens are a significant source of folate, a natural form of vitamin B9. If you want to boost your mood, this should be the first item on your shopping list.

That’s because folate is a necessary cofactor in neurotransmitter production.

Leafy greens also contain vitamin E, carotenoids and flavonoids, which are nutrients that can help protect against dementia and cognitive decline.

Next, did you know some foods can harm your gut bacteria and trigger metabolic processes that cause brain inflammation?

Brain inflammation can lead to depression, anxiety, irritability, anger, memory loss, and fatigue. But the most common symptom of brain inflammation is brain fog, that feeling of slow and fuzzy thinking.

If you want to fight inflammation and promote brain health, sharp thinking and good decision-making, there are four foods you should try to cut back on or completely avoid:

The first and most obvious is foods that contain added sugars.

While the brain uses glucose to fuel cellular activities, too much can be a problem.

A diet high in sugar can lead to excess glucose in the brain, which has been linked to memory impairments and less plasticity of the hippocampus — the part of the brain controlling memory.

The second thing you should cut back on is fried foods.

One study, including over eighteen thousand people, found that a diet high in fried foods was linked to lower scores in learning and memory.

That’s because these foods cause inflammation, which can damage the vessels that supply the brain with blood.

Another study that looked at 715 people found that those who consumed more fried foods were more likely to develop depression in their lifetime.

The next item on this list is not a food, but a drink. If you guessed alcohol, then you’re correct.

If a person regularly drinks too much alcohol, it’s toxic to their nerve cells.

Over time, drinking too much alcohol can cause brain cells to die and a person’s brain tissue to shrink.

This means there are fewer cells to carry the messages that the brain needs to do different tasks.

And last on this list is processed meats.

An analysis was done on over 1,000 people with and without psychiatric disorders.

The study showed that nitrates—chemicals used to cure meats such as beef jerky, salami, hot dogs and other processed meat snacks—may contribute to mania, an abnormal mood state.

Research shows there’s a big difference between the nitrates that are added to foods as preservatives and those that occur naturally in foods like spinach and celery.

The naturally occurring nitrates in foods come with vitamin C and other compounds that inhibit conversion into nitrosamines-organic chemicals that can cause cancer.

In the brain, nitrosamine exposure has been found to cause neurodegeneration.

Maybe you can’t completely give up foods preserved with nitrates.

Then, look for those that also come with vitamin C or a closely related compound like erythorbic acid, which is added to prevent nitrosamine formation.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/early-signs-of-diabetes/,Early Signs of Diabetes: #1 Symptom People Ignore,"Today, we look at the top symptoms of diabetes-and one symptom in particular that regularly goes unnoticed by doctors and patients alike.

Over 37 million Americans are living with diabetes, and 1 in 5 of them don’t know they have it. In fact, most people don’t find out they have type 2 diabetes until they experience health complications from long-term damage caused by the disease. These health complications include heart disease, cancer, nerve damage, fatty liver, blindness, and more.

Type 2 diabetes can go undetected for years because the warning signs can be so mild that you don’t notice them. This is especially true in its earliest stages. The warning signs of type 2 diabetes include:

frequent urination, often at night
increased thirst and hunger
unexpected weight loss
Lack of sharpness of vision or blurry vision
numbness or tingling in feet and hands
dry, itchy skin and dark patches on skin (acanthosis nigricans)
wounds that heal slowly
repeated infections, including yeast infection

And the one symptom that most often gets overlooked is fatigue.

There are so many reasons you may feel fatigued, like overworking, stress, not getting enough sleep, depression or other mood disorders. Most people who experience fatigue wouldn’t think that it’s caused by diabetes. So it’s easy to see why it’s often ignored.

But there is a way to tell whether your fatigue is due to diabetes or if it’s caused by something else.

While fatigue experienced at any time may indicate a blood sugar imbalance, fatigue after a meal is highly suggestive of diabetes. This symptom is also known as postprandial somnolence.

If you always feel tired and sleepy after a meal, despite getting sufficient sleep at night, get tested for diabetes, especially if you have other symptoms as well. The sooner you have a diagnosis, the sooner you can manage your blood sugar.

Next, how does eating too much sugar cause fatigue?

When your body detects high amounts of glucose or sugar molecules in the blood after eating a meal, it releases insulin from your pancreas.

Insulin is a hormone that allows your cells to absorb glucose present in the blood, to either convert it into energy or store it as fat for later. The rate at which all of this happens depends on how fast your blood sugar levels rise.

Complex carbohydrates, such as vegetables and whole grains, take longer for your body to break down. This allows glucose to be released into your blood more slowly, causing a gradual rise in blood sugar followed later by a gradual fall.

But when you drink fruit juice or eat highly processed foods, the complete opposite happens. These foods are quickly broken down and cause a large amount of glucose to enter your blood all at once.

There is a higher spike in blood sugar, which is then followed by an even more drastic fall, sometimes called a sugar crash.

The best way to prevent blood sugar spikes is to limit or remove sugary or highly processed foods from your diet.

If you’re just starting out, here’s a list of foods you should remove or gradually phase out of your diet in order of importance:

1. Soft drinks. A single 12-ounce (355-mL) can of soda contains as much as 8 teaspoons of sugar.

2. Fruit juices. Fruit juices contain the same amount of sugar as soft drinks. Choose whole fruit or canned fruit with no additional sweetening instead.

3. Candies and sweets. Try to limit your consumption of sweets.

4. Baked goods. These include cookies, cakes, and pies, among other pastries. They tend to be very high in sugar and refined carbohydrates.

5. Low-fat or diet foods. Foods with the fat removed from them are often very high in sugar to make up for the lack of flavor.

6. Drink water instead of soda or juices and don’t add sugar to your coffee or tea.

7. Stop using sugar in your recipes. Instead, use herbs and spices for flavoring like cinnamon, nutmeg, almond extract, vanilla, ginger, or even lemon.

And if you haven’t already started being more active, try to exercise more often. You don’t have to do one-hour workouts if you’re just starting out. Something as simple as taking a 15-minute walk daily can make a big difference.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 30, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/this-spice-helps-protect-your-brain-from-fluoride-poisoning/,This Spice Helps Protect Your Brain From Fluoride Poisoning,"Fluoride is found in so many places that is it nearly impossible to avoid it. It can be found in your medication, toothpaste, non stick pans and so much more. And although calcium fluoride can be found naturally underground and ocean water, sodium fluoride which is used for water fluoridation is a toxic waste substance created from the production of aluminum. (updated Aug 30 2022)

(If you’d like to know how water fluoridation came to be, read this.)

There is good news however, research is proving this common spice can prevent fluoride damage. A new study has been published in the Pharmacognosy Magazine titled, “Curcumin attenuates neurotoxicity induced by fluoride: An in vivo evidence,” and it adds more evidence to the fact that fluoride is indeed a brain-damaging substance.

This new study also reveals that the natural spice turmeric (curcumin) is a protective agent against various health effects associated with fluoride toxicity.

The researchers from the Department of Zoology, University College of Science, M.L. Sukhadia University, Udaipur, India, have spent the past decade investigating the effects fluoride has on neurology, and in particular the cells of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.

The study concluded[1],

“Our study thus demonstrate that daily single dose of 120 ppm F result in highly significant increases in the LPO [lipid peroxidation, i.e. brain rancidity] as well as neurodegenerative changes in neuron cell bodies of selected hippocampal regions. Supplementation with curcumin significantly reduce the toxic effect of F to near normal level by augmenting the antioxidant defense through its scavenging property and provide an evidence of having therapeutic role against oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration.”

https://dailyhealthpost.com/skin-cancer-symptoms/,Skin Cancer Symptoms: #1 Symptom People Ignore,"The best way to get enough vitamin D is by exposing your skin to the sun for 10-30 minutes every day. But if you’re planning on spending more time outdoors, you’ll want to protect yourself with sunscreen.

That’s because sunlight carries two types of rays, UVA and UVB, and both can cause skin cancer.

UVB causes surface sunburns. And UVA penetrates deep into your skin, causing wrinkles and dark spots.

According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the U.S.

The good news is, when skin cancer is detected early on, the five-year survival rate is 99 percent.

Today, we talk about the top symptoms of skin cancer you’ll want to look out for.

Watch this video till the end to learn about one symptom in particular that’s often overlooked.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.
First, Let’s Look At Where Skin Cancer Can Develop On The Body.

Skin cancer most often occurs on the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands. It is also common on the legs, especially for women.

It can also occur in areas that aren’t directly exposed to daylight, like your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area.

There are three main types of skin cancer. They are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.

Both basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas usually occur on sun-exposed parts of the body.

Melanoma can develop on parts of the body that rarely see light.

Next, Learn About The ABCDE Rule To Detect Potential Cancerous Growths.

Irregular moles are one of the most common signs of skin cancer.

One simple way to check your moles and determine if its skin cancer early on is to use the ABCDE rule.

“A” stands for asymmetry. Normal moles or freckles have two symmetrical halves. Look for moles that are asymmetrical, or uneven.

“B” stands for border. Be on the lookout for irregular or jagged borders on moles.

“C” is for color. Normal moles and spots are usually one color. A mole that has more than one color should be considered suspicious.

“D” is for diameter. Moles that are larger than 6mm or a pencil eraser may be a sign of melanoma.

And “E” is for evolution. Moles that change in size, appearance, and texture, or cause new symptoms like itching, pain, or bleeding, can be a sign of cancerous or pre-cancerous growth.

Next, Did You Know Skin Cancer Can Look Like A Pimple?

Very few people know about this, but skin cancer can manifest as a pimple-like bump on the skin, rather than a mole.

When that happens, people are quick to ignore it. While it may look like a harmless pimple, scar, or sore, basal cell carcinoma can grow slowly.

So, how can you determine if a newly noticed bump on your skin is simply an annoying pimple, or something more serious?

A surefire way to tell the difference between a pimple and skin cancer is whether the bump goes away on its own.

The average pimple stays on the skin for a week and subsides after popping it. But it’s a different story if it’s skin cancer, which requires professional treatment to remove.

Next, Did You Know Skin Cancer Doesn’t Always Manifest On The Skin?

Since people are so familiar with moles as a symptom of skin cancer, they may ignore other warning signs.

Sometimes, the first sign of skin cancer is a rough area of red or brown skin that resembles a scab or wart.

It’s also important to know that while skin cancer symptoms can occur externally, certain warning signs don’t manifest on the skin at all.

For example, melanoma near the lungs may lead to shortness of breath, while melanoma on the head can cause headaches and even affect your eyesight.

Skin cancer is very treatable when caught early, but it can be deadly if left untreated.

Next, How Can You Do a Skin Self-Exam?

You don’t need x-rays or blood tests to find skin cancer early, just your eyes and a mirror.

If you have a weakened immune system, have had skin cancer in the past or have a strong family history of skin cancer, doing a skin self-exam once a month could make a big difference.

A skin self-exam is best done in a well-lit room in front of a full-length mirror. You can use a hand-held mirror to look at areas that are hard to see, such as the backs of your thighs.

A spouse, partner, or close friend or family member may help you with these exams, especially for those hard-to-see areas like your back or scalp.

The best time to do a skin self-exam is after a bath or shower. Check any moles, blemishes, or birthmarks from the top of your head to your toes.

If you’re looking at your skin and see anything that concerns you, especially something that has just appeared or has changed recently, be sure to have it checked by a doctor.

Next, How Can You Prevent Skin Cancer?

Did you know that getting a sunburn just once every two years is enough to triple your risk of getting melanoma skin cancer?

Here’s a list of things you can do to reduce your exposure to ultraviolet rays to prevent skin cancer:

Limit exposure to the sun between 10 am to 4 pm when the sun’s rays are strongest.

Seek shade whenever possible.

Avoid tanning or the use of UV tanning beds.

Cover up with clothing and UV-blocking sunglasses.

Always use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when you’re planning on spending the day out. Reapply every two hours and after swimming or excessive sweating.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-b12-deficiency-symptoms/,Top 11 Vitamin B12 Deficiency Symptoms People Ignore,"Do you experience low energy, irritability, mood imbalance, feeling sluggish-especially in the afternoon, forgetfulness, light-headedness or brain fog? If so, your body may be low in vitamin B12 levels, and you’ll need to boost it.

Your body craves B12 to keep your nerves and cells healthy. B12 deficiency, also known as cobalamin deficiency, is as much associated with bad absorption as it is with low intake of the vitamin itself.

Today, we look at the warning signs your body is deficient in B12. We also look at what causes low levels of B12, and how to get optimal levels of this nutrient.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

So, how can you tell if you’re deficient in B12?

Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can manifest in these ways:

Number 11. “Tingling hands or feet”.

Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause “pins and needles” in the peripheral nerves of the hands or feet.

Number 10. “Trouble walking”.

Over time, peripheral nerve damage resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency can cause numbness in the feet and limbs, making it hard for a person to walk without support.

Number 9. “Pale skin”.

Pale or yellow skin, called jaundice, may be a symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Jaundice develops when a person’s body cannot produce enough red blood cells, causing megaloblastic anemia.

Number 8. “Fatigue”.

Megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to a person feeling fatigued because there are not enough red blood cells to carry oxygen around their body.

Number 7. “Fast heart rate”.

A fast heart rate may be a symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency.

The heart may start to beat faster to make up for the reduced number of red blood cells in the body.

Number 6. “Shortness of breath”.

Anemia that results from vitamin B12 deficiency may cause a person to feel short of breath, because of a lack of red blood cells and a fast heartbeat.

Number 5. “Mouth pain”.

Deficiency in vitamin B12 may cause a swollen, smooth, red tongue, mouth ulcers, or a burning sensation in the mouth.

This is due to a reduction in red blood cell production, which results in less oxygen reaching the tongue.

Number 4. “Thinking or reasoning problems”.

Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause difficulty in thinking or reasoning, and memory loss, because of less oxygen reaching the brain.

Number 3. “Irritability”.

Being deficient in vitamin B12 can affect a person’s mood, and may cause irritability or depression.

Number 2. “Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea”.

Vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to a person both feeling and being sick, and cause diarrhea because of insufficient oxygen.

Number 1. “Decreased appetite and weight loss”.

As a result of digestive issues, such as nausea, people with vitamin B12 deficiency may lose their appetite, leading to weight loss.

Are you experiencing any of these symptoms?

A severe deficiency in Vitamin B12 can cause permanent damage to the brain and nervous system.

Conversely, when you get enough vitamin B12, and absorb it well, it has been shown to:

help maintain energy levels, support better mood, support healthy heart function, support healthy thick hair and clear skin, aid in digestion by fostering a healthy environment for gut-friendly bacteria, and boost the ability to think, learn, and remember.

Next, Let’s talk about the important role vitamin B12 plays in the body.

The human body needs B12 to make red blood cells, nerves, and DNA.

Vitamin B12 regulates hormone production and supports a healthy immune system.

It’s important for the functioning of the digestive, circulatory, and reproductive systems.

Vitamin B12 is also needed to convert carbohydrates into fuel that the body can use, and metabolize fats and proteins.

So, getting enough B12 can help you feel more energetic and have a better overall sense of well-being. The average adult should get 2.4 mcg a day.

Next, what causes vitamin B12 deficiency?

The most common cause of B12 deficiency is inadequate absorption. Here is the process by which B12 is absorbed:

Vitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat.

In order for the body to absorb B12, it first needs to be separated into its free form.

To do this, adequate amounts of stomach acid are required.

Once B12 has been separated, it needs to combine with another protein produced by stomach cells called intrinsic factor, so that it can be absorbed once it reaches the small intestine.

So, absorbing B12 is a multi-step process, and any disruption can compromise this process.

Here are a few factors that affect B12 absorption:

As you age, it becomes more difficult for your body to absorb vitamin B12 from foods because you produce less stomach acid.

Any surgeries that affect the stomach where intrinsic factor is made, or the ileum, which is the last portion of the small intestine where vitamin B12 is absorbed, can also increase your risk of a deficiency.

Lack of intrinsic factor in the body can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. This is an autoimmune disease, which causes an overactive immune system to attack and destroy the stomach cells that produce intrinsic factor or the protein itself.

Vegans who don’t eat foods high in B12 are also at risk of developing a deficiency.

Prescription medication can also interfere with the body’s ability to absorb B12.

People who take medications that suppress stomach acid for conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or peptic ulcer disease, such as proton-pump inhibitors, H2 blockers, or other antacids, may also have difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 from food.

That’s because these drugs can slow down the release and even decrease the production of stomach acid.

Medications used to treat diabetes like metformin can also cause B12 deficiency.

Alcohol consumption, even on a moderate level, can cause B12 deficiency. Drinking alcohol flushes B vitamins from your body and decreases absorption from your gut.

Also, you may not be able to process vitamins properly if you suffer from digestive problems, such as Crohn’s disease or Celiac disease.

Liver disorders may interfere with the storage of this nutrient because most of the body’s vitamin B12 is stored in the liver.

Next, how can you test for vitamin B12 deficiency?

A simple blood test can diagnose a vitamin B12 deficiency.

For example, your doctor might recommend a complete blood count (CBC), a homocysteine test, or a methylmalonic acid (MAA) test.

The most important step, however, is to visit a doctor who has experience in diagnosing and treating B12 deficiencies.

Next, what foods can you eat to get enough vitamin B12?

Unlike other vitamins, B12 isn’t readily available to the body.

That’s because B12 is produced by bacteria in the soil.

And animals and humans must get it from bacteria, directly or indirectly.

Animal foods naturally contain high amounts of vitamin B12 because they accumulate this bacterial product during their lives.

Also, livestock are often supplemented with B12 in their feed.

Here is a list of foods that contain significant amounts of B12:

Beef, animal liver and shellfish, fish like sardines and tuna, meat, eggs, milk, and other dairy products.

Vegan foods with lesser amounts of B12 include:

Algae – such as Spirulina and Chlorella

Seaweed – such as Nori or Laver

Nutritional yeast –  a type of deactivated yeast, also called “Nooch”

Wheatgrass Juice – from freshly sprouted leaves

Legumes Sprouts – like moong, peas, lentil

Root Vegetables – like carrots, radish and turnips

Buckwheat – such as noodles or porridge

Mushrooms – Black trumpet and Golden Chanterelle contain higher levels of B12

B12 fortified foods – such as breakfast cereal, non-dairy milk and nutritional yeast

If you have low stomach acid, you may choose to eat fortified foods or B12 supplements, as these forms are absorbed well and do not require stomach acid.

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin B12 increases as you get older.

It’s recommended that vegans take more than the RDA of B12, to compensate for the lack of animal sources in their diet.

Most of the B12 supplements you find are cyanocobalamin, which is synthetic. The best form of supplemental B12 is methylcobalamin, which is naturally occurring and most readily absorbable.

See our recommended methylcobalamin source below.

Keep in mind that your body may only absorb 50% of the vitamin B12 it ingests.

What’s more, certain medical conditions, such as gut inflammation, can impede B12 absorption.

So it’s important to monitor your levels as you adjust your diet or begin supplementation.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/this-sleeping-position-helps-your-brain-flush-out-toxins-more-efficiently-13069/,This Sleeping Position Helps Your Brain Flush Out Toxins More Efficiently,"Most of us don’t think much about the way we sleep. Whether we sleep on our back, side, stomach, or curled up in a fetal-like position seems of little consequence. But according to a recent study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, how we position our body when sleeping can actually reduce our risk of Alzheimer’s and other neurological disorders. (Updated Aug 21, 2022)

Why You Should Sleep On Your Side

The study reveals that sleeping on your side rather than on your stomach or back allows the brain to more easily and efficiently dispose of waste products, causing less buildup of plaques in the brain(1).

“We investigated the influence of body posture on brainwide transport of inert tracers of anesthetized rodents,” the study authors explain.

“The major finding of our study was that waste, including [amyloid beta], removal was most efficient in the lateral position (compared with the prone position), which mimics the natural resting/sleeping position of rodents.”

Most doctors believe that the best sleep position is either resting on your back or on your side – these positions provide support for the spine and neck, which leads to a better night’s sleep and can help prevent long-term injuries.

The Sleeping Position Most People Prefer

One 2007 study from the Internet Journal Of Allied Health Sciences And Practice found that most individuals surveyed preferred sleeping on their side to sleeping on their back or stomach, and that those who did sleep on their side reported waking up during the night with less frequency than those who did not.(2)

In the recent Journal of Neuroscience study, MRA technology was used to image the brain’s glymphatic pathway – the system that clears waste from the brain. The buildup of brain waste chemicals, like amyloid beta, may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease and other degenerative neurological conditions such as dementia.

Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, an author on the study, found the findings particularly interesting given humans’ propensity for sleeping on our sides.

“It is interesting that the lateral sleep position is already the most popular in humans and most animals – even in the wild – and it appears that we have adapted the lateral sleep position to most efficiently clear our brain of the metabolic waste products that build up while we are awake,” Dr. Nedergaard said in a recent press release(3).

“Out finding brings new insight into this topic by showing it is also important what position you sleep in.”

The next step for the research team is to use MRI technology to create imagery of human brains during sleep. In the meantime, if you’re looking for a better night’s sleep, try sleeping on your side – it’s scientifically proven to be better for you!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/lower-uric-acid-naturally/,10 Ways to Lower Uric Acid Naturally,"If you have high uric acid levels or hyperuricemia, this video will show you 10 ways to lower uric acid naturally and reduce gout symptoms. Not only can hyperuricemia lead to painful gout flares, it can also increase your risk of developing kidney stones.

As we mentioned in our last video, the first step to lower high uric acid levels is to reduce purine-rich foods, and avoid alcohol and high-fructose corn syrup. Make sure to watch “Top 10 Uric Acid Foods to Avoid” if you missed it.

Let’s begin with our Number 10, “Cherries”.

Cherries are one of the best things you can eat to reduce uric acid in the body.

They help lower uric acid levels by increasing kidney filtration rate and decreasing reabsorption of uric acid.

Cherries are also a natural source of xanthine oxidase inhibitors, which are primarily used in the clinical prevention and treatment of gout associated with hyperuricemia.

They are particularly rich in quercetin. Several studies have found that quercetin supplementation can decrease uric acid levels in men.

Finally, this fruit is loaded with anthocyanins, which is what gives cherries their deep red color. Anthocyanins have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the body, which can help reduce the production of uric acid.

In fact, one study found that drinking at least 8 oz of cherry juice daily for at least four weeks, can help lower uric acid levels naturally.

Next on our list is number 9, “Vitamin C”.

Along with avoiding foods rich in purine, you should also consume foods rich in vitamin C like kiwi, strawberries or bell peppers.

Several metabolic studies and a double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial, have shown that higher vitamin C intake significantly reduces serum uric acid levels.

In a 2005 study published in Arthritis & Rheumatism, participants who took 500 mg vitamin C supplements daily for two months had significantly lower uric acid levels compared to those who took placebos.

Unless you’ve had kidney stones in the past, increasing your intake of vitamin C, helps lower your uric acid levels naturally.

Coming up next is Number 8, “Coffee”.

Often, coffee drinkers worried about gout are left wondering: Is coffee helpful or harmful?

Turns out, coffee contains an antioxidant called chlorogenic acid that can lower your uric acid levels and may even prevent gout.

For example, men in a 2007 study who said they drank four to five cups of coffee a day had a 40% lower relative risk of developing gout when compared with men who didn’t drink coffee.

In another study, researchers found that drinking coffee was associated with lower levels of uric acid and fewer episodes of hyperuricemia.

Next up, Number 7 is “Water”.

Staying hydrated is incredibly important for your overall health and this is especially true if you’re dealing with gout. Drinking more water can help flush out excess uric acid in your body.

Milk is another good beverage to reduce uric acid production and increase uric acid excretion from the body.

Next up, Number 6 is “Weight Loss”.

Besides improving your diet, losing weight can also help lower your uric acid levels.

Being overweight or obese makes it harder for your kidneys to eliminate uric acid through your urine.

The risk of developing gout is 10 times higher for individuals who are obese than those who are at a healthy weight. That’s because fat cells naturally produce more uric acid than muscle cells.

A 2017 study with over four thousand participants found that those who lost more than 22 pounds over two years had significantly lower uric acid levels.

Next up, Number 5 is “Balance Insulin Levels”.

Insulin is a hormone that allows cells in the muscles, fat and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood.

However, too much insulin can lead to excess uric acid in the body, as well as weight gain. That’s because insulin decreases the urinary excretion of uric acid.

To prevent insulin levels from spiraling out of control, try to avoid consuming too much sugar or highly processed junk food.

Check out our video “Top 13 foods to reverse insulin resistance”.

At Number 4 we have “Dietary Fiber”.

Eating at least 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber can help slow down the absorption of sugar. This prevents your blood sugar and insulin levels from spiking. As mentioned previously, keeping insulin levels low allows your body to eliminate uric acid effectively.

Adding more dietary fiber to your diet also helps increase satiety. This makes it easier to avoid overeating, which can lead to weight gain. The less excess fat you carry, the less uric acid your body produces.

Next up, Number 3 is “Reduce Stress”.

For some people, stress can trigger gout attacks. That’s because high levels of stress and anxiety are associated with increased uric acid levels. Breathing exercises and yoga are great ways to help cope with stress.

Next on our list is Number 2, “Exercise Regularly”.

On average, gout attacks last for about three to 10 days. And it can take months or years before you experience another one. During these pain-free times, exercise should be at the top of your to-do list.

That’s because exercising can help reduce inflammation, maintain a healthy weight, and prevent insulin resistance. These are all things that can help reduce uric acid levels in your body.

If you’ve recently experienced a gout flare, aquatic exercises may be a good place to restart working out. The buoyancy of the water will reduce the impact on the joints.

There are other low-impact aerobic exercises you can also try, like an elliptical machine or a stationary bicycle.

And at Number 1, we have “Reduce Certain Meds”.

Some medications may raise your uric acid levels. These include diuretics, immunosuppressant drugs, niacin, and chemotherapy drugs.

Low-dose aspirin may also raise the level because it can interfere with your kidneys’ ability to excrete uric acid. 

If you need to take any of these medications and have hyperuricemia, it’s important to let your doctor know so that he can work with you to figure out a suitable alternative.

Next, let’s look at what causes gout.

It is a common mistake to think that diet alone causes gout, and if you change your diet, you can fix the problem.

Research increasingly shows that genes and family history have a much bigger impact on how much urate or uric acid crystals are in your blood compared to diet.

A 2018 study published in the journal BMJ found this to be true.

There is no one cause of gout. Your genes and family history, weight, medical history, medications, and other things all play a part in developing gout.

Although this does not imply that you can eat as much steak as you want, treating yourself occasionally will not immediately trigger a gout flare-up.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-boost-collagen/,Top 7 Foods That Boost Collagen,"In today’s video, we’ll be looking at the top 7 foods you can eat to naturally boost collagen production in your body.

Collagen plays an important role in the body and acts as a glue that helps ensure the cohesion, elasticity, and regeneration of skin, joints, tendons, ligaments, and skeletal muscles.

As we age, our body’s ability to produce collagen decreases with each passing year. This results in having more wrinkles, sagging skin, thinner hair, and weaker joints.

While growing old is inevitable, research shows that your diet plays a much bigger role in the aging process than your genetics.

This means that eating the right collagen-boosting foods can make you look a lot younger than your actual age.

Why everyone over 50 should be taking THIS kind of protein
Let’s start with Number 7 “Protein-rich foods”.

Think of amino acids as raw material that’s needed by the body to make collagen. When you ingest proteins, your body breaks them down into amino acids. Among these amino acids, your body uses mainly lysine, glycine and proline for collagen production.

Lean meats, bone broth, fish, eggs, and also legumes are some of the best sources of protein you can add to your diet, to make sure you get all the amino acids you need to produce collagen.

Coming up next is Number 6 “Dark Leafy Greens”.

If you aren’t already doing this, adding dark green leafy vegetables to your diet can be a game changer.

Spinach, swiss chard, and other greens get their color from chlorophyll, which has been well-documented for its antioxidant properties. Some studies have even shown that consuming chlorophyll increases the precursor to collagen in the skin.

Dark leafy greens are also excellent sources of vitamin C, which is a critical component of collagen synthesis.

Next, add this category of foods to your diet to boost collagen production.

Number 5 is “vitamin C-rich foods”.

To build collagen, our body produces procollagen, a precursor to collagen. Procollagen is made by combining the amino acids glycine and proline, along with vitamin C.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that without vitamin C, the body is literally unable to produce collagen.

It’s the reason why sailors in the past who were deficient in vitamin C for prolonged periods of time developed scurvy.

Scurvy is a disease associated with collagen degradation and can cause visual blemishes on the skin and bleeding gums.

Additionally, vitamin C is also critical for the synthesis of hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is a gooey, slippery substance that your body produces naturally.

It’s found throughout your whole body, especially in the eyes, joints, and skin. Its primary function is to serve as a cushion and lubricant in the joints and other tissues.

Eating foods rich in vitamin C and amino acids can increase the levels of hyaluronic acid and collagen in the body, which are both important for skin health and joints.

On top of that, vitamin C also acts as an antioxidant and helps fight off free radicals caused by environmental pollutants that can damage the collagen present in your skin.

Popular sources of this nutrient include citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and tropical fruits like mango, kiwi, pineapple, and guava.

Berries are another excellent source of vitamin C that are also naturally high in antioxidants.

While we’re on the subject of colorful foods, here’s one you don’t want to ignore.

Number 4 is “Red and Orange whole foods”.

Carotenoids are a class of more than 750 naturally occurring pigments synthesized by plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria.

These molecules are the sources of the yellow, orange, and red colors you see in many plants.

Fruits and vegetables provide most of the 40 to 50 carotenoids found in the human diet. Among the most important carotenoids for humans, beta-carotene and lycopene stand out from the rest when it comes to slowing down the signs of aging.

Both lycopene and beta-carotene can help boost your skin’s defenses against UV radiation and help maintain skin health and appearance.

Most of you probably already know this, but beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A. Your body converts beta-carotene to vitamin A according to its needs.

Vitamin A is an essential vitamin at any age, including for cellular health and vision.

Additionally, vitamin A also plays an important role in stimulating collagen accumulation in your skin.

It can also inhibit something called the matrix metalloproteinase, which is an enzyme that chews up collagen as a result of exposure to environmental stressors.

Next up is a nutrient most of us don’t get enough.

Number 3 is “Omega-3 fatty acids”.

Every single one of your cells is coated with a membrane that contains omega-3 fatty acids. Yet, the majority of people eating a western diet don’t get enough of this powerful anti-inflammatory.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been proven to help reduce UV-induced damage, as well as inhibit wrinkle formation through collagen synthesis.

Excellent sources of omega-3s you should consider eating include fatty fish, walnuts, flax seeds, and shellfish.

If you don’t like fish, then supplementing your diet with a high-quality Omega-3 is always a viable option.

Coming up next is something you should probably eat every day.

Number 2 is “Garlic”.

Garlic can do more than just add flavor to your stir-fries and pasta dishes. It can also boost your collagen production.

Garlic is high in sulfur, which is a trace mineral that helps synthesize and prevent the breakdown of collagen. Garlic is also high in taurine and lipoic acid, which are essential for rebuilding damaged collagen.

While not everyone may like the smell of garlic, its many health benefits make it a worthy ingredient to add to your regular diet.

First on the list is the perfect snack to boost collagen production.

Number 1 is “Cashews”.

Next time you’re thinking of a snack, reach for a handful of cashews. These satiating nuts are loaded with zinc and copper. Both of these minerals have been found to boost our body’s ability to create collagen.

Zinc serves as a co-factor for collagen production, which means that it activates proteins essential for collagen synthesis.

It also activates a protein called collagenase that allows your cells to remodel collagen during wound healing.

Zinc is also essential for cell repair and helps protect collagen in the body from damage.

Copper also plays a role in collagen production. It activates an enzyme called lysyl oxidase that’s required for collagen maturation. In addition to increasing collagen production, copper also helps boost elastin proteins, which can help create firmer and smoother looking skin.

There you have it, the top 7 foods to eat to boost collagen production.

But eating the right stuff isn’t the only thing you can do to slow down the signs of aging.

If you want life-changing results, you’ll need to avoid eating too much sugar and refined carbohydrates, which can cause inflammation and damage collagen.

You’ll also want to reduce your exposure to advanced glycation end products also known as AGEs.

AGEs are inflammatory compounds that are formed when a protein or fatty-acid combines with sugar in the bloodstream and are linked with chronic diseases like cancer or diabetes.

This process is called glycation and is not something you can completely avoid. It’s a natural part of your metabolism and fortunately, your body has different mechanisms in place, such as antioxidants, to keep AGEs under control.

However, things can get out of hand if you eat a diet high in added sugar and ultra-processed foods. That’s because AGEs can also accumulate in the foods you eat, depending on how it’s prepared.

Fried foods or anything that’s cooked at high heat are some of the worst offenders. One simple way to lower the amount of AGEs in the foods you cook is to change the method of preparation.

Instead of always frying or roasting, try boiling and steaming. If you like steaks, you can try making them with the sous-vide method. Lean towards cooking with low heat as opposed to high heat. Slow cookers are also a great way to limit the production of AGEs.

There’s nothing wrong with enjoying a barbecue or french fries, but if your diet is solely based on these things, it’s not going to bode well for the health of your skin in the long-run.

Other things you’ll want to avoid doing is excessive drinking and smoking cigarettes. These speed up the formation of wrinkles, sagging skin and reduce collagen production.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/uric-acid-foods-to-avoid/,Top 10 Uric Acid Foods To Avoid If You Have Gout,"Today, we’re going to look at what happens to your body when your uric acid levels are too high, and how you can reduce it by avoiding certain foods.

Uric acid is a byproduct that forms when chemicals called purines are broken down by your body. Purines are building blocks of DNA and RNA and are super important for cell energy production. They are produced by your body and are also absorbed through the foods you eat.

Most of the uric acid dissolves in the blood, passes through the kidneys and leaves the body through urine. The rest is eliminated in the stool. However, if you eat foods high in purines, and your kidneys are having problems excreting uric acid, you end up with elevated levels of uric acid in the blood or hyperuricemia.

So, what are high uric acid levels?

For men, the normal upper limit is 8.6 mg of uric acid per liter of blood, and for women, the value is considered to be 7.1 mg per liter. Anything above these levels is hyperuricemic, and symptoms can occur. At any one time, it has been estimated that at least 20% of the US population has hyperuricemia.

What are the effects of hyperuricemia?

What happens in hyperuricemia is that crystals of uric acid or urate can form, even if you do not see symptoms. These needle-like crystals can settle in the joints and tissues and cause gout, a form of arthritis that can be very painful.

These “needles” literally pierce through the walls of white blood cells, which signals for more cells to come to the rescue, and cause a cascade of inflammation and a full-on attack. Gout attacks come and go and usually occur in the lower legs, like the ball of the foot or ‘big toe’. Uric acid crystals can also settle in the kidneys and form kidney stones.

So, why is elevated uric acid such a big deal?

That’s because hyperuricemia and gout can cause chronic inflammation over many years, and lead to permanent bone, joint and tissue damage, kidney disease and heart disease if untreated.

Research has also shown that hyperuricemia and gout are linked to high blood pressure and metabolic problems like weight gain, type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.

The good news is that it’s possible to control and lower your uric acid levels by making simple dietary changes.

This starts with reducing or avoiding purine-rich foods that stimulate uric acid production. And this is exactly what we’re going to talk about in the rest of the video. Not all people with hyperuricemia get gout, but all people with gout have hyperuricemia.

These are the foods to avoid or reduce in your diet if you have hyperuricemia or want to prevent gout attacks.

Let’s begin with Number 10 “Red Meat”.

Red meat has more purine than white meat. Lamb has the most purine of all red meats. People trying to avoid gout flare-ups should not eat beef or pork more than three times per week. If you do eat lamb, go for chops instead of leg meat.

Next on our list is Number 9 “Fish”.

Fish that are rich in purine include herring, tuna, mackerel, sardines, and anchovies. Salmon is a good low-purine alternative that is generally safe. People with gout should eat fish no more than twice a week.

Coming up next is Number 8 “Wild Game”.

People with hyperuricemia should avoid eating meat from wild game, especially rabbit, venison, quail, pheasant, and goose. These animals have high purine content which can increase the risk of gout attacks. Instead, eat white meat like chicken in moderate amounts when paired with plenty of vegetables.

Next up, we have Number 7 “Scallops”.

People with hyperuricemia are encouraged to enjoy scallops only occasionally. Better options are lobster, shrimp, salmon, and crab. A person’s total seafood intake should be no more than six to eight ounces a day.

On to our next item, Number 6 is “Organ Meats”.

Organ meats are not recommended for people with high uric acid levels. It is best to avoid eating tongue, liver, brains, kidneys, and sweetbreads to minimize gout attacks.

Coming up next, Number 5 is “Beer”.

Beer is probably the worst drink when it comes to hyperuricemia and gout. That’s because it contains alcohol and is also high in purine from brewer’s yeast.

All alcohol-including beer, wine, and hard spirits-cause the kidneys to excrete alcohol instead of uric acid. This dehydrates the body and increases the amount of undissolved uric acid in the blood.

Beer drinking doesn’t necessarily lead to gout. But if you have gout and drink beer, you will definitely experience attacks.

Also, avoid packaged foods and dietary supplements that contain yeast or yeast extract, as these are high in purines.

Moving on to Number 4, we have “High-Fructose Corn Syrup”.

Many sweetened beverages like fruit juices, sodas, and energy drinks are loaded with high-fructose corn syrup or HFCS, which stimulates uric acid production.

Freshly-squeezed fruit juices are concentrated with fructose and consumption should be limited. In general, avoid any prepackaged snacks or processed foods like fast food, candy, cookies and sauces that are loaded with HFCS when trying to reduce hyperuricemia and prevent gout attacks.

Getting into our top 3, Number 3 is “Certain Vegetables”.

While vegetables are recommended for people with high uric acid levels, you may want to limit purine-rich vegetables if you already have hyperuricemia. These include asparagus, mushrooms, peas, spinach, and cauliflower, and legumes like dried fava, garbanzo beans, and lentils.

Studies have shown that high-purine vegetables do not increase the risk of gout or recurring gout attacks the same way as high-purine animal foods.

Our Number 2 is “Certain Fruits”.

Researchers have linked fruit juice and certain types of fruits with gout symptoms, including chronic pain. Fruits like peaches, mangoes, kiwi, dried fig, persimmons, and apricots should be eaten in moderation in small amounts. These are high in fructose and also oxalate, which increase the risk of kidney stones in people with gout. Go for cherries, berries, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, papaya, apple and banana.

Also, while tomatoes are low in purine, some research suggests they may cause gout flares.

And at Number 1, we have “Whole and Refined Grains”.

Whole grains like oatmeal, wheat germ, and bran have moderate levels of purines. While they are not as high in purines as organ meats, scallops or some fish, it is still high enough to increase your risk of gout when eaten in excess.

Also, whether wheat is whole grain or refined, it contains more gluten than any other food and triggers inflammation.

Limiting high-glycemic-index foods, such as white bread, pasta, and rice, may help to decrease uric acid levels. This could prevent gout onset or flares.

At this point, you may be wondering, should you avoid dairy products?

It turns out there’s a misconception that people with gout should avoid dairy. In fact, certain dairy products like cheese, yogurt, and especially milk can help you remove uric acid from your body. In other words, dairy tends to help rather than hurt people with hyperuricemia and gout.

Also, note that while rich foods like desserts do not cause flare-ups when eaten in moderation, they can cause weight gain. And obesity is a major risk factor for gout attacks.

To test your uric acid levels at home, you can use a blood uric acid meter.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-d/,Everyone’s taking vitamin D ???? but no one knows this!,"You already know that getting enough vitamin D is important for your overall health. But did you know that consuming more vitamin D is not necessarily better, and in fact, can make things worse?

That’s because supplementing with vitamin D “without” two other key nutrients can weaken your bones and even contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries.

So, what are these two nutrients? And how do they help your body use vitamin D properly? This is exactly what we’re going to talk about in this video.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

So, the first important nutrient is magnesium.

Even before you consider taking vitamin D supplements, you should ask yourself if you’re getting enough magnesium in your diet.

You see, magnesium is a cofactor in hundreds of enzymes that are involved in important biological reactions. And this includes the enzymes that play a role in vitamin D metabolism.

Now, vitamin D, in either the D2 or D3 form, is considered biologically inactive until it is converted into its active form, calcitriol.

For this conversion to happen, the enzymes present in your liver and kidneys require sufficient amounts of magnesium to draw upon.

This means if you have low levels of magnesium, your body won’t be able to make full use of the vitamin D supplements you’re taking.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the recommended amount of magnesium is 400-420 mg per day for men, and 310-320 mg a day for women.

However, these guidelines only apply to oral supplements such as tablets and capsules. There are currently no upper limit recommendations for transdermal magnesium supplements, which are basically those you apply directly to your skin.

If you experience poor sleep, lethargy and heart palpitations, this could mean that you aren’t getting enough magnesium through your diet.

One of the best ways to replenish your body’s supply of magnesium is by eating foods like almonds, pumpkin seeds, mushrooms, cashew nuts, and spinach.

Plus, getting enough magnesium benefits you in a variety of ways like relieving muscle tension, reducing stress, and helping with your nervous system and your body’s synthesis of proteins.

Now that you know how the vitamin D you’re taking gets metabolized, the second nutrient is something you absolutely cannot ignore.

One study published in 2010 found that older women who consume very high doses of vitamin D alone were prone to more falls and fractures.

This may come as a complete surprise, since vitamin D’s primary function in the body is to help absorb calcium from the intestines.

But calcium absorption is only part of the equation. Too much vitamin D can actually have the opposite effect.

In one study, participants who took either 400 IU, 4,000 IU or 10,000 IU of vitamin D over a three-year period showed no improvement in bone density, and actually showed decreased density in the highest dose group.

What most people don’t know is that vitamin D also facilitates the formation and activation of osteoclasts.

Osteoclasts are a specialized type of cell that removes calcium from bones. Think of them as the first step in a complex loop where bones need to be broken down before they can be rebuilt to allow new bone to develop and to maintain bone strength.

The problem is that the calcium you’re getting isn’t doing you any good if it’s not being transported to the right places like your bones and teeth.

For this to happen, your body requires vitamin K2 in the form of MK-7. We highly recommend that you watch our previous video on this cardioprotective nutrient to better understand its different subtypes.

So, vitamin K2 is the missing piece of the puzzle.

The active form of vitamin D ensures that calcium is absorbed easily. Then vitamin K2 activates the protein osteocalcin, which tells your cells to carry all that calcium into your bones and teeth.

Taking too much vitamin D without vitamin K2 can lead to excessive calcium in the blood, which could end up being deposited into your kidneys, arteries and other soft tissues.

Adults should ensure they are getting between 100 and 300 mcg of vitamin K2 per day.

So, now you know why you need to get enough magnesium and vitamin k2 along with vitamin D3.

Vitamin D is incredibly important to your overall health because it can turn disease-causing genes on and off.

Studies have shown that Vitamin D can switch off cancer-causing genes, and switch on genes vital to immune system function. As you can imagine, this has a positive impact on a variety of bodily systems.

So, how much vitamin D is too much?

The generally recommended safe upper limit is 4,000 IU per day. However, people who are deficient in vitamin D need to take more than this. Make sure to consult a healthcare professional on what dosage you should take.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-low-thyroid-levels/,12 signs of LOW thyroid levels (Hypothyroidism),"In today’s video, we’ll be talking about a crucial hormone in our body: the thyroid hormone, and what happens when you have hypothyroidism, or low levels of thyroid hormone in your body.

Your thyroid is the butterfly-shaped gland in your lower throat. It produces two main hormones, T4 and T3, which are responsible for managing your metabolism, body temperature, and blood pressure.

When your hormone levels are too high or low, it can cause all sorts of chaos. That’s because every cell in your body uses thyroid hormones!

When the thyroid is under-active and does not create enough hormones, it’s called hypothyroidism. And when it’s over-active and releases too many hormones, it’s called hyperthyroidism.

Now, hypothyroidism is extremely common. It affects up to 5% of the population in the United States alone, with a further estimated 5% being undiagnosed.

The primary reason many people are undiagnosed is because many patients, as well as their doctors, mistake the symptoms of low thyroid levels for something else entirely.

Today, we’ll look at 12 symptoms of an under-active thyroid. Keep in mind that these symptoms are not definitive proof of the disease. Always consult a doctor for professional opinion.

Now, with that being said, let’s look at the first symptom. Number 12 is “Hair Thinning”.

There are three kinds of hair days: the good, the bad, and the days when your strands are trying to warn you that your thyroid levels are low.

The thyroid hormones are crucial for the growth and health of hair follicles.

You’ll find that people with low thyroid hormones have hair that is dry, coarse, brittle and slow-growing.

The hair loss caused by thyroid problems occurs over time and falls out in clumps or strands. And it can also happen to your eyebrows, body hair, and eyelashes.

Hair regrowth can occur upon successful treatment of this thyroid disorder, though it can take several months and may still be incomplete.

Your hair isn’t the only thing that can dry up if you have hypothyroidism. Number 11 is “Dry Skin”.

Just like hair follicles, skin cells also have a rapid turnover. This means they are sensitive to losing growth signals if there is a lack of thyroid hormones.

When the normal cycle of skin renewal is broken, skin may take longer to regrow. The outer layer of skin will take longer to shed, leading to flaky, dry skin.

And when that skin is on the scalp, the effects can show up in your hair. That’s because dry, flaky skin can lead to an itchy scalp and stubborn dandruff.

Another physical sign that can be seen by the naked eye is Number 10, “Brittle nails”.

An underactive thyroid can cause slow-growing and brittle nails.

In addition, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA), your nails may also develop visible ridges.

Some patients with hypothyroidism may also notice that their fingernails lift up, splitting from the nail bed.

This condition is known as onycholysis and is also referred to as “Plummer’s nails.”

Onycholysis can appear as a white discoloration, because of the air underneath the nail.

Next is a subtle sign that is often overlooked. Number 9 is “Chronic Fatigue”.

When was the last time you had a good night’s sleep and woke up refreshed?

Now, imagine having that good night’s sleep but waking up tired like you have no energy or motivation to do anything.

That’s what fatigue feels like and is one of the most common symptoms of hypothyroidism.

And no matter how much you sleep or how many naps you take, the fatigue never really goes away.

Not only does the lack of energy make it harder to go about your daily life, it can actually worsen the next item on this list. Number 8 is “Weight gain”.

If you have a swollen face and put on weight easily, your thyroid may be causing these issues.

That’s because the thyroid helps produce key hormones necessary to regulate body weight, hunger levels, and the metabolism of fat and sugar. Even mild cases of hypothyroidism may increase the risk of weight gain and obesity.

As if putting on weight isn’t already bad enough, the next on this list is a real pain. Number 7 is “Sore muscles and joints.

Hypothyroidism can cause musculoskeletal symptoms ranging from general muscle and joint aches to true muscle disease or arthritis.

That’s because thyroid hormones play a vital role in the reproduction and growth of bone and cartilage.

Now, the most reported cases of joint pain and symptoms in patients with an underactive thyroid involve the knees and hands.

And there seems to be a connection between rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid disorders.

According to researchers, people with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to develop an underactive thyroid, including hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

And that link appears to go both ways, meaning that people with thyroid disease have a higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.

Unfortunately, muscles and joints aren’t the only areas of the body that can be affected, which brings us to Number 6. Slow heart rate.

Hypothyroidism can affect the heart and circulatory system in several ways. Insufficient levels of thyroid hormones can slow your heart rate, make arteries less elastic, and can cause blood pressure to increase.

In some individuals with hypothyroidism, the heart rate can be 10 to 20 beats per minute (bpm) slower than what is considered medically normal.

This condition, also known as bradycardia, can cause weakness, dizziness, breathing problems, and may also result in serious complications, such as heart failure.

Speaking of which, if you’re concerned about heart health, you’ll want to pay close attention to what’s coming next. Number 5 is High cholesterol.

Not many people know this, but thyroid hormones have a direct impact on cholesterol levels.

In fact, thyroid hormones play a vital role in breaking down and removing excess LDL cholesterol from the body via the liver. Without adequate thyroid hormones, the liver struggles to carry out this function and LDL cholesterol levels increase.

Having high cholesterol levels puts you at greater risk of heart disease. That’s because excess LDL cholesterol that isn’t removed can become oxidized and turn into plaque, which can cause your arteries to narrow and harden.

Research suggests that up to 13 percent of individuals with high cholesterol have an underactive thyroid.

Even people with mildly low thyroid levels, called subclinical hypothyroidism, can have higher than normal LDL cholesterol.

The good news is that treating the thyroid problem may help reduce cholesterol levels, even in those who do not take cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Another major organ that can show signs of hypothyroidism is your brain, which brings us to Number 4. Mood and memory changes.

Thyroid hormones are crucial for brain development and influence brain function throughout life.

Individuals with an underactive thyroid can experience anxiety, depression, mood swings, impaired memory function, brain fog, and other cognitive related issues.

These symptoms can occur because the brain requires thyroid hormones to function correctly.

Research shows that low levels of thyroid hormones can cause changes in brain structure and functioning.

Fortunately, these brain changes are reversible once a person receives proper treatment.

Next up, a symptom that makes you want to carry a heating pad everywhere you go. Number 3 is Feeling cold.

Nobody enjoys feeling cold all the time, but that’s exactly what a person with hypothyroidism can experience, even if the weather is warm.

That’s because low thyroid hormones can slow down metabolism, which can lead to a drop in core body temperature.

Individuals with hypothyroidism may feel cold all the time or have a low tolerance against it. They’re also more likely to have icy hands or feet.

Coming up next is a frustrating bathroom symptom. Number 2 is Constipation.

Did you know, there is a movie about constipation? It just hasn’t come out yet.

All jokes aside, digestion is another body function that can slow down because of hypothyroidism.

Studies report that an underactive thyroid can cause problems with bowel movement.

These digestive changes cause some people to experience constipation.

According to doctors, constipation is medically defined as having fewer than three bowel movements a week.

A person may also experience hard stools, difficulty passing stool, or not being able to empty the rectum fully.

Another unexpected symptom of thyroid problems is Number 1. Menstrual changes.

Women with hypothyroidism may experience heavy or irregular menstrual periods or spotting between periods.

According to the Society of Menstrual Cycle Research, having low levels of thyroid hormones can cause these problems because it affects other key hormones that play a role in the menstrual cycle.

Hypothyroidism can also cause periods to stop for several months or longer, a condition called amenorrhea.

There you have it! The top 12 symptoms of hypothyroidism.

If you have more than one of these symptoms, do consult your physician for further evaluation. 

Next, what are the causes of hypothyroidism?

Conditions that can cause hypothyroidism include:

-Thyroiditis, an inflammation of the thyroid gland.

-Iodine deficiency, the most common cause of all thyroid disorders worldwide.

-Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an inherited autoimmune condition

-Postpartum thyroiditis, a temporary condition that occurs in 5-9% of women after childbirth.

Next, how is hypothyroidism diagnosed?

A blood test is the best way to diagnose hypothyroidism. This condition is usually associated with an elevated TSH level.

TSH stands for thyroid stimulating hormone. TSH is released by your pituitary gland to regulate the production of T4 and T3 by your thyroid.

Your doctor may also test for T4 and T3 directly or perform an ultrasound. If you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, a common treatment is to take levothyroxine tablets every day.

Environmental, diet and lifestyle factors contribute to a malfunctioning thyroid. While some factors are seemingly out of our control, many are not.

In the next video, we’ll look at natural ways to prevent thyroid trouble and restore hormone levels.

Now, since inflammation is an underlying cause of low thyroid hormones, eating an anti-inflammatory diet can support your thyroid health.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/plants-that-repel-mosquitoes-naturally/,The surprising plants that keep mosquitoes away all summer long,"Mosquitoes are the bane of summertime – they make great food for bats and birds, but for people they’re a nuisance, and their bite is definitely worse than their bark, especially for those who have allergic reactions to them. (updated July 12, 2024)

While many people resort to using toxic chemicals to repel these bothersome insects, there are natural ways to keep them from chowing down on your blood. Like many other biting insects, mosquitoes are attracted to certain odors in human skin, such as sweat.

The following plants can mask your natural odor and help repel mosquitoes, and smell fairly pleasant to boot.

1. Lemon Balm

Lemon balm is a member of the mint family. Recognizable by its white flowers and gentle, citrusy scent, it has some natural healing properties(1) in addition to being great at keeping insects at bay. However, lemon balm is an invasive species, so be careful when introducing it into your garden.

2. Catnip

Another member of the mint family, this herb is known for having drug-like effects on cats. But it can also be used as a natural insect repellant.

3. Basil

This delicious herb is often used in pasta, but according to one 2009 study, it is toxic to mosquito larvae(2).

4. Lavender

Lavender is an attractive plant with a distinctly pleasant scent, that is often used in aromatherapy for it’s relaxing properties(3). Its essential oil, when rubbed into the skin, is a particularly effective mosquito repellant.

5. Peppermint

Concentrated peppermint oil is often used as an insect repellant, and with good reason. Peppermint essential oil has been shown to effectively keep mosquitoes at bay, and also kill mosquito larvae(4).

6. Citrosum

Citrosum is a perennial, often sold as a “mosquito plant” due to it’s strong smell, which resembles the scent of citronella. While it can be effective when rubbed into your skin, some research suggests that it’s less effective than other plants – however, if nothing else is available, it will do in a pinch.

7. Sage and 8.Rosemary

When burned, these herbs give off a scent that is not only pleasant for humans, but is unpleasant enough for mosquitoes to drive them away, as long as you’re near the smoke. If you’re planning a summer bonfire, be sure to bring along some of these herbs to toss into the flames.

There are other non-toxic alternatives to commercial bug sprays – lots of companies make organic bug repellants, and electric bug zappers can be fun to use as well.

Finally, when all else fails and you end up scratching at mosquito bites, calamine lotion can be a real life saver – and don’t scratch too hard; rupturing mosquito bites can lead to scarring and infection.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamins-for-neuropathy-in-feet/,Top 9 vitamins for neuropathy in feet (STOP diabetes complications),"Today, we’ll look at the 9 nutrients that help normalize blood sugar levels, repair damaged nerves, and prevent complications from diabetes. If you are someone living with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and neuropathic pain, this article is for you.

Our recommended solution for neuropathy pain

You already know that high blood sugar is destructive and can damage almost every tissue in the body. Nerves, blood vessels, eyes, heart, liver and skin, you name it, it can probably be adversely affected by elevated blood sugar!

Research shows that 50% or more people with diabetes have peripheral neuropathy, or damage to the nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. When the peripheral nerves are damaged by uncontrolled high blood sugar, their ability to send signals is disrupted. This is called diabetic neuropathy.

Nerve damage often affects the feet and legs first, before it spreads to the hands and arms. The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in the feet include tingling, numbness, muscle twitches and cramps, and sharp, stabbing, or burning pain. The feet become ultra-sensitive to pressure, touch, and temperature.

Some people report feeling like they’re wearing socks or shoes when their feet are bare. This is dangerous, because if you have numb feet, it’s easy to hurt your feet by stepping on something sharp or hot. You may also develop a blister caused by badly-fitting shoes and not be aware.

And if you do not feel any pain, you may continue walking without protecting against your wound or blister, and it develops into an ulcer.

Now, high blood sugar also damages the walls of blood vessels, and reduces blood flow to your feet. This means that the skin and nerves on your feet receive less oxygen and nutrients, and a lower number of infection-fighting cells. As a result, wounds take longer to heal and can lead to gangrene.

With that said, let’s get into the three steps to reverse diabetic neuropathy.

One, controlling blood sugar levels. Two, prevent or relieve neuropathy symptoms. And Three, correct common nutrient deficiencies found in people with prediabetes and diabetes. Let’s start with a mineral that controls blood sugar.

Number 9. Chromium Picolinate.

This little-known, yet clinically effective form of chromium reduces insulin resistance, the number ONE root cause of prediabetes, diabetes and neuropathy. Chromium picolinate is the fastest and easiest form of chromium your body can absorb.

A study of 833 people with Type 2 diabetes found that taking a daily dose of 500 mcg of chromium picolinate led to significant reductions in blood glucose levels after only one month, and the effects lasted for at least one year. The participants also experienced significant long term reduction in diabetic symptoms such as fatigue, frequency of urination and excessive thirst.

This powerful mineral may also decrease cravings for sugar-rich food. You won’t be stressing over sugar cravings anymore, and will probably lose weight and even regain your energy, which is a bonus.

Next we have Number 8, Cinnamon.

This well-known spice helps improve fasting blood glucose and A1C. However, you’ll want to get REAL cinnamon which comes from Sri Lanka. That’s because TRUE cinnamon barely contains any coumarin, unlike other types of “fake” cinnamon. Coumarin is toxic when consumed in large amounts, and can cause liver damage.

Next on our list is Number 7, Vitamin D3.

This is the kind of vitamin D your body makes naturally from the sun. Vitamin D3 helps improve insulin sensitivity. This hormone is essential for regulating the removal of sugar out of the blood, thus lowering A1C.

Did you know that fixing a vitamin D deficiency can deliver relief from your nerve pain and numbness?

In one study, 60 people with diabetic neuropathy, who were deficient in vitamin D, were given oral supplements of vitamin D3 (50,000 IU) once weekly for 12 weeks. Not only did their serum level of vitamin D increase, but there was a significant decrease in the stabbing, burning, and tingling in their hands and feet.

Also, new research shows that vitamin D3 may help your body grow new nerve endings. Your nerve endings help detect feelings like pain, cold, and heat.

Coming up next is Number 6, Alpha-lipoic acid.

For this video, I will refer to it as ALA. ALA is an antioxidant that helps protect the body from inflammation and improves nerve conduction velocity. It has been used for decades in Europe to counter nerve damage in people with Type 1 and 2 diabetes.

Because of its effect on glucose metabolism, ALA may improve the glucose-lowering action of insulin.

In a clinical trial, researchers gave 328 people with tingling, burning, and stinging in their feet and hands, either ALA or a placebo. The results were truly remarkable. The group taking ALA reduced their nerve pain by up to 52% within three weeks. And those who received 600 mg of ALA daily were found to have the greatest reduction in pain.

Now, you would have to eat about 12 bowls of spinach or 8 tomatoes, to get that amount of ALA into your day! R-Lipoic acid, a potent form of lipoic acid with 50% greater biological activity, provides significantly more benefits.

Next up, we have Number 5. Vitamin B12.

Vitamin B12 repairs your protective myelin coating. This helps your nerves communicate correctly with your brain again. As a result, you can finally get relief from neuropathy symptoms.

The myelin sheath is an insulating layer that covers the body of nerves or axons. It enables electrical impulses to travel quickly and smoothly between the nerve cells.

There are two types of vitamin B12: cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin. The first one, cyanocobalamin, is hard to digest. That means you don’t get the full benefit from it.

That’s why we recommend methylcobalamin. It’s easy for your body to digest and use, so it can repair your damaged nerves right away.

Clinical research from the medical journal, PLOS ONE, shows that B12 deficiencies are more common in diabetics. This is likely because of the use of blood glucose control medications like metformin.

Vitamin B12 is found in animal foods and healthy vegan diets are fortified with the vitamin.

Coming up is Number 4, Vitamin B6.

Research shows that vitamin B6 or pyridoxine can improve nerve density in your feet. This is important because the more nerves you have in your feet, the easier it is for them to send clear and correct messages to your brain. This can help stop tingling, numbness, and stinging.

To get vitamin B6, add lean meats, bell peppers, yams, broccoli, sunflower seeds and hazelnuts to your diet.

Next up, our Number 3 is Benfotiamine.

Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 in its highest bioavailable form. This vitamin has been shown to significantly decrease symptoms of burning, tingling, prickling or loss of sensation in feet and hands.

Its use may also reduce serious complications like deafness, loss of vision, high blood pressure and stroke. Benfotiamine may also help repair and regenerate diabetes-induced damaged cells throughout the body.

These include nerve cells in the extremities, and small capillaries in the eyes and kidneys, thus restoring some function to these organs. Benfotiamine works by purging excess levels of potentially damaging glucose metabolites from within the blood vessel cells. In this way, it helps to balance cellular glucose metabolism.

The natural version of benfotiamine, thiamine, can be found in foods like whole grains, meat, legumes, and nuts. People with diabetes have been found to have low levels of this vitamin.

And now we have Number 2, Acetyl-L-Carnitine.

For this article, I will refer to it as ALCAR. ALCAR is an amino acid used to break down carbs and fat more efficiently for mental and physical energy to power through your day. It can also help you lose weight.

Studies have shown that supplementing with ALCAR at 1,000 mg per day, helps relieve pain and improve nerve fiber regeneration and vibration perception in patients with diabetic neuropathy.

Animal-based foods are excellent sources of carnitine, including beef, chicken, milk and cheese.

And at Number 1, we have Choline.

Choline is a nutrient found in egg yolks, beef liver, legumes, nuts, beef, and leafy greens. It is an essential component of our cell membranes.

Choline is a building block for the nerve cells and helps our bodies create the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It protects the myelin sheath and improves nerve function when combined with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12.

Now, choline has been well studied to improve mental health and cognitive function in aging.

This is important, because according to new research from the World Journal of Diabetes, people with diabetes run a high risk of developing dementia and cognitive impairment.

There you have it! The 9 vitamins that reverse diabetes and repair damaged nerves.

This group of nutrients can also prevent and stop other diabetes complications, such as eye problems (retinopathy), kidney problems (nephropathy), gum disease, heart attack and stroke, and sexual problems in men and women.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-heart-disease/,Top 3 Signs of Heart Disease Your Eyes REVEAL (& 5 health problems),"The eyes are often called “the windows to the soul,” but more often they can be a window to your health. Changes to your eyes, such as blurry vision, eye floaters, and bloodshot eyes, can tip you off to a problem with your health.

In today’s video, we’ll look at the top THREE symptoms of heart disease your eyes reveal, as well as FIVE other health conditions.

Did you know that the eye is the only place in the body where a doctor can see the live action of blood vessels, nerves and connecting tissue, without relying on an invasive procedure?

It turns out the arrangement of blood vessels at the back of the eyes is closely connected to the health of your heart.

When decreased blood flow caused by heart disease, known as Ischemia, leads to inadequate blood flow to the eyes, and causes cells in the retina to die, it leaves behind permanent marks.

These marks are the reason eye doctors are often the first to spot health problems, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke and more.

So, it’s no exaggeration to say that a comprehensive eye exam can save not just your eyesight, but also your life.

Now, let’s get on with our Number 8. High Blood Pressure.

An eye doctor or ophthalmologist can look at the blood vessels in your eyes using an imaging tool and detect signs of high blood pressure.

High blood pressure can cause retinopathy or damage to the eye’s primary blood supply.

And this can lead to blurred vision, bleeding in the eyes, blood clots, swelling, damage to the nerves or even a stroke in the retina, resulting in complete loss of vision.

To detect high blood pressure, the ophthalmologist will see if there are changes in the ratio or shape of retinal vessels or if there are small blood clots in the eyes.

In healthy individuals, the ratio between the size of retinal arteries to veins is supposed to be approximately two to three.

So, if the artery is a lot smaller than the vein, or the vein is a lot bigger and dilated, that may show high blood pressure or cardiovascular risk factors.

Next we have Number 7. Blocked Arteries.

Hypertension isn’t the only heart-related condition that can be detected in the eye.

During an eye exam, an ophthalmologist can see if there is any embolus in the eye.

An embolus is a blood clot or a piece of plaque that acts like a clot.

When the clot travels from the site where it formed to another location in the body, it is called an embolism.

An arterial embolism occurs when an embolus has traveled through the arteries and become stuck in small vessels or organs like the brain or the retina.

An arterial embolism may be caused by one or more clots.

When arterial blockages occur in the brain, it’s called a stroke.

When it happens near the heart, it’s called a heart attack.

And when it happens in the eyes, it’s known as retinal arterial occlusion.

This condition can lead to the death of nerve cells in the eye, which can cause or worsen vision loss.

Some individuals may regain their vision one year after experiencing an eye stroke, but their vision may never fully recover.

People who are older or have high blood pressure, glaucoma, or diabetes are at higher risk of developing this eye condition.

Next on our list, Number 6 is High Cholesterol.

Cholesterol plays an important role in human tissue, but too much of the wrong type can turn into plaque buildup and narrow arterial walls.

The “wrong type” refers to high levels of oxidized LDL cholesterol, and not normal LDL cholesterol.

Oxidized cholesterol is what causes the damage to artery walls and increases the risk of a heart attack and stroke.

LDL cholesterol by itself is not bad. It is required to transport fat and cholesterol to the locations throughout our bodies where they are needed.

And guess where oxidized cholesterol comes from?

That’s right, if you’ve watched our video on inflammation, you already know that prolonged consumption of oxidized vegetable seed oils and high-fructose-corn-syrup is a major dietary cause.

Now, back to our eyes. Through an OCT scan, your eye doctor can detect signs of high cholesterol by looking at your eyelids, cornea, and retina.

There’s an eye symptom called Xanthelasma, and it’s commonly linked to high cholesterol.

Xanthelasma occurs as yellow fatty deposits of cholesterol that show up on the eyelids or on the skin around the eyelids or near the nose.

This condition is more common in individuals who are overweight, have diabetes or have high blood pressure.

Another condition called arcus senilis can also point to high cholesterol.

Normally, the cornea is a clear tissue on the front of the eye, but when cholesterol deposits develop, it causes a white or gray ring to develop along the outer edge.

It’s important to note that not every person with arcus senilis has high cholesterol. However, if high cholesterol runs in your family, you’re more likely to develop this eye condition.

Now that we’ve covered the top 3 cardiovascular symptoms, let’s look at what else your eyes may reveal about your health.

Next on our list is Number 5. Diabetes.

The tiny blood vessels that supply your retina can be a telltale sign of diabetes.

What happens is, when these blood vessels are damaged from high blood sugar levels, they can leak blood into the retina and distort vision.

Your ophthalmologist can see this during a dilated eye exam.

This condition is known as diabetic retinopathy. Early symptoms of diabetic retinopathy include blurred vision, floaters, loss of central vision, and dark spots in the field of vision.

You may have experienced floaters before. These are small, dust-like specks that seem to move when your eyes move.

They are actually tiny clumps of gel or cells inside the vitreous, the clear jelly-like fluid that fills the inside of your eye.

These things appear to be in front of your eyes, but they are, in fact, floating within it.

Now, if you see floaters in your field of vision, it’s usually a normal part of aging, unless you have diabetes.

What happens during diabetic retinopathy is that the retina grows new blood vessels through a process called “neovascularization,” and these often bleed into the vitreous.

If they only bleed a little, you may see a few dark floaters. If they bleed a lot, it may block all vision.

In the worst case, this could lead to the eye developing scar tissue and a detached retina, which can cause blindness.

If diabetic retinopathy is a suspected cause for your floaters, you should also look out for other signs of diabetes.

These include excessive thirst or hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, recurring infections, unexplained weight loss, numbness in the hands or feet, and certain skin symptoms, including darkened patches of skin.

Fortunately, diabetic retinopathy can be reversed naturally. To see our recommended solution to reverse diabetes and complications like neuropathy and retinopathy, click the link below.

Next, we have Number 4. Brain tumors.

When a brain tumor forms and causes swelling and increased pressure in the brain, its impact can be seen in the back of the eye.

There may also be pressure on the optic nerve your eye doctor can detect.

In addition, some individuals may notice double vision, loss of peripheral vision, or a change to their pupil size, sometimes on just one side.

Coming up, Number 3 is Lupus.

Lupus is an autoimmune disease, which means your body’s immune system attacks your own tissues and organs.

Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many body systems — including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, lungs and your eyes.

Lupus can cause changes in the skin around the eyelids, dry eyes, inflammation of the white outer layer of the eyeball, blood vessel changes in the retina, and damage to nerves controlling eye movement, thus affecting vision.

On to Number 2. Thyroid disease.

If the eyeballs are bulging or protruding from eyelids that seem to retract, an eye specialist may suspect an overactive thyroid gland or hyperthyroidism, which is often caused by Grave’s Disease.

This condition affects the tissues and muscles around the eye and symptoms may also include blurry vision, vision loss or dry eyes.

And at Number 1, we have Rheumatoid Arthritis.

A routine eye exam can also reveal systemic inflammatory diseases that cause arthritis and inflammation in other parts of the body.

Patients who experience dry eyes, red eyes and severe pain may exhibit signs of rheumatoid arthritis.

Pain and redness may be symptoms of scleritis, a painful inflammatory condition of the sclera, the white part of your eye.

The inflammation can sometimes make the white part of the eye look purple.

Pain from scleritis is usually the worst at night and can even spread to your face and jaw.

There you have it! The top 3 symptoms of heart disease your eyes reveal and 5 other health conditions.

Other signs of health risks your eyes can show, include glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts, cognitive decline, liver and lung disease, as well as multiple sclerosis.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/fructose-damage-liver/,"Fructose Is Your Liver’s Enemy, Not Fat","There is growing scientific consensus that one of the most common types of sugar, fructose, can be toxic to the liver, just like alcohol. Fructose is the sugar that makes fruit taste sweet. For most people, there’s nothing wrong with eating fructose in its natural state, in fruit. (updated July 18 2022)

But today, manufacturers extract and concentrate the fructose from corn, beets and sugarcane, removing the fiber and nutrients (minerals, vitamins, enzymes, antioxidants) in the process. Getting frequent, high doses of fructose throughout the day, without fiber to slow it down, is more than our bodies were designed to handle.

Nearly all added sugars contain significant amounts of fructose. Typical formulations of high-fructose corn syrup contain upwards of 50% fructose, depending on processing methods. Table sugar and even sweeteners that sound healthy, like organic cane sugar, are 50% fructose.

What’s unique about fructose is that, unlike any other sugar, it’s processed in the liver. Small amounts of fructose, meted out slowly, are not a problem for your liver. Think of eating an apple – its sweetness comes with a lot of chewing that takes time. The apple’s fiber slows down its processing in the gut.

But when we consume large amounts of fructose, particularly in liquid form on an empty stomach, it slams the liver with more than it can handle.

As with alcohol, a little added fructose, consumed with fiber-rich foods, is OK. It’s only when we frequently consume large quantities, in concentrated form, that fructose becomes a health hazard.

Liver damage is a looming health issue

For a long time, doctors mainly worried about life-threatening liver disease in alcoholics. But since 1980, there has been growing concern about two new conditions linked to fructose consumption, as well as to obesity and other unhealthy dietary additives, such as trans-fats:

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): This is characterized by excess fat build-up in the liver.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): This is characterized by fatty liver, inflammation and “steatosis,” which is essentially scarring as the liver tries to heal its injuries. That scarring gradually cuts off vital blood flow to the liver.

About one-quarter of NASH patients will progress on to non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis, which requires a liver transplant or else it can lead to death.

Since 1980, the incidence of NAFLD and NASH has doubled, along with the rise of fructose consumption.

Approximately 6 million individuals in the United States are estimated to have progressed to NASH and some 600,000 to NASH-related cirrhosis. Eating a lot of trans-fats, being overweight and not exercising also can contribute to NASH. Most people with NASH also have Type II diabetes.

What is alarming is that NASH is now the third-leading reason for liver transplantation in America. And it will become the most common if recent trends continue. Rates of NASH have doubled in America during the past 20 years alongside a dramatic increase in sugar consumption.

Estimates vary, but conservatively, 31% of American adults and 13% of kids suffer from NAFLD.

How do you know if you have a liver problem?

You should be concerned if you or your kids have a “sugar belly” or belly fat. If your waist is larger than your hips, you should ask your doctor for a blood test that checks for triglyceride levels.

A sugar belly occurs when the liver detects more fructose than can be used by the body for energy. That excess fructose is broken down by the liver and transformed into fat globules (triglycerides), some of which are exported into the bloodstream and selectively deposited around your midsection and internal organs. Just as people who drink too much get a “beer belly,” those who eat or drink too much fructose can get a “sugar belly.”

Fat cells that accumulate around your midsection send out disruptive hormonal messages that upset your body’s normal chemical balance. Scientists are actively studying how these hormonal imbalances become implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/why-smoking-every-day-harmful-lungs/,Nurse Explains Why Smoking Everyday Is Harmful for Your Lungs,"In 2017, an estimated 34.3 million Americans smoked cigarettes regularly. While the number of cigarette smokers have been decreasing over the years, this unhealthy habit still accounts for approximately 480,000 deaths per year. (1) (updated July 15 2022)

The terrible health effects that smoking has on your lungs is just the tip of the iceberg compared to the long-term health complications that can arise from it. If you smoke or anyone close to you does, then keep on reading to find out how smoking impacts your well-being.

What Smoking Does To Your Lungs

Many people are unaware of the side effects of smoking. Yes, your lungs suffer the most, but health problems can spread beyond this organ. Smoking can affect blood circulation, the heart, bones, mouth, throat, skin, reproductive system, stomach, and brain. (2)

Following are the risks that smoking poses on your respiratory health and lungs:

Smoking weakens your immune system and makes you an easy target for colds and coughs. As your condition deteriorates, it can lead to more severe problems like pneumonia, emphysema, and lung cancer. Smoking is responsible for 84% of deaths from lung cancer and 83% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Smoking makes it harder to breathe by destroying your lung tissue and narrowing your airways. If you have COPD, then you will constantly find yourself out of breath when moving. Living with COPD means having to deal with persistent coughs with phlegm and frequent chest infections.
Smoking causes more than 93% of oropharyngeal cancers (throat cancer).
Smoking Causes Inflammation

Smoking a cigarette a day can lead to inflammation in your lungs. Regular smoking restricts your air passages and makes it extremely difficult for you to breath. Any damage to the tiny air sacs in your lungs called alveoli lowers your ability to absorb oxygen, and since these air sacs don’t re-grow, the damage can become permanent.

Have you ever wondered why people who smoke are often fighting off an infection or cold? It happens because smoking paralyzes and kills the small hair in your airways called cilia. These hairs exist to clean out the dirt and mucus so that your lungs stay healthy and debris-free. When these hairs are not present, your risk of getting an infection increases because there’s nothing to filter out incoming contaminants.

Even if you somehow don’t develop any lung complications or lung cancer, smoking puts you at a higher risk of mortality than non-smokers. A study published in the BMJ Journals showed that male and female participants who had a habit of smoking at least 1 or 4 cigarettes a day were more likely to die from ischemic heart disease. The study also found that women were at greater risk of dying from lung cancer. (3)

What Happens When You Smoke for 20 years, Every Day

A nurse from North Carolina by the name of Amanda Eller uploaded the following videos on Facebook. The videos illustrate how a non-smokers’ and smokers’ lungs look like after 20 years. The first video shows her blowing air into the lungs of a smoker and the second video shows her blowing air into the lungs of a non-smoker.

You can easily tell which lungs were exposed to cigarettes based on the color.

https://www.facebook.com/amanda.orr.56/posts/10212156331769060

Even when she pumps air into the lungs of the smoker, they hardly expand, whereas the other pair of lungs expand normally.

Despite the hundreds of studies done on how harmful smoking can be to our health, many still smoke because of stress, peer pressure, or out of habit. Remember, for every cigarette you smoke, you are inhaling more than 5,000 different chemicals, including tar and nicotine.

If you need to unwind, you can try coloring books, yoga, meditation, exercise and so on. As you can see, there are plenty of ways to go about it. Only you can bring positive changes to your lifestyle, and it’s alright to start small, as long as you end up kicking this addiction.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/silent-heart-attack-symptoms/,Top 10 SILENT heart attack symptoms you’re likely to MISS,"Did you know a person can have a heart attack and not even know it? In 2016, the American Heart Association’s journal, Circulation, reported that 45% of all heart attacks are what doctors call “silent”.

Meaning they don’t cause the classic symptoms, such as pressure or pain in the chest or left arm.

Just like a heart attack that causes sharp chest pain, a silent heart attack can occur when the arteries that carry blood to the heart become blocked. This deprives the heart muscle of nutrient-rich oxygen and can cause severe damage.

In today’s video, we look at the top 10 symptoms of a silent heart attack or silent myocardial infarction (SMI), that signal something isn’t right.

Most times, the person having the heart attack doesn’t realize what’s actually going on. This can then delay seeking medical treatment, and in the worst-case scenario, those precious moments can lead to a tragic outcome.

Continue watching to find out which subtle signs are clues that someone you love might be suffering from a heart attack.

Number 10. Stomach pain and indigestion.

Most commonly reported in women, nausea, indigestion, and abdominal pain are plausible warning signs indicating a heart attack. This is especially true if these gastrointestinal symptoms are accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.

In one study published in the journal Circulation, researchers interviewed 2,009 women who were hospitalized for a heart attack, and discovered that nearly 61.5 percent of them experienced nausea or stomach pain as a symptom of their event.

If you just had a spicy meal or a junk food feast, your upset stomach and heartburn are probably perfectly normal. However, when pain in your chest persists, and you aren’t sure it’s heartburn, it’s time to have your doctor run tests. Even experienced medical professionals can’t always tell a heart attack from heartburn.

Number 9. Lightheadedness or dizziness.

Not drinking enough water, skipping lunch, or standing up too fast are all things that can make you dizzy. But feeling dizzy or lightheaded, accompanied by chest pain and shortness of breath, may signify that a heart attack could be on its way.

When the heart struggles and cannot deliver oxygen, this adversely affects the brain. According to the American Heart Association, dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting are all heart attack signs that are more likely to occur in women than men.

Number 8. Shortness of breath.

If you feel like you just ran a marathon after going up a flight of stairs, that may be a sign your heart is having difficulty pumping blood to the rest of your body. Shortness of breath, for no apparent reason, can occur with or without chest pain, and is another overlooked sign of a silent heart attack. According to The Heart Foundation, this symptom occurs more often in men than women.

Number 7. Nausea and vomiting.

Researchers have provided several theories on the cause of vomiting associated with heart attacks. According to researchers, this happens when heart cells become damaged from poor blood supply.

As a result, these damaged areas then release lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and other metabolites. The buildup of these metabolites increases acidity in the blood, which can lead to vomiting.

Number 6. Pain in the throat and jaw.

You may have heard that chest pain that radiates down your arm is a heart attack symptom. What you might not know is that the pressure, tightness, pain, or squeezing or aching sensation in your chest and arms, can also spread into your neck, jaw, down your mid and lower back, and even your legs.

Pain in your jaw and throat can feel like a bad toothache. These body parts are often in the line of fire during a heart attack, because the vagus nerve is connected to not only the heart but also the abdomen, chest, neck, and brain.

So, when a blocked artery occurs, it can trigger the nerves in your heart to signal pain in order to warn you that something is wrong. And the vagus nerve spreads the signal to other areas of the body.

Number 5. Extreme fatigue or weakness.

Feeling worn out after a sleepless night or a stressful day is normal. But if you’re sitting in bed, watching TV, and suddenly are no longer able to even hold your head up, this could mean trouble.

This is not an unusual situation. In one study, researchers found that over 45 percent of women who had a heart attack said they felt weak or tired right before they went to the hospital.

In 2003, the American Heart Association surveyed over 500 women who survived heart attacks and published the results in the journal Circulation. Seventy-one percent of women reported feeling tired for no logical reason in the weeks before their heart attack.

In the same survey, 48 percent of women said they experienced sleep disturbance up to a month before the event. Only 31 percent of women experienced chest pain at the onset of their heart attack. And 43 percent reported no chest pain at all during their heart attack.

Number 4. Irregular heartbeat.

Abnormal heartbeats, also known as arrhythmia, are a common heart disease symptom in both men and women, although it has other causes as well. You may notice that your heart is beating faster or irregularly, and in most cases, you will also experience dizziness. When your heart’s rhythm is disrupted, it isn’t pumping oxygenated blood properly, and this can lead to a heart attack.

If you have coronary artery disease, you may be at risk for a dangerous arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. This is a rapid, quivering heartbeat that can lead to heart palpitations, blood clots, heart attack and stroke. Seek medical attention right away, if an irregular heartbeat is associated with other symptoms.

Number 3. Unexplained sweating.

Sweating excessively can happen minutes before a heart attack. And unlike regular sweat that happens after a workout or in warm weather, this symptom is often described as cold sweats. This condition is called diaphoresis and affects your entire body rather than a part of your body.

A 2005 study from the University of Illinois at Chicago found that perspiration, in combination with feeling discomfort in your chest, arm, neck, or jaw, could be a reliable predictor of a heart attack.

Number 2. A general feeling of unease.

You may not be feeling quite right, but cannot put your finger on exactly why. A general state of discomfort, and an overall feeling of unease, could indicate a silent heart attack is on the way. It’s a good idea to get your heart checked out, even if you don’t think you’re exhibiting common signs of a heart attack.

Number 1. Pain in the chest.

Some people do not experience any chest pain, while in others, the symptoms may not always be sudden or severe. Chest pain or discomfort can last for several seconds or minutes and is just as common in men as it is in women. In those with serious chest pain, some feel intense pressure or a sense of fullness. Others feel tingling or sharp stabbing pain.

There you have it! The top 10 subtle signs of a heart attack that are easy to miss. Being aware of these symptoms could save your life—or someone else’s.

One thing you can do to prepare is to have medically prescribed aspirin or nitroglycerin in your home. Although a heart attack is life-threatening, these medications can help stabilize the condition while waiting for help to arrive.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamins-for-high-blood-pressure/,Top 13 Vitamins for High Blood Pressure – Reduce Naturally!,"If you have high blood pressure, the last thing you would want to hear, is that the meds you’re taking could make things worse. L-type calcium channel blockers (LCCBs) — the most widely used drugs for treating hypertension — may harm the heart as much as help it, according to a new study.

So, why not consider natural alternatives backed by science?

Recommended High Blood Pressure Supplement

In today’s video, we cover 13 vitamins that help reduce high blood pressure. We use the word “vitamins” broadly to include nutrients such as antioxidants, as well as herbs. Some of these are available as supplements, while others are present in certain vegetables or fruits.

Let’s begin with an essential substance that humans cannot produce and must get from the foods we eat.

Number 13. Vitamin C.

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is the primary water-soluble antioxidant in plasma and tissues, that neutralizes dangerous reactive oxygen species (ROS).

This antioxidant protects the body’s level of nitric oxide, which is a natural compound that relaxes blood vessels and contributes to healthy blood flow.

In a review of 8 studies in individuals with hypertension, taking 300–1,000 mg per day of vitamin C significantly reduced their blood pressure levels.

This means that vitamin C can prevent the onset of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, conditions that can progress to coronary heart disease.

Another reason vitamin C is important is because it’s used to make healthy collagen. This is the glue that holds our heart cells together, so that your veins can deliver oxygen-rich blood to the heart.

In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study published by the medical journal Lancet, researchers found that a 500 mg daily supplement of vitamin C can significantly reduce high blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

Next, your body produces this important hormone from 10 to 30 minutes of midday sunlight.

Number 12. Vitamin D.

Did you know that if you are deficient in vitamin D, you are more likely to have higher blood pressure?

A review of data in over 300,00 people found that those with the highest levels of vitamin D had almost 30% fewer chances of developing high blood pressure when compared with those that were deficient in this vitamin.

When supplementing, choosing vitamin D3, as this is the same bioavailable form produced from sunlight.

Next, this amazing berry is a recommended food to help treat high blood pressure in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Number 11. Hawthorn.

Hawthorn berries contain antioxidant flavonoids which help dilate blood vessels, improve blood flow, and protect your cardiac muscle cells against damage-causing reactive oxygen species (ROS).

In both animal and human studies, hawthorn has been found to help lower blood pressure and support healthy cholesterol levels.

Next, this vitamin helps relieve emotional stress and anxiety so your body can relax.

Number 10. Vitamin B.

Among the eight B vitamins, some have been found to help reduce blood pressure levels and prevent stroke.

Niacin or B6 is the primary B vitamin that can help to lower blood pressure. Niacin is a powerful vasodilator, which means it opens up blood vessels so that blood can flow without resistance, and thus lowers blood pressure.

Other studies have shown that vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and vitamin B9 (folate) supplements can also lower hypertension.

Next, a natural anti-inflammatory that reduces blood viscosity and prevents fatal blood clots.

Number 9. Omega-3s.

It has been found that consuming enough omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce blood lipid levels, inflammation, and high blood pressure.

In fact, a review of 71 clinical trials showed that roughly 3 grams of omega-3s each day may be the optimal amount to help lower blood pressure.

To see the supplements we recommend, for the vitamins mentioned in this video, check out the description below after you finish watching.

Coming up next is a flower that’s common in many backyards…

Number 8. Hibiscus.

A well-known benefit of the hibiscus flower is that it may lower blood pressure when consumed as a tea or extract. This is because it flushes salt and fluid from your body, which relaxes your blood vessels.

In a study by the University of Western Australia, researchers found that hibiscus extract helped lower blood pressure in 390 participants.

In another study, 65 people with high blood pressure were given hibiscus tea or a placebo. At the end of the six week trial, those who drank hibiscus tea experienced a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure, compared to the placebo group.

Stay tuned for a popular spice that is the reason for low levels of heart disease in Spain.

Number 7. Saffron.

Saffron is rich in antioxidants that reduce oxidative damage and inflammation in the arteries.

In one study of 230 men, researchers found that saffron supplementation for 26 weeks significantly reduced blood pressure.

Similarly, in another study, participants that were given 400 mg of saffron as tablets reduced blood pressure after one week.

Next is an herb that’s often referred to as king of medicines in Tibetan culture…

Number 6. Arjuna Bark.

Several studies have found that Arjuna bark may help reduce high blood pressure.

This is because of its high content of coenzyme Q10, which is a catalyst that can lower high blood pressure and improve heart function. CoQ10 also sustains nitric oxide levels and dilates blood vessels in patients with hypertension.

Coming up, nearly two-thirds of the population in the western world is not getting enough of this mineral.

Number 5. Magnesium.

This mineral plays a vital role in many bodily functions, including blood pressure regulation.

Studies show that magnesium supplements can help reduce blood pressure by increasing the amount of nitric oxide in the body.

A review of 11 randomized studies found that consuming between 365-450 mg of magnesium per day over an average of three months significantly lowered blood pressure in people with chronic medical conditions.

Another review of 10 studies with over 200,000 participants found that a 5% reduction in high blood pressure risk could be seen for every 100 mg of dietary magnesium consumed daily.

When supplementing, consider magnesium glycinate or magnesium malate as they are easier on the digestive system and easily assimilated in the body.

Next on the list is an ancient root you pass by every time you go to the supermarket.

Number 4. Ginger.

A review of six studies found that consuming ginger supplements of 3 grams or more per day for eight weeks helped reduce blood pressure in individuals 50 years old or younger.

In another twelve week study done on 37 participants with metabolic syndrome, eating 2 grams of ginger powder per day significantly lowered levels of blood pressure, triglycerides, and fasting blood sugar, compared with a placebo.

Next, a vital mineral your body requires for managing blood pressure.

Number 3. Potassium.

Many studies have found that consuming higher amounts of potassium, whether through food or supplements, can help lower blood pressure levels.

One exception is people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who need to limit the amount of potassium they consume.

The reason potassium works is that it helps promote sodium excretion through the urine. With less sodium in the body, there is less fluid retention, which reduces blood pressure and helps blood vessels relax.

If you are eating a diet high in vegetables and fruit, you won’t need to take a potassium supplement.

Next, a powerful vegetable that reduces blood pressure and heart disease risk.

Number 2. Garlic.

In a review of 12 studies, consuming garlic supplements daily was found to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 8.3 mm Hg and 5.5 mm Hg respectively.

According to researchers, this reduction may help decrease your risk of stroke, heart attack, and coronary artery disease by up to 40%.

See our video “#1 Vegetable to Clean Your Arteries and Prevent Heart Attack,”

Coming up, a vitamin that’s often neglected when it comes to cardiovascular health.

Number 1. Vitamin K2.

Studies have found that increased vitamin K2 intake may help reduce stiffness in the arteries and slow down calcification in the blood vessels and heart valves.

When your body gets enough of this nutrient, calcium is kept out of soft tissues like your blood vessels, where it would otherwise cause them to harden and narrow.

This enables the heart to pump blood freely through the body and thus helps lower blood pressure and prevent heart disease and stroke.

It’s important to take vitamin k2 MK7 and D3 together, so that calcium is routed away from your heart, kidney, and arteries, and sent to the bones.

See our video, “Top 9 Vitamin K2 Foods to Stop Bone Loss & Reduce Artery Stiffness.”

https://dailyhealthpost.com/dancing-reverse-aging-brain/,"Dancing Can Reverse The Signs Of Aging In The Brain, Study Finds","Researchers have known for years that age-related degeneration in brain structure and cognitive impairment can be mitigated, and neuroplasticity improved, with physical activity. This is especially true of dancing because it requires more than just motor skills; there is more “thinking” associated with it. It turns out that dancing is not just fun, but it’s also good for your brain. (Updated July 8, 2022)

How Dancing Protects Your Brain

You don’t have to be a party lover to enjoy dancing. In fact, if you find jogging or running tedious, dancing can be just as good or even better at keeping you young. And you’re about to find out why.

A study published in “Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,” compared various dancing styles, such as Jazz and Latin-American, with traditional exercise. Individuals who took part in the study had an average age of 68. After 18 months of weekly choreographed dance routines, researchers found that the brain structure of all participants had made dramatic improvements. Especially, in the hippocampus area. (1)

The hippocampus is the region in our brain that is crucial for creating new memories and is also associated with learning and emotions. This is very welcoming news for those concerned with age-related brain degeneration, such as Alzheimer’s or memory loss.

Dancing Improves Physical and Brain Health

On top of strengthening the area of your brain involved with memory (hippocampus), dancing also improves endurance, flexibility, balance and body coordination. Many times, an injury caused by falling can be fatal to elderly people. One in three adults aged 50 and over dies within 12 months of suffering a hip fracture. (2)

“Dancing seems to be a promising intervention for both improving balance and brain structure in the elderly. It combines aerobic fitness, sensorimotor skills and cognitive demands while at the same time the risk of injuries is low,” the study states.

Having to remember dance steps, holding on to your partner the right way to execute a turn, having to recognize the beat and move in tandem, or just “feeling” the rhythm of the music and moving on your own, are all sensorimotor demands.

Researchers believe the improvements in balance may be due to learning choreography, which requires having to coordinate footsteps and arm patterns along with speed and rhythm changes.

The social aspect of dancing should not be underestimated either. Dancing involves other people and can reduce feelings of isolation and social stress, which can contribute to depression and cognitive decline.

Regardless of which genre you learn, dancing is a multi-tasking activity that combines cognitive, physical and social aspects all into one. It’s this unique synergy of components that make dancing so effective at slowing down the effects of aging in the brain.

Dance Like No One’s Watching!

The positive benefits of dance on aging and health are the real deal. With so many studies being doe on the subject, we ought to be dancing as much as we can.

Don’t like to dance? No problem, just think of it as enhancing your brain power and a way to keep healthy and fit. There’s no better time to start than now. 

Join a class or learn by yourself. Learn a dance step or two. Practice it until you get bored and move on to a new move even if you haven’t mastered the previous one. Just keep moving forward and keep practicing. Whatever you do, just remember to have fun!

Here’s what a year of dancing can turn into:",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"July 9, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-reduce-blood-sugar-levels/,Top 17 SUPER foods that reduce blood sugar levels (CONTROL Diabetes),"Almost seventy percent of people who suffer a heart attack have type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. That’s because high blood sugar damages the arteries, and makes them targets for hardening or atherosclerosis.

This can cause high blood pressure, which, if not treated, can lead to trouble, including blood vessel damage, heart attack, and kidney failure.

In today’s video, we look at the top 17 foods that reduce blood sugar levels, and help your body use insulin.

Number 17. Okra.

Okra is naturally rich in blood-sugar-lowering compounds like polysaccharides and flavonoid antioxidants.

Rhamnogalacturonan is a natural compound found in okra that has powerful antidiabetic properties.

On top of that, okra also contains the flavonoids like quercetin, which helps regulate key signalling pathways involved in glucose metabolism. Quercetin has been shown to help reduce blood sugar levels and boost insulin sensitivity.

Number 16. Avocados.

Avocados are a wonderful source of healthy fats and contain other key nutrients that can help keep your blood sugar and insulin levels steady throughout the day.

The majority of healthy fats found in avocados are monounsaturated fats. Several studies have found that this type of fat can make you feel full longer and help reduce hunger by controlling the release of appetite hormones.

Number 15. Coffee.

According to a study from the University of California, Los Angeles, participants who drank four cups of caffeinated coffee daily were found to be 56% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes.

And if you’re trying to avoid caffeine, decaf coffee can also help. A 2006 study of 28,812 women found that those who drank six cups of decaffeinated coffee a day had a 22% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to those who didn’t drink any coffee.

Number 14. Apple Cider Vinegar.

Taking a spoonful of vinegar before meals and at bedtime has been shown in one study to lower post-meal glucose by 34%. In the study, participants were asked to consume 20 ml of apple cider vinegar with 40 ml of water.

Not only did vinegar slow down the absorption of carbohydrates into the blood, the study also found that it helped improve insulin sensitivity.

In addition, many other studies have shown consuming vinegar before going to bed can help reduce fasting blood glucose levels in the morning.

Number 13. Nuts and Seeds.

All varieties of nuts, except cashews, are extremely low on the glycemic index and have little to no impact on your blood sugar levels.

Nuts are also rich in minerals. Two of particular interest when it comes to managing blood sugar levels are selenium and magnesium.

Selenium is a powerful cancer-fighting mineral that also helps keep the thyroid gland healthy. The thyroid gland regulates your metabolism, and turns fat into energy.

According to a systematic review and meta-analysis in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, magnesium has been found to reduce fasting blood glucose levels and insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes or who are at risk of developing it.

Number 12. Seaweed.

An eight-week study of 60 Japanese people found that fucoxanthin, a compound naturally present in brown seaweed, may help improve blood sugar control.

Study participants who consumed 2 mg of fucoxanthin had improved blood sugar levels, compared to the group who didn’t receive any.

The study also noted additional improvements in blood sugar levels in those with a genetic disposition to insulin resistance.

Another compound in seaweed called alginate has been found to prevent blood sugar spikes in animals after they were fed a high-sugar meal.

Number 11. Olive Oil.

Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fat, a type of fat that researchers believe has many health benefits.

A Spanish study published in the scientific journal Diabetes Care found that a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil helped reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by almost 50% compared to a low-fat diet.

Other similar studies have shown that a Mediterranean-style diet rich in olive oil may prevent type 2 diabetes by improving blood sugar levels, insulin resistance and blood lipid levels.

In addition, consuming olive oil has also been shown to improve levels of adiponectin, which is a hormone your fat tissue produces, to help with insulin sensitivity and inflammation.

Individuals with low levels of adiponectin have been associated with several conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.

Number 10. Grass-Fed Butter.

Butter is low glycemic and helps keep blood sugar levels stable, while also reducing appetite and sugar cravings.

Some studies suggest that consuming butyric acid, which can be found in butter, can help boost energy use and improve insulin sensitivity.

In addition, eating healthy fats can help our bodies absorb vital nutrients like calcium and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K.

Number 9. Green Tea.

A 2013 study published in the Diabetes and Metabolism Journal found that people who drank 6 cups of tea a day were 33% less likely to gain weight, develop insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.

Green tea consumption has also been associated with decreased fasting glucose levels and A1C levels, as well as reduced fasting insulin levels. Researchers believe that the antioxidant activity of polyphenols and polysaccharides within green tea is responsible for these benefits.

Number 8. Coconut Oil.

A 2010 study published in the Indian Journal of Pharmacology found that a diet supplemented with coconut oil led to improved glucose tolerance levels, as well as a lowering of total cholesterol levels. Researchers attributed this effect to lauric acid, a medium chain triglyceride found in coconut oil.

Another 2009 study found that mice fed coconut oil for four weeks experienced lower insulin resistance and less body fat buildup. These effects were seen even without making any other changes in the rodent’s diets.

Number 7. Fermented Foods.

Kimchi and sauerkraut are packed with nutrients like probiotics, minerals, and antioxidants. Eating them regularly has been associated with improved blood sugar and insulin sensitivity.

Number 6. Beans.

Beans are a significant source of slow-burning carbohydrates, fiber, and protein, which can help you feel satiated and stabilize blood sugar levels.

Research studies have shown that bean, lentil, chickpea and soybean consumption can reduce insulin resistance and improve blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

One thing to remember is that beans and other legumes contain more lectins and other digestive-irritants than most other types of foods. For individuals with sensitive digestive systems, beans can make digestive problems worse.

Number 5. Dark Leafy Green Vegetables.

According to a study published in the British Medical Journal, adding more green leafy vegetables to your diet can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Leafy greens are packed with magnesium, fiber, and phytonutrients, which can help lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin control.

In addition, the high concentrations of polyphenols and vitamin C, both of which have antioxidant properties, are also believed to play a role in regulating blood sugar levels.

Number 4. Cruciferous Vegetables.

Test-tube, animal, and human studies have found that sulforaphane-rich foods like broccoli exert powerful antidiabetic effects, helping enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels.

Cruciferous vegetables also contain a natural compound called glucoraphanin, which has been found to help promote insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

Number 3. Garlic and Onion.

Allicin, which is responsible for the pungent smell of onion and garlic, is one of the main active components that’s been found to have several therapeutic effects in the body, like promoting insulin sensitivity, reducing blood sugar levels, regulating lipid metabolism and limiting inflammation.

Number 2. Berries and Cherries.

Many studies have linked the consumption of berries with improved blood sugar control. A 2019 study found that eating 2 cups of red raspberries with a high-carb meal significantly reduced post-meal insulin and blood sugar levels in adults with prediabetes, compared with a control group.

Other studies have shown that a compound called anthocyanin, which is commonly found in berries, can benefit blood sugar management by enhancing insulin sensitivity and improving glucose clearance from the blood.

Number 1. Dark Chocolate.

This delicious treat contains several antioxidants which are effective at curbing your appetite as well as improving glucose tolerance.

In addition, dark chocolate is also rich in magnesium, a mineral that helps control blood sugar and helps you feel calm and relaxed, while lowering your blood pressure.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-kidney-problems/,Top 10 Signs of Kidney Problems You ABSOLUTELY Must Be Aware Of…,"Did you know that having high blood pressure puts you at a greater risk of developing kidney disease That’s because high blood pressure causes the blood vessels to constrict and narrow, which eventually damages and weakens them throughout the body, including in the kidneys.

==> Reverse Kidney Disease Naturally

When this happens, the kidneys cannot remove all wastes and extra fluid from your body.

This extra fluid in the blood vessels can raise your blood pressure, creating a dangerous cycle, and cause more damage, leading to kidney failure.

For most people, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is asymptomatic until Stage 3 and later.

In today’s video, we look at the top 10 signs of kidney problems to watch out for.

Watch to the end to learn how one ingredient damages both your kidneys and heart in one go.

Number 10. You feel lethargic and have trouble concentrating.

A severe decrease in kidney function can lead to a buildup of toxins and impurities in the blood. This can cause people to feel tired, weak and can make it difficult to focus.

That’s because your kidneys make a hormone called erythropoietin or EPO, that stimulates the production of red blood cells, which is necessary for transporting oxygen throughout the whole body. And reduced oxygen levels can lead to brain fog and fatigue.

Number 9. You have trouble sleeping.

Although patients with chronic kidney disease often experience poor sleep quality, not much is known about the exact physiological mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon.

One thing is for sure though, is that sleep apnea is more common in those with chronic kidney disease, compared with the general population.

Number 8. You have dry and itchy skin.

Healthy kidneys do many important jobs, and one of them is maintaining the right amount of minerals in your blood. When the kidneys cannot keep the right balance of minerals and nutrients in your blood, the outcome is dry and itchy skin.

Number 7. You feel the need to urinate more often.

If you go to the bathroom more than you’d like, especially at night, this can be a sign of kidney disease. When the kidneys’ filters are damaged, it can cause an increase in the need to urinate.

Number 6. You see blood in your urine.

Under normal circumstances, your kidneys keep healthy blood cells in the body when filtering wastes from the blood to produce urine. However, when the kidney’s filters are damaged, healthy blood cells can start to “leak” out into the urine.

Number 5. Your urine is foamy.

Excessive bubbles in the urine, like the ones that require you to flush several times before they go away, are a sign that there is protein in the urine.

High amounts of protein in your urine over a period, may be the first sign that kidney disease, or another condition like high blood pressure or diabetes, has damaged the filters in your kidneys*. This can happen in Stages 1 and 2 of kidney disease.

Number 4. Your eyes are dry, red and sore.

As mentioned previously, healthy kidneys ensure that proper levels of minerals and nutrients are maintained in your blood.

When the kidneys cannot control the amounts of calcium and phosphate in the blood, these extra minerals can find their way into your eyes and cause irritation.

Number 3. Your ankles and feet are swollen.

Impaired kidney function can lead to sodium retention, causing swelling in your feet and ankles.

Number 2. You have a poor appetite.

That’s because when unfiltered waste builds up in the blood because of poor kidney function, it can suppress appetite and alter the way food tastes. Foods you once enjoyed may taste metallic and cause you to eat less.

Number 1. Your muscles are cramping.

Electrolytes are needed to regulate nerve and muscle function, hydrate the body, balance blood acidity and pressure, and help rebuild damaged tissue.

For example, a muscle needs calcium, sodium, and potassium to contract. When these minerals become imbalanced because of impaired kidney function, it can lead to muscle cramps.

Next, let’s talk about the one ingredient that affects your blood pressure, heart, and kidneys.

Your kidneys filter over 120 quarts of blood each day. They remove toxins and any excess fluid from cells throughout the body.

But eating too much salt or sodium can make it harder for your kidneys to do their job. That’s because salt makes your body hold on to water.

Excessive sodium intake causes the extra water in your blood to put additional pressure on your blood vessel walls.

This not only raises your blood pressure but can also damage the walls inside your arteries, which can collect plaque and ultimately lead to a heart attack or stroke.

Do you know the number one source of excessive sodium? See our video, Top 5 foods that cause high blood pressure.

In addition, salt affects people differently. For some individuals, eating sodium has little to no effect on their blood pressure.

But for others, even a slight increase in salt intake can wreak havoc on the kidneys’ ability to regulate fluid, and can lead to increased blood pressure.

Salt sensitivity is most prevalent among people who are middle-aged or elderly, and overweight. It also becomes more prevalent as we age.

Next, what are the causes of kidney disease?

Uncontrolled high blood pressure and diabetes are the most common causes of kidney disease.

Other risk factors to take into consideration include being over the age of 60, and having a family history of kidney disease.

Next, here are eight lifestyle habits to protect your kidneys.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), there are several things you can do to avoid kidney problems:

Keep your blood sugar levels stable.
Maintain a healthy blood pressure.
Eat healthy low-sodium meals. Try to limit your daily salt intake to 1,500 mg.
Have annual tests to ensure your kidneys are functioning properly.
Avoid painkillers because they can damage your kidneys-especially non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen.
Don’t smoke.
Limit alcohol.
Exercise regularly to help maintain a healthy weight.
Next, what are the foods that support kidney health, especially for people with kidney disease?

People with kidney problems should eat foods that don’t have a lot of potassium, sodium, and phosphorus, so as not to overwork the kidneys.

These foods also need to be high in antioxidants, so they can fight inflammation, and help the kidneys heal or stop them from getting worse.

Here is a list of foods:

Vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, arugula, and garlic…

Fruits like blueberries, pineapple, apple, grapes and bell peppers…

Healthy Fats like olive oil, salmon, macadamia nuts…

Whole grains (and complex carbs) like buckwheat, oats and quinoa…

Protein like fish and skinless chicken breast…

People with different stages of kidney disease should consult a renal dietitian for advice on the foods they should eat.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/juice-to-unclog-arteries/,Drink one cup daily of this juice to UNCLOG arteries?,"Did you know that something as simple as drinking pomegranate juice could help protect you against heart disease – the #1 cause of death in developed countries?

In today’s video, we take a close look at FIVE cardioprotective properties of pomegranates that work together to lower cholesterol, reduce blood pressure, and even prevent atherosclerosis.

And the first on the list has to do with a unique compound found in pomegranates that’s responsible for the majority of its health benefits.

Number 5. Pomegranate juice reduces oxidative stress.

When it comes to cardiovascular disease, reducing damage caused to blood vessels by oxidative stress and inflammation is vital.

Pomegranates contain a unique compound known as punicalagins, which has been found to be cardioprotective thanks to its powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

Not only is this the most abundant antioxidant in pomegranate, but it’s also responsible for more than half of the antioxidant activity of pomegranate juice.

In one study, researchers compared pomegranate juice to other potent antioxidants like grape juice, cranberry juice, green tea, vitamin C and vitamin.

The results showed that pomegranate juice outperformed all other sources in reducing the damaging effects of free radicals on cell membranes.

Number 4. Pomegranate juice promotes nitric oxide activity.

Nitric oxide is a molecule that your body produces naturally.

Its main function is vasodilation which means it helps the blood vessels relax, making it easier for the blood to flow.

Having inadequate levels of nitric oxide has been found to be associated with heart disease, diabetes and erectile dysfunction.

Nitric oxide helps prevent LDL oxidation and plaque buildup within the endothelial cell lining, which often leads to clogged arteries.

Combined, these effects help slow down the progression of atherosclerosis.

Many studies have found that consuming pomegranate juice can help enhance the biological actions of nitric oxide, while also protecting it from oxidative damage.

In one study, researchers found that pomegranate juice and pomegranate fruit extract were able to increase production levels of nitric oxide.

Number 3. Pomegranate juice prevents LDL oxidation.

LDL oxidation is one of the well-documented causes of heart disease.

That’s because oxidized LDL promotes atherosclerosis through inflammatory and immunologic responses that lead to the formation of plaque in the arteries.

LDL oxidation also reduces the production of nitric oxide in blood vessels, which reduces blood flow throughout the whole body.

In one study, researchers treated human coronary artery cells with pomegranate juice and found a strong increase in levels of nitric oxide production, which is beneficial in preventing heart attacks.

Number 2. Pomegranate juice lowers blood pressure.

Pomegranates contain key nutrients that can help prevent high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.

An old study from 2012 found that consuming 1 cup of pomegranate juice daily for 28 days helped lower high blood pressure in the short term.

Another 2017 review of eight human trials found evidence that drinking pomegranate juice consistently lowered blood pressure.

Researchers believe that pomegranates help lower blood pressure by reducing levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the body.

That’s because angiotensin converting enzymes increase blood pressure by producing the hormone angiotensin II, which constricts blood vessels.

To learn about a “10-Second Trick” to erase plaque from your arteries, click the link below after you finish watching this video.

Number 1. Pomegranate juice may help reverse atherosclerosis.

In a 2004 study published in the journal Clinical Nutrition, researchers administered pomegranate juice to patients over the course of a year.

This reversed plaque accumulation in the carotid arteries of patients with severe carotid artery stenosis, which is defined as 70–90% blockage in the internal carotid arteries. 

The carotid arteries in the neck are responsible for more than 80% of blood flow to the brain, and narrowing of these major vessels is a major risk factor for stroke.

Among patients given daily pomegranate juice, atherosclerotic lesions in the common carotid artery decreased by 35% in size.

Patients who drank pomegranate juice daily also saw total antioxidant activity increase by 130% compared to before-treatment values.

Another study from the California-based Preventive Medicine Research Institute looked at the effects of pomegranate juice in human patients suffering from cardiac ischemia or insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle.

A total of forty-five patients were randomly assigned to consume 8 ounces of pomegranate juice or a placebo beverage daily.

At the end of the three-month study, scientists found that patients who drank the pomegranate juice daily showed significant improvements in blood flow to the heart muscle compared to the placebo group.

Next, How to Eat Pomegranate Without Making a Mess.

Removing the edible arils from a pomegranate can be a messy task, but it’s actually easy when you know how to do it.

All you have to do is cut it in half around the diameter and then hit the back of the fruit with a large spatula or serving spoon. The edible arils should fall off on their own.

When selecting pomegranates, look for a ripe, deep-colored fruit with a red to reddish-brown outer rind that is heavy for its size.

The best time to enjoy fresh pomegranates in the United States is between the end of September through November.

For those living in other countries, you can also just buy frozen pomegranate arils as they store well in the freezer.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-a-blood-clot-in-your-leg/,Top 10 signs of a BLOOD CLOT in your leg (prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis),"Blood clots are shockingly common. On average, one person dies from a blood clot every 6 minutes in the United States.

Medically known as deep vein thrombosis or DVT, blood clots can form in any part of the body, but usually occur in the pelvis, thigh, or lower leg.

When a part of a clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs where it causes a blockage, it’s called a pulmonary embolism or PE.

This is instantly an emergency room situation that cannot be ignored or delayed.

In today’s video, we look at 10 signs that alert you to a blood clot in the legs.

We also reveal one “hidden” condition that causes blood clots, and how you can prevent them.

Number 10. Inflammation.

Swelling in the legs can be a sign of a blood clot (or thrombus), especially if other home treatments for inflammation, such as cold and hot compresses, cannot ease the symptom. The dense tissue and bone in this part of the body makes it difficult to break down or absorb clots naturally. If you experience unexplained swelling in your calf, ankle, or upper leg, seek medical attention immediately.

Number 9. Redness of Skin.

There are many reasons a person’s skin becomes red, such as sun exposure or an allergic reaction. If the redness is accompanied by dark patches, it could be a clot. These clots may get bigger over time for no reason. If you have redness that lingers after an injury or surgery, see a doctor.

Number 8. Warm Skin.

The skin around a blood clot becomes warm to the touch and may even radiate heat. If the symptom persists and the cold compress doesn’t help, see a doctor. Warm skin can also be accompanied by tingling and throbbing sensations.

Number 7. Tenderness.

The skin surrounding the clot may become sore, or sensitive to the touch. Besides acute pain, this symptom frequently requires individuals to rely on their other leg to relieve the discomfort, which can lead to muscle and joint strain.

Number 6. Increased Heart Rate.

When a blood clot in the leg grows larger, the body goes into overdrive to eliminate it. Vital organs have to work harder, resulting in a rise in the heart rate. A higher heart rate can produce its own symptoms, such as shortness of breath and chest pains. A racing heart that cannot be attributed to physical activity or other recognized reasons should be assessed by a physician.

Number 5. Fever.

When a blood clot detaches and enters the bloodstream, some people develop a fever. This fever may be accompanied by chills, shivering, sweating, headaches, weakness, dehydration, fatigue, and body aches. In severe cases, the fever may shoot very high, resulting in mood changes, confusion, and other psychological anomalies.

Number 4. Distended Veins.

Sometimes, distended or swollen veins may be a sign of a blood clot. Clots that become large can compress the surrounding blood vessels. People with varicose veins have an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the leg.

Number 3. Fainting.

Fainting is often associated with low blood sugar or dehydration, but it can also be a sign of a blood clot. When a blood clot blocks the flow of oxygenated blood to the brain, you may feel dizzy or faint. If the blood clot moves to the lungs, you may have respiratory symptoms. Many people are unaware that a blood clot can cause a person to faint. This can lead to a misdiagnosis.

Number 2. Fatigue.

When a clot grows larger, the body’s natural defense mechanisms go into overdrive to eliminate it. This can use up a lot of energy and resources, leaving a person feeling tired. Even after sleeping, a person may still feel tired and weak. If you have unexplained fatigue, it may be a sign of a blood clot, especially if you have pain, swelling, and redness in the affected area.

Number 1. No Symptoms.

No symptoms may appear in about half the cases of blood clots in the leg until the clot detaches and becomes lodged in the lungs. There is a limited time period when doctors can treat or remove the clot before it causes deadly consequences such as pulmonary embolism.

Next, what are the symptoms of pulmonary embolism?

These include low blood oxygen levels, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, pain in the chest, low-grade fever, and low blood pressure.

Contact a doctor as soon as multiple symptoms appear. If caught early enough, treatments such as anticoagulants and thrombolytics can be administered, which may break up the clot before it causes any serious damage.

Next, what are the consequences of deep vein thrombosis?

The CDC estimates that 50% of those who survive a blood clot experience will have long-term consequences for the rest of their lives. And one third will have another clot within 10 years of the first one.

When blood clots damage the valves in the vein, they cause a condition called post-thrombotic syndrome or PTS. Symptoms of PTS include swelling, pain, discoloration, and, in severe cases, scaling or ulcers in the affected part of the body. Sometimes, these symptoms can be so severe that a person becomes disabled.

Next, this condition that causes deep vein thrombosis is largely ignored.

The condition known as high blood viscosity not only increases your risk of DVT, it also puts you at higher risk for heart disease, high cholesterol, stroke, metabolic syndrome and diabetes.

Having high blood viscosity means that your blood is very thick and sticky. This makes it harder for your heart to pump blood and increases the friction on the inside of your veins.

As blood flow becomes sluggish, the amount of oxygen and nutrients delivered to your cells and organs is decreased.

To learn about your blood viscosity, you can request a complete blood count from your doctor.

A study from Edinburgh University in the United Kingdom, showed conclusively that raised blood viscosity is at least as important as blood pressure and “bad” cholesterol in predicting death by heart attack.

In other words, the quality of your artery walls is not the only thing that matters, the quality of your blood matters too.

However, over the last two decades, mainstream medicine has been obsessed with reducing cholesterol levels through statin drugs, while largely ignoring high blood viscosity and the fatal blood clots it can cause.

So what can you do about high blood viscosity?

One simple way to fix this is to get plenty of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are natural anti-inflammatories, which means they help reduce inflammation. They also slow blood clotting and thin the blood.

It should be mentioned that DVT in the leg, pelvis, and sometimes arm, does NOT cause heart attack or stroke.

The blood clot in an artery in the heart or brain, known as arterial thrombosis, is what causes a heart attack and stroke.

Next, what can you do to prevent blood clots in your legs and improve blood viscosity?

Avoid wearing tight clothing, especially when traveling.

During long periods of travel, take time to move or stretch.

Elevate your legs at least 6 inches above the level of your heart every day.

(See our video, Top 8 ways to improve blood flow to legs and feet)

Keep your feet flat on the floor while sitting, do not cross your ankles.

Move around for at least 30 minutes every day.

Consider graduated compression stockings if you are at risk for blood clots.

Be careful of impact injuries to your arms and legs.

If you’re a woman taking birth control, ask your doctor about non-hormonal options.

Eliminate excess sodium from your diet. This means avoiding processed meals. (See our video, Top 5 foods that CAUSE high blood pressure.)

Keep well-hydrated and drink plenty of water. Quit smoking.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-cause-high-blood-pressure/,Top 5 foods that CAUSE high blood pressure – replace!,"Your blood pressure goes up, when there’s excess fluid and not enough space in your arteries. That’s when your kidneys open up, and release extra fluid from your arteries into your urine. So you literally flush away that extra pressure.

=> Discover this “Kidney Release Trick” to Lower Blood Pressure Overnight

At least, you should, but if this isn’t the case, you may have high blood pressure. This is a reading above 140/90 mm HG.

In today’s video, we look at the FIVE worst foods that cause elevated blood pressure or hypertension, which can lead to heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.

We begin with the #1 “heart-healthy oil” that is, in fact, destroying your health.

Number 5. Vegetable Oils.

Prolonged consumption of vegetable oils trigger chemicals that cause inflammation in your body. This can lead to hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, and other chronic diseases.

Vegetable oils such as soybean, cottonseed, corn, safflower, grapeseed, and canola oil, are mostly composed of processed polyunsaturated fats.

During refining, these oils oxidize easily when exposed to heat or light and become rancid.

They have a lot of inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, and very few anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats, which is bad for you.

A 2019 study in OpenHeart showed that omega-6’s increase blood pressure through their high amounts of linoleic acid.

In another 2011 study, rats who were fed palm and soybean oils experienced a noticeable increase in blood pressure.

If you buy processed foods, packaged baked goods, fast food, fried foods, frozen foods, and margarine, it is almost certain that vegetable oils were used to prepare these foods.

Or worse, it may use partially hydrogenated oil or vegetable shortening, also known as trans fats.

Trans fatty acids are notorious for their double whammy effect: they increase the levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol and lower levels of the ‘good’ cholesterol. They also increase inflammatory response and cause leaky gut.

To replace vegetable oils, cook with unrefined oils like macadamia oil, extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, sesame oil, and coconut oil.

Raw, unsalted nuts and seeds are excellent sources of healthy polyunsaturated fats. A polyunsaturated fat that isn’t processed is usually not inflammatory.

Next, this mineral gets most of the blame for high blood pressure.

Number 4. Salt or Sodium.

Doctors have been preaching about avoiding salt for a long time. This is because it was considered a contributing factor in high blood pressure. How is that?

Well, salt can cause the body to store water. When that happens, blood volume rises, and some people get higher blood pressure.

Salt comprises sodium and chloride. But in reality, it is sodium that can be harmful to your health.

The body needs a small amount of sodium to function, but most people in industrialized countries consume too much sodium.

One survey of worldwide dietary sodium intake found that only 10 to 15% of total dietary sodium comes from adding it to food cooked at home.

The other 75 to 80% of sodium ingested by people in North America and Europe comes from processed food. This should come as no surprise!

Highly processed meals are not only high in sodium, they are also full of high fructose corn syrup, chemical preservatives, starchy fillers, and other undesirable elements that all contribute to poor health.

So it’s tough to say that the sodium in these processed foods is the only thing that causes high blood pressure.

In fact, the link between sodium and high blood pressure is uncertain, because many of the scientific studies on the effects of salt on hypertension have been inconclusive.

A 2011 meta-analysis of seven studies involving over 6,000 people found that there is NO firm evidence that cutting salt intake reduces the risk for heart attacks, strokes or death.

Some studies have even found low-salt diets lead to a slight increase in health problems. There is a growing body of research questioning the long-term benefits of a low-salt diet.

The only time when sodium can lead to hypertension is when there is an imbalance between the salt and potassium in the diet.

Sodium and potassium balance each other. Too much salt depletes potassium, and too much potassium depletes salt.

So, the important choice here is to increase potassium in the diet. And that’s pretty easy—just add a lot of fresh veggies and fruits, and you have more potassium!

So rather than worrying about the sodium content in foods, eat organic unprocessed foods that include an abundance of veggies and fruit.

Most veggies and fruits are loaded with potassium, which helps the body get rid of excess sodium and lower blood pressure.

So, if you have elevated blood pressure, just eat more potassium-rich whole foods. Cut way back on the salt and foods containing sodium, and stay away from refined sugar and grains.

And, of course, avoid processed foods. If it comes in a can, box, bag, and has multiple ingredients, it is probably not good for you.

Processed foods containing excess sodium include cheese singles, frozen meals and pizza, french fries, deli meats, condiments like ketchup and barbeque sauce, and pickles.

Canned foods like tomatoes, beans and soups not only contain too much sodium, they also contain the chemical, bisphenol A (BPA), which has been found to raise blood pressure significantly.

Foods that contain high levels of potassium include avocado, squash, spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes, pomegranates, coconut water and bananas.

Next, this white crystal is the real culprit behind high blood pressure.

Number 3. Refined carbs and sugar.

It’s well-established that a diet high in refined carbs and sugar increases the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.

Refined carbs are starchy foods like white bread, pasta, pizza dough, pastries and cereals, and contain mostly sugars.

They are made from processed grains like corn, wheat – and soy (a legume), which have nutrients removed from them.

Too many refined carbohydrates increase water in the blood, thus increasing blood pressure.

A 2014 study published in OpenHeart showed that refined sugar, particularly fructose, may be a bigger threat for blood pressure and heart disease (than salt).

The researchers found that people who ate processed foods loaded with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) for two weeks, experience elevated blood pressure.

Fructose or HFCS is a sweetener found in 80 to 90% of all processed foods, sodas, sweetened beverages, juice drinks, and other packaged foods like biscuits and salad dressings.

So how does added sugar cause the onset of hypertension? It does this through several mechanisms.

One. Fructose increases uric acid, which raises blood pressure by blocking nitric oxide in blood vessels. Nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels and helps them stay elastic.

Two. When the body produces too much insulin and leptin in response to a higher-carb diet, it can increase blood pressure because it decreases the amount of water and sodium that the kidneys excrete.

Three. As insulin levels increase, cells become resistant to insulin. This results in magnesium not being able to be stored in the body. So it leaves the body through urination. When there is not enough magnesium, blood vessels do not relax fully, which raises blood pressure.

Four. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) directly result from exposure to sugars. AGEs cause diabetes-related complications. They also trigger processes that cause blood vessels to stiffen and narrow. This contributes to atherosclerosis and further increases blood pressure.

To substantially reduce blood pressure, eliminate wheat, soy and corn, along with sugars and processed foods.

Go for complex carbs like peas, beans, whole grain (try to avoid wheat) and vegetables. And use moderate amounts of natural sweeteners like raw honey, maple syrup, stevia and molasses.

Coming up, this beverage can spike your blood pressure and damage your brain.

Number 2. Alcohol.

There is a proven positive association between alcohol intake and blood pressure.

According to a study of 15 controlled scientific studies, reducing alcohol consumption lowered blood pressure in a dose-responsive way. The less alcohol consumed, the better the blood pressure results, and vice versa.

Another study showed that when people stopped or severely restricted their alcohol intake, their blood pressure went down. But when they resumed drinking the same amount of alcohol as before, their blood pressure went back up to where it was before the study.

If you have high blood pressure, and do not plan to quit drinking, limit yourself to one drink a day – whether it’s wine, beer, whiskey or a mixed drink.

Next, if you love charbroiled burgers and grilled meats, do this ONE thing to protect your health.

Number 1. Over-Grilled Meat.

New research suggests that eating meat cooked at high temperatures can cause an inflammatory response in the body, which raises blood pressure.

In 2018, researchers presented a 16-year study about the effects of cooking red meat and fish. The study showed that cooking meat and fish at high temperatures, such as over an open flame, raises the risk of developing hypertension.

People who grilled their meat and fish were 17% more likely to develop hypertension than those who broiled or roasted their meat.

Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines (HAAs) are carcinogenic compounds that form when meat protein is exposed to high temperatures. The risk of hypertension increases with the amount of HAAs present. Well-done meats have more HAAs than rarer meats.

If you are going to grill meats, using rosemary, thyme, garlic, oregano and other spices in a marinade can decimate any carcinogens.

Harvard Medical School researchers have found that inflammation may be an underlying cause of high blood pressure. They found that levels of an inflammatory marker called C-reactive protein are significantly and independently associated with the future development of hypertension.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-train-your-brain-to-stop-worrying/,How to Train Your Brain to Stop Worrying,"Most of us occasionally worry about one thing or another, some people much more than that. Sometimes we worry about things that are happening in our lives; often we worry about what could potentially happen. Worry is a disturbing and destructive state of mind when you experience anxiety over things that are often beyond your control.

While worry may have some value for defining and analyzing problems, habitual worry is an emotional state that can have physical impacts, such as: impaired brain function and health, fatigue, skin conditions, muscle soreness, circulatory and respiratory problems, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and a compromised immune system.

But worry isn’t a physical condition—it’s all in your head.

Churning up anxiety over something that you can’t do anything about may be the single most energy-draining activity in which you can engage. Chronic worriers are unhappy people and often unhealthy as well. “Don’t worry, be happy” is simplistic and disrespectful. But the sentiment is in the right place: when you worry about something to the point that it affects your daily life and relationships or disrupts your sleep, it would be extremely helpful if you could easily allay the anxiety and rationally deal with whatever situation is causing the distress.

Because you have control over your thoughts, you can train yourself to manage worry to keep it from becoming debilitating—and potentially to consistently hold it at bay.

Here are three ways to train your brain to stop worrying:

1. Write it down

We’re often worried about something in the future that may or may not actually happen. Those concerns are hard to rein in because thoughts often spiral and you start thinking of all the possibilities, regardless of how realistic or probable they are. Research into the causes and outcomes of worry has found that there’s an inverse relationship between the degree of worry and how real the subject of worry is:

“The more participants worried about a given topic the less concrete was the content of their elaboration. The results challenge the view that worry may promote better problem analyses. Instead they conform to the view that worry is a cognitive avoidance response.” (1)

Journaling your troubling thoughts makes them more concrete. Whether written by hand or electronically typed, writing the actual words makes them real and you can deal with them in a more direct way. You give shape and validation to vague ethereal thoughts. You can then step back and look at the words to consider your troubles more objectively. Expressive writing about a stressful subject has been demonstrated to be a very effective moderator of anxiety. (2) Getting it out of your head and onto paper can give your mind some peace!

2. Meditate

Take a vacation from the din of your thoughts on a regular basis. Stress levels in the Western world are on the rise, with significant and noticeably negative effects. Mindfulness meditation calms the mind and body. A Dutch study of the effects of meditation to alleviate stress found:

“MM [mindful meditation], HRV-BF [heart rate variability biofeedback], and PE [physical exercise] are all effective self-help methods to improve attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying…” (3)

In fact, mindful meditation has been found effective in:

improving blood sugar levels
reducing the effects of stress of all kinds
preventing memory loss
promoting cognitive function
improving immune system function
promoting calmness and re-balancing emotions
decreasing the feeling of loneliness
managing pain
and more!

It doesn’t take a lot of time each day to practice mindfulness; as much time as you have is enough, even if it’s only a minute. Go to a quiet room, sit or lie comfortably, breathe deeply and regularly, and let your thoughts come and go without lingering on any one. Treat your worrisome thoughts as transient, passing through your consciousness like a warm breeze. Be present in the moment and ground yourself from being carried away by the busy-ness of your life and the worry you experience. You will feel refreshed and calmer, your concerns not as critical and imposing. For some people, meditation is even more effective at reducing anxiety than physical exercise. (4)

3. Exercise

Vigorous physical activity is good for you in every way, including helping you deal with stress. When you exercise, hormones are released in your body that (among other things) make you feel good, counteracting and balancing stress hormones. (5) In a psychological context, numerous studies have found that exercise:

improves self-esteem
provides a sense of well-being
protects from mental illness (6)
reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms (7)

You may compare a state of worry with anticipation of an attack of some sort: adrenaline, cortisol, and other stress hormones are released to prepare for fight or flight. Because the attack isn’t physical (at least in the moment of worry), you instead freeze—there’s really nothing else you can do without a tangible antagonist. This is a case in which you are your own worst enemy. These stress hormones are on low boil for as long as you worry and there is never a resolution for a chronic worrier.

When you exercise, you focus your efforts to the physical realm, transferring a battle in the mind to a battle of the body. You provide yourself with an outlet for all that’s been bottled up and simmering. In addition, you can’t dwell on any one thought outside of the attention you are forced to pay to your body while it’s in motion. When your exertion has ended, hormones regain homeostasis and all your body’s systems are rejuvenated.

When you find yourself worrying, take a walk outside as soon as you can get out and as far away from cars and bustle as you can. Walk briskly and look around you, taking in whatever your senses feed you while breathing regularly. Even a short walk can quickly alleviate immediate symptoms of worry and help you reset.

Try to remember that worrying about what has already happened won’t change history; worrying about the present doesn’t positively affect how events will resolve; and worrying about the future (and what might happen) is a complete waste of time and energy. Be as kind and helpful to yourself as you would be to your best friend. Train your brain to stop worrying.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-to-lower-high-blood-pressure/,Top 7 foods to lower HIGH blood pressure naturally,"Hypertension affects about 30% of adults worldwide. Many people think that eating too much salt is the reason for high blood pressure. But the real culprit may be added sugar, especially the fructose in sugar-sweetened beverages.

So when it comes to blood pressure, avoiding processed foods high in fructose is the first step to lowering risk.

The next step is adding the right foods to your diet. Here are 7 foods proven to lower blood pressure.

Let’s begin with the #1 food source of a compound that’s essential for strong blood flow.

Number 7. Beets.

Beets help to lower blood pressure levels because they contain high levels of dietary nitrates. Nitrates are found in beetroot and dark leafy greens like spinach and arugula.

When you eat nitrates, your body turns them into nitric oxide, which causes blood vessels to relax and open up. This lowers blood pressure and helps the body carry more oxygen to different parts of the body that need it.

Other leafy greens with high levels of nitrates are celery and celery root, watercress, leeks, parsley, and turnips.

You may have heard that some people take a drug called “nitroglycerin” to help with chest pain and heart attacks. This medication is a synthetic version of nitrates found in beets.

In a study funded by the British Heart Foundation, 68 patients with hypertension were given either 250 ml of beetroot juice or a placebo juice. The beetroot juice lowered blood pressure in the group that received it.

This group also improved endothelial function by about 20 percent, and reduced arterial stiffness.

Another study of over 1500 people without high blood pressure, showed that those who ate the most nitrate-rich vegetables over 3 years, had a 37% lower risk of developing hypertension than those who ate the least.

Next, a delicious source of magnesium that promotes a healthy heart rhythm.

Number 6. Dark Chocolate.

Many studies prove that cocoa products can lower blood pressure. Dark chocolate is particularly effective and only small amounts are needed. In a JAMA study of 44 people with hypertension or pre-hypertension, those who ate a small square of dark chocolate (30 calories), saw their systolic pressure drop by 2.9 mm Hg, and diastolic pressure drop by 1.9 mm Hg, while there was no change in the group that ate white chocolate.

Researchers say that flavanols, especially epicatechin, are responsible for the blood pressure-lowering effects of chocolate. Another study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that chocolate also contains procyanidins that increase nitric oxide production and relax blood vessels.

Chocolate can help save lives. A study of 470 elderly men published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that those eating the most chocolate, not only lowered their blood pressure, but also slashed the risk of cardiovascular death in half.

Coming up, if a pharmaceutical company created a synthetic substance like this spice, it would be one of the most popular and expensive drugs on the market!

Number 5. Garlic.

Garlic is an amazing food for keeping your blood pressure in check. It does this through several mechanisms that widen your blood vessels and improve blood flow.

Garlic helps increase nitric oxide production in your cells by increasing the activity of an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase.

It acts like popular blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors by blocking the hormone angiotensin.

And garlic helps your red blood cells produce hydrogen sulfide, which relaxes your blood vessels.

Garlic is as effective as blood pressure medications. A study of 210 hypertensive patients showed that garlic tablets significantly reduced blood pressure compared to beta blockers. Unlike drugs, garlic is safe and well-tolerated.

See our video “#1 Vegetable to Clean Your Arteries and Prevent Heart Attack.”

Next, this lazy summer fruit may not seem like much, but it is actually a powerful healer.

Number 4. Watermelon.

Eating watermelon is a highly effective way to reduce blood pressure and the risk of heart disease.

According to a study published in the American Journal of Hypertension, watermelon is the richest edible natural source of L-citrulline, and is also an excellent source of vitamin A, B6 and C, as well as fiber, potassium and the antioxidant lycopene.

A study from the Florida State University gave 9 pre-hypertensive people, six grams of the amino acid L-citrulline from watermelon extract every day. All the patients showed improved arterial function and lower aortic blood pressure.

Watermelon contains citrulline, especially the white part of watermelon. This is turned into arginine in our bodies. Arginine helps us create nitric oxide, which we already know has many benefits for our hearts and blood vessels.

*L-arginine is available as a dietary supplement, but it may cause nausea, gastrointestinal tract discomfort, and diarrhea. Watermelon does not have any of those effects.

Because it is rich in potassium, watermelon also helps keep sodium from raising blood pressure.

Watermelon is a superb source of lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that protects the heart, supports healthy arteries, and improves blood flow.

A Physicians Health Study showed that men with the highest blood levels of lycopene had a 39% decrease in stroke risk. Another study in Finland following 1,000 men for 12 years found similar results.

Lycopene may also support bone formation, improve male fertility, and protect against cancer and UV damage from the sun.

Coming up, a superfood that has medicinal qualities without the negative effects some medications can have.

Number 3. Pomegranate Juice.

Pomegranates contain powerful polyphenols that can help fight inflammation and oxidation. It has been shown to help prevent or treat various health issues, including high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, oxidative stress, high blood sugar, and other health problems related to inflammation.

In one Israeli study, 101 kidney disease patients were given either 100 ml of pomegranate juice or a placebo every day for one year. The systolic blood pressure was found to be significantly lower in the group that drank pomegranate juice, but not in the placebo group. Drinking pomegranate juice regularly reduces systolic blood pressure and may reduce atherosclerosis.

See our video on the amazing benefits of pomegranate.

A great idea is to combine beet, pomegranate, and carrot juice for a high antioxidant, blood pressure lowering drink. A triple-whammy for your health!

Next, this popular beverage is famous for its cancer-fighting properties.

Number 2. Green Tea.

New research has shown that green tea can help to lower blood pressure levels in people who have hypertension.

Green tea contains many powerful polyphenol antioxidants that are known for their health-protective benefits. One of green tea’s most powerful flavonoids, EGCG can counteract a variety of diseases and health conditions.

Study results also show EGCG can be helpful to prevent atherosclerosis, blood clots, heart attack, and strokes—partly because of its ability to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow.

A review of 25 different studies published in the British Journal of Nutrition showed that long-term tea drinking can significantly improve blood pressure. After 12 weeks of drinking tea, blood pressure was lower by 2.6 mm Hg systolic and 2.2 mm Hg diastolic. Green tea had the most significant results, while black tea performed better than no tea at all.

Best results occur when drinking about 3 to 4 cups of organic green tea a day. Adding a bit of citric acid like lemon juice can boost the amounts of antioxidants your body can absorb.

And finally, replace vegetable oil with this healthy fat to skyrocket your health.

Number 1. Olive Oil.

Olive oil has been shown to widen blood vessels, preventing high blood pressure. Studies have also found that it can reduce LDL cholesterol (the bad kind) and increase HDL cholesterol (the good kind).

Polyphenols found in extra virgin olive oil prevent atherosclerosis. They stop the oxidation of LDL accumulated on the wall of blood vessels. Polyphenols do this by capturing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and preventing their attack on blood vessels.

A study published in the journal “Archives of Internal Medicine” found that hypertensive patients who took 40 grams of olive oil per day reduced the dosage of blood pressure medication by 50%.

The arterial health benefits of olive oil are 99% related to the phenolic components, so it is important to choose high quality extra virgin olive oil.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/eat-crushed-garlic/,Eat Crushed Garlic to Clean Your Arteries and Prevent Heart Attack,"Garlic is widely used as a spice, but few people realize just how powerful a healing agent it is for cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Today, we look at how garlic can save your heart, and your life, through its ability to help prevent and treat atherosclerosis.

First, let’s briefly mention what is atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerosis is a disease where plaque, which is a build-up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances, forms inside the arteries. Over time, plaque can harden and narrow the arteries, which can limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the organs and the rest of the body. Sometimes, plaque breaks off and causes a blockage, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.

Garlic, in its raw and aged form, possesses 6 major therapeutic properties, that work together to treat and prevent atherosclerosis.
Number 6. Garlic helps protect the heart from calcification.

Garlic can help prevent too much calcium from building up in the arteries. When this happens, the arteries can become stiff and hard. This is called calcification. Calcium buildup in the heart’s two major arteries is known as “coronary artery calcification”.

A 2004 study from UCLA showed that patients on statin drugs who took aged garlic extract for one year had 3 times reduced progression of coronary artery calcification.

Another 2013 study published in the International Journal of Cardiology showed that supplement doses of aged garlic extract, B-12, folic acid, B6, and l-arginine over one year, increased the ratio of (active) brown fat to (inactive) white fat surrounding the heart muscle. More brown fat and less white fat around the heart means that the risk of calcification was reduced.

The authors concluded that garlic may be beneficial for patients who are at high risk of future cardiovascular events.

Number 5. Garlic helps slow the progress of atherosclerosis.

Studies done at UCLA found that the garlic and supplement mix mentioned earlier improved oxidative biomarkers, vascular health, and reduced the progress of atherosclerosis.

A 4-year clinical trial in Germany showed that garlic powder, when taken daily, reduced the volume of “arteriosclerotic plaque” by up to 18%, and the risk of heart attack and stroke by 50%.

In another 2016 study published in the Journal of Nutrition, patients with metabolic syndrome were given 2400 mg a day of aged garlic for 354 days.

Metabolic syndrome is a group of health problems that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, too much body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels. People with metabolic syndrome are at a much higher risk of heart attack and stroke. This condition often occurs together with atherosclerosis.

The clear conclusion of the study was that aged garlic prevented plaque buildup in the arteries.

Number 4. Garlic helps improve the cholesterol profile.

Garlic reliably reduces total cholesterol and Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL), while increasing High-density Lipoprotein (HDL), thus helping to prevent cholesterol from clogging the arteries.

Number 3. Garlic helps lower blood pressure.

High blood pressure is dangerous because it increases your risk of heart disease and stroke, often showing no symptoms until the damage has already been done.

When you eat a garlic-rich diet, it works to keep your blood pressure in check via several mechanisms.

First, garlic helps increase nitric oxide production in your cells by increasing the activity of an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase.

Nitric oxide is important for healthy blood flow because it helps your blood vessels to dilate or widen. If you don’t have enough nitric oxide, you are at risk for high blood pressure and heart disease.

Second, garlic may have a similar effect as popular blood pressure drugs by blocking the hormone angiotensin. This helps to keep blood vessels from narrowing.

Third, garlic helps your red blood cells produce hydrogen sulfide. This compound relaxes your blood vessels, which keeps your blood pressure in check.

Number 2. Garlic helps prevent blood clots.

Garlic contains sulfur compounds that help prevent platelets in the blood from sticking together. This lowers the risk of forming a blood clot and improves blood flow. However, this antiplatelet property of garlic may be a problem for people taking blood thinners, such as aspirin or other anticoagulants.

Number 1. Garlic helps reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.

Damage to blood vessel linings can be caused by unstable molecules called “free radicals. Too many free radicals can lead to oxidation stress, which leads to inflammation and a higher risk of plaque formation and clogging.

Garlic is an excellent source of antioxidants (including selenium, vitamin C, and quercetin), and sulfur compounds, which fight both oxidation and inflammation, making it easier for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body.

You probably already guessed by now that garlic’s cardioprotective properties have a lot to do with its sulfur-containing compounds, and you’re right!

Now, let’s look at what makes garlic so effective as a natural remedy.

Garlic is a member of the lily family and is rich in sulfur compounds-something it shares with onions, leeks, and chives, all of which are from the same family.

Garlic contains a molecule called allicin. When garlic is “disturbed” through chewing, slicing, or crushing, it releases allicin.

Allicin turns into a variety of fat and water-soluble sulfur-containing compounds. These compounds are so volatile that they give off hydrogen sulfide, which is part of garlic’s unmistakable smell and taste.

It is these sulfur compounds that help to prevent and treat atherosclerosis, and heart disease caused by diabetes. They also provide other health benefits like fighting infection and cancer, detoxifying heavy metals from the body, and preventing the common cold.

Next, how much garlic should you take daily?

The benefit of any garlic or aged garlic extract depends on how it’s processed.

One of the best ways to eat garlic is in its fresh, raw form. You can chop it or crush it with your teeth. Raw garlic has a strong taste, but you can reduce it by adding some avocado, tomato sauce, or olive oil. If you’re cooking with it, letting it sit for 10 minutes after chopping may help to preserve more of its health benefits.

This “stinking rose” is a simple and tasty addition to many dishes, and getting 3-6 cloves a day into your diet is an easy goal. For supplementation, most studies on garlic use a dosage range of 600-1,200mg a day, usually divided into multiple doses.

Aged garlic extract is a popular supplement because it doesn’t have a fresh garlic scent. It may have greater antioxidant benefits. However, garlic supplementation can be done through food alone.

Compared to drugs with side effects like statins, garlic is a powerful, time-tested, safe, affordable, and easily accessible natural healing agent with dozens of documented side benefits!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/liver-problems-symptoms/,These are 5 symptoms of liver problems your legs REVEAL,"You probably don’t think about your liver every day, but it is hard at work filtering blood, removing waste and producing bile – among other essential functions. When your liver becomes sick or injured, it can affect other parts of your body and throw your health into jeopardy.

In today’s video, we’ll go over 5 ways your feet can tip you off to a problem with your liver, and when it’s time to call the doctor. So, if you’re ready, let’s get into it!

Number 5. Swelling.

Liver cirrhosis is a medical term used to describe the late stage scarring of the liver. This chronic condition can be caused by injury, disease, alcohol abuse, and prescription drugs.

Unfortunately, liver cirrhosis doesn’t always show symptoms. One lesser known warning sign of liver cirrhosis is swelling in the legs, feet, or ankles. 

This happens because increased pressure in the portal vein can cause fluid to buildup in the legs and abdomen. The portal vein is the major vessel that drains the blood from the gut, gall bladder, pancreas, and spleen to the liver.

Individuals with liver cirrhosis may also suffer from fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, jaundice, nausea, and bleeding, or bruising. Some additional warning signs may include developing spider-like veins on the skin, redness on the palms of the hands, itchy skin, and more.

Other than cirrhosis, a buildup of fluid in your legs, ankles, or feet, could also be a symptom of one of several related liver conditions: hepatitis B, hepatitis C, fatty liver disease, or even liver cancer, according to experts at the Cleveland Clinic.

Number 4. Muscle Cramps.

When it comes to common signs of liver cirrhosis, muscle cramps are typically NOT one of them. However, a 2014 study published in The American Journal of Medicine, found that 67 percent of participants with cirrhosis, experienced muscle cramps three months prior to the study.

According to the researchers, muscle cramps were associated with significantly decreased quality of life in patients diagnosed with cirrhosis.

It is still unclear why cirrhosis patients in the study suffered from muscle cramps. Researchers suggest that a neurologic, muscular, endocrine, or electrolyte imbalance could be a plausible cause.

Number 3. Joint Pain.

Joint pain in your legs or any other parts of your body can be caused by a variety of different reasons. Sometimes, it can be caused by viral hepatitis, a type of liver inflammation that can occur as acute infections, or as a chronic condition.

If your joint pain is due to viral hepatitis, you’ll notice other symptoms including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, reduced appetite, jaundiced skin, dark urine, and general weakness.

Joint pain can come both from the illness that leads to cirrhosis, or cirrhosis can make the pain from existing conditions worse. For example, if you have fatty liver disease and are obese, you may also have osteoarthritis, says the Cleveland Clinic. And cirrhosis makes your bone and joint pain worse. Cirrhosis also causes inflammation in your entire body, which can lead to general pain.

Number 2. Spots on your Legs or Arms.

According to a report published in 2009 in the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine, changes in the skin are often the first clue that a person may have liver problems. And being able to recognize these signs is crucial to diagnosing liver conditions early.

One such skin symptom is Bier spots, which are characterized by irregularly shaped or mottled white spots that can develop on the legs, arms or hands. 

Most cases of Bier spots are benign and have no cause for concern. However, it is still a good idea to consult your doctor if you notice them, especially if you experience any other common liver symptoms.

Number 1. Tingling or numbness.

People with liver problems may experience tingling or numbness in their feet. This can be because of a hepatitis C infection, alcoholic liver disease, or diabetes. Diabetes is more common in people with liver problems because the liver regulates glucose levels. Any of these conditions can cause peripheral neuropathy, which damages the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord.

There you have it, the five ways your legs and feet can signal liver problems. Seek medical treatment if any of these symptoms do not go away after a few days of at-home treatment

https://dailyhealthpost.com/doctors-are-urging-you-to-stop-feeding-your-children-hot-dogs-heres-why/,Doctors Are Urging You To Stop Feeding Your Children Hot Dogs – Here’s Why,"Among American favorites is the Hot Dog – a fourth of July staple that’s eaten at least once a week in most households. Many Americans are so used to eating a certain way that they don’t realize that they’re making unhealthy choices and that those choices are affecting their kids. (Updated Mar 29, 2022)

However, a USC epidemiologist found that children who eat more than 12 hot dogs per month have nine times the normal risk of developing childhood leukemia (1).

And that’s not all, in another study, children who ate hot dogs one or more times per week were also at higher risk of brain cancer (2). The study examined the relationship between the intake of certain foods and the risk of leukemia in children from birth to age 10 in Los Angeles County between 1980 and 1987 (3).

It also concluded that there was a strong risk for childhood leukemia for children whose fathers’ intake of hot dogs was 12 or more per month before conception. This demonstrated in part that the dietary habits of parents before their child is born, as well as during pregnancy, can leave them more prone to disease.

In fact, researchers Sarusua and Savitz, who studied childhood cancer cases in Denver, found that children born to mothers who consumed hot dogs one or more times per week during pregnancy had approximately double the risk of developing brain tumors (2).

It’s been suggested that the nitrates contained in hot dogs are the cause of these health problems.

“Processed red meat commonly contains sodium, nitrates, phosphates and other food additives, and smoked and grilled meats also contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, all of which may contribute to the increased heart failure risk,” explains Alicja Wolk, D.M.Sc. (source)

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, these nitrates act as preservatives to prevent food from spoiling, and they also add colour to the meat.

Nitrites and nitrates are not cancer-causing by themselves, but in certain conditions in the body they can be changed into by-products called N-nitroso compounds, such as nitrosamines and nitrosamides. N-nitroso compounds are associated with an increased risk of cancer.

Vitamin C may be added to some preserved meats. Vitamin C keeps nitrites from changing into nitrosamines, which may help reduce the risk of cancer associated with these chemicals.

However, new cases of nitrate-caused cancers still appear at an alarming rate each year.

How To Avoid Nitrate-Filled Foods
Minimize your consumption of processed foods and cured meat products such as hot dogs, sausage and cold cuts.
Check labels carefully and avoid products that list sodium or potassium nitrates and nitrites. In addition to lunchmeat, some canned beans and vegetables with bacon, and even packaged seafood, may contain these added chemicals.
Eat organic food. Synthetic nitrates and nitrites are not allowed as preservatives in organic packaged foods and meats.
Find out if your water is tainted with nitrates or nitrites. Public drinking water utilities test for these compounds and must disclose their results. If you drink well water, your local health department can help you find out if this is a problem in your area. You can also have your water tested by a laboratory. If the chemicals are present, consider treating your water with a home water distiller, a reverse osmosis filter or an ion exchange filter to remove any fertilizer nitrates in the groundwater.
Eat a diet high in antioxidants. Vitamin C and certain other vitamins can reduce the conversion of nitrates and nitrites to nitrosamines. (source)

https://dailyhealthpost.com/early-signs-of-dementia/,Top 10 Early Signs of Dementia – REVERSE!,"Do you know that a person as young as 40 years can show signs of early dementia without even realizing it? Dementia is a progressive decline in brain function. Nerve cells in the brain die, weaken, or they lose connection to one another.

Harvard: Common Household Toxin Triggers Memory Loss

Many people think of dementia as “memory loss” associated with old age. That is true, especially in the early stages, but it goes much further than that.

If dementia is not reversed or slowed, it progresses to complete brain failure, resulting in death. It is not simply a mental disorder as many people often perceive.

Continue watching this video to discover 10 early warning signs of dementia. Stick around till the end to learn the underlying cause of dementia, and 10 steps to reverse or prevent cognitive impairment, according to science.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

First, let’s talk about Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent type of dementia worldwide, which accounts for over 60% of all dementia cases.

AD is caused by the buildup of proteins (amyloid and Tau), which leads to abnormal changes in the brain, resulting in a loss in cognition, memory, and reasoning.

It is the 6th leading cause of death for adults in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Alzheimer’s affects 10% of Americans over 65 years of age, and 50% of those over 85.

It’s important to know that dementia and Alzheimer’s does NOT suddenly occur once you’re older. It begins when you’re younger and takes decades to develop and worsen.

Other common types of dementia are vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD). The last one is the most diagnosed dementia under age 60.

Number 10. Memory loss that affects daily life.

Is the person you know, forgetting things more often or struggling to recall new information?

Some other signs include forgetting important dates or events, asking the same questions over and over, and needing to rely more on memory aids (e.g. reminder notes or electronic devices), or family members for things they used to do on their own.

Number 9. Challenges in planning or solving problems.

Is the person you know, having trouble following a favorite recipe or keeping track of monthly bills?

People with dementia may experience changes in their ability to develop and follow a plan or work with numbers. They may have difficulty concentrating and take much longer to do things than they did before.

Number 8. Difficulty completing familiar tasks.

Is the person you know, forgetting how to drive to a familiar place, make a grocery list, or play a favorite game?

People with dementia often find it hard to complete daily tasks like cooking or getting dressed.

Number 7. Disorientation to time and place.

Is the person you know, having problems knowing what day of the week or the season?

People with dementia may not understand something, if it is not happening right in front of them. They may also forget where they are or how they got there.

Number 6. Trouble understanding visual and spatial information.

Is the person you know, having problems seeing things correctly?

People with dementia may have problems with balance, reading, or judging distance. They may also find it difficult to determine color or contrast, which can cause issues when driving.

Number 5. New problems with words in speaking or writing.

Is the person you know, forgetting simple words or substituting words that don’t fit in a conversation?

People with dementia may have trouble following or joining a conversation. They may stop in the middle of a conversation and do not know how to continue, or they may repeat themselves.

Number 4. Misplacing things and unable to retrace steps.

Is the person you know, putting things in places where they shouldn’t be?

A person living with dementia may lose things, and cannot retrace their steps to find them again. For example, an iron in the freezer, or a watch in the sugar bowl.

Number 3. Impaired judgment.

Is the person you know, not recognizing something that can put health and safety at risk?

People with dementia may experience changes in judgment and decision-making. For example, they may make poor decisions about money or ignore their personal hygiene.

Number 2. Loss of Initiative.

Is the person you know, losing interest in family, friends, and favorite activities, and requires cues and prompting to get involved?

People with dementia may become passive and disinterested, because of changes in their ability to hold or follow a conversation.

Number 1. Changes in personality.

Is the person you know, showing mood swings and personality changes?

People with dementia may become confused, suspicious, sad, or nervous. They may get easily upset at home, with friends, or when out of their comfort zone.

Next, what is the underlying cause of dementia or Alzheimer’s?

The underlying causes of Alzheimer’s disease can be traced to the effects of too much sugar on the brain.

The cycle begins when you overindulge in sugar and don’t eat enough healthy fat. This leads to insulin resistance. You are most likely insulin resistant if you have high blood sugar, high triglycerides, and high LDL cholesterol.

Insulin resistance triggers inflammation, which creates a vicious cycle that wreaks havoc on the brain.

See our video, Top 13 Foods that Cause Inflammation.

Here are the 10 steps you can take to reverse or prevent dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Number 1. Balance your blood sugar with a whole-foods, low-glycemic diet.

You can achieve this and lose weight by taking out the inflammatory bad stuff (refined carbs, sugar, alcohol, processed foods, dairy, and omega-6 rich oils such as vegetable and seed oils). And replace with the anti-inflammatory good stuff (healthy fats like avocados, walnuts, almonds and cashews, olive and coconut oil, grass-fed meats, and pastured chicken and eggs).

Number 2. Consume healthy fats that make your brain happy.

These include omega-3 fats in wild fatty fish, as well as coconut oil, extra-virgin olive oil, avocados, pastured whole eggs, nuts, and seeds.

Number 3. Exercise daily.

Even a 30-minute walk, run or dance can help. Incorporate high-intensity interval training or weight lifting into your weekly routine. Studies show physical activity can prevent and even slow down the decline of cognitive function.

This is because exercise increases the level of a protein called Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which increases the lifespan of neurons by repairing and protecting the brain cells (11).

Number 4. Supplement wisely.

Take an omega-3 supplement, extra B6, B12, and folate, as well as vitamin D3. Also, a good probiotic will enhance the brain-gut connection. Other nutrients shown in studies to slow or reverse the progress of dementia, include alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), curcumin, and Vitamin E.

Number 5. Check your thyroid and sex hormone levels.

If they are out of balance, you’ll want to treat them. Thyroid dysfunction and low levels of estrogen and testosterone are associated with an increased risk of dementia.

Number 6. Detox from mercury, aluminum, or other heavy metals.

Aluminum and fluoride in drinking water have been associated with an increased incidence of Alzheimer’s. If you have high levels, detox by using cilantro and chlorella or find a chelation therapy program. Avoid exposure to items with hazardous toxins such as cosmetics, gasoline, and household cleaners.

Number 7. Control stress levels.

Chronic stress can hurt your body and brain. Relaxation isn’t a luxury if you want to avoid or reverse dementia. Find something that helps you relax, whether it’s deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.

Number 8. Get 8 hours of sleep every night.

Studies show poor sleep becomes a risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. Aim for at least 8 hours of quality sleep every night.

Number 9. Do intermittent fasting.

A new study published by the Journal of Alzheimer’s Association explains that fasting can help reverse cognitive decline (13). This happens because fasting for at least 12 hours forces the body to use ketones for energy instead of glucose, which leads to reduced brain inflammation and increased cell regeneration. See our video “Intermittent Fasting for Beginners.”

Number 10. Build strong brain connections.

A study published in the Lancet shows that less education, social isolation, and hearing loss are strongly correlated with the onset of dementia (8).

A person who is not building strong mental connections makes it easier for dementia to progress. Those at risk should play musical instruments, crossword puzzles, games of strategy, and read more (9).

If you suspect that someone you know might have early signs of dementia, make sure they see a doctor for a diagnosis.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/poor-circulation-in-legs-and-feet/,Top 5 Ways Poor Circulation in Legs and Feet REVEAL Heart Trouble,"Do you know that right now, your feet could be sending you warning signals to pay attention to your heart?

When you think about cardiovascular health, your feet are probably not the first thing that springs to mind.

But even though they couldn’t be further from your heart, your feet can alert you to cardiac issues!

So, make sure to watch this video till the end, to discover 5 surprising ways, poor blood circulation in your legs and feet, can reveal heart trouble.

Also, stick around for a Special Gift that will help you clean out your arteries and significantly lower blood-flow risks.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Number 5. Change in Hair Growth.

When was the last time you paid attention to the hair on your toes?

Just like the hair on your head can tell you if you’re malnourished, the hair on your feet can tell you how your overall circulation is doing.

If you’ve always had hairier toes, and then suddenly notice thinning or complete loss of hair on the toes, you may want to see your doctor.

Hair on the toes, especially your big toe, is completely normal, and actually is a sign of good blood flow to your feet.

If suddenly you notice you haven’t had to shave your toes as frequently as before, then you need to pay attention.

Loss of hair on your feet and toes may be a warning sign of poor circulation. This can be due to decreased blood flow in the smaller vessels in your feet.

Decreased circulation in your toes and feet, may indicate vascular disease or atherosclerosis. Or, it could be a sign that your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it used to.

Either way, hairless toes could be a signal that your heart is in trouble.

Number 4. Swelling in Your Feet.

Swollen feet and ankles is a condition that many seniors have and ignore. This is a BIG mistake.

If you sit down, remove your socks & shoes, and it looks like the narrow band of the sock is still there…then something’s not right.

Or, if you reach down and push down on your foot, ankle, or lower shinbone, and when you take your finger away, your finger depression is still there…that’s abnormal.

And if you experience constant aching and discomfort in your feet even when you’ve tried everything – normal exercise, drink enough water, and wear supportive shoes – the problem isn’t just annoying; it’s also potentially dangerous.

These symptoms point to circulation issues causing blood and fluid to pool in the tissue around your feet and ankles.

And could result in serious clots or devastating cardiac events.

Swelling, or edema in your feet and ankles, could be caused by a number of things.

It could mean that your heart isn’t circulating blood properly, there’s a vein blockage in your leg, or that you’re suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF), liver cirrhosis, or kidney disease.

Swollen legs can also be caused by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — a condition in which clots form in the blood vessels that drain blood from the legs.

Another likely cause of swelling is chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a disease in which blood does not properly drain from the legs.

People with venous insufficiency suffer from severe swelling at the end of the day.

This condition can be eased by raising the legs up against the wall for 20 minutes, 1 to 3 times a day, doing seated chair exercises, or wearing compression socks.

For stretches and other ways to increase blood circulation, see our video, “Top 8 Ways to Improve Blood Flow to Legs and Feet.”

Do not dismiss swollen feet and ankles as just a new symptom of growing older. If you notice swelling, call your doctor right away.

Number 3. Cold Feet.

Are your feet and hands always freezing? Do you live in fuzzy, comfortable socks?

Do your legs feel persistently heavy, and do you experience painful cramps when you walk?

If you answered yes to any of these, it may be time for a doctor’s visit.

Reduced circulation in the extremities and nerve damage owing to atherosclerosis are two of the most common issues that cause cold feet.

In atherosclerosis, arteries are narrowed by fatty deposits known as plaque that impede blood flow in the limbs. This is a chronic condition known as peripheral artery disease or PAD, which is one type of peripheral vascular disease.

PAD becomes more common as a person gets older, and by the age of 65, about 12 to 20% of the population have it. People with PAD have 4 to 5 times the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Since your feet are the farthest body part away from your heart, they are often the first to show signs of poor blood circulation.

For the best foods that increase blood flow, see our video, “Top 10 Foods That Improve Blood Circulation in Legs”.

Number 2. Blue Feet or Toes.

Just like cold feet may be a sign of poor circulation, so can blue or purple toenails.

If you have a bluish tint to your toes or feet, that is not caused by a recent injury, this can indicate cyanosis. This condition occurs when your blood isn’t carrying enough oxygen to your muscles, organs, and other tissues.

Cyanosis can point to several serious issues, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension (a complication of COPD), and congestive heart failure.

If you notice your toes turn blue, and you have difficulty breathing, seek treatment immediately.

Number 1. Burning Pain.

Burning pain, tingling, and numbness in your feet may be a sign of nerve damage. Nerve damage may be caused by PAD, swelling in your feet, or peripheral neuropathy because of diabetes.

This condition can be tough to live with, and cause a lot of distress. It isn’t something to be taken lightly.

Burning pain should always be checked out, because you may also have areas of your feet, that have become numb without your knowledge. This can lead to foot ulcers, and wounds that are difficult to heal.

To get a list of nutrients that help reverse neuropathy, see our video, “11 Best Vitamins for Your Nerves”.

There you have it! The 5 signs of poor circulation in your legs and feet that reveal that your heart is in trouble.

You already know that avoiding tobacco, eating a balanced diet, and staying active are things you can do to keep your heart healthy.

Now, add monitoring your legs and feet to the list!

That’s because no matter how long you’ve been a smoker – whether 30 days or 30 years – your body CAN recover from the toxic chemicals you’ve inhaled.

You see, smoking cigarettes is one of the unhealthiest things you can do to your body. Cigarettes have been linked to lung, throat, and mouth cancer and have been proven to increase a person’s risk for heart troubles and respiratory difficulties.

And because of the addictive qualities of nicotine, stopping the habit of smoking cigarettes can be especially hard for some people.

Some lack the motivation, others easily relapse thanks to stress or other factors and then have to restart the whole quitting process again. But for the most part many probably do not understand just how much healthier their lives would be if they learned how to stop smoking, for good.

Unfortunately, you should note that there are some setbacks that may occur when quitting, most notably these 4 effects of withdrawal.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 22, 2022"

Incorporating these ingredients into your diet will help your heart, brain, and skin stay as healthy as possible. The best anti-aging foods everyone over 40 should eat include: (Updated May 19, 2022)

#1 Spinach

One of the vitamins we rarely hear about is vitamin K, which improves bone density and strength.

Leafy greens, such as spinach, are primary sources of vitamin K and a single serving is over one-and-a-half times your daily requirement of the vitamin.

Aside from strengthening your skeleton, spinach also provides nutrients to keep your eyesight healthy.

#2 Protein

Instead of simply looking at what foods you consume, it’s important to consider your key dietary components as well.

Since metabolism slows with age, it’s critical to eat sources rich in protein to protect muscle mass and prevent unnecessary weight gain.

Eggs, skinless chicken, and wild salmon are excellent sources of protein that are easy to consume.

#3 Almonds

Though all nuts are generally healthy, almonds top the list. Numerous medical studies reveal that a single serving of almonds every day will lower LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.

Since fat calories are disproportionately high in nuts, we recommend eating them by the dozen per day.

#4 Broccoli

Rich with vitamins A, C, and K, broccoli is an excellent low-calorie food that is filled with phytochemicals.

This keeps cells in your body healthy and prevents them from becoming cancerous. Broccoli also contains lutein and zeaxanthin, which help prevent cataracts in the eyes.

#5 Water

Are you getting your full eight glasses of water every day? Water is not only critical for hydration, but also helps your body naturally flush out toxins, rejuvenate its skin, and efficiently fulfill internal functions.

#6 Avocado

Considered one of the “super foods” of the world, avocado is rich in the vitamins and nutrients needed to keep the body as healthy as possible.

Similar to nuts, however, guacamole is high in fat calories, so be sure to be conscious about your intake!

#7 Spices

If you open your spice cabinet right now, you may find ginger, paprika, and cayenne pepper.

These are incredibly delicious on our foods, but did you know that they’re filled with anti-aging benefits as well?

These can lower blood sugar levels and cholesterol. By fighting high blood pressure, they improve circulation throughout the body.

#8 Coconut Oil

Pound for pound, coconut oil is one of the single most nutritious superfoods you can put in your body.

It has a vast array of incredible health benefits.

These include but are not limited to healthier skin and hair, lower cholesterol levels, weight loss, increased levels of immunity, proper digestion and metabolism.

#9 Olive oil

Cultures where olive oil is a part of daily diets tend to have longer lifespans than the average American’s.

This is because olive oil contains oleocanthal, which is a natural anti-inflammatory ingredient that keeps the heart healthy. Just like any other oil, olive oil should be consumed in moderation.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 19, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-heal-cavities-naturally/,How to Heal Cavities Naturally,"The world is slowly waking up to the fact that, when you give the body what it needs, it can heal things we previously thought were impossible. (Updated May 18, 2022)

A fine example of what is often deemed as an incurable health problem is dental cavities, but extensive research is now becoming more public about the true nature of tooth decay and the fact that there are proven remedies that can remedy it.

The lies perpetrated about tooth decay

According to the American Dental Association, the reason we have tooth decay is as follows:

“[Tooth decay] occurs when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches) such as milk, pop, raisins, cakes or candy are frequently left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in the mouth thrive on these foods, producing acids as a result. Over a period of time, these acids destroy tooth enamel, resulting in tooth decay.”

There are a few problems with this theory, including:

Groups of indigenous people who had fermentable carbohydrates stuck on their teeth all the time that did not brush or floss were mostly or completely free of tooth decay.
Bacteria do not consume processed sugar or flour because of the lack of nutrients in them.
Foods that bacteria like to eat, such as milk, vegetables, meat, fish and fruit, are not commonly implicated in causes of tooth decay.

So if the modern explanation of tooth decay is not accurate, what is actually the cause of tooth decay?

What actually causes tooth decay

Tooth decay, as researched by Dr. Weston Price and other dental pioneers, boiled down to three factors:

Not enough minerals in the diet.
Not enough fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) in the diet.
Nutrients not being readily bioavailable, and your intestinal system not properly absorbing them. The presence of phytic acid largely influences this factor.

Over a period of time, if your diet lacks vitamins and minerals from a poor diet and/or contains high levels of phytates (from grains, seeds, nuts, and legumes), the blood chemistry and the ratio of calcium and phosphorous become out of balance, which results in minerals being pulled from bones, causing tooth and bone loss.

So, the long-standing belief that sugar causes tooth decay is true, but as a result of it depleting nutrients from the body, not because bacteria eat it and produce acid that ruins your teeth.

The food remedies that can heal cavities and tooth decay

In order to restore the ratio of calcium and phosphorus in our blood, and to enable minerals to bond to our teeth, it is not enough to just avoid eating too many sweet or processed foods.

We must also eat health-building foods, containing copious amounts of minerals and vitamins that will build a glassy hard tooth structure.

Foods to focus on are:

Coconut oil, grass-fed organic dairy (especially butter), grass-fed meats, seafood and bone broths.
Organic cooked vegetables (soups with bone broth are ideal).
Organ and gland meats, like liver.

Limit foods that are high in phytic acid, like grains, beans, nuts and seeds, as well as limiting processed food intake full of processed flours and sugars that upset blood sugar balance.

Supplements to consider are:

Fermented cod liver oil – very high in fat soluble vitamins A, D and K.
Magnesium – required to use calcium and phosphorous effectively.
Gelatin – if you don’t have time to make bone broth, this is a good alternative and is great for gums and digestion.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/this-sugar-free-drink-can-triple-your-stroke-risk/,This Sugar-Free Drink Can Triple Your Stroke Risk,"According to the American Heart Association (AHA), about 75 percent of patients who had a stroke for the first time have high blood pressure. Because of this correlation, doctors strongly advise patients to focus on lowering their blood pressure to decrease their risk of stroke.

However, lowering your blood pressure is not the only risk factor for stroke. Researchers have discovered a common drink that most people think is healthy is in reality associated with an increased risk of stroke and dementia.

This study was done by scientists from the Boston University School of Medicine in 2017.

The team examined the effect of artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) on the health of adults over the age of 45 for an extended period. About three thousand participants took part in this study. The team measured their daily beverage consumption via the food-frequency questionnaire for ten years.

The Boston researchers’ result showed that people who drank a minimum of one diet soda a day had two times the risk of stroke compared to the group who did not drink the beverage.

Upon further analysis, the team also found that the diet soda drinkers had a three-times increased risk of experiencing an ischemic stroke attack.

The scientists behind this study noted that their findings add to the growing evidence that suggests ASBs significantly increases a person’s risk of stroke especially ischemic stroke.

The team analyzed about 1,500 people over the age of 60 for the effect of diet soda consumption on dementia. The result shows that drinking even one soda a day can increase a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease.

The team also pointed out that this study was the first of its kind to show a strong correlation between drinking diet soda and dementia caused by Alzheimer’s and other forms of the disease. They also explained that more research needs to be done to help experts understand the causal link of diet soda.

Ralph Sacco, former president of AHA, commented that the result of this study is of great concern because diet soda is marketed as a healthier alternative to sugary beverages. And Sacco also said there is a growing number of studies that shows that despite popular belief both sugary and artificially sweetened drinks could harm the brain.

He explains further that major governing bodies such as the AHA have approved the replacement of sugar with artificial sweeteners to manage diabetes, high blood sugar, and other metabolic syndromes without fully understanding the health effects.

It is worth noting that the American Heart Association has acknowledged the findings of the Boston study.

According to AHA, various studies have linked artificially sweetened beverages to obesity, stroke, vascular diseases, and heart attack.

The Boston team highlights that they did not find a correlation between drinking sugary beverages and stroke or dementia. The reason for this result could be that the daily consumption of regular soda is not as high as diet soda, explains the lead scientist of this study, Dr. Matthew Pase.

He also warns that people should not use this result as evidence that sugary drinks are healthier than diet soda.

Nutritionist Rachel K. Johnson from the University of Vermont commented that people should focus more on reducing added sugar for better weight management and improved nutrition. And that artificially sweetened drinks should be consumed sparingly till there’s further evidence that proves their health effects. She added that it is best for people who want to manage diabetes or obesity to consume water, low-fat milk, or other sugar-free drinks.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 16, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/your-hands-reveal-5-heart-disease-symptoms/,Your Hands REVEAL 5 Heart Disease Symptoms,"Did you know paying attention to your hands can help you prevent heart disease? Research shows that your hands are one of the most overlooked organs that signal problems with your heart (1). 

Recent worldwide statistics show that over 30% of deaths are caused by heart disease (2). In fact, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), someone suffers from a heart attack every forty seconds in the United States (3). 

You would think that such a deadly disease has many warning signs, but it does not. A new survey by American researchers found that over 63% of people believe it’s likely they will suffer from heart disease within the next 10 years (4). 

Even though everyone sees their hands all the time, most people don’t notice when they are signaling a serious health problem such as cardiovascular disease.

In this article, you’ll learn five easily ignored signs on your hands that could warn you of heart trouble. 

5. Painful Finger Bumps

Lumps on the fingers, especially at the tip, that are tender, purple-pink, and painful, are called Osler’s nodes (5). These lumps could be a sign of infective endocarditis – a life-threatening inflammation of the cardiovascular system.

A bacterial infection that spreads into your heart and blood vessels could lead to endocarditis. If you notice painful lumps on your fingers, you should not ignore them, because doing so might cause irreversible damage to your heart. 

A report by Krishan Parashar from Wayne State University School of Medicine explains that Osler’s nodes develop as a result of inflammation in the blood vessel (6). This leads to bacterial infection in the dermis (the middle layer of the skin), which causes increased inflammation in the cardiovascular system 

Osler’s nodes may disappear on their own within a couple of days. But this does not mean it’s harmless (7).

See a doctor for a skin biopsy if you suspect that the lumps on your fingers are Osler’s nodes. You can also consult a cardiologist to determine if the bump is related to a heart condition.

4. Reddish-brown or purple lines on nails

Red or purple lines underneath your nail (nail bed) are a common symptom of splinter hemorrhages. This condition results from damaged blood vessels on your fingernails (8). And it could be a sign of heart-related issues. 

According to the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AAD), splinter hemorrhages, alongside fever and irregular heartbeat, could be signs of heart disease (10).

A paper published by researchers from Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York explains multiple lines on your nails could show a serious health problem (9). 

Splinter hemorrhaging occurs because of bleeding in the blood vessels underneath your nails. This could be caused by trauma or bacterial infection that has spread into the cardiovascular system, says the New England Journal of Medicine (8). 

3. Fingernails clubbing 

Even though you probably never heard of the term clubbing, Andrew Jamieson MB, Ph.D., says that it’s a common condition (10).

People who have clubbing experience enlarged fingernails, soft nail beds, and downward-curved nails. It usually occurs when oxygen in the blood is low (11). 

One of the major causes of clubbing is infective endocarditis, which is a bacterial infection of the heart chamber and valves. 

According to a paper by Amber S. Tully MD, clubbing is diagnosed when “the angle that forms between the nail plate and the soft tissue of the distal digit is greater than 180 degrees” (12).

While this condition is common in people with birth defects, it can also occur because of heart disease, osteoarthritis, and lung disease. 

If clubbing is caused by heart disease, the symptoms will begin in the thumb and index fingers. 

This disease develops quickly, but can be healed easily once the underlying cause has been treated. If you notice your fingernails are bulging, see a medical physician as soon as possible.

2. Weak, tingling, and waxy hands

Amyloidosis is a rare condition that is characterized by numbness, pain, weakness, and wax-like bumps on the hands. It develops as a result of the buildup of an irregular protein called amyloid (13). 

When amyloid deposits increase in the heart, it replaces the heart muscles, which causes Cardiac Amyloidosis (stiff heart syndrome). This condition makes it difficult for the heart to function properly. And it might lead to cardiovascular cell signaling problems and abnormal heartbeat. 

The American Heart Association (AHA) journal explains that Cardiac amyloidosis reduces the amount of blood that flows into the heart; this leads to a slowdown of blood circulation in the body (14).

Because the blood supply is low, the amount of oxygen your hands receive is reduced, which causes wax-like hands, pain, and a weak grip. 

If you notice any of these symptoms on your hands, contact your physician without hesitation, as your heart might be in danger.

1. Colored spots on the palms

Harvard Medical School Professor MD Jatin Vyas explains that bluish-red or brown painless patches on the palms are called Janeway lesions (15). 

This condition is caused by blood clots containing bacteria (septic emboli) that lead to infection in the circulatory system. 

Janeway lesions develop and disappear quickly (often within days), which means most people will not notice them (16, 17). That is why you need to consult a doctor as soon as you see discoloration on your palms to test if you have a heart problem.

While most people will only visit a doctor when they feel sick, it is always better to prevent an illness than to cure it, especially heart-related issues. 

A study published in Clinical Cardiology shows that 80% of heart-related problems can be prevented by avoiding harmful lifestyle choices. The team adds that diet, weight, and cigarette smoking significantly increase a person’s risk of cardiovascular disease (18). 

This means that you can reduce your risk of heart problems by modifying your lifestyle and paying attention to your body, especially your hands. 

It is also important to visit your physician regularly for routine checkups. You should speak to your doctor about your diet, lifestyle, body symptoms, and any other health concerns you may have.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/reading-on-your-smartphone-lowers-reading-comprehension-study-finds/,"Reading on your smartphone lowers reading comprehension, study finds","Do you feel like you are constantly on your phone? Do you also feel like you never can remember anything you’ve read? If so, these two variables may be connected. A recent study published in Scientific Reports suggests that reading documents, books, and other texts on your phone may actually be leading to poor comprehension skills.

Negative Effects of Smartphones

Smartphones have changed the way our society interacts with each other. People have gone from only having a landline with an answering machine to carrying a personal phone with them 24/7.

Although convenient, constantly looking at your smartphone can lead to eye strain, headaches, and may even lead to poor comprehension.

Scientists behind this new study split their subjects into two groups. One group read texts off of a smartphone, and the second group read texts off of an actual piece of paper.

After reading, the two groups took a comprehension test to determine what they had and hadn’t learned. Plus, each participant was also hooked up to a functional near-infrared spectroscopy headband to measure the activity of their prefrontal cortex.

Findings of this radical study showed that students who read on paper had much better comprehension than those that read on their smartphones. This result has been consistent with previous studies that compared similar variables.

Interestingly, the study also revealed increased prefrontal cortex activity while students were reading on a smartphone versus reading on actual paper. This may suggest that reading from a smartphone is associated with an increase in cognitive load.

Deep Breathing as a Way to Increase Comprehension

So how can you increase your comprehension if you spend a lot of time on your smartphone? One great way to do this, is to breathe.

Sighing, or breathing deeply, has long been known to have a positive effect on cognitive function. A single sigh is defined as a breath that is twice as deep as an average breath during a normal respiratory cycle. By sighing, you can increase the oxygenation in your blood and promote improved blood flow to your vital organs, including your brain.

While completing this study, researchers actually found previous studies that looked at the impact of increased sighing and cognitive tasks. They found that sighing can increased a person’s cognition and lead to better comprehension.

So the next time you are trying to read something important for work or school on your smartphone, take a few deep breaths. Incorporating breath work into your reading routine, may lead to improved cognition and improved comprehension.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 13, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/doing-this-for-30-minutes-a-week-lowers-risk-of-death-from-all-causes/,Doing this for 30 minutes a week lowers risk of death from all causes,"Can lifting weights lead to longevity? According to recent research out of Japan, the answer is yes. A large-scale systematic review from the Department of Medicine and Science in Sports in Exercise at the Tohoku University looked at the association between muscle-strengthening activities and the risk of mortality in non-communicable diseases.

This review followed 16 different studies from around the world to determine if there was an association between muscle-strengthening activities and overall health.

Physical Activity as a Measurement of Health

Physical inactivity is a major health issue across the globe, leading to higher obesity rates and worsening health in many countries.

While physicians and scientists all over the world have always touted that exercise is healthy, this study looked specifically at muscle-strengthening exercise such as lifting weights or using resistance bands.

Aerobic exercise, or exercise that increases your heart rate, have been heavily studied for its health benefits in recent years. However, muscle-strengthening exercise is often pushed to the side as the lesser important variable.

This large scale study may change the way that physicians and scientists think about aerobic and muscle-strengthening exercise in terms of health benefits.

Weight Lifting Benefits

Researchers found that muscle-strengthening activities were associated with a 10-17% lower risk of mortality from certain non-communicable diseases.

So what is a non-communicable disease? In simple terms, it’s a disease that isn’t contagious.

Examples of non-communicable diseases that researchers specifically studied includes cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes.

Researchers found that approximately 30-60 minutes per week of muscle-strengthening activities could lead to a reduction in mortality. This means, that simply one weight lifting session per week could decrease your risk of mortality by up to 17% from the aforementioned diseases.

Incorporating Weight Lifting Into Your Weekly Routine

Like any new form of physical activity, it’s best start slow and easy, and then work your way up to harder and longer routines. Incorporating both aerobic and weight strengthening exercises into your weekly routine can help improve your overall physical and mental health.

If the gym intimidates you, then try a few exercises with free weights or even items you have around your home. Canned goods, books, and even milk jugs can act as the perfect weights for many exercises.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 12, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/this-supplement-boosts-cancer-treatments-ability-to-fight-disease/,This supplement boosts cancer treatments’ ability to fight disease,"Findings from a new study performed in mice suggest that omega-3 fatty acids could help immunotherapy and other treatments do a better job at fighting cancer. Immunotherapies, which stimulate the body’s own immune system to attack cancer, have revolutionized cancer treatment, but they don’t work for every patient.

“Dietary interventions can be powerful tools because they are relatively simple and inexpensive to implement,” said Abigail Kelly, a research assistant at Harvard Medical School’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “Our findings show that omega-3 supplementation has the potential to broadly improve immunotherapy and other anti-cancer drugs in the clinical setting.”

Omega-3 vs Omega-6

Research from various laboratories has suggested that omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce cancer risk whereas consuming too much omega-6 fatty acids can stimulate cancer. Sources of omega-3s include fish, nuts and seeds while omegas-6s are found in meats, eggs and other foods.

In the new studies, Kelly and senior author Dipak Panigraphy wanted to find out how diets supplemented with these fatty acids affected the anti-tumor activity of immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and an anti-inflammatory therapy that inhibits the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). The immunotherapy has regulatory approval and is being used clinically while the anti-inflammatory therapy is undergoing clinical development.

The researchers used state-of-the-art mouse models of primary and metastatic tumors for the new study. They began by feeding the mice either a standard diet or a diet high in omega-3 or 6 for 10 days prior to tumor injection and for the duration of the studies. One week after the tumors were injected, mice in each diet group were started on immunotherapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, both therapies together, or no treatment.

The researchers found that dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation blocked tumor growth in mice treated with immunotherapy, sEH inhibitor, or both treatments used together. In contrast, mice on the high-omega-6 diet and given immunotherapy experienced accelerated tumor growth in certain tumor types.

In mice receiving the high omega-3 diet and both cancer treatments, up to 67 percent of tumor growth was inhibited compared to mice receiving no treatment and a normal diet. This indicates possible synergistic anti-tumor activity, meaning that the combined effect may be greater than the sum of its parts.

“We demonstrated, for the first time, that the combination of immunotherapy and anti-inflammatory treatment (sEHi) was more effective when mice were fed diets enriched with omega-3 fatty acids,” said Kelly. “This is very promising because dietary supplementation is easy to implement for cancer patients and can be added for patients already on immunotherapy.”

The researchers are now performing additional studies to determine the mechanism of action of the potentially synergistic anti-tumor activity imparted by omega-3 supplementation. They are conducting these studies with human cancer tissues and cells, human immune cells and animal models to aid with translation to cancer patients. These new results from Kelly and colleagues may represent a new treatment approach that remains to be evaluated in humans.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 11, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/fecal-transplants-reverse-signs-of-aging-in-the-gut-eyes-and-brain/,"Fecal transplants reverse signs of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain","In the search for eternal youth, fecal transplants may seem like an unlikely way to reverse the aging process. However, scientists at the Quadram Institute and the University of East Anglia have found that transplanting faecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain.

In the study, transferring microbes from aged mice into younger mice induced inflammation in the brain of the recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision.

These findings show that gut microbes play a role in regulating some of the detrimental effects of aging and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.

Prof Simon Carding, from UEA’s Norwich Medical School and head of the Gut Microbes and Health Research Programme at the Quadram Institute, said: “This ground-breaking study provides tantalizing evidence for the direct involvement of gut microbes in aging and the functional decline of brain function and vision and offers a potential solution in the form of gut microbe replacement therapy.”

Gut Microbes Linked to Health

It has been known for some time that the population of microbes that we carry around in our gut, collectively called the gut microbiota, is linked to health. Most diseases are associated with changes in the types and behaviour of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes in an individual’s gut.

Some of these changes in microbiota composition happen as we age, adversely affecting metabolism and immunity, and this has been associated with age-related disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases, along with cardiovascular, autoimmune, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders.

To better understand the effects of these changes in the microbiota in old age, scientists from the Quadram Institute transferred the gut microbes from aged mice into healthy young mice, and vice versa. They then looked at how this affected inflammatory hallmarks of aging in the gut, brain and eye, which suffer from declining function in later life.

The study, published in the journal Microbiome, found that the microbiota from old donors led to loss of integrity of the lining of the gut, allowing bacterial products to cross into the circulation, which results in triggering the immune system and inflammation in the brain and eyes.

Age-related chronic inflammation, known as “inflammaging,” has been associated with the activation of specific immune cells found in brain. These cells were also over-activated in the young mice who received aged microbiome transplants.

In the eye, the team also found specific proteins associated with retinal degeneration were elevated in the young mice receiving microbiota from old donors.

In old mice, these detrimental changes in the gut, eye and brain could be reversed by transplanting the gut microbiota from young mice.

In ongoing studies, the team are now working to understand how long these positive effects can last, and to identify the beneficial components of the young donor microbiota and how they impact other organs distant from the gut.

The microbiota of young mice, and the old mice who received young microbiota transplants were enriched in beneficial bacteria that have previously been associated with good health in both mice and humans.

The researchers have also analyzed the products which these bacteria produce by breaking down elements of our diet. This has uncovered significant shifts in particular lipids (fats) and vitamin metabolism, which may be linked to the changes seen in inflammatory cells in the eye and brain.

Similar pathways exist in humans, and the human gut microbiota also changes significantly in later life, but the researchers caution about extrapolating their results directly to humans until similar studies in elderly humans can be performed.

A new facility for Microbiota Replacement Therapy (MRT), also known as Faecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is being built in the Quadram Institute that will facilitate such trials, as well as other trials for microbiota-related conditions.

Lead author of the study, Dr Aimee Parker from the Quadram Institute said: “We were excited to find that by changing the gut microbiota of elderly individuals, we could rescue indicators of age-associated decline commonly seen in degenerative conditions of the eye and brain.

“Our results provide more evidence of the important links between microbes in the gut and healthy aging of tissues and organs around the body. We hope that our findings will contribute ultimately to understanding how we can manipulate our diet and our gut bacteria to maximize good health in later life.”",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 10, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/ibuprofen-may-cause-permanent-kidney-damage-if-you-do-this/,Ibuprofen may cause permanent kidney damage if you do this,"Anyone who is taking a diuretic and a renin-angiotensin system (RSA) inhibitor for high blood pressure should be cautious about also taking ibuprofen, according to a new study.

Diuretics and RSA inhibitors are usually prescribed together for people with hypertension and are available under various pharmaceutical brand names. Painkillers such as ibuprofen are available over-the-counter in most pharmacies and stores.

Researchers at the University of Waterloo used computer-simulated drug trials to model the interactions of the three drugs and the impact on the kidney. They found that in people with certain medical profiles, the combination can cause acute kidney injury, which in some cases can be permanent.

“It’s not that everyone who happens to take this combination of drugs is going to have problems,” said Anita Layton, professor of applied mathematics at Waterloo and Canada 150 Research Chair in mathematical biology and medicine. “But the research shows it’s enough of a problem that you should exercise caution.”

Computer-simulated drug trials can quickly produce results that would take much longer in human clinical trials. Layton and her team use mathematics and computer science to give medical practitioners a head start with issues like drug complications.

The research, in this case, can also speak directly to the many people who are taking drugs for hypertension and may reach for a painkiller with ibuprofen without giving it much thought.

“Diuretics are a family of drugs that make the body hold less water,” Layton said. “Being dehydrated is a major factor in acute kidney injury, and then the RAS inhibitor and ibuprofen hit the kidney with this triple whammy. If you happen to be on these hypertension drugs and need a painkiller, consider acetaminophen instead.”",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 9, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/scientists-bring-hope-to-multiple-sclerosis-patients-with-new-t-cell-therapy/,Scientists bring hope to multiple sclerosis patients with new T-cell therapy,"Recent findings that were presented at an investor meeting early this year found that immune cells that fight against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have the potential to slow down or reverse the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS).

According to epidemiological studies, more than 90% of people worldwide have been infected with EBV at some point in their life, usually with no ill effects.

Because EBV can survive in the body for a long time by being dormant, it can be difficult to detect. The virus has the ability to become active from time to time. Meaning an infected individual could experience symptoms repeatedly. 

The study was conducted by Atara Biotherapeutics; a company located in San Francisco, California.

Atara’s chief medical officer, Dr. Joshi explained that there is strong evidence that shows EBV infection plays a major role in the development of MS. In fact, Harvard scientists previously found that people with Epstein-Barr virus have 32 times increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. 

In this study, Atara’s team conducted a trial with a small group of 24 MS patients by injecting them with T-cells that target the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). 

MS remains a mysterious disease. It occurs when the immune system is attacking the nerve cells thereby causing symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and mobility problems. 

Experts have not been able to fully understand MS even though it affects about 900,000 people in the US and 130,000 brits. 

There is currently no known cure for MS. It is a chronic illness that can only be managed with medication and physical therapy. 

One in ten patients experiences progressive MS. This means some people with multiple sclerosis get worsening symptoms over time leading to their condition deteriorating. 

People with progressive MS have very few available treatment options.

To help such people, Atara’s team used T-cells therapy to target MS development. 

This therapy involves the extracting of Immune cells called ATA188 from people who have recovered from glandular fever caused by the Epstein-Barr virus infection. After isolation, the cells were given as an injection to MS patients. 

Atara Biotherapeutics did the drug trial on 24 multiple sclerosis sufferers for one year in 2017. 

The participants came from all over the US and Australia. Different doses of the T-cell therapy treatment were given to the patients to evaluate its effects. 

To ensure compatibility, the team crossmatched the donated samples of the recovered EBV participants with the blood of the MS patients. 

After the initial trial, 18 people chose to continue the therapy for three or more years till August 2021. 

The scientist in this study examined scans of nerve damage in the brain (caused by MS). They also used the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) to test and measure the physical symptoms of MS patients.

While the study did not specify the dose and frequency of the drug given to MS patients, 20 of the initial 24 showed reduced physical symptoms according to the EDSS grading after one year. 

And the brain scans of nine of the participants were significantly improved after three years.

According to neurologists Mark Freedman (a third party), it is nearly impossible to see patients with progressive MS improve naturally. The professor at the University of Ottawa explains that there is a certain stage of progressive MS where the patient becomes noticeably disabled. And such a condition cannot reverse on its own without treatments. 

In other words, the T-cell therapy by Atara’s team is likely the main reason MS participants in the study showed signs of improvements.

This evidence suggests that the patients who saw results might have regenerated new myelin sheaths which were previously damaged by multiple sclerosis. This is a possible explanation for the improved EDSS grades recorded by the team. 

The result of this study is encouraging for people with MS and their loved ones. However, the team acknowledged that the sample size is small. And, the results may be due to placebo; (a term used to describe a situation where patients become better because they expect to).

Despite the evidence, scientists explain that further research needs to be done before getting MS sufferers excited about possible treatment for their condition.

The good news is that Atara has recently announced that the team has begun phase II of the T-cell therapy trial with 80 MS patients.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 8, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/doctors-scoff-natural-remedy-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-but-it-works/,Doctors Scoff At THIS Natural Remedy For Rheumatoid Arthritis—But It Works!,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a hereditary auto-immune disease, unlike osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease most often caused by lifestyle or injury (1). RA’s nature is systemic, so while a painkiller may mask the symptoms, it will not cure the fundamental problem. (Updated May 4, 2022)

RA is estimated to affect over 1.5 million people in the United States and can begin at any age (2). It manifests most often in proximal finger or foot joints (those closest to the palm of the hand or arch of the foot) and the resulting pain can be crippling. Once symptoms begin, there is very little chance that the disease will go into spontaneous remission.

Common RA Treatment Masks Symptoms and Further Stresses Immune System

Historically, RA has been treated with painkillers and immunosuppressants—most often prednisone, methotrexate, and Enbrel (3,4,5). There are inherent dangers in that mode of “treatment”, as the body develops a tolerance for these chemicals. More importantly, immunosuppressants further compromise the immune system, which is the source of the disease. In contrast, a healthy and active immune system is imperative for ameliorating RA’s effects.

Alternate Treatment Neither Toxic Nor Accompanied by Side Effects

Holistic doctor Dr. Joseph Mercola tells the story of one of his patients with RA, Sarah Allen, who had initially pursued the conventional method of treatment for her disease.

Not only was she prescribed the typical series of drugs, but Sarah was also advised to curtail her regular exercise regimen to reduce stress to her affected joints. At a physically active and fit 28 years old, this was a drastic and unwelcome change.

The result of her treatment was a vast reduction in her health and quality of life. A rheumatology specialist told her the harsh drugs she was taking would take 15-20 years off her life. Sarah had to check the status of her liver on a regular basis and she began to lose her hair. That’s when she decided to explore alternate forms of treatment for her RA.

Sarah began to see Dr. Mercola who prescribed immediate changes to her diet and lifestyle. He cut out wheat and gluten, sugar, and processed foods right off the top since these foods cause inflammation in the body, which exacerbates RA. Instead, she increased her intake of anti-inflammatory foods like turmeric and ginger , which also help relieve pain.

She also began drinking homemade green juice and eating organic meats, eggs, and raw produce. Since gastrointestinal health is crucial to a vital immune system, Sarah incorporated fermented foods into her diet, including kefir, kombucha, cultured butter,  sauerkraut, and yogurt.

Additionally, Dr. Mercola educated Sarah on the importance of vitamin D to support the immune system, as this nutrient stimulates the production of powerful antimicrobial peptides (6). Sarah was also advised to spend more time in the sun and to increase her intake of food high in vitamin D, such as salmon, sardines, and mushrooms.

Other Factors for Managing RA

High stress levels contribute to the detrimental effects of auto-immune diseases. For Sarah, reducing stress meant cutting back on extra work and employing the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) to promote better energy flow throughout her body (7). She also got back into her fitness routine to strengthen her immune system and boost lymph and blood flow.

Sarah’s Results

After just 3 months of her change to diet and lifestyle, Sarah felt significantly better. A blood test showed that her cells were healthy again, proving that what she was doing was having a positive effect.

When Sarah told her doctor about the changes she’d made, that she’d stopped taking prescribed pharmaceuticals, resumed regular exercise, and the results of her subsequent blood tests, “he almost acted disappointed or angry that I dared try that method. He said he wanted me to stay on methotrexate, and he still didn’t believe in diet even though it worked for me. I went to another rheumatologist later just to check how I was doing.”

“She said, ‘That disease is going to come back in 10 to 12 years, and just explode in your body possibly.’ She recommended I also stay on the drugs even though I was completely symptom-free!”

2 years after the health journey began, Sarah found it no longer necessary to see medical professionals for her RA—it was in complete remission. Sarah is now 43 years old and still hasn’t experienced symptoms of arthritis since meeting Dr. Mercola.

Sarah summarizes her RA journey:

“If you look at it from an Eastern perspective, our bodies are microcosms of the universe and our universe provides us with all that is necessary to heal. There is energy or chi in food that builds and moves the energy and blood in our bodies to promote balance and health. Food is so powerful, I think it’s one of the most important gifts we have in life.”",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"May 4, 2022"

https://dailyhealthpost.com/root-canal-and-breast-cancer/,Root Canals And Breast Cancer: The Hidden Link No One Told You About,"Going to the dentist can be pretty stressful for some people, especially if they don’t practice proper oral hygiene. But what happens if a routine visit can actually leave you more prone to a life-threatening disease? (updated Apr 22 2022)

Unfortunately, an increasing amount of research is showing that getting a root canal can lead to bacterial overload and may increase your chances of developing breast cancer.

The Root Canal-Breast Cancer Connection

More than 25 million root canals are performed every year in the United States. This highly invasive procedure involves drilling into a decaying tooth to remove the infected pulp, and then using a file of sorts to reach into the canal of the tooth to remove the remaining pulp.

The canals are then filled with a plastic material (gutta percha) that’s quite problematic: Recent research shows that in many cases the plastic does not actually get into the tiny lateral canals of the tooth that branch off the main canal, which results in “leakage” of the highly toxic anaerobic bacteria the procedure was designed to remove.

It is this bacteria that researchers claim results in disease (sometimes even decades later), including breast cancer.

Dr. Kulacz, a well-known dentist and author of The Toxic Tooth: How a Root Canal Could Be Making You Sick, has performed biopsies on every root canal tooth he has ever extracted. And as a result, he says, “Almost all of them have remnants of necrotic debris still in that canal meaning that they were not thoroughly cleaned. Microbiological cultures of the surrounding bone showed infection almost 100 percent of the time.”(1).

Bill Henderson, author of Cure Your Cancer and radio host of How to Live Cancer-Free, also states there is growing scientific evidence of a significant correlation between root canals and breast cancer. Henderson, who has been a cancer-prevention advocate for over 25 years says: “Two facts have jumped out at me…The most common cause of all cancers is root canal-filled teeth and cavitation sites; and until a cancer patient gets rid of the root canal-filled teeth and cavitations, they don’t get well.”(2).

Others agree: In fact, a five-year study conducted by Dr. Robert Jones, that specifically looked at the relationship between root canals and breast cancer, revealing that a whopping 93% of breast cancer patients also had root canals, and the other 7% had other oral diseases or issues. Even more convincing is the fact that almost all of the cancerous tumors were found on the exact same side of the body as the original root canal (3).

Another significant study published in 1998 in the American Academy of Periodontology essentially concluded that the root canal procedure itself may be the cause of infection. In 12 of the 26 case subjects the study examined, the root canaled teeth as well as the patient’s blood samples both contained anaerobic bacteria (4).

Essentially, having a root canal done could lead to never-ending river of bacteria flowing into your bloodstream.

Your Teeth and Your Overall Health

We don’t often think of the health of our teeth as a reflection on our general health but some researchers now claim your teeth are not only living organisms connected to the rest of your body, but that they are actually part of the ‘acupuncture meridian system’—an ‘energy highway’ that runs through your entire body.

Chinese Medicine believes that Qi (chi) energy flows through this highway and accesses all the different parts of your body (5).

As such, a tooth that is diseased or dying should just be pulled, says Henderson, comparing it to trying to save an infected gallbladder or appendix by filling it with toxic chemicals as dentists do with your teeth during a root canal.

Since each tooth has over 3 miles of tubules—tiny fluid-filled holes in its dentin layer—it is inevitable that the remaining tooth will eventually become a receptacle for deadly bacteria such as E. Faecalis, which is what is responsible for abscesses (pus-filled cavities) that ultimately spread to the rest of your body.

In a best case scenario, with a strong, healthy individual, the constant influx of harmful bacteria can adversely affect your immune system, leaving you run down and at risk for illness. For those with compromised immune systems, this added bacterial assault can wreak havoc on their bodies, even leading to sepsis and death in severe cases (6).

Infected Teeth Threaten Your Whole Body

As Chinese Medicine claims, the body, including your organs, are all interconnected through meridians (energy highways). As such, an infected tooth, for instance, can then affect the organs connected to it through the associated meridians.

According to Dr. Veronique Desaulniers, best-selling author and founder of BreastCancerConqueror.com, the 4th and 5th tooth (to the left and right of the center teeth) in the upper and lower jaw, for example, are connected to the breast meridian. Thus, “…constant infection caused by a root canal in these teeth can lead to complications, energy (or Chi) imbalances and blockages in energy flow in the breast meridian.” She further states this “imbalance” can even be visible, in many cases, on thermography scans.

Dr. Thomas Rau, a Swiss doctor, also revealed that of the last 150 breast cancer patients treated in his clinic, “147 (98%) had one or more root canal teeth on the same meridian as the original breast cancer tumour.” He now goes so far as to recommend any cancer patient he treats to first see a biological dentist to examine their teeth and even remove all root canal teeth (7).

What is probably the most disturbing fact about the connection between cancer and root canals is that this deadly association was first reported in 1925, when Dr. Weston Price and 60 other prominent researchers revealed 1,174 pages of research to the American Dental Association (ADA) clearly stating that essentially, there is no safe way to complete a root canal filling as every case ended in similar results—infection and disease elsewhere in the body.

Dr. Hal Huggins, a dentist and dental toxin specialist says “Dr. Weston Price and Mayo Clinic’s [studies from] 1910 to 1920 described finding bacterial growth in root canals that could be transferred into animals and create the same diseases the donor human had in from 80 to 100% of the animals. Heart disease, in particular, could be transferred 100% of the time. His research has since been suppressed by the various Dental Associations in the United States.”(8).

According to The Independent Cancer Research Foundation, the Weston Price’s work and other similar studies have all been “suppressed” by the ADA and the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) (9).


So, what is someone to do when faced with an infected tooth that cannot be saved by any other procedure than a root canal? Well, according to a growing number of dentists, “consider having the tooth removed and the tissue around it cleaned and repaired by a holistic or biological dentist.”

These specialized dentists take into consideration the fact that there is a proven connection between root canals and disease. In fact, they openly state people should seriously consider their dental health with respect to many other types of diseases and suggest that anyone who is having health issues contact the Holistic Dental Association and/or the International Academy of Biological Dentistry and Medicine for not only more information but as well to locate a qualified biological dentist in your area.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 22, 2022"

Approximately 40 million adults in the US battle anxiety daily (2). With increased rates of competition in the workplace we are faced with higher amounts of anxiety, but less time to manage our stress. We face conflicts within our family, finances, health and relationships and often it can all become overwhelming (3). (Updated Apr 22, 2022)

Women At Higher Risk…

Women, in particular, have the highest rate of stress and anxiety, with researchers finding women to be twice as likely to experience depression than men, and three times more likely to suffer from anxiety or attempt suicide (4).

Some common signs of anxiety in women are (5):

Feeling of panic, fear and uneasiness

https://dailyhealthpost.com/what-happens-if-you-quit-sugar-for-15-days/,What Happens If You Quit Sugar For 15 Days,"What happens if you stop eating sugar for 15 days? If you drink soft drinks, energy drinks, eat cereals, candies, ice-cream, packaged foods, or even coffee with added syrup, you probably consume higher amounts of sugar.

Why not quit sugar for 15 days to discover the amazing benefits of a sugar-free diet? In this video, we go over the top 10 benefits of quitting sugar for 15 days. Watch till the end to learn the one benefit of quitting sugar you probably would not have guessed.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Number 10. You Will Have A Healthier Gut.

If you quit sugar, your gut microbiota would be more balanced. The gut hosts trillions of bacteria, some of which eat sugar and create harmful substances as a byproduct.

When excess sugar is present in the intestines, beneficial bacteria decrease. The perfect composition of bacteria is disturbed, and this can trigger bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and celiac disease.

Also, an excess intake of sugar damages the gut barrier function, and increases the likelihood of infection and inflammation. This is a syndrome known as leaky gut.

See our video, Top 8 Foods That Cause Leaky Gut.

Number 9. You Will Feel Less Hungry.

When you eat refined sugar, your body releases more insulin. Insulin is a crucial hormone that helps to keep your blood sugar levels stable.

When your blood sugar increases steeply after eating, your body can release too much insulin, making your blood sugar plummet below normal levels.

This is commonly called a blood sugar ‘crash’. Symptoms of a sugar crash include hunger, irritability, fatigue, anxiety, headaches, difficulty concentrating, shakiness, and dizziness.

People who have pre-diabetes and diabetes are more prone to experience a sugar crash.

When you stop eating sugar, the foods you eat no longer cause an immediate spike in blood sugar levels. So changes in your glucose would not be as extreme as when you were eating sugar.

That’s why you will feel less hungry and less exhausted after eating a meal.

Number 8. You May Lose Fat.

You may lose fat because your blood glucose levels are more balanced, and you don’t feel an urgent need to eat again after a meal. In a study published in the BMJ in 2012, the results of 68 studies were analyzed.

Analyses of this sizeable population showed that decreased dietary sugar intake was associated with reduced body weight. Also, a one-year follow-up showed people who had a higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages had a higher risk of being obese.

If you want to break your sugar addiction, see our video, Top 9 Ways to Stop Sugar Cravings.

Number 7. Your Skin Will Look Better.

Your skin is highly affected by diet. Sugar plays a role in common skin diseases, such as acne.

In a study published in The American journal of clinical nutrition in 2007, participants who had acne were given a low-glycemic-index diet, which means their glucose level would be more controlled. Due to lower blood glucose levels, their total acne lesion counts decreased more than control groups with an energy-dense, high glycemic index diet.

Sugar also contributes to skin aging by damaging collagen structure. Collagen is the protein that plays an important role in skin repair and protection.

This is the reason quitting sugar may give you younger-looking and healthier skin.

See our video, Top 12 Foods to Avoid if You Want Younger Looking Skin.

Number 6. Your Inflammation Levels Will Decrease.

Too much sugar intake is linked with inflammation, which is one of the major causes of chronic diseases. Chronic inflammation can damage tissues and organs, leading to diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, intestinal problems, and even cancer.

Quitting sugar can improve your overall health by decreasing inflammation.

See our video, Top 13 foods that cause inflammation.

Number 5. Your Blood Lipid Levels Will Improve.

High sugar intake causes high blood glucose levels, which increase blood lipid levels.

Your body needs to lower blood glucose levels, so it produces more insulin. This makes your cells take up sugar and convert it to fat in tissues, including in the liver and adipose tissue, where fat is stored.

The liver converts excessive sugar to triglycerides and LDL (bad cholesterol), which then go into the bloodstream.

When you go sugar free, your blood glucose levels will be more balanced; as a result, fat production will decrease, and this can help prevent heart disease.

Number 4. You Will Have A Lower Risk Of Diabetes.

Consuming too much sugar can increase your risk of developing pre-diabetes and diabetes.

A normal insulin response is triggered until the pancreas cells that produce insulin become exhausted. When this happens, the amount of insulin your body produces goes down, which causes your blood sugar levels to go higher, and damage your pancreas even more.

If you cut sugar out of your diet and eat a balanced meal instead, your blood glucose levels will rise and fall normally, which will prevent abnormal insulin secretion and pancreas damage.

See our video, Top 12 Pre-diabetes Symptoms and Treatment.

Number 3. You Will Sleep Better.

A study published in Psychoneuroendocrinology in 2019 showed that patients with pre-diabetes had poor sleep compared to people with normal blood glucose levels. This study shows that blood glucose levels can affect sleep.

An imbalance in blood glucose will disturb sleep, and poor sleep will disrupt blood glucose levels, thus causing a vicious cycle. You can break the cycle by cutting sugar from your diet.

Number 2. Your Dental Health Will Improve.

Do you want shiny, white, and healthy teeth? Quitting sugar can give you healthy teeth by preventing you from getting cavities.

In a study published in the Journal of dentistry in 2014, almost 1000 adults were questioned on sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. Their dental health was assessed with a dental score calculated based on the number of decayed, filled, and missing teeth because of cavities.

Results showed that their dental health decreased when the frequency of consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages increased.

And now the number 1 benefit that you may not have guessed.

Number 1. You Will Feel More Energetic.

Yes, you heard that right. Most people think they would be unhappy and joyless if they quit sugar, but it’s actually the opposite.

When you stop eating sugar, you will gradually feel more energetic because sugar inhibits a hormone called orexin, which stimulates the brain and gives you wakefulness.

Orexin also stimulates other brain cells to release dopamine and serotonin, which are known as happiness hormones. You’ll feel happier when you stop eating sugar.

While 15 days may be too short a time to get all the benefits of quitting sugar, the longer you stop eating sugar, the more you’ll find you won’t miss it at all! Sugar is as addictive as cocaine, and the effects of excess sugar intake – higher blood pressure, inflammation, weight gain, diabetes, and fatty liver disease – are all linked to an increased risk for heart attack and stroke.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-lose-weight-with-intermittent-fasting/,How to Lose Weight with Intermittent Fasting,"As many of you already know, intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that involves short-term fasting periods where you consume little to no food. Intermittent fasting not only helps with weight loss but it can also help improve your cholesterol profile and lower blood sugar levels, which are known risk factors for health conditions like diabetes, dementia and heart disease.

If you’re serious about losing excess belly fat, intermittent fasting is something you’ll definitely want to try.

While fasting may sound unpleasant and uncomfortable, it doesn’t have to be.

We’ve put together this video to share FIVE things you need to know for a successful intermittent fasting routine, regardless of your age or level of fitness.

Watch this video to the end to learn a simple trick that will help control your appetite so that you can lose weight for good. We’ll also explain why intermittent fasting works.

As always, this video is educational, and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Number 5. Start with a small fasting period.

There are several ways to implement intermittent fasting. Some of the most popular ones include the 16:8 method, the 5:2 diet, Leangains, eat-stop-eat and alternate-day fasting (ADF).

Ultimately, all these methods can be effective, but figuring out which one works best for you, will depend on your schedule and hunger tolerance.

If in doubt, it’s best to start with a 12-hour fast and followed by a 12-hour eating window.

From there, you can slowly transition to a 14:10 or 16:8 schedule, where you fast for 16 hours and have an eight-hour eating window.

As you become more accustomed to fasting, you can try to increase the fasting window, or increase the number of fasting days per week to suit your schedule better.

If you are interested in starting intermittent fasting, click the link below this video to get our ultimate FREE guide to lose weight with intermittent fasting in 4 weeks or fewer!

Number 4. Break your fast slowly and steadily.


After going several hours with no food consumption, you might feel you could eat up an entire mountain.

However, according to the latest research, chowing down your food too quickly after a fast, is actually bad for your body and your waistline.

Although this is unlikely, refeeding syndrome is a condition that can occur, when large amounts of food are reintroduced too quickly into the body after a long period of starvation or malnourishment (think several months to a year). This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and severe complications that can be fatal.

It’s recommended that you take your time to chew well and eat slowly after a fast, to allow your digestive system to process the food, causing no imbalances. Doing this will also help you avoid over-eating.

Number 3. Drink a lot of water.


This may sound weird, but when you don’t drink enough water, your body can receive mixed signals of hunger.

Dehydration can trick your brain into thinking you need to eat, when in reality, you really should drink some water.

Therefore, staying well hydrated is an important part of succeeding with intermittent fasting.

The best drinks to consume during a fast are free from calories and sweeteners like still or sparkling water, and tea or coffee with no additives.

Number 2. Choose nutrient-dense foods.


Intermittent fasting does not set any restrictions on what foods you should consume when fasting. However, it is highly recommended to focus on nutrient-dense foods.

After a fast, it’s important to supply your body with foods that are high in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients which can help to keep blood sugar levels steady and prevent nutrient deficiencies.

Some examples of foods that you should eat after a fast and that will keep you satiated include chicken breast, fish, leafy greens, nuts and eggs.

If your meals are too bland, you can season them generously with garlic, herbs, spices, or vinegar, which are extremely low in calories.

Number 1. Keep yourself busy.


Understand that hunger comes and goes in waves. It’s a natural feeling that you can learn to acknowledge and then ignore. It’s important to keep your mind busy during your usual meal or snack times while you’re fasting.

If you think about it, most snacking you do isn’t to avoid malnutrition. It’s usually out of boredom or stress.

So, go for a walk, read a book, play a game or do a crossword puzzle. Just get out of your snacking routine that will keep you from reflexively thinking about it.

By following these tips, you will set yourself up for success and be much more likely to incorporate intermittent fasting as part of your daily routine. The key is doing it in a way that feels sustainable and fits into your lifestyle.

Next, why does intermittent fasting work?


This can be explained with autophagy. Autophagy is a natural body process wherein the body removes dysfunctional parts and cleans and repairs any damaged cells. It literally means “self-eating.” It’s part of the body’s response to biological stressors and toxins. With damaged cells removed and replaced, your body becomes healthier.

While autophagy is a normal self-preservation mechanism of the body, you can induce this process through fasting, diet, and exercise. Most people do that to lose and manage their weight. Autophagy is gaining more attention in the medical field as it might contribute to treating and preventing cancer. It’s also correlated to anti-aging and longevity processes.

What are the benefits of autophagy?

Here are a few more benefits based on studies:

• It aids the body’s cellular metabolic process.

• It reduces inflammation.

• It slows down the aging process.

• It stimulates the production of growth hormones.

• It protects against neurodegenerative diseases.

• It supports the body’s immune function.

• It protects the body against infections and diseases.

• It can increase the lifespan.

• It can lower risks of cancer.

• It improves liver function.

• It delays the progression of some liver conditions.

How does fasting trigger autophagy?

Fasting can induce autophagy in the body because it subjects the cells to stress because of the prolonged absence of food intake. It’s a kind of healthy stress, unlike dangerous and damaging chronic stress. Limited food means the cells have limited calories and nutrients to use and function correctly.

When that happens, it triggers autophagy, making the cells clean out and recycle damaged proteins and cellular parts so that they can function more efficiently.

How long do you have to fast before autophagy starts?

There’s no absolute figure to answer this, but experts say it typically takes 18 to 20 hours of fasting before autophagy starts. The maximal benefits happen after 48 to 72 hours of fasting. That’s 2 to 3 days, which can help you understand why fasting for a day then resuming normal eating patterns means autophagy may only be short term.

The results can vary because people have different metabolic rates. For some people, going 8 hours without food can already prompt autophagy. Others might have to try 24-hour or 5-day fasting to experience profound benefits.

Aside from intermittent fasting, you can also help trigger autophagy through other means. Combining any or all of these with fasting will compound the efficacy in terms of both reducing lead time and improving benefits. Here are 3 methods. exercise regularly, get quality sleep, and take time to relax and free yourself from trauma.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/causes-of-inflammation/,Top 11 Causes of Inflammation,"Millions of people are affected by chronic inflammation, but don’t even know it. Inflammation is a natural and healthy part of the body’s immune response, but left unchecked, it can cause many problems like joint pain, weight gain, heart disease, Alzheimer’s and cancer. So, what causes this type of inflammation in the first place?

In today’s video, we’ll go over the Top 11 Causes of Inflammation. Once you know the root causes of your inflammation, you can take steps to address them. As always, this video is educational, and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Number 11. Obesity.

Obesity is often linked with low-grade chronic inflammation. When fat cells expand, you get fatter and your body is in a constantly swollen state. This extra stress isn’t good for your body, so white blood cells rush to help. Unfortunately, if you do not lose weight soon enough, healthy cells stop responding to the hormone insulin that regulates blood sugar. This is a condition called insulin resistance. Your body may then have a more dangerous problem: diabetes. White blood cells that were there to help you now enter the bloodstream and start damaging your liver.

Number 10. Stress And Anxiety.

Sometimes when something bad happens, it can cause a lot of stress and anxiety. This often triggers night sweats or a panic attack because your body is releasing cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone that makes the blood vessels widen when a threat is perceived. When you are stressed, this hormone can cause inflammation, even if we don’t feel any physical pain. Your brain sees the change in emotions as a threat, and then inflammation is created as an extra protection measure. Excess cortisol increases your risk of getting an infection. You are more likely to get sick when you are stressed than when you are feeling mentally healthy.

Number 9. Pollution And Bad Air.

Chronic inhalation of polluted air has been linked to an increased chance of having diabetes, heart attack or stroke. This is because polluted air causes inflammation, which makes it harder for your body to fight off diseases. Smoking cigarettes exposes your lungs to bad air and leaves your immune system struggling to repair the damage constantly.

Number 8. Poor Diet.

A poor diet is a major cause of inflammation. This includes things like refined carbohydrates, white flour, processed foods, and high levels of sugar. These foods can cause the immune system to go into overdrive, leading to inflammation. A balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, nuts, olive oil, and fish can help keep inflammation in check. In short, skip the junk food and choose more whole, unprocessed fare.

Number 7. Lack of Sleep.

People who have insomnia have more cytokines in their bodies. This means that their immune system is working harder than people without insomnia. The body needs sleep to regenerate and the immune system needs to calm down. Not getting enough restorative sleep can promote inflammation, which is bad for people with autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis.

Number 6. Food Allergies.

Food allergies are another common cause of inflammation. When someone has a food allergy, their immune system reacts to a particular food as if it were a foreign invader. This can lead to inflammation in the gut and other parts of the body. Common food allergens include dairy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, and wheat. Some people are sensitive to foods, but they don’t have a true allergy. For example, people with Celiac disease get sick when they eat gluten. This is not a true food allergy, but their body reacts similarly.

Number 5. Hormone Imbalance.

Chronic inflammation can result from an imbalance in hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. When these hormones are imbalanced, cortisol levels may increase. Cortisol is a hormone that helps keep the immune system balanced and inflammation in check. Chronic inflammation can affect women going through menopause, causing symptoms like adult acne and osteoporosis. Studies suggest that inflammation increases with age.

Number 4. Synthetic Fibers.

Synthetic fibers are another common cause of inflammation. These are the man-made fibers that are used in things like clothing and furniture. Some people with sensitive skin may find that problematic fibers can cause rashes, nausea, and itching. In more severe cases, the fibers can also lead to lung problems because of the inflammation they cause.

Number 3. Chemicals.

You are exposed to many chemicals in your everyday life, such as from air fresheners, adhesives, cosmetics, and cleaning products. They can also come from things like glues, heavy metals, and pesticides. Inflammation can be caused by airborne irritants that we breathe in at work. These chemicals will spread even faster if the air conditioning system in your home or workplace is not clean.

Number 2. Excessive Alcohol.

Drinking over one drink per day can damage your memory, reasoning, and teeth. It can also lead to gastritis, anemia, and malnutrition. Drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco is even worse for you. This combination can lead to esophagitis, or inflammation of the tube that carries food from mouth to stomach.

Number 1. Trigger Foods.

The top trigger foods that can cause inflammation are sugar, refined carbs, processed foods, fried foods, alcohol, and artificial sweeteners. Some research suggests that products high in linoleic acid can cause an inflammatory reaction. This includes safflower, corn, soy, and sunflower oils. In contrast, healthy, fiber-rich carbohydrate sources, like fruits and vegetables, may help to reduce inflammation. See our video, Top 13 Foods that Cause Inflammation.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/alkaline-eating-tips/,"Alkaline Eating: Tips and Tricks To Lose Weight, Fight Inflammation and Prevent Cancer","You might have noticed that eating too many sweets or drinking too much coffee can leave you feeling tired, fat and sick. Although sugar and caffeine do play a role in this condition, it may not be for the same reasons you’ve heard. In fact, these foods are highly acidic and inflammatory, meaning that they can impact your body’s natural acid-base balance.  This is why you need alkaline. (Updated Apr 4, 2022)

What Is The Acid-Alkaline Balance ?

Acid and alkaline are two ends of the pH scale: 0 is the most acidic, 7 is neutral and 14 is the most alkaline. While different systems in your body thrive at different points on this scale, it’s believed that having slightly alkaline blood promotes a healthier environment for life-sustaining bacteria and enzymes.

Your acid-base balance is important for every process in your body to function properly. This balance is maintained mainly by your kidneys and lungs.

Respiratory acidosis occurs when your blood is over-saturated with carbon dioxide because of poor lung function while metabolic acidosis occurs when your kidneys fail to excrete enough uric acid to maintain balance. Eating acidic foods can impair these natural processes.

Acidosis can contribute towards health problems like multiple sclerosis, cholesterol, arrhythmia, immunodeficiency disorders, joint pain, lethargy, chronic illness, heart disease, diabetes and much more (1).

Over-acidity can also increase your risk for osteoporosis, cancer, liver problems, heart disease and ketoacidosis.

How Your Body Fights Acidosis

When your body is too acidic and you’re not eating well, it will leach minerals like calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium from your bones to neutralize the acidity in your blood. This can lead to serious medical problems like osteoporosis (2).

When there’s not enough alkalizing minerals in the body, acidic toxins get stored in your fat cells (3). Both of these methods harm your long term health, so it’s important to make the right lifestyle changes to avoid acidosis.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 4, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/adhd-supplements/,Studies Show That Magnesium Treats ADHD Better and Safer Than ADHD Drugs,"Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is classified by the National Institute of Mental Health as a brain dysfunction in which inattention and impulsive and hyperactive behaviors interfere with normal brain function and/or development. (1) Symptoms of ADHD include: (Updated April 4, 2022)

inability to focus and disorganization
inability to complete tasks
lack of attention to detail
easily distracted and forgetful
restlessness and/or excessive physical activity, including fidgeting, tapping or talking; an inability to sit still and be quiet
need for instant gratification
making decisions (often poor ones) without first thinking through the consequences
socially intrusive behavior; unable to exercise self-restraint

Demonstrating these and related traits can be a problem for children in a traditional classroom setting and for adults working in an office or team environment. But not always.

Olympic medalists Michael Phelps and Simone Biles have come out publicly with their ADHD diagnoses. (2, 3) Other athletes and prominent successful people in all disciplines have been similarly diagnosed. (4)

What these people have in common in addition to ADHD is an upbringing during which they were given the freedom to channel their energies creatively.

Garret LoPorto is the originator of The DaVinci Method, a regimen to psychologically hone and positively direct the very natural tendencies that appear in people diagnosed with ADHD and similar disorders (e.g., bi-polar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder). ADHD develops as the result of repressing those natural tendencies, he asserts.

“Since lack of self-repression is often perceived to be socially unacceptable, DaVincis [including people with ADHD] may develop the maladaptive approach to holding everything back until there is a crisis…Another maladaptive response to the social norms of repression is to ‘shut down’…[someone who is] behaviorally self-repressed often appears stiff, unnatural, emotionally dishonest, stunted, all-bottled-up, frustrated, anal retentive, and even constipated…because they are straining to hold back the rush of unconscious ideas and impulses that fill their consciousness in order to avoid expressing something that would be deemed ‘inappropriate’ by their community.” (5)

The Root Causes of ADHD Are Unknown

LoPorto theorizes that the symptoms manifesting as what is labelled ADHD are the result of different genetic brainwave patterns from “normal” people. There seems to be a general consensus among the scientific community that neurotransmitters in people with ADHD are different than in people without it, most likely as the result of genetic influence. (6)

There are, of course, pharmaceuticals that have been devised to change and block neurotransmitters in order for people with ADHD to function within the confines of societal norms. With these come a wide range of negative side effects aside from the staunching of creative and physical flow. On top of the adverse effects of medications used to treat ADHD is the body’s mechanism of building tolerance of the medication:",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"April 4, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-ways-youre-accidentally-lowering-your-testosterone/,5 Ways You’re Accidentally Lowering Your Testosterone,"Testosterone is hugely important for muscle and bone strength, sex drive, and energy levels. While both men and women produce this hormone, men typically produce it in larger amounts – and tend to notice more when their levels start to drop. (Updated Mar 18, 2022)

Testosterone production naturally starts to decrease around age 30 for most men, and can result in everything from tiredness to erectile dysfunction. By that point, many men are working hard to keep their testosterone (or “T”) levels high with supplements, diet, and exercise, but there are a few things you might be doing to unintentionally hinder your efforts.

Here are five things to avoid that might be causing you to accidentally lower your testosterone levels.

#1 Long Distance Running

A solid cardio program can help you stay fit and even increase testosterone levels to a point, but once you start getting into long-distance running – like marathon training, for instance – you may actually be decreasing your testosterone with your workouts. A study by the University of British Columbia found that male runners who pounded over 40 miles of pavement per week had distinctly lower T levels than their short-distance running counterparts.

#2 Excessive Alcohol Consumption

The bar might be a great place to meet a date, but more than a few drinks isn’t going to do great things for your testosterone level. As your liver processes alcohol, it produces compounds that inhibit the release of testosterone, reducing its overall level in your body and preventing you from doing things like building muscle mass. While even one or two drinks will cause a minor, temporary dip in your T levels, this is a bigger worry for individuals who drink heavily multiple times per week.

#3 Low-Fat Diets

We’re not telling you to go shovel in a burger and fries to up your T levels, but a super-low-fat, high-fiber diet isn’t the best idea for boosting them, either. Researchers at UCLA found that men who greatly reduced their fat intake and upped their fiber intake from their baseline diet had a 12% drop in their testosterone levels. Just make sure the fats you keep in your diet are healthy ones, rather than trans or saturated fats.

#4 Not Enough Sleep

Whether you’re partying, working late, or catching some 2am reruns, not sleeping enough is going to do unfortunate things to your T levels. Because your body produces most of its testosterone while you sleep, interrupting that cycle with insufficient or poor quality sleep can result in 20% to 30% less testosterone floating around your bloodstream than if you’d gotten enough shut-eye.

#5 Replacing Meat with Soy

Totally cutting meat out of your diet and replacing it with soy is a common health decision these days, but it may end up lowering your testosterone levels over time. A combination of the plant estrogens in soy and the lack of complete proteins from meat have been correlated with a 10% dip in testosterone levels after 4 weeks of a change in diet.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-regrow-your-hair-naturally-with-these-herbs-and-foods/,How to Regrow Your Hair Naturally With These Herbs and Foods,"“Male pattern baldness” is a phrase that instills fear and horror in most guys. This type of early hair loss is an unfortunate reality for about 85% of men, with over a quarter starting to lose their hair before they even turn 21. (Updated Mar 18, 2022)

While male pattern baldness is an unfortunate result of high testosterone levels coupled with grabbing the genetic short straw, there are things you can do to halt or slow its progression, and even regrow hair you’ve already lost. Check out this list of surprising herbs and foods that might help you stop male pattern baldness in its tracks.

Gingko Biloba

Researchers at the University of Maryland found that men who took this herb were able to increase their blood flow to the scalp, which aided to grow hair naturally and improved overall scalp health.

Aromatherapy Oils

A combination of essential oils of rosemary, cedar, thyme, and lavender applied directly to the scalp also stimulates blood flow to the follicles, according to University of Maryland Medical Center researchers.

Low-fat Proteins

Since hair is made of protein, a diet full of fish, eggs, beans, and other low-fat, high-protein foods can help supply your hair with the raw materials it needs to grow.

Han Lian Cao

This Chinese herb fights inflammation and swelling in your scalp (preventing further hair loss), and helps to strengthen your hair at its roots.

Raisins

Iron is a key factor in hair production, so any foods rich in this mineral will do. But for those of you who don’t relish the thought of packing in the kale, dried fruits like raisins are a great snack that will help boost your iron levels.

Bean Sprouts

These veggies are full of silica, which your body uses to process the vitamins and minerals (like that iron you got from those raisins) that help your hair grow.

Horsetail Extract

No, you don’t have to cut off a horse’s tail and eat it. This herb is another silica-rich option that will help you absorb the vitamins and minerals you need to reverse your hair loss.

Walnuts

These nuts can pack a huge punch with biotin and vitamin E, which help protect your hair and scalp from sun damage. Low biotin consumption has also been linked with hair loss, so it’s a smart idea to make sure you’re getting enough of it.

Nettle Extract

Another Chinese herb, nettle extract works to just barely irritate your scalp, which causes increased blood flow and improved circulation, and therefore better oxygen absorption by your hair follicles.

Oysters

Not getting enough zinc has been tied to hair loss in both men and women, but just three ounces of oysters give you almost 500% of the daily recommended dose of zinc. They’re also incredibly rich in protein.

Saw Palmetto

This herb helps prevent a specific enzyme from turning testosterone into DHT. It’s testosterone and DHT that cause male pattern baldness in the first place, so lowering these levels slightly can help stop the process at its root.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/bottled-water-code/,Here is What You Need To Check Next Time You Buy Bottled Water,"Bottled water sure is convenient, but is it safe? If you’ve ever turned your bottled water upside-down, you may have noticed letters and numbers near the recycling symbol that indicate the kind of plastic they’re made of. Unless you know what to look for, these numbers can be more confusing than helpful. Here’s what you need to know.

#1 PET or PETE

This kind of plastic is the most common variety used to make single-use water bottles. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most toxic plastics.

The plastic leaches carcinogenic chemicals and endocrine disruptors into the liquid it contains, which is made worse by repeated use and exposure to heat. That’s why plastic water bottles shouldn’t be stored in the sun or used to contain juices or other acidic drinks (1,2).

This plastic is also hard to decontaminate, making it prone to bacterial or fungal growth. Proper cleaning requires harmful chemicals that may further enhance leeching or directly contaminate water stored in the bottle.

Bottom line: Avoid if you can, recycle after use and keep away from heat.

SEE ALSO: 10 warning signs of dehydration you should know about

#2 HDP or HDPE

High density polyethylene (HDPE) is a plastic commonly used in the production of water and juice bottles as well as grocery bags. It is a very stable and hardy plastic and does not break down when exposed to extreme temperatures. It’s also easy to recycle and does not to leach any chemicals that are suspected of causing cancer or disrupting hormones (3).

Bottom line: Relatively safe.

#3 PVC or 3V

Polyvinyl Chloride is a flexible plastic used to make anything from plastic food wrapping to children’s toys and plumbing pipes because of its durability. However, this plastic often contains phthalate which can contribute to obesity, insulin resistance, reproductive disorders and foetal malformation. Some phthalates, like di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), are suspected human carcinogens.

Infants and children are particularly vulnerable to these chemicals, but even phthalate-free PVC contains other harmful substances like volatile organic compounds (VOC’s), lead, cadmium and other heavy metals as well as dioxin, a carcinogen.

Bottom line: Avoid at all cost and never give to children.

#4 LDPE

Low-density polyethylene doesn’t typically appear in plastic bottles, but it can appear in squeezable bottles and plastic bags. The substance doesn’t release any chemicals into the water, is much less toxic than other plastic and is typically considered to be safe for food use.

Bottom line: Safe, but probably not the best bottle to use.

#5 PP

Polypropylene is durable, heat-resistant and appropriate for reuse. It actually serves as an excellent barrier against moisture, grease and chemicals. The substance is hazardous during production but studies have determined it to be safe from carcinogens and endocrine disruptors.

Bottom line: Relatively safe.

#6 PS

Polystyrene is inexpensive and lightweight, so it’s uses in a large variety of products, including styrofoam and plastic cutlery. The product is known to leech benzene, butadiene and styrene, which are all known carcinogens. The plastic also leeches other unhealthy chemicals known for reproductive toxicity.

PS plastics are rarely recycled and mostly end in landfills or in the ocean. In fact, it’s not uncommon for fisherman to find the plastic in the bellies of their catch of the day.

Bottom line: Don’t buy and don’t use. Recycle any existing bottles at home.


#7 PC or non-labeled plastic

This category is a catch-all for polycarbonate and other plastics. Polycarbonate is known to contain BPA, which “has been shown to interfere with reproductive development in animals and has been linked with cardiovascular disease and diabetes in humans. Polycarbones also contain xenoestrogen, a known endocrine disruptor. This plastic is mainly found in reusuable water bottles and baby bottles (4).

Although BPA-free bottles are on the market, they aren’t much safer. BPS, the compound used to replace BPA can disrupt normal cell functions and contribute to metabolic disorders, birth defects, asthma or even cancer.

“[Manufacturers] put ‘BPA-free’ on the label, which is true. The thing they neglected to tell you is that what they’ve substituted for BPA has not been tested for the same kinds of problems that BPA has been shown to cause. That’s a little bit sneaky,” says Cheryl Watson, a specialist in cancer research, cell biology and endocrinology at The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.

The Scientific American also reports that Hong-Sheng Wang, an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati, found that both BPA and BPS cause heart arrhythmia in rats (5). Needless to say, #7 plastic should be avoided at all cost.

That is, unless they are compostable. That’s right, compostable bottles have also ended up in category #7.You can tell them apart from their toxic counterparts because they have initials “PLA” near their recycling symbol. This compostable plastics are much safer than nearly all the products on this list but should not be reused or recycled.

The bottom line: Don’t be fooled by BPA-free products. Compostable bottles are a great alternative but the best option to carry around a reusable glass bottle and fill it up throughout the day.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 9, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/people-whose-mouths-feel-dry/,People whose mouths feel dry when sleeping at night need to know these 8 reasons,"Nowadays, people’s lives are very stressful. This stress can affect their quality of sleep, which affects their happiness. However, some people cannot even get a good night’s sleep. They frequently experience dry mouth when sleeping at night. This can be very distressing and it usually happens in the second half of the night. If this occurs frequently, it may be a sign of an illness. This symptom could be related to 8 factors.

1.Digestive problems

If you eat foods that irritate your stomach before going to bed, it can affect your gastrointestinal function. These foods will absorb your body’s water and also make your blood pressure rise. The amount of fat inside your body will increase. If you eat these foods before going to bed, you will have a dry mouth when you fall asleep and the food is still digesting inside your body while also absorbing water.

2.Liver disease

The liver detoxifies the body. When the liver is damaged, toxins and waste can’t be expelled from the body quickly enough, and this can have harmful effects. If you have a dry mouth at night when you sleep, it may be a sign that your liver is inflamed due damage. When the problem doesn’t go away after a while, seek medical attention and have your liver checked.

3.Dehydration

If you don’t drink enough water, your body will become dehydrated. You lose water when you sleep as you breathe, and as your body functions. When you sleep, all of your bodily processes need water. If your body doesn’t have enough water, your mouth will be dry. It’s important to drink more water regularly.

4.Oral diseases

If you have periodontitis, gingivitis, or gum disease, there will be a lot of bacteria and viruses in your mouth. If your mouth is not sufficiently clean, the bacteria and viruses will continue to reproduce and grow. This can lead to inflammation and a dry mouth at night.

5.Diabetes

Many diabetic patients find they have a dry mouth and bitter taste in their mouths at night. This happens because the sugar in their blood rises and keeps building up. Then the kidneys and liver metabolize the sugar, which causes faster water loss. This makes the mouth dry when you’re sleeping.

6.Bile reflux

When the liver function decreases, it will affect the secretion of bile. This will cause bile reflux, which will lead to problems such as poor spleen and stomach function and indigestion. When bile reflux occurs, you may have a dry mouth at night and your quality of sleep may be affected.

7.Fever

If you get cold, you can get a fever. When your body is hot, you lose water and have a dry mouth at night. You may feel a burning sensation in your mouth. You can relieve these symptoms by cooling down your body or taking medication.

8.Hyperthyroidism

Hyperthyroidism causes the body’s metabolism to speed up and the sympathetic nerves become more excited, which makes the dryness of the mouth more obvious.

One of these reasons may be why you feel dry mouth at night. If it is related to poor dietary habits, you’ll need to adjust and maintain oral hygiene. If it is caused by a disease, then consult your doctor for an examination and treatment as soon as possible.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 7, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-selenium/,What you need to know about selenium,"Selenium is a mineral that people need for their entire lives. Animal experiments and clinical practice have both shown that people need to get enough selenium from their food every day to be healthy and to fight off diseases. You should try to eat enough selenium every day, just like you should eat enough starch, protein, and vitamins.

Foods Rich In Selenium

Foods rich in selenium include fish, shrimp, dairy, animal liver, meat, nuts (such as peanuts, and melon seeds). Other foods such as butter, fish meal, lobster, mushrooms, pork kidney, and garlic contain some selenium, but the absorption rate is less than ideal.

Selenium intake is more related to the selenium content of the soil than it is to dietary patterns. Soils in the United States and Canada appear to contain sufficient selenium. Studies of vegetarians and strict vegans in the United States have found that they consume adequate amounts of selenium. Selenium is found in many foods, but Brazil nut, whole grain cereals (whole wheat bread, oatmeal, barley), white rice, and beans are high in selenium.

Eggs contain more selenium than meat, with pork containing 10.6 mcg, eggs 23.3 mcg, duck eggs 30.7 mcg, goose eggs 33.6 mcg, ginseng 15 mcg, and peanuts 13.7 mcg of selenium per 100 grams of the food.

The selenium content of plant food is determined by the selenium content of local soil and water and could have a difference of up to 1000 times between two agricultural areas.

Fish, shrimp, and other seafood products have the highest levels of selenium. After that, another significant source of selenium is the heart, kidney, and liver of animals. Selenium is also found in vegetables. The highest levels of selenium are found in goldenrod, capers, garlic, mushrooms, and peas. Cabbage, pumpkin, radish, leek, onion, and tomato all have high levels of selenium as well.

The survey data showed that the natural selenium content in food follows this order: seafood, animal offal, fish, eggs, meat, grain, milk (powder), vegetables, fruits. 

The organic selenium content in plants is higher for human consumption and can reach up to 70%-90%. However, the utilization rate of selenium in animal products is lower and only about 50%.

Problem with Selenium

Organic selenium can be found in seafood and animal organs, but these may not be the best sources of selenium. Seafood contains methyl mercury, which can combine with selenium and make it inactive. This means you won’t get as much benefit from the selenium. Animal organs also contain more cholesterol, which is not ideal for older people or those with cardiovascular disease.

You can help improve your absorption of selenium by eating more fruits, vegetables, and other foods that are rich in vitamins A, C, and E.

Nutritionists advocate supplementing organic selenium, such as selenium yeast, selenium-enriched eggs, selenium-rich mushrooms, selenium-rich malt, selenium-rich tea, selenium-rich rice, etc.

In summary

Selenium is an essential element that has various important functions in the human body. Selenium can help improve immunity, and it has a significant inhibitory and protective effect on colon cancer, skin cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and many other cancers. Selenium also has the effect of reducing and easing heavy metal toxicity and free radicals. However, the human body cannot synthesize it, so selenium must be absorbed from food. The recommended daily selenium intake of selenium is 50μg.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"March 6, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/this-is-what-happens-when-you-get-aspartame-poisoning/,This Is What Happens To Your Body When You Get Aspartame Poisoning From Diet Sodas,"You may have never heard about it but aspartame poisoning is very real. Also known under different names such as aminosweet or nutrasweet, this artificial sweetener has been shown to have detrimental effects in the human body. (Updated Mar 1, 2022)

And this is exactly what happened to Rhonda’s sister.

According to her blog, “In October of 2001, my sister started getting very sick. She had stomach spasms and she was having a hard time getting around. Walking was a major chore. It took everything she had just to get out of bed; she was in so much pain.

By March 2002, she had undergone several tissue and muscle biopsies and was on 24 various prescription medications. The doctors could not determine what was wrong with her.”

The doctors eventually believed that Rhonda’s sister had Multiple Sclerosis. But they were wrong.

Soon after learning about her sister’s possible diagnosis, Rhonda recalled an article she had read about aspartame.

Rhonda then proceeded to asking her sister if she drank diet soda to which she answered ‘yes.’ In fact, she drank a lot of diet soda!

Rhonda told her to stop drinking it immediately. And what happened next changed her life forever.

“My sister called me within 32 hours after our phone conversation and told me she had stopped drinking the diet soda AND she could walk! The muscle spasms went away. She said she didn’t feel 100% but, she sure felt a lot better.”

Symptoms of aspartame poisoning can include headaches, decreased vision, elevated blood pressure and dizziness.

The best way to avoid aspartame poisoning is to stop eating foods that contain this artificial sweetener.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/cinnamon-and-magnesium-lower-blood-pressure/,Cinnamon and Magnesium May Lower Blood Pressure More Than Medication,"Supplementation with cinnamon has been found to lower blood pressure in pre-diabetic and diabetic people. Cinnamon combined with magnesium, diet and lifestyle changes may lead to overall reductions in blood pressure. Data from 22 trials with magnesium supplements revealed that the mineral may reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure, researchers from the University of Hertfordshire report in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Combined with diet and lifestyle changes, magnesium and cinnamon supplementation may lead to an overall reduction of up to 25mm Hg more than any hypertension medication in the world with the advantage of no adverse effects.

Even Cinnamon Alone Will Reduce Blood Pressure

Valued in ancient times as currency and once considered more precious than gold, cinnamon has been used in medicine to treat everything from nausea to menstruation, to even diabetes.

“Cinnamon itself has insulin-like activity and also can potentiate the activity of insulin. The latter could be quite important in treating those with type 2 diabetes. Cinnamon has a bio-active component that we believe has the potential to prevent or overcome diabetes,” researcher Don Graves said in a prepared statement.

When it comes to the highest antioxidant values on the ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) scale, cinnamon comes in the top 10. ORAC units or “ORAC score” were developed by the National Institute on Aging in the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

While the exact relationship between the ORAC value of a food and its health benefit has not been established, it is believed that foods higher on the ORAC scale will more effectively neutralize free radicals. According to the free-radical theory of aging, this will slow the oxidative processes and free radical damage that can contribute to age-related degeneration and disease.

Numerous studies have reported that cinnamon and the compounds it contains may improve parameters associated with diabetes. The meta-analysis, performed by scientists from the University of Toronto (Canada), the University of West London (UK), and London South Bank University (UK) is said to be the first to evaluate the effects of cinnamon on blood pressure in diabetics.

Cinnamon alone without any diet and lifestyle changes is associated with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 5.39 and 2.6 mmHg, report scientists in Nutrition.

Out of a possible 93 identified studies, Dr Akilen and his co-workers limited their meta-analysis to only three randomized clinical trials, two of which included diabetics while the third was with pre-diabetics.

The doses of cinnamon used in the studies ranged from 500 mg to 2.4 grams per day, and all the studies lasted for 12 weeks.

Crunching the numbers yielded the result that cinnamon intake was associated with significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Commenting on the potential mechanisms of action, Dr Akilen and his co-workers said that a recent review had “confirmed that cinnamon and components of cinnamon have been shown to have beneficial effects on virtually all of the factors associated with metabolic syndrome, including insulin sensitivity, glucose, lipids, antioxidants, inflammation, blood pressure, and body weight.”

“In summary, this meta-analysis of three RCTs indicates that the consumption of cinnamon (short term) is associated with notable reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with prediabetes and [type-2 diabetes],” they wrote.

“However, the precise relationship between blood pressure regulation and the effect of cinnamon in humans remains unclear and to be established in future studies.”

The Real Cause Of Osteoporosis

The cause of osteoporosis, however, might not be a calcium deficiency but something you might not have considered: scurvy.

The human body doesn’t create vitamin C, which is why it’s referred to as an “essential” vitamin. This one nutrient is vitally important for proper functioning of the immune system and—you guessed it—maintenance of healthy bones.

Treating Osteoporosis

With a diagnosis of osteoporosis comes calcium supplementation and often a prescription of a bisphosphonate like Actonel, Fosamax, or Reclast. As with all pharmaceuticals, this type of drug can have serious adverse side effects: kidney dysfunction, eye inflammation, esophageal cancer, and chronic pain (1).

Bisphosphonates are effective in preventing further loss of bone mass by inhibiting the re-absorption of bone cells by binding to calcium. They therefore affect the usability and availability of calcium by bones, serving only a temporary solution against bone fracture. Long-term use of these medications is under review and the accumulated evidence suggests use should be limited, if prescribed at all.

The prescription of calcium supplements for people with osteoporosis can do more harm than good, especially when taken with a bisphosphonate. Too much calcium in the body will clump together, lining arteries and organs. We know the result when that happens: heart attack, stroke, and kidney and gallstones.

Another culprit for calcification.

Hypertension is often treated with a thiazide diuretic to reduce fluids in the body and dilate blood vessels. A side effect of this type of drug is the retention of calcium and loss of magnesium and potassium. Without nutritional balance, bones suffer and calcification elsewhere can occur.

Critical Vitamins for Strong Bones

Vitamin C prevents and treats osteoporosis by promoting collagen production, healing fractures, and making bones denser through the creation of new bone cells called osteoblasts (2). With inadequate levels of vitamin C, bone cells degrade. There have been studies that show a correlation of low levels of vitamin C in people who suffer bone fractures (3). Vitamin C is a formidable antioxidant; it’s oxidation that causes cells to age. Find a list of foods rich in vitamin C here.

Vitamin K is also critical for bone health. Found in leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables, fermented dairy, egg yolks, and meat, this vitamin is responsible for building bone proteins. Vitamin D3 is necessary for cells to absorb calcium, which is why it’s added to processed foods. When there is enough calcium in the bones, vitamin D helps bone cells to absorb the other necessary minerals (magnesium and phosphorus) to maintain density (4).

Weight-bearing exercises are good not only for your muscles but the bones under them. Regular lifting of weights and/or resistance training will exercise your bones and inhibit density loss.

Supplementation

It’s easier to swallow a pill than to plan your meals around a variety of foods to gain proper nutrition. If the cause of osteoporosis is a vitamin deficiency, then taking a supplement may seem the best thing to do if you are at risk.

But be wary of dietary supplements:

Synthetic vitamins don’t metabolize like nutrients from food (5)
Other ingredients in supplements can cause adverse reactions
Supplements can contain non-medicinal ingredients like aspartame, genetically-modified organisms, sorbitol, sugars, and other hazardous substances—read the label (6)
Nutrients often depend on other nutrients to work inside the body properly—you don’t want to create an imbalance by supplementing one particular nutrient without knowing the big picture.
Some supplements are contraindicated with certain medications; if you are taking anything, consult your healthcare provider or nutritionist before self-medicating.
Vitamin supplements aren’t regulated in the United States. Do your research so you know exactly what you’re taking.
Emergen-C is a popular vitamin C supplement. Don’t use it. Ascorbic acid is one component of what is referred to as “vitamin C” and is the active ingredient in this supplement. Other  harmful ingredients in Emergen-C include fructose [sugar], maltodextrin [sugar], silicon dioxide, and “natural flavors”.) Without the other phytochemicals that occur naturally to form the complex of the nutrient, there is the potential to overdose on ascorbic acid and cause damage. While it’s true that you can’t overdose on vitamin C (your body will eliminate any excess), ascorbic acid isn’t the same thing. If you like the convenience of a powder, you can peel some oranges, allow them to dry, and grind them up.
If you opt for a supplement, choose one that is made from whole foods.

As we age, our nutritional needs become even more important, as caloric intake may decrease and the body takes longer to heal. If you have osteoporosis or are at risk to develop it, a simple vitamin deficiency may be the cause.

Check your diet and incorporate more foods with the nutrients you require. You can find a list of vitamin C foods here, along with a discussion on this essential nutrient.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 21, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/4-ways-eating-turmeric-transforms-fat-storing-cell-into-fat-burning-ones/,4 Ways Eating Turmeric Transforms Regular Fat-Storing Cells Into Fat-Burning Ones,"You may have heard about how turmeric might revolutionize cancer treatment. The spice is already known to treat or prevent over 600 medical conditions. Studies consistently show that it outperforms certain medications in term of versatility, availability, non-toxicity and efficacy. A recent study published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry has found that turmeric fights obesity by modifying fat cells (1). Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric is capable of inducing browning of white fat cells.

Tropical Loophole Dissolves 2½ lbs In 24 Hours
Brown Fat Cells Vs. White Fat Cells

Fat cells differ in color because of their density of iron-filled mitochondria. Brown fat cells simply have many more and as a result are metabolically more active than white fat cells. While brown fat cells burn off calories to produce heat, white fat cells simply store energy.

Overweight and obese people tend to have a surplus of white fat. In normal human development, white fat levels should peak in infancy, not adulthood. In fact, belly fat increases risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes (2). Watch the following video to learn more about brown fat.

Curcurmin Promotes Brown Fat

In the study, called “Curcumin induces brown fat-like phenotype in 3T3-L1 and primary white adipocytes” scientists describe how curcumin affects fat cells:

By enhancing the expression of genes specific to brown fat cells. Through a process called nutrigenomic “epigenetic modification,” curcumin is capable of altering a cell’s patterns of gene expression resulting in significant changes in the structure and function of the cells involved.
By encouraging new mitochondria production.
By increasing protein levels of lipase and p-acyl-CoA carboxylase, two enzymes responsible for lipolysis (breakdown of fat) and by suppressing lipogenesis.
By increasing the activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase enzyme. This enzyme helps regulate metabolic homeostasis, which is often out of balance in obese individuals.

Turmeric has been proven to be as effective as prescription drugs in treating depression and comparable to exercise in maintaining cardiovascular health (3, 4). A recent study also found that it is potent in preventing the progression of prediabetes into diabetes in 100% of subjects studied (5).

Tumeric is super versatile in the kitchen. Use it in soups, rice, salad dressing and as  vegetable seasoning. You can also try drinking golden milk.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/heart-attack-symptoms/,Top 8 Heart Attack Symptoms You Need to Know,"A heart attack occurs when a part of the heart muscle doesn’t receive enough blood. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), every 36 seconds, one person dies from a heart attack in the United States. (1) While chest pain and shortness of breath are the most common heart attack symptoms, there are silent symptoms that you may not notice. Let’s look at the top eight common symptoms of a heart attack, including the subtle ones.

1. Dizziness

The feeling of dizziness is prevalent among aged people. While it’s mainly caused by tiredness and not usually life-threatening, dizziness can be a sign of a heart attack or stroke. You can also experience other symptoms like nausea and shortness of breath or even faint.

Although men may get dizzy before a heart attack, this symptom is a more common sign in women.

Be sure to seek immediate medical attention if you feel dizzy. Drink a cup of water or eat some vitamin D-rich foods like spinach or nuts to ease the symptom when waiting for medical help.

2. Shortness of Breath

According to The Heart Foundation, shortness of breath is more prevalent in men than women. While this symptom doesn’t always show cardiac problems, it’s one of the most common heart attack symptoms. (2)

The research showed that the possibility of experiencing this symptom depends on the person’s weight, mental health, and other factors. (3)

Although a healthy diet can help manage shortness of breath, it’s not recommended to eat anything during this period. Ensure you stay outdoors or open your windows to let fresh air in.

3. Severe Chest Pain

Chest pain is a common heart disease sign. The tissues don’t get enough blood because of the insufficient blood flow to the heart muscles caused by a blocked coronary artery.

This symptom lasts for several seconds or minutes and is as common in men as in women. Men are more likely to have chest discomfort, whereas most women experience heartburn.

One study revealed that chest pain is the most common complaint during heart attacks. Like other symptoms, this pain isn’t always associated with a heart attack. If you often experience chest pain, talk to your doctor to find out the root cause. (4)

4. Tingling or Discomfort in Neck, Jaw, or Other Body Parts

When a heart attack occurs, the pain can also occur in the back, jaw, neck, throat, or arm. This pain is more common in men than in women and, in most cases, isn’t linked to a heart attack. It doesn’t mean you should ignore it, though. (2)

The pain in these areas can either be a sharp sensation or a dull ache. These body parts are usually the first places to be affected during a heart attack. When observing these pains, look out for subsequent symptoms and seek medical support immediately.

5. Unexplained Tiredness

If you notice you feel exhausted after performing your usual daily tasks like climbing stairs or taking walks, it’s a sign of an underlying heart problem. This occurs because your heart is working harder to pump blood. Women are more likely to experience unexplained tiredness than men.

Chronic fatigue has nothing to do with unexplained tiredness, though. Although you require medical attention to correct this heart disease symptom, eating nuts (e.g., cashews and almonds) and seeds (e.g., pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds), and drinking lots of water will help you beat fatigue.

6. Cardiac Rhythm Disturbances

Abnormal heartbeats, also known as arrhythmia, are a common heart disease symptom in both men and women. You might notice that your heart is beating faster or irregularly, and in most cases, you will also get dizzy. Whether this disturbance is associated with a heart attack or not, you still need to get medical attention.

During an attack, you might not experience a change in your heartbeat. However, during attacks caused by infarction (tissue death due to blood supply failure) of the right coronary artery, the heart rate might slow down. Other factors like medication or underlying conditions can affect heart rate.

Irregular heartbeats can happen during panic attacks, too. You can fix your irregular heartbeat by taking deep breaths and keeping calm to avoid stress and anxiety. While dieting can help prevent an attack, it may not be enough to reduce it. To prevent this symptom, cut down on caffeine (coffee) and alcohol intake and smoke less.

7. Unexplained Sweating 

People who are about to experience a heart attack have unexplained sweating. This cold sweat symptom is more prevalent in women.

Unexplained sweating is called diaphoresis, a prevalent symptom of a heart attack. It’s caused by the activation of your sympathetic nervous system to compensate for the decrease in the strength of your heartbeat caused by heart disease.

However, the sympathetic nervous system increases the heart rate and force of heart contraction. Other symptoms like excessive sweating and dry mouth also appear.

One way to manage this symptom is by drinking a lot of water and incorporating sweat-reducing foods like bananas and sweet potatoes into your diet.

8. Nausea and Vomiting

Researchers have provided several theories on the cause of vomiting associated with heart attacks.

The heart cells from the damaged areas because of poor blood supply release lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and other metabolites. These metabolites cause stimulation that leads to vomiting. (5)

Although various theories exist, they all conclude that vomiting and nausea are heart attack symptoms. Seek medical attention when you notice this symptom. But you can also control and relieve these symptoms by drinking clear or ice-cold drinks, eating light foods, and getting lots of rest.

What Should You Do If You Notice Any of These Symptoms?

Reach out to someone nearby to call emergency services, or do it yourself if you can. You may feel awake and capable of driving yourself to the hospital, but a heart attack can cause you severe pain. If you can’t wait for the emergency services, ask someone to drive you.

After you call for emergency services, you might have to answer questions about your allergies and the medications that you’re currently taking. If you have no allergy to aspirin, you will be asked to chew on it or ingest nitroglycerin tablets to stabilize the condition until help arrives.

Final Words

Sometimes it’s hard to detect heart attack symptoms. One thing you can do to prepare in case of a heart attack is to have medically prescribed aspirin or nitroglycerin in your home. Although a heart attack is life-threatening, these medications can help you feel better.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/soak-chia-seeds-to-supercharge-your-metabolism/,"Soak Chia Seeds To Supercharge Your Metabolism, Burn Fat And Fight Inflammation","You may have heard about chia pets, the adorable children’s toy made from sprouted seeds. These beloved toys are actually powered by chia seeds, which give them lush green hair. Surprisingly enough, the seeds have grown popular over the last few years for their overwhelming amount of healthy compounds.

What Are Chia Seeds?

Chia seeds are little black seeds commonly found in health food stores. The seeds originate from Mexico, although Aztecs, Mayans, Incans and Native Americans commonly consumed the seed throughout Central and South America (1).

The name “chia” is said to come from the Mayan word for strength. The seeds are harvested from a plant formally known as Salvia hispanica, which is a member of the mint family (2).

Why Should You Eat Chia Seeds?

The seeds contain 5 grams of fiber per tablespoon of whole seeds. This fiber bulks up your stool, helps digestion and helps you feel more full (3). They are also chock-full of omega-3, manganese, phosphorus and protein (4).

Controls Blood Sugar

Chia gel is often used in desserts to slow the digestion of sugars by creating a barrier between carbohydrates and digestive enzymes. This results in a steady release of energy instead of sugar highs and crashes, which is particularly helpful for diabetics. Try it in pudding or fruit yogurt !

Keeps you Hydrated

Because chia seeds can absorb so much water, they help your body retain water and electrolytes, which is great for athletes and active children. If you’re going to be speding a day out in the sun, have some chia gel at breakfast and drink plenty of water to keep you safe from heat stroke.

Easy to Digest

Chis seeds are easily digested and absorbed by your digestive tract. Most of ther nutrients they contain are water-soluble, so soaked seeds are even easier for your body to process.

Cleans your Intestines

Chia seeds bulk up stool sweep through your digestive tract to clear away any old debris. It also helps dislodge anything that may be stuck along the way. In fact, chia is often used to keep patient regular and prevent constipation.

Inexpensive

Chia seeds are well-priced for what they contain. A 1lb bags costs roughly $8-10 and 2 ounces of dry chia seeds makes about 17 ounces of gel. That’s 1$ per 17 ounces of gel, which typically lasts 4 days. No other superfood costs so little.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 17, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-causes-of-leg-cramps/,5 causes of leg cramps and 3 ways to stop the pain quickly,"Many people experience leg cramps at night. This can be caused by a lack of calcium, but it may also be because of other factors such as potassium and magnesium levels, the position you sleep in, how tired you are, the temperature, and your overall health. Let’s look at 5 causes of leg cramps and 3 tricks you can use to stop the pain quickly.

1. Calcium deficiency

If you are deficient in calcium, you may experience muscle cramps and spasms. This is because calcium helps muscles contract and relax. Without calcium, the muscles cannot maintain their normal tone, which can lead to aches, cramps, spasms, and muscle weakness.

2. Sleeping position

Nighttime leg cramps may be related to foot position. We often sleep with our feet and toes pointing away from the rest of our bodies. This position called plantar flexion shortens the calf muscles, making them more susceptible to cramping.

If you cover yourself with heavy bedding, it may stop blood from flowing back to your lower limbs. This can cause acidic metabolites to accumulate and lead to calf cramps.

3. Too tired

Overexertion of the body, such as after high-intensity exercise or excessive exercise, can lead to continuous muscle contraction in a short period. This anaerobic exercise of the muscles produces a lot of acidic metabolites, and the accumulation can stimulate calf cramps.

4. Too cold or too hot

If your muscles are too cold, or if it’s too hot outside and you’re sweating a lot, you can lose a lot of magnesium and potassium. This can cause an imbalance in your body that might make it easier for you to get muscle cramps.

5. Disease

Cramps may occur when there is a decline in liver function, when you have hypothyroidism, parathyroidism, motor neuron disease, and when you take certain blood pressure and lipid-lowering medications.

Next, let’s look at 3 ways you can quickly relieve the pain from leg cramps.

Many people have felt sudden cramps in their legs. The pain feels like “ants crawling” to that of electrocution when gradually amplified. If you do not relieve it, the pain can last as long as a few minutes. This makes people sweat, grit their teeth, and curl up their bodies. However, the cramps can be relieved by following these 3 tips to help you soothe the muscles quickly.

1. Hot compress

If you have a leg cramp, use a hot towel to help reduce the pain. You can then massage the area to further relieve the leg cramp.

2. Stretching

Many people’s first reaction to leg cramps is to bend their legs, but this practice will intensify the pain. The correct approach should be to straighten the leg or stand straight up immediately. If you cannot act on your own, you can also seek someone else to stretch your big toe with your hands.

3. Feet facing opposite each other

When the leg cramps, you can place your two feet facing opposite each other. This can also play the role of stretching and relieving leg cramps.

Besides getting more calcium to prevent cramps, it is also important to pay attention to sleeping posture and avoid fatigue, as well as to consider whether the cramps are caused by disease and give timely treatment to avoid causing further deterioration and other critical problems.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 17, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/worst-foods-for-high-blood-pressure/,Top 10 Worst Foods for High Blood Pressure,"Healthy blood pressure promotes heart health, lowering the risk of stroke and heart attack. Diet choices are among the most critical factors to consider if you experience blood pressure spikes. While there’s medicine that might help control hypertension, why not alter your diet to help you control high blood pressure naturally? Bring your blood pressure down and optimize your health by avoiding these 10 worst foods for high blood pressure:

1. Deli Meat Is a Real Sodium Bomb

High intake of salt is linked with high blood pressure and cardiovascular problems. (1) Deli meat is loaded with sodium, which manufacturers used to preserve this meat. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that 2 slices of bologna have as much as 910 mg of sodium. (2)

If you add other foods high in salt, including pickles, cheese, bread, and other condiments, your sandwich might become a true sodium bomb. If you suffer from hypertension, avoid eating deli meat at all costs.

2. Canned Tomato Products Affect Blood Pressure

The salt content of most canned tomato sauces, pasta sauces, and tomato juices is extremely high. Since sodium elevates the amount of fluid in the blood, it increases your blood pressure, too. For instance, there’s 566 mg of sodium in a single serving of marinara sauce and 615 mg in a cup of tomato juice. (3, 4)

While it’s best to eat fresh tomatoes, you can still enjoy canned products. Just ensure you opt for reduced- or low-sodium canned tomato products. These products don’t affect your blood pressure and contain powerful antioxidants, such as lycopene.

3. Red Meat Is Harmful to Hypertensive People

Studies have found that red meat like pork, lamb, beef can trigger high blood pressure. (5) When the body metabolizes red meat, it may also produce substances that raise blood pressure even higher. Opt for leaner cuts or limit your red meat consumption to a minimum.

People with frequent and drastic blood pressure spikes should eliminate red meat from their diets.

4. Sugary Foods Up the Risk for High Blood Pressure

There are a few ways daily sugar consumption can impact your blood pressure. One study revealed that sugar-sweetened drinks and sugar itself increase the risk of weight gain in kids and adults alike. (6) Overweight people often experience high blood pressure and other symptoms. (7)

Added sugar has the potential to raise blood pressure directly. According to a study, cutting sugar by 2.3 teaspoons can lower systolic blood pressure by 8.4 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.7 mm Hg in women with high blood pressure. (8)

5. Ramen Noodles Do little for Your Health

The sodium in ramen noodles may trigger high blood pressure, increasing the likelihood of stroke and heart disease. Ramen noodles contain 2/3 the daily FDA-suggested sodium intake–about 1,820 milligrams. Eating ramen noodles regularly can double your combined salt consumption for the day/week and you might not even notice it. The more you consume, the bigger your risk of hypertension.

Highly processed foods like ramen noodles are packed with saturated and trans fat. There are 4 grams of saturated fat in one package. Trans fats are artificial fats that extend the shelf life and stability of packaged foods.

A study suggested that trans fats increase bad (LDL) cholesterol and decrease good (HDL) cholesterol levels, which can contribute to hypertension development. (9) Trans fats in ramen noodles are also bad for your heart health. Saturated fats have also been shown to elevate the LDL cholesterol levels in the blood. (10)

6. Canned Soups Are Sky-High in Sodium

When compared with ramen noodles, a serving of canned soup may seem to be a healthier option. In reality, stay away from this soup if you’re monitoring your blood pressure.

One can of veggie or chicken soup contains 2,140 mg of sodium while a can of tomato soup has 1,110 mg. (11, 12) There are low sodium and unsalted, sodium-free canned soups that you can choose instead. However, it’s best to cook your own soup and freeze it in portions if needed.

7. Frozen Pizza Makes Your Sodium Consumption Skyrocket

The ingredients in frozen pizzas can literally make your sodium consumption skyrocket! Apart from sodium, frozen pizza is loaded with sugar and saturated fat, which contribute to high blood pressure.

Besides the cheese and tomato sauce, processed meats in frozen pizza supply your body with an outrageous amount of salt. Manufacturers also add salt to enhance the pizza’s flavor. One frozen 12-inch pepperoni pizza has 3,140 mg of salt, which is significantly above the daily allowance of 2,300 mg. (13)

If possible, make your own pizza with low-sodium cheese and zero deli meat. Try making your own homemade dough and top your pizza with a variety of vegetables.

8. Alcohol Can Raise Your Blood Pressure

Frequent alcohol intake has been found to elevate blood pressure and result in different medical conditions. (14) If you suffer from hypertension, it’s recommended to eliminate any alcohol from your life.

Doctors say that alcohol can cause drug interactions and stop blood pressure medications from working effectively. (15)

Most alcoholic beverages contain sugar. According to one Canadian study, there’s a link between alcohol consumption and obesity. (16) Both factors increase the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.

9. French fries Offer Unfortunate Health Risks

Potatoes fried to golden perfection definitely taste fantastic. However, your blood pressure won’t thank you for them. French fries are loaded with salt and fat, which can cause blood sugar spikes, belly fat, elevated blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels.

Scientists from Harvard Medical School studied over 187,000 males and females over three studies and discovered that individuals who ate four or more portions of French fries per week had a 17 percent increased risk of high blood pressure. (17)

If you love French fries, you can make a healthier version by baking those spuds instead of frying them. The baking method lets you reduce the amount of oil that is typically used during frying.

10. Salad Dressing Has One Surprise Ingredient

You might not realize it, but there’s a strong chance you’ll discover one surprise ingredient in your favorite store-bought salad dressing: high fructose corn syrup. You’re more likely to develop obesity and high blood pressure if your diet is abundant in sugar, particularly HFCS.

According to one study, consuming a lot of fructose from added sugar raises your chance of having high blood pressure. (18) So, if your blood pressure is already high, adding extra sugar to meals you don’t even notice you’re eating would just make matters worse.

Final Thoughts

High blood pressure is a worldwide epidemic. Studies have shown that consuming a balanced diet will help you lower your blood pressure. Unaddressed high blood pressure can harm your circulatory system and lead to more serious problems, including heart attack and stroke.

Potassium-rich foods can significantly lower blood pressure because potassium counteracts the effects of sodium. The DASH diet is often recommended for managing blood pressure. It involves low-fat dairy, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein to aid in decreasing blood pressure and maintaining healthy levels.

Reduced-sodium, no-sodium, or trans fat-free canned or processed foods are the best choices. If you’ve used to eat frozen meals, consider cooking your own ones and freeze for months.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/people-with-heart-problems-should-avoid-these-4-things/,People with heart problems should avoid these 4 things to reduce stimulation to the heart,"The body can stay healthy only if the vital organs function normally. Many people don’t know how to keep their heart healthy, or avoid behaviors that hurt the heart. Once the heart is damaged, it becomes difficult for other parts of the body to function properly. This can lead to angina, arrhythmia, breathing problems and other health issues.

To keep the body healthy, it is important to avoid these behaviors and seek medical attention if necessary. Let’s look at the 4 behaviors that can hurt your heart.

1. Getting angry frequently

Getting angry or excited often can be bad for your heart. Emotional changes can cause physical harm, and if you stay negative for a long time, it will have a negative impact on your heart. Sometimes people have a heart attack suddenly and this is related to their behavior.

The increase in adrenaline secretion after being angry may cause blood pressure to fluctuate. When blood pressure is too high, the blood vessels around the heart are damaged. This can reduce the normal blood supply to the heart and its function. For the sake of your health, train yourself to stay calm.

2. Binge drinking and overeating

If you want to prevent heart damage, it is important not to overeat. Some people have chronic diseases when they get older and their body indicators are unstable. The arteries around the heart can gradually become atherosclerotic, which means that blood circulation cannot be maintained. Overeating or not knowing how to moderate the diet can increase blood viscosity.

High blood lipids cause the blood vessels to become clogged or narrowed. The heart will then be deprived of blood and oxygen, which in turn damages it. Want to protect your heart and improve your digestive system? You’ll do well to eat in moderation and chew slowly.

3. Staying up late frequently

Avoid staying up late for long periods of time as this hurts the heart. More people are dying from heart problems caused by staying up late for a long duration – a habit that increases the burden on the heart. Your heart and other organs in your body need enough rest time to function properly.

People working long hours are more likely to have health problems. The brain function decreases and heart rate increases when the body is tired. It is important to get a good night’s sleep and wake up early, as this helps your heart rate stay normal.

4. Strenuous exercise

Exercise is good for the heart because it improves resistance, promotes circulation, and increases metabolism. However, if you do too much strenuous exercise, it can actually be harmful to your heart. When you do strenuous exercises, your heart needs more oxygen. The amount of blood your heart needs increases, but your heart can’t get enough oxygen in a timely manner. This can cause chest tightness and make it hard to breathe.

Start by doing exercises slowly before you escalate the intensity. Do it slowly so that your heart can handle it.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 15, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-symptoms-to-remind-you-to-eat-less-salt/,The body will show 5 symptoms to remind you to eat less salt,"When you eat too much salt, your body will send you warning signals to remind you it is time to control your salt intake.

1. Dry mouth

When you eat too much salt, the most direct feeling is a dry mouth, because the electrolyte balance of salt and water in the body is broken. In order to adjust this balance back to normal, the brain will send out thirst signals, so you have a strong desire to drink water.

2. Slowed reaction

Eating too much salt can lead to cell dehydration. When a person is dehydrated, the brain is affected, thus slowing your reaction and reducing focus.

3. Thicker fingers

If you are not gaining weight, but your fingers feel thicker, it is possible that you are eating too much salt. This can cause water retention and edema.

4. Headache

Eating too much salt can raise blood pressure and blood vessel pressure. This can cause cerebral edema, which is when the nerves are squeezed and results in a headache.

5. Urge to urinate

If you eat too much salt, your kidneys have to work harder to get rid of the extra sodium. This makes you want to go to the bathroom more often.

Watch out for these symptoms. If you eat too much salt, it is important to control your salt intake in order to avoid health problems.

Next, what exactly are the dangers of eating too much salt?

First, let’s be clear: excessive intake of salt (sodium chloride) may indeed pose certain threats to your health.

1. Increase the pressure on the kidneys

Sodium is mainly excreted by the kidneys after it enters the body. If you eat too much sodium, it can make the kidneys work harder. This can cause sodium and water retention, which makes the kidneys work even harder. Over time, this can make the kidneys overwhelmed and sick.

2. Blood pressure is likely to rise

If you eat too much salt, it may lead to high blood pressure. When you eat too much sodium, the number of sodium ions in your blood goes up. This makes the blood vessels more resistant to blood flow, which can cause water retention and an increase in blood pressure.

3. Accelerate calcium loss

If you eat too much salt over a long period of time, your body will get rid of sodium and calcium at the same time. This can lead to excessive calcium loss over time.

If not replenished in time, the sodium will stimulate the secretion of parathyroid hormone, disrupting the balance of bone metabolism, which can ultimately enhance the risk of osteoporosis in the future.

Therefore, controlling salt intake is still important for your health. But note: low salt does not mean your food will taste terrible. You can reduce the amount of salt you use in cooking by 5-10%, and it won’t affect the taste but will be good for your health.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 14, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/hand-numbness/,People who often experience hand numbness need to watch out for these 4 problems,"Many people experience hand numbness in their lives. This can be caused by maintaining a certain posture for a long time, such as lying on the arm during lunch break or after waking up. It is normal for blood not to circulate easily in these situations. But regular hand numbness may also be a sign of a disease, so we should be alert. This is especially true for older people, because frequent hand numbness could be a sign of atherosclerosis.

As we get older, our blood circulation slows down and our blood vessels become harder. This can lead to atherosclerosis, which causes the body to feel dizzy and numb. If we have poor lifestyle habits, these problems can get worse. So it’s important not to ignore any symptoms.

People who often experience hand numbness should watch out for these 4 problems.

1. Brain infarction

The elderly are more likely to experience brain infarction. This happens when the body’s organs change and degenerate as people get older. The blood flow slows down, which can lead to age-related diseases and metabolic diseases.

Before a person has a brain infarction, they may experience numbness and pain in their hands and feet. They may also have an irregular heartbeat. So we should pay attention to this and not ignore it.

We can prevent brain infarction by eating more fresh vegetables and fruits, maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and developing good habits.

2. Carpal tunnel syndrome

People are getting more and more stressed out. This is because many people have to work overtime and stay up late. Some people need to sit at the computer desk to type, and cramps will occur after a long time.

Some people who like to play video games also experience numb wrist symptoms. These symptoms can often include hand numbness. If the symptoms persist even after you apply anti-inflammatory cream, seek medical attention as soon as possible because you may have carpal tunnel syndrome.

3. Diabetes

People with diabetes have high blood sugar levels, which can lead to numbness in the hands and other symptoms. This happens because the increase in blood sugar damages the nerves, which can then affect different organs in the body.

Besides numbness in the hands, there is also a sensation of pins and needles or a feeling of many ants crawling inside the hands. These symptoms show that the blood sugar in the body is elevated and measures need to be taken to lower it.

4. Stroke

A stroke occurs when the blood vessels in the brain become blocked and blood and oxygen cannot be supplied to the brain. This can cause problems with the brain’s function.

The major symptoms of a stroke are numbness in the hands, dizziness, and severe pain in the feet when walking. It is important to be alert to these signs so you can get help if needed.

The brain controls your life activities. When a stroke occurs, there will be symptoms of numbness in the hands, along with dizziness and severe pain in the feet when walking, so it is important to be alert to the occurrence of stroke in life.

If you feel numbness in your hands, here are two “moves” you can do.
1. Rub the “eight evil” (baxie) pressure points

The “eight evil” (baxie) pressure points are on the back of the hand between the 1 – 5th finger intersection, 8 points on left and right hands. (see diagram)

When massaging the baxie points, keep the five fingers open, cross your hands, and rub your fingers together. If the hand numbness is more serious, then the massage should be strengthened to stimulate the acupuncture points.

2. Arm combing

Combing the arm is to use one hand to stroke the other arm from top to bottom from bottom to top. This can assist the blood in the arm between the push to restore blood circulation and improve the symptoms of hand numbness.

This technique is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. “Comb your arm” from the location of the pulse in the hand, to the end of the shoulder armpit, back and forth about 10 times a day, to reduce hand numbness.

Many people experience numbness in the hands. We should look at our own symptoms and circumstances to figure out what is causing the numbness. We should also take care to protect our hands in daily life, and if necessary, to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Do not take a chance on these insignificant symptoms; they may hide something more serious.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 13, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/just-one-teaspoon-of-this-pantry-staple-lowers-cholesterol-levels/,One teaspoon of this pantry staple lowers cholesterol levels,"When it comes to protecting your heart, some of nature’s best solutions can be found in your pantry. That’s because a big part of managing your cholesterol levels is choosing the right foods to eat. In fact, some foods more than others can help improve your overall cholesterol profile.

According to a new study done by researchers from the Cardiff Metropolitan University, just one teaspoon (10g) of a popular condiment each day has been found to help reduce cholesterol levels by 10 percent.

The study presented at the European Federation of Food Science and Technology recruited 51 participants who were aged between 40-70 years old and either overweight or clinically obese. All participants were asked to consume 10g of wholegrain mustard either on a small cracker or by itself before bed each evening for 12 weeks.

At the end of study, researchers found that 86% of participants experienced a significant drop in either their blood glucose levels or cholesterol levels, and in some cases a decline in both.

This new research suggests that people with high cholesterol levels can improve their condition by having one teaspoon of wholegrain mustard each day. This is especially useful for individuals at greater risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and vascular dementia.

The 10 percent mark is the same cholesterol reduction you would normally see if someone followed a low-fat diet, the research reports.

But lowering cholesterol isn’t the only health benefit of wholegrain mustard. The study also found that when eaten every day, wholegrain mustard can also help lower blood sugar levels.

As many of you already know, having high blood sugar levels for prolonged periods of time is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes.

Adding wholegrain mustard to your diet can be as simple as just using it as a condiment. Here are some delicious ways on how to consume more mustard:

1. Make your own homemade salad dressing using olive oil and wholegrain mustard. Not only is this much healthier than the ones you buy in stores but it’s easy and quick to make.

2. Mustard also works well with fish. Take one part honey, one part wholegrain mustard, olive oil, a dash of lemon juice and salt mix, and pour over salmon fillets before baking.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"February 7, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-cleanse-your-lungs-in-72-hours/,How To Effectively Cleanse Your Lungs In Just 72 Hours,"The start of the industrial revolution brought about the rise of airborne pollution. These last few hundred years have dramatically increased the number of toxic substances in the air you breathe inside and outside your home. (Feb 3, 2022)

Since your lungs can only filter out so much, it’s good to clear them up every once in a while to maximize your oxygen intake. It goes without saying that you should also avoid smoking and highly polluted areas to keep your lungs healthy.

How To Cleanse Your Lungs

Follow these 7 steps daily for 3 full days to get the best results. If you live in the city, you may want to repeat the cleanse every month. Small-town dwellers probably don’t need to do it more than once every 3 months. You can also implement some of these habits in your daily or weekly routine to maintain optimal lung health.

1. Avoid Milk Products

Most cows in the United States are treated with hormones to increase milk production. One of the most common hormones in milk is IGF-1 which is a factor in the development of breast, prostate, colon, lung, and other cancers (1).

Certain breeds of cows produce milk containing a protein called beta-CM-7. This protein can stimulate mucus glands in both your digestive- and respiratory tracts. Milk containing the beta-CM-7 protein could therefore very well stimulate phlegm — particularly in people who suffer from chronic lung conditions. (source)

Milk allergy is also one of the most common and undiagnosed food sensitivities. Continued exposure in sensitive individuals trigger inflammatory response and can weaken the immune system (2).

“In all respiratory conditions, mucous-forming dairy foods, such as milk and cheese, can exacerbate clogging of the lungs and should be avoided,” writes Professor Gary Null in his “Complete Encyclopedia of Natural Healing.”

Very simply, when more mucus accumulates in the lungs than can be expelled, asthma attacks develop. (source)

2. Try Herbal Tea

Enjoying a good cup of tea can help break up mucus, expel chest congestion and soothe inflamed airways (3). For regular lung support, grab a cup of eucalyptus, lungwort, oregano, plantain leaf, elecampane, lobelia, chaparral, peppermint or osha root.

They can prevent oxidative damage in the lungs and breathing in the steam of your herbal tea as you drink it can help relieve tired lungs (4). Drink a cup two hours before bed to clear the toxins you’ve breathed in throughout the day and help you relax before bed.

3. Drink Grapefruit Juice

Grapefruit contains two powerful antioxidants: Lycopene and Naringin. In particular, lycopene may play a role in the prevention of lung cancer and can also help in the management of asthma symptoms (6,7).

Naringin, on the other hand, attenuates the development of carrageenan-induced acute lung inflammation, prevents lung lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury and protects against paraquat-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis (8,9,10).

4. Make Fresh Carrot Juice

For clear lungs, drink a glass of fresh carrot juice between breakfast and lunch. You can also add a bit of ginger and beets to make it even more delicious and nutritious.

Low concentrations of vitamins A, C, and E have been associated with development of lung cancer (11). Carrots are one of the vegetables with the highest levels of vitamin A and contain substantial levels of these other vitamins, making it a great lung-protecting elixir (12).

5. Take Cranberry Juice

Cranberries helps fight bacteria in the lungs that can cause infections. It’s also been shown to inhibit the growth and spread of several types of human tumor cells in vitro, including those of lung, cervix, leukemia and prostate cancer (13).

Cranberry juice also helps clear the kidneys and urinary tract and prevent bacterial infection to help them effectively expel toxins via urine (14).

6. Use Natural Cures

Don’t rely on toxic drugs and cough medicine, these drugs can impact the liver’s ability to detoxify your body and lead to toxic build-up in the lungs. Instead, try mother nature’s safe alternatives.

If your chest is feeling tight but not painful, take a little pine needle syrup and enjoy alongside a cup of hot water to quickly ease inflammation in your lungs.

7. Enjoy Steam Baths

Steam baths can help restore moisture in the nasal passages and reduce inflammation in respiratory tract.

Warm water around your chest also loosens up phlegm caught in the lungs. Take a bath with eucalyptus oil and soak for 10-15 minutes or tie a small muslin pouch of dried eucalyptus and hang it in your shower. Eucalyptus steam opens up your airway and encourages your body to expel more toxins as you exhale.

You can also run a hot bath with some Epsom salts and a few drop of eucalyptus oil. Make sure that the bath is warm but not uncomfortable. You should also see steam rising from the water.

If you’re feeling a little stressed or anxious, try these essential oils instead to help you relax and open up your lungs.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/prevent-hair-loss-and-promote-regrowth/,Top 12 Ways to Prevent Hair Loss and Promote Regrowth,"Do you worry about hair loss, and are looking to restore your hair? Today, you’ll discover 12 things you can do to prevent hair loss, reverse it, and grow stronger, shinier, and thicker hair. Women and men experience different hair loss patterns. In women, even if their hair gets thin, fragile, and falls out all over the head, they are less likely to become bald. In contrast, men lose hair first from the front of the head and are more likely than women to go bald.

Scroll down for scientific references

Watch this video to the end, to learn ONE surprising cause of hair loss that affects over 30% of adults.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Number 12. “Eat Foods that Block DHT.”

A significant factor behind male-pattern baldness is the sex hormone Dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

Some medications such as finasteride, block DHT to slow down hair loss, but there are natural alternatives. Certain foods have been found to reverse hair loss and allow hair to regrow. DHT blockers suppress the activity of the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, which converts testosterone to DHT.

Foods and supplements known to be DHT blockers include green tea, flaxseed, sesame seed, edamame beans, onion, turmeric, pumpkin seed oil, saw palmetto extract, reishi mushroom, E. cava alga, and pygeum bark extract.

DHT may also be blocked topically at the hair follicles by using a hair-thickening shampoo, or hair spray with natural ingredients mentioned earlier, rosemary, lavender, tea tree oils, and other nutrients coming up next.

Number 11. “Eat Biotin-rich Foods.”

Biotin, also known as vitamin B7, is a popular nutrient used in shampoos and food supplements designed for hair regrowth. A biotin deficiency can cause skin, nail, and hair problems. Nutritional sources of biotin are egg, milk, salmon, organ meats, sweet potato, broccoli, spinach, nuts, and seeds. These foods are also significant sources of other B vitamins, such as B2 and B12, that keep your hair follicles healthy.

Number 10. “Add Iron-rich Foods To Your Diet.”

Hair loss in men and women can be associated with an iron deficiency. In a study done in 2006, iron and lysine supplements were given to women who had telogen effluvium, or temporary hair loss because of stress or trauma. Results showed that iron supplementation lowered hair shedding in one-third of women. Foods that contain a good amount of iron are meat, eggs, lentils, nuts, raisins, and some vegetables such as spinach and broccoli.

Number 9. “Get More Vitamin D.”

Vitamin D plays an important role in the growth of hair follicles. These are the structures where the hair gets oxygen, nutrients and grows from them. A deficiency in vitamin D is associated with hair thinning and loss. The best source of vitamin D is the sun; 15 to 20 minutes of sunlight per day is all you need. You can get vitamin D from food sources such as fish, eggs, and milk.

Number 8. “Eat Antioxidant-rich Foods.”

Antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, and E are essential for healthy hair. They help to fight off free radicals that can cause damage, and promote collagen synthesis which helps nourish the connective tissue of follicles to enhance hair growth!

In one study done in 2010, volunteers with alopecia were given vitamin E capsules. The number of hairs in the test scalp area increased significantly.

The best sources of vitamin A, are carrots, eggs, milk, while vitamin C is abundant in citrus fruits such as orange and lemon. Foods rich in vitamin E include nuts, seeds, wheat germ oil, avocado, and spinach.

Number 7. “Get More Omega-3 Fatty Acids.”

Even though more research is needed, the daily intake of omega-3 helps regulate DHT and may help reduce hair loss and increase hair growth. In one 2015 study, women who took an Omega-3 fish oil supplement experienced greater hair growth and less hair loss.

Omega-3 fatty acids reduce the inflammation that can cause hair loss. The best sources of omega-3 are fish, flaxseed, chia seeds, and walnuts.

Number 6. “Add Zinc-rich Foods to Your Diet.”

Zinc deficiency is one of the known causes of hair loss. In a study done in 2009, zinc supplements were given to patients whose hair fell out in small patches because of alopecia areata, a condition in which immune cells attack hair follicles. After 3 months of zinc supplementation, 2 out of 3 patients regrew their hair. You can get zinc naturally from meat, poultry, yogurt, milk, beans, nuts, and seafood such as lobster.

Number 5. “Get More Selenium.”

Selenium is a trace mineral that plays a vital role in cell growth and development. A selenium deficiency can cause changes in the structure of hair follicles and trigger hair loss. Preclinical studies showed that a diet poor in selenium can cause telogen effluvium, which is hair loss induced by stress. You can get selenium from natural sources such as Brazil nuts, seafood, and organ meats. Be careful about selenium supplementation because excess intake can cause brittle hair and hair loss.

Number 4. “Get Enough Protein.”

Your hair needs protein for healthy growth. Protein is built by amino acids, and certain amino acids are more beneficial for hair regrowth. L-cysteine is a constituent of keratin that protects the hair follicle. L-cysteine can also increase iron and zinc absorption, which supports hair growth. You can get L-cysteine from beef, chicken, legumes, eggs, and yogurt.

Number 3. “Be Gentle to Your Hair.”

Have a gentle hair care routine to have healthy hair and prevent hair loss. Choose a shampoo that doesn’t dry your hair and apply a moisturizer after washing to avoid damage. Applying heat with curling irons and hot combs can damage and weaken your hair, so avoid this to prevent hair fall. Also, gently brush your hair when you’re styling it. Avoid pulling back your hair tightly when wearing a bun, ponytail, and braids. This is because doing this frequently can cause traction alopecia, a type of hair loss.

Number 2. “Reduce Stress.”

One cause of hair loss is stress, so manage your stress levels to support healthy hair growth in the long term. You can take a walk every day, or work on your hobbies to relieve stress and protect your hair.

Number 1. “Increase Blood Oxygen Levels.”

Getting enough oxygen and nutrients to your scalp encourages the growth of strong and healthy hair, and prevents premature hair thinning. You can consume foods such as beetroot juice, and exercise regularly to increase blood oxygen levels. If you’re a smoker, consider quitting, as this will increase oxygen transport to your hair follicles.

Next, what causes hair loss?

Hair loss can be caused by genetics, hormonal imbalance, disease, infection, vitamin deficiency, and bad hairstyling habits.

Thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto’s and Graves’ disease can sometimes result in hair loss. This is typically reversed after thyroid hormone levels are normalized.

Insulin resistance, the root cause of prediabetes, can also trigger hair loss. Prediabetes typically goes undiagnosed until type 2 diabetes develops, so hair loss is one symptom to watch out for.

How To Make This “Miracle Juice” Recipe

The basic recipe only requires one beet root, one carrot and one apple. If you want to take it to another level and make a batch that will last you for a few days, here’s the recipe you need.

Ingredients:

35 oz / 1kg of cooked beetroot
5 oz of honey
3 oranges
17 oz / ½ kg of carrots
3 apples
1 lemon

Instructions:

Wash all ingredients well.
Peel the oranges and the lemon and de-core the apples.

Pour into a glass jar and add the honey. Stir until everything is combined.
Keep refrigerated for up to one week.

To use: Drink half a glass every morning before breakfast.

What Each Ingredient Does

1. Beetroot (Key Ingredient)

Drinking beet juice can actually lower your blood pressure just a few hours after ingestion (1). Beetroot extract was even found to treat human pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancers (2).

According to NaturalHealth365.com this is how beet juice helps to kill cancer cells,

“Beet juice helps to detoxify as well as protect our cells with much needed (easily absorbed) nutrients and oxygen.

Some breakthrough studies have shown that the same characteristics in beets – which help athletes perform better – help cancer patients reverse their condition. The link between oxygen and cancer is well known and beets can increase oxygen, within the blood, by 400 percent while helping to eliminate waste products.

The Ferenczi’s Effect is named after the man that discovered a tumor-inhibiting effect of a flavonoid (betazyane) in beets – which proved that beets have the ability to increase oxygen intake within the cells, while protecting the levels of vitamin C – another great anti-cancer nutrient.

One of the anti-tumor effects of beetroot juice is explained by its high iron content, designed to regenerate red blood corpuscles that supply cancer cells with more oxygen. This higher oxygen content improves cellular respiration – which helps to kill cancer cells.

Beets are considered one of be best cleansing foods, and their main accomplishment in that regard is they detoxify the kidneys, liver and lymph system – while promoting the regeneration of new (healthy) cells.”

2. Honey

Honey can actually help manage diabetes (3) and relieve inflammation (4). It also fights bacteria and viruses (5). Plus, it’s wonderfully sweet and delicious!

3. Oranges

Oranges contain high levels of vitamin c, which can lower chances of stroke and Alzheimer’s disease (6). It’s also high in pectin, which is known to lower cholesterol (7). Long time orange juice consumption decreased LDL-cholesterol (8).

4. Carrots

Carrots are full full of antioxidants and vitamins, including high levels of vitamin A (9). This contributes to strengthening your cardiovascular health (10), supports your vision and immune system (11) and may even prevent cancer (12).

5. Apples

Quercetin (one of the antioxidants found abundantly in apples) was one of two compounds that helped to reduce cellular death that is caused by oxidation and inflammation of neurons (13). It also reduces your risk of developing dementia.

6. Lemon

Lemons contain limonoids and coumarins that work together to fight cancer (14,15). They also fight inflammation (16).

https://dailyhealthpost.com/prevent-fatty-liver-disease-with-only-30-minutes-a-day/,Prevent Fatty Liver Disease With Only 30 Minutes a Day,"A new study published in the journal Molecular Metabolism found that exercising regularly can help prevent the development of fatty liver associated diseases. People who suffer from non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) often have type 2 diabetes as well as an increased risk of liver cirrhosis, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality.

NAFLD occurs when fat deposits accumulate in the liver and with time can disrupt the function of liver cells, which can lead to inflammation within the organ.

Exercise can prevent fatty liver disease caused by overeating

In the study conducted by Dr. Miriam Hoene and Dr. Lisa Kappler, mice were fed a high-energy diet (HED). The high-energy diet (HED) contained added sugar (10% weight sucrose) and fat (20% weight lard).

At the end of the six-week study, researchers found that mice who also trained three days a week for 1 hour on a treadmill showed better weight control than those that stayed sedentary.

The results showed that training helped regulate important enzymes in the liver responsible for breaking down glucose and fructose. As a consequence, less fat is stored in the liver – and specific lipids such as diacylglycerol are reduced. In addition, the exercise-trained mice on the HED diet also experienced better glucose control.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"January 18, 2022"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/real-reason-to-drink-olive-oil-every-day/,The REAL Reason To Drink Olive Oil Every Day,"Olive oil is a healthy fat and the most common oil consumed in Mediterranean countries. It is high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which are healthier than animal fats, saturated fats, and other plant oils. Oleic acid is the main MUFA found in olive oil; it makes up 80% of all fatty acids. Olive oil is also rich in vitamins such as alpha-tocopherol, also known as vitamin E!

In today’s video, you’ll discover 11 amazing benefits of drinking olive oil every day. Watch till the end, to learn how you can distinguish fake extra virgin olive oil from the real. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Number 11. “Prevent Heart Diseases.”

Olive oil shows vasodilator effects on blood vessels, which means olive oil widens blood vessels, preventing high blood pressure. Studies also showed that extra virgin olive oil high in MUFA, reduced LDL known as bad cholesterol, and increased HDL known as good cholesterol.

Polyphenols found in extra virgin olive oil prevent atherosclerosis. They stop the oxidation of LDL accumulated on the wall of blood vessels. Polyphenols do this by capturing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and preventing their attack on blood vessels.

Number 10. “Reduce Inflammation.”

We are exposed to many environmental pollutants and toxins that cause oxidative damage in tissues and organs, resulting in function loss. Considering oxidative damage and inflammation are the leading causes of degenerative diseases, the antioxidant properties of olive oil have excellent benefits for health. Olive oil’s antioxidant effects come from polyphenols, which are powerful antioxidants found in plants, and it is found in higher amounts in extra virgin olive oil than refined olive oils.

Number 9. “Promote Healthy Aging.”

Everyone hopes to be disease and pain-free in old age. Olive oil supports healthy aging with its benefits for weight management and skeletal health. Olive oil can prevent a decline in bone mineral density which can lead to osteoporosis. Taking olive oil helps promote weight loss. One review of 11 randomized controlled studies found that people following an olive-oil-enriched diet for at least 12 weeks, compared to a control diet, reduced weight more effectively.

Number 8. “Improve Cognitive Function.”

Regular intake of olive oil is associated with healthy cognitive function. It protects neurons from oxidative damage, prevents dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, and even improves major depression symptoms. In a study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2021, 73 patients with depression were given 25ml extra virgin olive oil daily for 52 days. Patients who were given olive oil showed improvement in symptoms of depression compared to those who were given sunflower oil.

Number 7. “Prevent Metabolic Diseases.”

Metabolic diseases such as prediabetes, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome can be detrimental to overall health. These diseases are related to impaired blood glucose and lipid levels. Studies showed that olive oil could decrease glucose, total cholesterol, LDL levels and increase HDL levels by almost 50%.

Number 6. “Help With Digestion.”

Have you ever struggled with constipation? Olive oil can regulate your bowel movement. Importantly, it decreased inflammation and improved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis (UC), a disease of the intestines caused by inflammation. In a study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2020, patients with ulcerative colitis were given 50 ml of extra virgin olive oil daily for 20 days. Their blood inflammation markers were decreased, and symptoms such as abdominal bloating, diarrhea, and constipation were reduced significantly.

Number 5. “Protect the Skin.”

The skin is our biggest organ, and it is directly exposed to environmental pollutants and UV radiation. It’s important to increase the skin’s antioxidant capacity to decrease inflammation, and even help to repair skin burns. In a study done in 2015, olive oil was given to patients who had burn-wounds in 10 to 20% of their total body surface. As a result, their wound healing time decreased.

Number 4. “Prevent The Growth Of Harmful Bacteria.”

The anti-bacterial effects of olive oil come from the high polyphenol content. A study tested olive oil effects on 6 strains of bacteria, including E. coli, which is highly contagious and the most frequent cause of gastrointestinal and urinary infections. The results showed that extra virgin olive oil effectively inhibited the growth of E. coli. Olive oil can also inhibit Helicobacter pylori infection, which can cause stomach cancer.

Number 3. “Boost The Immune System.”

A healthy immune system is important because it produces cells that fight infection and diseases. Olive oil can be beneficial for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which immune cells attack normal host cells by mistake and damage the joints. An animal study showed that extra virgin olive oil could reduce swelling in joints, and the harmful molecules that cause inflammation in joints. Also, a study done in 2020 showed that even applying and massaging with olive oil, reduced pain in the joints in women with rheumatoid arthritis.

Number 2. “Help to Prevent Cancer.”

Oxidative damage in DNA can cause cancers. Extra virgin olive oil contains polyphenols and vitamin E that capture reactive oxygen species (ROS) and eliminate them. In a study done in 2011, an analysis of 19 studies from thousands of patients showed that higher olive oil consumption lowered the risk of breast and digestive system cancer.

Number 1. “Improve Liver Health.”

The liver is the central organ for nutrient metabolism. Taking olive oil improves insulin resistance and decreases triglyceride accumulation, the leading cause of fatty liver diseases. Also, the antioxidant effects of olive oil protect liver cells from the harmful effects of lipid peroxidation, which damages the cells. See our video, 7 Signs and Symptoms of Fatty Liver – “Reverse!”

Unfortunately, not all olive oils are the same. There are a lot of frauds who sell refined, and “not” virgin olive oils. These fakes do not show the same beneficial effects as extra virgin olive oil, because refined olive oils have lower or no polyphenol content.

Here are some tips to help you choose high-quality extra virgin olive oil.

First, taste it. If the taste is bland or it has a plastic taste, it is most likely fake. Olive oil has a rich taste; it should give you a fresh, peppery finish in your throat.

Second, check the bottle. It should be dark because olive oil can easily be damaged by light and the taste becomes bitter.

Third, check the harvest time. Choose the oil with the most recent harvest date.

Fourth, avoid bottles that have “pure,” “light,” and “virgin” labels. Instead, select the one labeled as “extra virgin.”

Olive oil has a high smoke point of approximately 190 Celsius. It is healthy to use when cooking in high heat because it is not burned easily. You can add olive oil to your salad, bread, fish, or you can drink it neat.

Please share how you take olive oil, and the benefits you experienced in the comments below.

Although there is no exact amount of olive oil you have to drink daily, people living in the Mediterranean countries are reported to consume 60 ml or 4 tablespoons of olive oil. You can take 1 tablespoon every day on an empty stomach, or you can use olive oil extensively in your cooking.

You can mix 1 tablespoon of olive oil with lemon juice, 1 raw black garlic clove, 1 tablespoon of raw honey, and add a pinch of turmeric. Stir well and drink 30 minutes before breakfast; this is just one of many ways you can take olive oil!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/adding-this-vitamin-in-your-diet-can-lower-your-risk-of-frequent-migraines-by-50/,Adding This Vitamin To Your Diet Lowers Your Risk of Frequent Migraines By 50%,"There’s nothing more debilitating than a headache in the middle of the work day. It can make your whole day slip away by making it hard to focus and perform simple tasks. Unfortunately, it’s an incredibly common condition. (Updated Jan 13, 2022)

The National Headache Foundation estimates that 28 million Americans suffer from migraines. More women than men get migraines and a 1/4 of all women with migraines suffer four or more attacks a month.

And the worst part is that each migraine can last from four hours to three days and be so severe that all you can think about is finding a dark, quiet place to lie down. Occasionally, it will last longer. (source)

What Causes Migraines?

Although most scientists still don’t quite understand exactly why migraines occur, they have been able to pin down some common causes (1).

Hormone imbalance or influxes (during pregnancy or menstruation)
Tyramine sensitivity
Sleep deficiency
Being overweight
Certain medication
Allergies
Genetics
What Vitamin Can Help?

Several studies suggest that people who get migraines may reduce how often they get migraines and how long the migraines last by taking riboflavin (vitamin B2).

One double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed that taking 400 mg of riboflavin a day cut the number of migraine attacks in half.

The researchers suggest that, because of the low number of side-effects and its potential efficacy and low cost, riboflavin is a feasible option for migraine(2).

Why It Works?

Researchers have proposed that the brain cells of some people with migraine may have a mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in impaired oxygen metabolism. (3)

Because riboflavin, the water-soluble vitamin B2, improves energy metabolism in the body, it is thought to increase the mitochondrial energy efficiency in an individual who has migraine.

In short, riboflavin helps improve the way oxygen is metabolized in the brain to prevent migraines.

Natural sources of this vitamin include (4):

Dairy products
Eggs
Green leafy vegetables
Lean meats
Legumes
Nuts
Additional B Vitamins That Can Help

Professor Lyn Griffiths of Griffith Health Institute’s Genomics Research Center found that 20% of migraine sufferers carry a specific genetic mutation.

This gene mutation increases levels of homocysteine production, which can make you more prone to migraine attacks.

It was discovered that vitamins B6 and B12 reduce homocysteine levels. In addition, researchers found that depending on your genotype, one may need a higher or lower dose in order for it to work.

According to Professor Griffiths, “The success of our trial has shown that safe, inexpensive vitamin supplements can treat migraine patients,” she said.(4)

Bottom Line

A deficiency in Vitamin B2, Vitamin B6, or Vitamin B12 are most likely to cause a headache. In addition, your migraines can also be a symptom of Vitamin D, Magnesium or CoQ10 deficiency.

You can help relieve the pain of a migraine by drinking cold water, taking deep breaths and inhaling lavender. You can also try to relieve pressure by massaging your head where you’re experiencing tension.

You can also try to stimulate the nerve just under your eyebrow, which usually causes the body to release painkilling endorphins.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/eat-turmeric-every-day/,The REAL Reason To Eat Turmeric Every Day,"Today, you’ll discover the top 10 health benefits of eating turmeric every day. Do you eat turmeric? Maybe you already consume turmeric in curries or turmeric latte known as golden milk.

Turmeric is a plant from the ginger family. It is commonly used as a spice and also as traditional medicine. The benefits of turmeric come from curcuminoids. The main curcuminoid of turmeric is curcumin, which makes up 77% of all curcuminoids and gives turmeric its yellow color. Continue watching till the end to discover 3 ways you can skyrocket the amazing benefits of turmeric.

Number 10. “Protect Your Neurons.”

Neurons or nerve cells transport information between different areas of the brain. Fortunately, neurons can increase and grow new connections even in adulthood. This is great news because you can keep your brain healthy by enhancing nerve cell connections!

Curcumin can increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that promotes healthy neurons and improves memory and learning. When neurons are damaged, BDNF decreases, and neurodegenerative diseases such as depression, epilepsy, migraine, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease can occur.

Curcumin also protects nerve cells from damage by blocking inflammatory molecules.

It reduces Alzheimer’s disease symptoms and migraine by binding to a protein called Amyloid Beta. When these protein pieces clump together to form plaques in the brain, it leads to brain damage. Research on Alzheimer’s patients has found that curcumin removes these plaques and prevents their formation.

Number 9. “Reduce Oxidative Stress & Inflammation.”

Radical oxygen species (ROS) are free radicals produced by metabolism and pollutants. Oxidative damage caused by ROS can trigger chronic inflammation, the leading cause of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and macular degeneration. Luckily, we can eat antioxidant foods such as turmeric to capture ROS and eliminate it to protect our cells.

Number 8. “Support Liver Function.”

The liver has a crucial role in detoxification because it metabolizes drugs and toxins. Curcumin increases the detox activity of enzymes of the liver. Besides, curcumin showed beneficial effects on patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Fatty liver is caused by fat accumulation in the liver and affects liver function if it progresses. A meta-analysis study was done in 2019, that investigated studies in which fatty liver patients were given 70 to 3000 mg of curcumin daily for 8 to 12 weeks. The results showed that curcumin supplementation reduced body weight and waist circumference in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Considering weight loss is beneficial to reverse fatty liver, curcumin can support liver health. See our video, “7 Signs and Symptoms of Fatty Liver – Reverse!”

Number 7. “Reduce Pain in Joints.”

A healthy skeletal system is important for pain-free living and aging. Unfortunately, some diseases such as arthritis, a painful condition caused by inflammation in the joints, can restrict your movement. A study done in 2016 showed that patients who were given 1000 mg of curcumin daily, experienced reduced pain and inflammation-related symptoms.

Number 6. “Prevent Bowel Diseases.”

Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by inflammation of the intestines. IBD is characterized by an abnormal immune response to inflammation caused by intestinal microbes. Curcumin can improve IBD by regulating immune responses and reducing inflammation.

Number 5. “Boost Collagen Synthesis.”

Collagen is one of the building blocks of skin. It gives the skin elasticity and a younger look. Curcumin can help you have healthy and glowing skin by inducing collagen synthesis and reducing inflammation. Curcumin can help blood vessels to form during injury, so oxygen and nutrient transport can increase. As a result, the wound-healing time for injuries is reduced.

Number 4. “Improve Blood Glucose Levels.”

Curcumin has beneficial effects on blood glucose levels. A study done in 2021, evaluated curcumin’s effects on type 2 diabetes patients’ blood sugar levels. Patients given curcumin showed reduced fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels, which means their blood sugar levels were improved and became more stable.

Number 3. “Help Prevent Cancer.”

Curcumin effects have been shown in various cancers, including breast, lung, and gastric cancer. Studies showed curcumin could help prevent or treat cancer by inducing the death of harmful cells, decreasing new blood vessel formation, and preventing the travel and location of cancer cells to other parts of the body. As mentioned earlier, oxidative stress and inflammation caused by reactive oxygen species may damage the DNA. This is one of the main reasons for cancerous cells. Curcumin’s powerful antioxidant effects can protect cells from inflammatory molecules.

Number 2. “Protect Your Lungs.”

The lungs are highly exposed to oxidative stress because they are directly in contact with environmental pollutants and oxygen during breathing. As an antioxidant, curcumin prevents damage and inflammation in the lungs, improving diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Number 1. “Protect Your Heart.”

Curcumin shows cardioprotective, heart-friendly effects by lowering blood lipid levels. It can inhibit atherosclerosis, a severe heart condition in which lipids clog blood vessels and obstruct blood flow. Atherosclerosis can lead to heart attack, stroke, and even death. In a study done in 2008, patients with a heart disease called acute coronary syndrome, were given 15 to 60 mg of curcumin supplementation 3 times a day for 2 months. As a result, the patients’ triglyceride and LDL levels known as ‘bad cholesterol’ decreased, and HDL levels known as ‘good cholesterol’ increased.

There you have it! The top 10 reasons to take turmeric daily! Next, what is the effective dose of turmeric? Studies show that turmeric doses of 500 to 2,000 mg per day are effective. This is normally a curcumin extract with a much higher curcumin concentration than that found in food. Turmeric spices contain around 3% curcumin, compared to 95% curcumin in extracts. However, turmeric has benefits even when eaten as a spice!

To see our recommended liquid turmeric extract, which has superior bioavailability to unlock the power of turmeric, click the link in the description below.

Do note that turmeric may interact with certain medications and cause unwelcome effects. Consult your doctor before taking turmeric with any prescription drug. Click the link below to get a list of medications that should not be taken with turmeric: “Don’t Ever Use Turmeric If You’re On Any of The Following Medications”

When you orally take curcumin, only a small amount of it is absorbed from the intestines. Most of it is excreted through the feces.

Fortunately, there are 3 simple kitchen strategies that you can use to boost the bioavailability of turmeric.

Number 1. Increase absorption by taking turmeric with piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper. Studies showed that black pepper increases the bioavailability of curcumin by 20 times.

Number 2. Turmeric needs to be combined with fats for your body to assimilate the curcuminoids. When eaten with healthy fats, such as eggs, coconut oil, grass-fed butter, and olive oil, curcumin can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream.

Number 3. Increase turmeric bioavailability with heat, by adding this spice to your cooking extensively. This is where the sauté pan and a little warm oil come into play.

And now, over to you: Do you eat turmeric regularly? What are your favorite ways to add this amazing spice to your diet?

https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-and-symptoms-of-fatty-liver/,7 Signs And Symptoms Of Fatty Liver You Need to Know,"Today, you’ll discover the top 7 signs and symptoms of fatty liver. Keep reading till the end to learn the steps you can take to reverse fatty liver disease. First, what is fatty liver disease?

The liver is a vital organ with many functions, such as the metabolism of nutrients, production of bile and urea, removal of toxins from the blood, and storage of some vitamins and minerals.

When there is excess fat in the liver, an inflammatory response is triggered. This causes antibodies to attack and damage liver cells. Damaged liver cells cannot function like healthy ones. So the liver cannot detox and perform its other tasks, causing more fat to accumulate.

This condition is called fatty liver disease, or “hepatic steatosis”. Fatty liver is the most common form of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).

Small amounts of fat accumulation are harmless, but not when it exceeds 5 to 10 percent of the liver’s weight. As the liver becomes fattier, it can cause fibrosis and cirrhosis – the severe scarring and irreversible stage of liver disease.

Now that we know why fatty liver is dangerous, let’s get into the 7 signs and symptoms of this disease.

Number 7. “Higher Blood Liver Enzymes.”

The liver produces several enzymes to metabolize nutrients, drugs, toxic chemicals, and other metabolites (products of metabolism). Liver Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are the main enzymes that show liver damage. Studies showed that 25 to over 50% of fatty liver disease patients have elevated blood AST and ALT levels. An increase in blood ALT levels is more specific to liver damage, while AST can also be increased because of thyroid and muscle diseases. An increase in these enzymes could be a sign of fatty liver disease.

If you have Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), click the link in the description to discover a 4-week plan to make your liver healthy.

Number 6. “Weakness & Fatigue.”

If you lack self-motivation for physical and mental activities, experience muscle weakness, or feel sleepy, you may have fatigue because of fatty liver disease.

In one study done in 2008, fatigue was higher in patients with fatty liver disease. That’s not surprising, considering the liver’s central role in energy metabolism. The liver communicates with the skeletal system, intestines, nervous system, and adipose tissue, where fats are stored. As fat builds up in the liver, this communication is disrupted, and the muscles, intestines, and nerves start to not function properly.

Number 5. “Edema & Abdominal Pain.”

Fat accumulation causes inflammation of the liver cells. Inflammation causes immune cells to attack tissue. Damage in tissue can cause fluid retention and edema. You may feel pain or discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen where the liver is located. Another reason for pain could be bile duct stones that accumulate because of fatty liver disease.

Number 4. “Appetite & Weight Loss.”

In liver damage, especially in the severe stage of fat accumulation, hormones that regulate hunger become disrupted. Leptin is a hormone that modulates appetite and reduces food consumption. When leptin levels are above the normal average, it can cause loss of appetite and lead to weight loss.

Number 3. “Gastrointestinal Issues.”

Gastrointestinal issues involve the digestive system organs – mouth, stomach, and intestines. In a study done in 2019, gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with liver cirrhosis were assessed. The most common were abdominal bloating with nearly 50%. Also, 13.3% of patients experienced diarrhea, and 8% of patients experienced constipation.

Number 2. “Nausea & Acid Reflux.”

A study done in 2009 showed that gastroesophageal reflux was more prevalent in patients with fatty liver disease. Also, these patients experienced more heartburn and belching.

Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition in which stomach fluid move back up to the esophagus. It can cause nausea and vomiting. Another reason is that toxins and waste products cannot be eliminated by the liver, and as a result, damage the stomach and esophagus mucosa, resulting in reflux.

Number 1. “Bruising & Bleeding.”

The liver produces a hormone TPO that regulates production of platelet, which is a type of blood cell that helps to clot to stop bleeding. Platelet production is decreased in cirrhosis, the severe stage of fatty liver disease. When blood cannot clot, bruising, even bleeding, can occur in injury. A person may also experience jaundice, itching, and swelling.

There you have it! The 7 symptoms of fatty liver. If you observe these symptoms, get a blood test, ultrasound, or biopsy to be sure about your liver function. However, this man-made disease can only be healed through diet and lifestyle changes.

Now, here are “8 things” you can do to prevent and reverse fatty liver disease.

Number 1. “Regular Exercise.” Aerobic exercises such as walking, running, cycling, Zumba, can increase fat-burning and decrease the synthesis of fats in the liver.

Number 2. “Limit alcohol consumption.” Alcohol increases fat accumulation in the liver. When alcohol is broken down in the liver, an enzyme converts ethanol to a toxic compound called acetaldehyde, which is carcinogenic or cancer-causing.

Number 3. “Consume fiber rich-foods.” Fiber can lower your blood lipids – triglycerides, and LDL, known as “bad cholesterol”. Try to add at least 5 portions of fruits and vegetables to your diet. You should also eat other fiber-rich foods such as beans, lentils, and gluten-free whole grains.

Number 4. “Cut Out Sugar.” Sugar can cause weight gain and spike blood glucose levels, especially in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes. High blood glucose levels lead to fat accumulation in the liver. Avoid refined sugar, commercial fruit juice, and packaged foods and snacks. See our video “Top 13 Foods That Cause Inflammation”.

Number 5. “Cut Out High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS).” HFCS is as bad, or maybe worse than sugar. There are no enzymatic steps to limit fructose to fatty acid conversion in the liver. When large quantities of fructose reach the liver, excess fructose is directly converted to fat. Read nutritional labels and avoid packaged foods that contain HFCS. Names that disguise HFCS include glucose-fructose syrup, maize syrup, tapioca syrup, fruit syrup, and crystalline fructose.

Number 6. “Maintain a Healthy Weight.” Even losing 10 percent of body weight can decrease fat accumulation and help turn around fatty liver disease.

Number 7. “Avoid Medication where Possible.” The liver is crucial in eliminating toxins and waste products and in drug metabolism. Taking unnecessary medication can exhaust liver cells and worsen the inflammation that occurs with fatty liver disease.

Number 8. “Have a balanced diet.” Most notably, having a healthy and balanced diet is crucial. Because we convert foods to energy in the liver, any excess of carbohydrates, protein, and fats, are converted to fat in the liver, and some fat accumulates. Include foods that help the liver detox, such as cruciferous vegetables, artichoke, turmeric, walnut, milk thistle, and coffee. Watch our video “Top 10 Foods to Reverse Fatty Liver” for a full explanation of liver detox foods.

Next, Who Is At Risk For Fatty Liver Disease?

If you’re are obese, older than 50, have a family history of liver disease, have sleep apnea, diabetes, high blood lipids, or consume alcohol (over 14 drinks per week), you are at higher risk of fatty liver disease.

Do you have Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease? If “Yes”, click the link below to learn about the 3 pillars to ensure outstanding liver health and a 4-week plan to rejuvenate your liver function.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-to-control-diabetes/,Top 10 Foods to Control Diabetes,"Today, we’ll be going over the top 10 best foods for diabetes control. These are the foods that help manage your roller-coaster blood sugar, and even reverse type 2 diabetes while helping you melt away stubborn belly fat. Make sure you read till the end to learn ONE thing you can do before meals to lower post-meal glucose.

Number 10. “Healthy Fats”.

Healthy oils and fats are key to good health. A diet rich in Omega-threes (wild salmon, sardines), alpha-linolenic acid (flaxseed, walnut), and monounsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts, seeds) is anti-inflammatory, and beneficial for our blood sugar and overall health. Many studies show that a Mediterranean-style diet reduces the risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease by up to 50 percent.

Recent research suggests it is not cholesterol and saturated fats in our diets that contribute to heart attacks. But a combination of high blood sugar and insulin from too much sugary and starchy foods, eating highly-processed inflammatory vegetable oils (soybean, sunflower, corn, safflower, canola oil), as well as partially hydrogenated oils (margarine, baked goods, packaged snacks).

Number 9. “Green Leafy Vegetables”.

Studies prove that consuming green leafy and cruciferous vegetables (like cabbage, cauliflower, and spinach) and drumstick leaves (moringa) can help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. This is attributed to their magnesium (which reduces type 2 diabetes incidence) and antioxidant content (for example polyphenols, vitamin C, and beta-carotene), which help reduce systemic oxidative stress  — a condition associated with numerous diabetes complications like heart disorders.

Number 8. “Whole Grains”.

While people with diabetes should avoid grains like white rice, not all grains need to be cut off from their diet. Diabetes-safe grain products such as brown rice and whole-grain bread have been observed to improve the blood sugar of people living with diabetes.

Studies show that consistent consumption of whole grains lowers your body mass index (BMI), which subsequently reduces body weight. How does bodyweight affect blood sugar? Failure to manage your body weight worsens diabetes by increasing the risk of developing diseases associated with heart disease.

Whole grains are high in fiber and help improve insulin sensitivity and prevent insulin spikes caused by increased blood sugar. 

Number 7. “Coffee and Green Tea”.

Research on these beverages has shown that drinking green tea will decrease glucose in your blood and improve diabetes control by promoting insulin sensitivity. These effects are attributed to its epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content which promotes glucose uptake by skeletal muscles, reducing blood sugar levels.

Coffee, caffeinated or decaffeinated, has similar effects. Research indicates that drinking coffee lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes. One plausible mechanism for this is its ability to promote weight loss, which helps manage diabetes risk. This may be due to its quinides and chlorogenic acid content.

Number 6. “Dark Chocolate”.

Dark chocolate contains more cacao than milk chocolate, resulting in less severe effects on your blood sugar levels than regular chocolate. But, how does it control diabetes? Most research points towards an improvement in insulin resistance due to its flavonoid antioxidant content. These compounds reduce inflammation, prevent cell damage, break down glucose in the body, and reduce oxidative stress, the primary cause of insulin resistance. They’re also known to contain magnesium in significant amounts, which reduces your blood sugar levels and promotes feelings of calm and relaxation. 

Number 5. “Berries and Cherries”.

Although the sweet taste of berries like blueberries and strawberries can be confused with refined sugar that raises blood sugar, their effect is different. Treating yourself to strawberries or raspberries after a meal prevents your blood sugar from spiking and improves insulin secretion in overweight or obese people. More insulin means more glucose is converted into glycogen, and by extension, reduced blood sugar levels. This effect may be due to their anthocyanin polyphenol content, which has been shown to enhance glucose uptake and reduce inflammation.

Cherries, on the other hand, have been observed to have unique effects on diabetes. When ingested, the anthocyanin content of these fruits may boost insulin production by up to 50%. In addition to this, their antioxidant properties are responsible for reducing the risk of diabetes complications like heart disease and kidney failure.

Number 4. “Beans”.

As a diabetes superfood, beans, such as pinto, lima, and green beans, provide a rich source of fiber and have a low glycemic index (GI). This means that when you eat beans with any other food, white rice, for example, it’s more likely to prevent your blood sugar level from spiking than when you eat white rice alone, as studies suggest.

For one, they contain complex carbohydrates, which digest more slowly, keeping your blood sugar levels in check. Additionally, their high fiber content slows down the rate of digestion, minimizing blood sugar spikes. Their high protein content is also beneficial because it helps you stay full for more extended periods, eliminating the need for constant snacking and, by extension, excessive weight gain.

An excellent way to enjoy them is to sprinkle some cooked beans in your salad or add them to your sandwich or burgers.

Number 3. “Citrus Fruits”.

Citrus fruits also have a good amount of fiber that prevents an abrupt increase in your blood sugar and makes it easy for you to get full. In a study that examines the antidiabetic effect of citrus fruits, there was an increase In the uptake of blood sugar into the muscles and fat cells. This blood sugar lowering effect of citrus fruits is linked to their high flavonoid content, including cosmosiin, hesperidin, and naringin. Aside from lowering blood sugar, the vitamins in citrus fruits will boost your immune system, and prevent diabetes complications.

Number 2. “Nuts and Seeds”.

Nuts like walnuts and almonds have a low carb content with healthy amounts of fiber and dietary fat essential for managing blood sugar. Seeds, such as chia seeds and fennel flower seeds, are on a whole new level, with different seeds offering different health benefits for diabetic health. While fennel flower seeds possess hypoglycemic effects, chia seeds lower systolic blood pressure in people with diabetes. Notably, in chia seeds, most of these effects are linked to their rich fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and antioxidant content.

Number 1. “Avocados”.

This creamy fruit is packed with vitamins and healthy monounsaturated fats and is highly recommended for people living with diabetes. With low amounts of sugar and carbohydrate and high fiber content, avocados deserve a spot on this list. Their fat and fiber content delays the digestion of carbohydrates and, subsequently, blood sugar. In addition to this, a compound called avocatin found only in avocado, functions in diabetics to reduce insulin resistance responsible for high blood sugar.

Weight management, which is also essential for people living with diabetes, is one of the benefits of this fruit, making it indispensable in the diabetic diet. So, whether you are smearing avocados on toast or using it as a dip, you are taking the right step to a healthy blood sugar level.

There you have it! The top 10 foods for diabetes control. One thing you can do to ensure you benefit from these foods is to consume apple cider vinegar, just before meals and before you sleep; this practice is proven to reduce post-meal glucose by up to 34%.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/anti-aging-secrets/,Top 7 Anti Aging Secrets To Stay Young Longer,"Did you know you can slow down, and even reverse premature aging, at the cellular level? If you want to stay biologically younger for longer, and look and feel 10 to 20 years younger, read till the end. We’ll explore 7 lifestyle changes you can make to slow down cellular aging, by increasing the length of our telomeres. So what are telomeres?

Telomeres are sections of DNA placed at the end of the chromosome that carries genetic material. Telomeres protect our chromosomes, much like the plastic tips at the end of shoelaces. They help ensure the chromosome is properly copied during cellular reproduction, thus preventing DNA loss.

We all have a set amount of telomeres at birth, roughly 15,000 base pairs, but they inevitably get shorter as we age. Shorter lengths are related to health problems, and cell death in our bodies. When telomeres get too short, our cells can no longer reproduce – a state known as senescence. This causes our tissues to degenerate, and eventually die. Some cells, like those found in the skin, hair, and immune system, are most affected by telomere shortening because they replicate more often.

In our bodies, an enzyme called telomerase, maintains the length of the telomeres, by adding new genetic sequences. However, the amount of telomerase in our bodies declines as we age. By activating telomerase, it is possible to repair and reverse telomere shortening, help cells live longer, and make old cells young again.

Next up: the 7 ways you can boost telomerase activity, and produce more telomeres to slow down biological aging. Make sure you see our recommended anti-aging solution at the end.

Number 7. “Get Enough Sleep”.

Sleep is crucial for optimal health; it influences your cells’ growth and renewing capacity. Sleep deprivation can increase inflammation, and reduce immune response on the inside, and make you look older on the outside. Sleep-deprived individuals are more at risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, depression, and even cancer.

In one study of 482 people, researchers found that participants who slept for fewer than five hours per night had telomeres that were, on average, 356 base pairs shorter than those who slept for seven hours. In another study of 3000 post-menopausal women, researchers found that on average, women who slept less than seven hours a night had telomere length that was equivalent to women who were two years older.

Number 6. “Activating Autophagy”.

Autophagy means “self-eating”; it is the body’s “waste-removal” function that cleans out damaged cells, to regenerate newer, healthier cells. As we age, our body’s autophagic capacity declines. This leads to an accumulation of cellular waste, causing a loss in the function of tissues and organs.

Autophagy can extend your lifespan, and slow down the aging process. It can be triggered through intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets, which put the body into a “survival-repair” mode. These two diet regimens have been shown to increase telomere length.

Intermittent fasting is a concept based on time-restricted eating, primarily practiced as 16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating period with one or two big meals. The period of fasting is the time that autophagy increases.

Ketosis, a diet high in fat and low in carbs, brings the same benefits of fasting without fasting. Because of low glucose levels, it causes starvation-induced autophagy, which protects nerve cells against damage and dysfunction.

In general, simply eating less can help your telomeres stay nice and long. This slows the aging process and delays the onset of chronic diseases.

Autophagy also helps you look younger by repairing the skin that has been damaged due to stress, diet, toxins, and excessive sun exposure.

Number 5. “Exercise Regularly”.

Even just 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise a day, induces autophagy. Doing this prevents diseases, boosts cognitive function, enhances sleep quality, and improves skin texture through increased circulation.

In one study of 5823 adults, people who had high levels of physical activity showed a significantly longer telomere length compared to people who were sedentary or moderately active. Adults involved in high physical activity were determined to have 9 years less biological aging than their sedentary counterparts.

Number 4. “Manage Stress”.

Going for a brief walk, singing in the shower, dancing like crazy, driving through beautiful places, or just lying down, can reduce stress and benefit your telomeres more than you imagine. Chronic stress leads to an increase in cortisol, which causes a rise in blood sugar and blood pressure, reduces inflammation and immune system resistance to infection. However, cortisol has also been found to suppress telomerase activation in immune system cells, causing telomeres to become unprotected during cell division and become progressively shorter. This leads to early cell aging and increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, dementia, and cancer. Research on individuals who reduced stress through various forms of meditation showed increased telomerase activity and longer telomeres.

Number 3. “Healthy Diet and Weight”.

An anti-inflammatory diet is a telomere-protective diet, so eat a diet low in “bad fats”, sodium, and refined sugars. See our video on foods that cause inflammation and their healthy replacements.

Foods rich in antioxidants are important for protecting DNA from oxidative stress. These include dark chocolate, berries, leafy and cruciferous vegetables, and nuts and seeds. Also include healthy fats like avocados, olive oil, fatty fish, and grass-fed butter. In one study of 5,582 men and women, eating nuts and seeds was linked to longer telomeres, and decreased biological aging. Conversely, another study showed that high consumption of processed meats is associated with short telomere length, and increased biological aging.

It is important to maintain a healthy weight, as obesity is linked to high levels of oxidative stress. This condition causes DNA damage and increases the rate of telomere shortening.

For more foods that activate and extend longevity, see our video “Top 10 Anti-Aging Foods”.

Number 2. “Avoid Tobacco and Alcohol Use”.

When you smoke, your body is exposed to increased levels of oxidative stress which causes inflammation, and shortens telomeres by promoting senescence in immune cells; this has been well-established in studies.

Additionally, excessive alcohol consumption has been linked, to faster biological aging at a cellular level, as shown by different studies. Heavy drinking is often accompanied by a lack of vitamin B1, also known as thiamine. Vitamin B1 takes energy from food and turns it into energy for the brain, nerves, and heart. Long-term B1 deficiency leads to higher oxidative stress levels which affect telomere length. Another study showed that heavy alcohol use (eight or more drinks per week) increased facial lines, under-eye puffiness, and volume loss in the midface.

Number 1. “Supplements”.

Some nutrients have been shown to decrease the effect of aging in our system. Even though you can get them through foods, you may want to consume them as supplements to get sufficient amounts daily.

For example, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has potent antioxidant effects. Vitamins C and E may protect against oxidative DNA damage, that would otherwise cause telomere shortening.

Magnesium. A deficiency is known to be accompanied by an increase in oxidative stress, as this mineral plays a vital role in the enzyme activity involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and RNA synthesis.

Zinc. Similarly, a deficiency is associated with oxidative damage, which leads to shorter telomeres. Optimal levels can reduce the incidence of infection, and prevent DNA erosion.

Other nutrients that boost telomerase activity are Omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol, vitamin D3 and the herb, Astragalus.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/ways-to-improve-your-eyesight-naturally/,Top 9 Ways To Improve Your Eyesight Naturally,"Today, you’ll discover 9 ways to improve your eyesight naturally, to improve your near-distance, far-distance, and night-time vision. Imagine, being able to more comfortably enjoy a good book, look at your phone up close, clearly see faces and expressions, and being more confident when you drive after dark. One day, you may wake up, and forget to wear your glasses, because you’re seeing so well! And even if your eyesight is good, you’ll want to read all the way to number 1, because age-related vision decline happens to every one.

Perfect Vision in 7-Seconds? Just Do THIS…
Number 9. Protect your eyes by wearing sunglasses and blue light glasses.

Our eyes are directly exposed to both sun and artificial lights, including “high-energy visible” or blue light, which is radiated from a phone, computer, television, and LED lighting. According to eye doctors, long-term exposure to blue light is a health concern.

Unlike UV rays from sunlight, which are mostly absorbed by the structure of our cornea and lens, blue light can reach all the way to our retina. This causes dry eyes, contributes to digital eye strain, and can damage the eyes, increasing the risk of visual conditions like cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration. This is because damaging chemicals called Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are released, causing our lens cells to become stiff and cloudy.

Also, blue light exposure at night, suppresses the production of the hormone melatonin, and disrupts our circadian clock, leaving us feeling alert instead of tired. Sunlight is a main source of blue light, and invisible ultraviolet rays that damage the eyes. Protecting your eyes by wearing sunglasses, and blue light glasses, or using blue light blocking screens, is a must to have healthy, hydrated eyes. (Zhao et al., 2018).

Number 8. Regularly do eye exercises and rest your eyes.

In a study done in 2018, college students were instructed to do eye exercises, including palming, blinking, sideways, up and down, and rotational viewing, just twice a week for 2 months. As a result, the participants who did eye exercises had decreased eye fatigue, caused by prolonged exposure to digital screens, office and academic work, poor diet, and weak eye muscles.

You can do the 3 exercises we will mention, to decrease eye fatigue, eye irritation, dryness, burning, and poor or double vision.

1. Blinking: close your eyes and wait for 2 seconds and repeat. This can activate oil glands in the eyelids, so they can provide lubrication and hydration for your eyes.

2. Moving eyes: move your eyes up and down, side to side, rotate and rest in between each, and then repeat the cycle.

3. Palming: warm your hands by rubbing your hands, and then placing over your eyes, and breathing deeply; this can relax your eyes. Do these 3 exercises 5 minutes for each, then importantly don’t skip to rest your eyes to relax them.

4. Focusing on near and far object: focus on object1 replaced 10 inches or 25 cm far from your face for 15 seconds. Then focus on object2 20 feet away for 15 seconds, and repeat the cycle.

5. Figure Eight: Focus on the floor 10 feet far from you; draw eight with your eyes for 30 seconds, and do the same with drawing eight backward. Repeat each exercise for 5 minutes, then close your eyes to relax your eye muscles.

Also, you should regularly rest your eyes throughout the day. Use the 20-20-20 rule. Look at a target 20 feet away for 20 seconds, after 20 minutes of near work, in which you focus and work on the computer or book, and repeat (8 Easy Eye Exercises To Improve Vision: Techniques and Tips | Kraff Eye Institute, no date)(Kim, 2016).

Number 7. Get Enough Vitamin A.

Vitamin A deficiency can lead to severe eye conditions such as, night blindness, dry eye, and age-related eye diseases. Carrots, sweet potato, egg, milk, cheese, oily fish and fish oil, are excellent sources of vitamin A, an essential nutrient for eye health. An aging-associated eye disease called age-related macular degeneration is a cause of vision loss in older people. Other vitamins also support better vision. A large population study done in 2001, showed that taking Vitamins A, C, and E, zinc, and copper can decrease the risk of age-related macular degeneration by 25%. Eat a balanced and healthy diet, so you get can get these, as well as other vision-enhancing nutrients: vitamins B6, B9, and B12, riboflavin and niacin, and Omega-3 fatty acids, in particular DHA. (Vitamin A – Health Professional Fact Sheet, no date)(Kassoff et al., 2001)(Gilbert, 2013) 

Number 6. Eat foods high in lutein and zeaxanthin.

Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids primarily found in leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale, lettuce, broccoli, as well as egg yolks, and marigold extract. They show blue-light blocking effects, and function as antioxidants, protecting the eye from harmful UV rays from the sun, as well as environmental pollutants. Eating lutein and zeaxanthin-rich foods can improve eye dryness and fatigue, and protect against age-related macular degeneration and cataracts. Adding healthy fats like olive oil, grass-fed butter, and coconut oil to your salad or cooked greens, help improve the absorption of lutein and zeaxanthin; as does taking zinc foods or supplements.

In one study at the University of Georgia, doctors gave 30 men and women marigold extract. The results? The patients were able to see fine details better, and make out details more clearly at night. To see our recommended marigold extract, click the link below. (Eisenhauer et al., 2017)(Ma and Lin, 2010)(Kan et al., 2020) 

Number 5. Add anthocyanin-rich fruits to your diet.

Anthocyanin is an antioxidant found in berries such as blackberries, blueberries, bilberries, cranberries, and cherries. It protects the eyes from damaging effects caused by UV rays, and improves night vision. Add these berries to your diet to power up your eye health! (Khoo et al., 2017; Nomi, Iwasaki-Kurashige and Matsumoto, 2019). 

Number 4. Get quality sleep 

When you are sleeping, your eyes can finally get some rest. The duration and quality of sleep affect eye symptoms such as dryness. In a study done in 2019, the sleep quality of patients with dry eye diseases was examined. Results showed that patients with dry eyes had poor sleep quality, and tear secretion was not enough to hydrate the eyes. Importantly dry eyes can contribute to depression and anxiety too. Do you prefer sleeping lights or lights on? Even little light can your eyes, brain stimulation, and sleep quality.

In a study done in 2018, participants were exposed to light when sleeping; they had increased tiredness, discomfort in the eye, and their focus decreased.(Lee et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2019).  

Number 3. Wear the right glasses or lenses 

Our vision is changing day by day. When your eyes are tired, your vision is slightly less sharp. Visit your doctor to get the right prescription for your glasses and lenses. Fixing an appointment when you have a week to get enough sleep, a healthy diet, and balanced work, can increase your chances of getting the right prescription. Importantly, pay attention to hygiene if you’re using contact lenses. Make sure you have clean hands, and take out lenses when you’re sleeping, so you don’t get your eyes infected.

Number 2. Keep your eyes hydrated

The hydration level of the eyes influences eye health and diseases. Dehydration of the eye can be a reason for dry eye syndrome, changes in the retina’s blood vessels, and cataracts. Dry air can irritate your eyes, so environmental factors such as the humidity of the place you stay can affect your vision. The humidified environment can increase the tear’s hydrating effects on the eye. Maybe you can use room humidifiers if the air in your office or home is dry due to air conditioner use or weather. (Sherwin, Kokavec and Thornton, 2015)(Abusharha and Pearce, 2013; Wang et al., 2017) 

Number 1. Quit smoking.

We all know smoking can cause many diseases, and quitting smoking can give you not only healthy lungs, but also healthy eyes. Our eyes have blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the cells to function properly. Smoking damages blood vessels; therefore, it can cause eye diseases. Studies show smoking can be the reason for age-related macular degeneration, cataracts even vision loss or blindness(Vision Loss, Blindness, and Smoking | Overviews of Diseases/Conditions | Tips From Former Smokers | CDC, no date)

https://dailyhealthpost.com/real-reason-to-drink-lemon-water/,The Real Reason To Drink Lemon Water Revealed,"Lemon! A little sour, bitter, but fresh fruit overflowing with nutrients! If you are having problems with your skin, digestion, or feeling a little off, tired, and anxious…..why not try drinking lemon water everyday? Today, we explore 13 REAL benefits of taking lemon, and lemon water daily, according to science.

Number 13. “Lemon Water Is Nutritious”.

Drinking lemon water can be your safeguard throughout the day. It is a fantastic source of vitamin C, which will boost your immunity. On top of it, lemon water supports your eye health with vitamin A, gives you energy with vitamins B1, B2, and B3, strengthens your muscles with calcium and magnesium, and promotes your cardiovascular health with potassium.

To discover the exact benefits of these nutrients coming from lemon, watch this video till the end…..and be prepared to be amazed!

Moving on to Number 12. “Better Digestion, Happy Bowels”.

As discovered in the last decades, bowel health affects all of your body, from head to toe. Good bowel movement, and a healthy microbiome in the gut, will make you healthier. Lemon contains an ingredient called D-limonene, which increases the motility of your bowel and stomach, giving you a healthy digestive system. It also reduces gastric acid, and prevents unpleasant problems with the stomach, such as gastritis or reflux.

Number 11 addresses a modern life problem. “Reduce Stress and Pain”.

Mental health issues, especially anxiety, have hit the roof. Mental health affects overall health, so it is important, to manage the stress levels in our daily lives. D-limonene calms you down, by activating serotonin and dopamine, which are known as happiness hormones. It also inhibits pain receptors, so it can act as a painkiller.

Next, avoid this painful condition; Number 10 is “Prevent Kidney Stones”.

Kidney stones are formed by substances in the urine, including calcium. Approximately 80% of kidney stones are made of calcium. Lemon is rich in citrate, which binds to calcium. So, stone formation is inhibited, because calcium is no longer free. Studies show that drinking one-half cup of lemon juice concentrate, diluted in water each day, or the equivalent amount from two lemons, can increase urine citrate, and likely reduce kidney stone risk.

Want to look younger? Next up is Number 9, “Boost Collagen Synthesis”.

Collagen is the main element of your skin, hair, bones, and muscle. Vitamin C in lemon water is needed for collagen synthesis. Increased collagen production can give you firmer, younger, and glowing skin.

Next, boost blood oxygen levels. Number 8. “Increase Iron Absorption”.

Iron is an essential mineral for living cells, especially red blood cells. Iron is needed to synthesize hemoglobin, which carries oxygen to the organs. Considering the prevalence of iron deficiency, lemon water can be beneficial, especially when taken with iron sources, like meat, lentils, nuts, and spinach. Vitamin C in lemon water increases the absorption of iron from the intestines.

Next, prevent heart attack and stroke; Number 7 is “Support Cardiovascular Health”.

Lemon water may improve your heart health, by decreasing blood pressure. When you have lower blood pressure, your heart and blood vessels are healthier, and your organs can get enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly. Drinking lemon water also lowers the risk of cardiovascular diseases, because it prevents lipid accumulation in the blood vessels.

Next, prevent cell damage; Number 6 is “Increase Anti-Oxidant Activity”.

Reactive oxygen species, (ROS) are produced by metabolic processes, or environmental pollutants, and accumulate in your body. They are harmful to your cells, and we need anti-oxidant compounds to eliminate them. Here, lemon water comes into play.

Lemon is full of flavonoids, which are compounds showing anti-oxidant effects. Some flavonoids found in lemon are hesperidin, naringin, diosmin, and quercetin. The hesperidin in lemon, is an especially strong inhibitor of ROS. This anti-oxidant activity of lemon water, helps protect your cells and DNA, from the harmful effects of ROS.

Are you looking to lose weight? Number 5 is “Maintain Healthy Metabolism”.

A healthy metabolism is crucial for weight management. D-limonene in lemon water has positive effects on metabolism, and supports weight loss.

People with high cholesterol, and glucose levels can benefit from lemon water. Studies showed that D-limonene can decrease LDL, known as “bad cholesterol”, and help maintain healthy blood sugar levels, resulting in obesity prevention. In addition, if the liver or pancreas gets damaged, because of metabolic problems, D-limonene can show therapeutic effects too.

Number 4. Drink lemon water every day to “Reduce Inflammation”.

Chronic inflammation is detrimental to health. It makes your immune cells attack your own cells, and destroy them, resulting in tissue and organ damage, so it can affect every system in the body.

In a study done in 2015, individuals are given a low-calorie diet with 2 liters of lemon detox juice, containing 140 mg of lemon juice, and 2 liters of water every day. The people who drank lemon water every day, had lower C-reactive protein levels, which is an indicator of inflammation and infection in the body.

Down to our final 3. Number 3 is “Reduce Allergy Symptoms”.

Allergies are widespread, and can be really annoying sometimes. Usually, people with allergies are prescribed anti-histamine drugs. Luckily, lemon water can inhibit the release of histamine, which causes itching in your skin, and increases mucus and gastric acid production.

Number 2. Drink lemon water daily to “Protect Against Infections”.

Lemon is an acidic fruit. It can inhibit the growth of a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. For example, it can prevent bacterial infection from Escherichia Coli, which can cause urinary tract infections, or Candida Glabrata, which is a vaginal yeast infection. It also reduces viral infections, such as herpes simplex that causes cold sores. Besides the aforementioned infections, lemon has excellent effects on many microbes and viruses.

Finally, our Number 1 is “Protect Against DNA Damage”.

Cancer occurs because of genetic changes in the DNA, leading to abnormal growth of the cells. The vitamins and flavonoids in lemon water, can enhance anti-oxidant effects, preventing DNA from getting damaged. Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women.

A study done in 2012, showed that lemon seeds have beneficial effects on breast cancer, by inducing the death of carcinogenic cells. Even though 1 glass of lemon water cannot reverse cancer, it can prevent it, by eliminating oxidant molecules, that can be harmful to the DNA of the cells.

Lastly, what is the best time to drink lemon water?

You can drink lemon water in the morning, on an empty stomach, to get the nutrients to start a day with boosted immunity and energy. Or, you can drink hot lemon water before bed for relaxation.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-reduce-inflammation-in-lungs/,Top 12 Foods That Reduce Inflammation in Lungs,"Maintaining your lung health is vital for your overall well-being. Your chest may feel congested or inflamed after being exposed to pollutants, including cigarette smoke, air pollution, and other toxins that may negatively affect the lungs. Mucus builds up in the lungs to trap bacteria and infections, contributing to lung inflammation. Several lifestyle changes, including your eating habits, can help eliminate excess mucus from the lungs, fight or prevent inflammation, and improve breathing. Let’s take a closer look at your diet and the way certain foods may reduce inflammation in the lungs.

1. Pumpkin

Pumpkins include a range of lung-health-promoting plant chemicals in their vividly colored flesh. According to a scientific review, pumpkin is particularly high in carotenoids, such as zeaxanthin, lutein, and beta carotene, which have potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities. (1)

The research found that having increased levels of carotenoids is linked to better lung function in elders and children alike. Smokers can reap maximum perks from eating more foods rich in carotenoids like pumpkin. (2, 3)

One study revealed that people who smoke have 25% lower levels of carotenoid antioxidants than those who don’t smoke. As a result, smoking can trigger lung health issues, including chronic inflammation. (4)

2. Apples

Eating apples on a daily basis may help to clean your lungs and improve their overall function. Ex-smokers who consumed apples had a slower loss in lung function, according to research. Furthermore, eating 5 or more apples each week is linked to improved lung function and a lower chance of getting the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (5, 6)

A decreased incidence of asthma and lung cancer has also been related to apple consumption. This might be due to apples’ strong antioxidant content, which includes flavonoids and vitamin C. (7)

3. Beets

Beets and beet greens are high in nitrates, which optimize lung function. According to a scientific review, nitrates aid in the relaxation of blood vessels, the reduction of blood pressure, and the optimization of oxygen absorption. (8)

Research after research has shown that beets might enhance lung function and physical performance in patients with lung conditions, such as pulmonary hypertension and COPD. (9, 10)Pulmonary hypertension is a condition that triggers blood pressure spikes in the lungs.

Moreover, beet greens are overflowing with vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, and carotenoid antioxidants, which help boost lung health, reducing the risk of chronic inflammation.

4. Bell peppers

Bell peppers are among the best foods for healthy lungs. It’s an excellent source of water-soluble vitamin C, which works as a powerful antioxidant in the body. Consuming enough vitamin C is especially important for those who smoke or looking to heal their lungs from smoking.

One Korean study showed that smokers who consume more vitamin C have a stronger lung function than smokers who are deficient in this vitamin or don’t consume enough of it. (11) One medium-sized red bell pepper provides the body with 169% of the recommended vitamin C intake.

5. Turmeric

Turmeric’s high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties make it vital for promoting overall health. Turmeric’s major active ingredient, curcumin, may be particularly good for lung health. (12)

Another study that involved 2,478 people, found that curcumin consumption was linked to better lung function. Smokers who consumed the most curcumin had much better lung function than smokers who consumed the least curcumin. (13)

When compared to smokers who did not consume curcumin, high curcumin intake was related to 9.2 percent better lung function. (13)

6. Olive oil

If you’re looking to detox your lungs, invest in extra virgin olive oil. Olive oil consumption may help in reducing the risk of breathing problems such as asthma. Olive oil is high in anti-inflammatory antioxidants like polyphenols and vitamin E, which are responsible for its many health advantages.

The research that involved 871 participants concluded that increased intake of olive oil helped decrease the likelihood of asthma. (14) Thus, if you’re looking to start an anti-inflammatory diet, pay attention to the Mediterranean diet. This type of eating plan is particularly beneficial for people with asthma and COPD, and smokers.

7. Brazil nuts

One of the reasons why you should be eating more Brazil nuts is because they’re loaded with selenium, which is essential for healthy lungs. Though concentrations vary substantially depending on growth circumstances, a single Brazil nut can offer more than 150 percent of the required daily selenium intake. (15)

According to studies, high selenium consumption can help prevent lung cancer, promote respiratory function in individuals with asthma, and boost immune function and antioxidant defenses, all of which can promote lung health. (16, 17, 18) Aim to have one or two Brazil nuts to protect your lungs from inflammation.

8. Fatty Fish

Fatty fish is rich in omega-3s, which boast anti-inflammatory abilities. A researcher from La Trobe University claimed eating fish twice a week might help treat lung inflammation in kids with asthma.

The scientific trial included 64 children diagnosed with moderate asthma from Athens, Greece, ranging in age from 5 to 12. Scientists from Australia and Greece separated the children into two groups.

The first group consumed two servings or 150 grams of cooked fatty fish per week for 6 months as part of the Greek Mediterranean diet. The second group ate their regular meals. The fish-eating group in the study had a 14-unit reduction in bronchial inflammation. (19)

9. Swiss chard

A dark leafy green, Swiss chard packs magnesium that has been shown to fight inflammation and keep your bronchioles (small airways within your lungs) flexible, reducing airway obstruction. (20) Several studies concluded that high magnesium intake promotes lung function while reduced levels of this mineral are linked to worsened symptoms in COPD patients. (21, 22, 23)

A diet rich in leafy green vegetables like Swiss chard has been associated with a lower risk of lung cancer and COPD in several studies. (21, 24)

10. Red cabbage

Red cabbage contains plant pigments called anthocyanins, which give this vegetable its bright color. According to a scientific review, regular anthocyanin consumption helps prevent a decline in lung function. (25) Additionally, red cabbage is brimming with fiber that has been linked to better lung function. (26)

When compared with green cabbage, the red variety contains a great amount of powerful antioxidants, cancer-fighting flavonoids, and 10x more vitamins which are all good for lung health.

11. Blueberries

Blueberries help preserve and protect lung function thanks to their rich nutrient content. These berries can also aid in treating inflammation in the body. (27) Blueberries contain anthocyanins, such as petunidin, delphinidin, peonidin, malvidin, and cyaniding. Anthocyanins have been studied to suppress the effect of oxidative stress on lung tissue. (28)

In a research of 839 veterans, it was shown that blueberry consumption was linked to the slowest rate of decrease in lung function. Eating 2 or more servings of blueberries per week inhibits lung function decline by more than 38% when compared to little or no blueberry consumption. (29)

12. Tomatoes

Tomato is a wonderful source of a carotenoid antioxidant, lycopene, which has been linked to better lung health. One study found that eating tomato products helps decrease airway inflammation in patients with asthma as well as enhance lung function in patients with COPD. (30)

A diet high in tomatoes was linked to a decreased frequency of poorly managed asthma in 105 adults with asthma, according to a 2019 research. In addition, tomato consumption is linked to a slower deterioration among pulmonary function in ex-smokers. (31, 32)

Final thoughts

While there’s no food item that can magically treat inflammation in the lungs, a healthy diet can significantly reduce it. Consider including a few of the aforementioned foods in your eating plan to help prevent inflammation and support your overall lung health.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/increase-blood-oxygen-levels-naturally/,Top 9 Ways to Increase Blood Oxygen Levels Naturally,"Increasing blood oxygen boosts your energy; because cells need oxygen to produce energy. It also enhances the immune system, and cognitive function, by improving concentration and memory. In today’s video, we explore 9 ways you can increase blood oxygen levels naturally.

Make sure you watch till the end, because one of them is an important nutrient most people don’t get enough. As always, this video is educational, and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

First, how do you measure your blood oxygen level?

Your blood oxygen level, or oxygen saturation, indicates how much oxygen your red blood cells are carrying. Anyone can measure this with a pulse oximeter (pulse ox); this is a non-invasive device with a sensor placed on your fingertip. Or your doctor can measure this accurately, with an arterial blood gas test, in which blood is drawn from the artery in your wrist.

Next, what happens to your body when blood oxygen levels are too low?

Normal blood oxygen levels range between 75 to 100 millimeters of mercury. (mm Hg); pulse ox reading is 95 to 100%. Oxygen deficiency can occur if it is below 60 mm Hg; or pulse ox reading falls below 95%. When the blood oxygen level is insufficient, hypoxemia is diagnosed, which further causes hypoxia, in which low oxygen levels adversely affect organ health. Lung diseases such as asthma, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, and sleep apnea, can be the reason for hypoxemia. The symptoms of hypoxemia are headaches, shortness of breath, coughing, rapid heartbeat, changes in skin color and lips.

Number 9. “Eating Iron-Rich Foods”.

People who live in a hypoxic environment, such as in high altitude places, or who have hypoxemia, need more iron to produce hemoglobin. Oxygen diffuses through tiny, balloon-shaped air sacs in the lungs called alveoli, and enters the blood stream. It binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, and travels to every body part. Because iron deficiency is common in children, pregnant women, women of reproductive age, athletes, and seniors, monitoring dietary iron intake is critical. Great sources of iron are meats, eggs, milk, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, and iron-fortified cereals.

Number 8. “Drink Beetroot Juice”.

Beetroot is rich in nitrates, which is used for nitric oxide synthesis. Nitric oxide is a compound that has beneficial effects for repairing blood vessels, and lowering blood pressure, resulting in increased oxygen delivery to organs. A study on active individuals, showed that 3-day beetroot juice supplementation significantly increased oxygen uptake. Besides beetroot juice, you can get nitrates naturally from spinach, lettuce, carrot, and potatoes.

Number 7. “Eat Foods With Creatine”.

Creatine is an amino acid found in all cells in the body. It plays an important role in tissues where the body needs instant power, such as muscles; that’s why athletes supplement with it, to help them train, and improve muscle performance. A study showed that 2-week creatine supplementation, helped improve muscle strength and lung function, during rehabilitation for patients who had pulmonary disease, such as COPD or Asthma. Creatine can increase blood oxygen levels by making oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange easier. You can get creatine naturally from lean meats, fish and dairy.

Number 6. “Get Your Antioxidants: Vitamin C and E”.

Oxidative stress occurs when your body’s antioxidant status decreases, or reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase, due to increased metabolic needs, high oxygen levels, or environmental pollutants. ROS are free radicals that contain oxygen, and easily react with other molecules in a cell, causing damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins, and even “cell death”.

Oxidative stress can result in lung disease with breathing problems. Lung cells are exposed to high amounts of oxygen, so they are highly susceptible to oxidative stress. In a 2018 clinical trial, vitamins C and E given together to patients with lung injury, was shown to increase oxygen levels significantly. These two vitamins act as antioxidants to capture ROS, and make them harmless. You can get dietary vitamin C from orange, tangerine, kiwi, strawberry, broccoli, and vitamin E from vegetable oils like olive and sunflower oil, and nuts and seeds.

Number 5. “Consume Less Salt”.

Continued high intake of salt can cause high blood pressure, that narrows blood vessels resulting in decreased oxygen to organs. Foods that contain high amounts of salt include bacon, cheese, pickles, salami, salted and dry-roasted nuts, soy sauce, and most importantly, packaged foods. When you eat these foods, make sure to control your portion size.

Number 4. “Breathing Techniques and Exercise”.

As the American Lung Association suggests, breathing with the right techniques, and doing aerobic exercises, can improve lung efficiency for breathing. Normally, your lungs are elastic, but with lung diseases and hypoxemia, they lose their elasticity, making less room for the diaphragm to work fully. So the neck, chest, and back muscles are used for breathing instead. This change results in lower blood oxygen levels, and decreased exercise capacity.

Diaphragm breathing, commonly known as belly breathing, is taught by rehabilitation specialists to make breathing easier for lung disease patients. With these exercises, you can strengthen your muscles, making it possible to breathe normally. The diaphragm can take control back with breathing exercises, and blood oxygen levels can increase. So how can you do this? Make sure your neck and shoulders are relaxed. Breathe through your nose, till the air fills up in your belly, and you can see your belly moving. Then breathe out through your mouth 2 or 3 times longer than you breathe in, and practice this, 5 to 10 minutes every day.

Number 3. “Change Sleeping Position”.

In lung diseases and hypoxemia, airflow is disturbed because the lungs are less elastic, and airways become narrower. During sleep, hypoxemia increases cardiac arrhythmia, which can affect life expectancy. While sleeping, some positions help you breathe easily, and allow more oxygen into your lungs, as suggested by the British Lung Foundation. First position. Using a pillow to support your head, lie on your side on the floor, and slightly bend the knee of the leg you are lying on, with the top leg straight. This position should help when you’re feeling breathless. Second position. Sit in front of the table, then lean, and rest your arms and head, on the pillow on the table. This should help when you feel short of breath.

Number 2. “Quit Smoking”.

Worldwide statistics show that smoking is the number one cause of preventable diseases and death. Cigarettes contain thousands of harmful chemicals which cause hypoxemia, lung diseases such as COPD, chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer. A study showed that smoking one pack a day causes tissue hypoxia, resulting in cell dysfunction or death.

Smoking also narrows blood vessels, and causes a loss of elasticity, so oxygen delivery to the tissues is decreased. If you’re a smoker, you should consider quitting to prevent breathing problems and lung diseases.

Number 1. “Eat Magnesium-Rich Foods”.

Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs, to blood vessels. When blood vessels widen, oxygen diffusion increases. Magnesium helps to relax the lung muscles, and increase airflow, resulting in increased oxygen delivery to the blood. Therefore, magnesium can improve shortness of breath, and asthma symptoms, in which airways become tightened, making it difficult to breathe. Magnesium deficiency may increase blood pressure, resulting in lower blood oxygen levels. In a clinical trial done in 2012, magnesium was administered to patients with lung disease. This resulted in lower blood pressure and, importantly, improved blood oxygen saturation. Magnesium-rich foods you can add to your diet, include bananas, yoghurt, avocado, dark chocolate, almonds, whole grains, lima beans, pumpkin seeds, and spinach.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/pomegranate-benefits/,These 11 Pomegranate Benefits Are Amazing!,"Do you know what happens to your body, when you consume pomegranate fruit or juice regularly? That’s exactly what you’re going to discover, in today’s video. Make sure you watch till the end, as most people are not aware of these health benefits of pomegranate, that are proven by science.

As always, this video is educational, and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Number 11. Reduce Inflammation.

Chronic inflammation is a major contributor to a variety of severe disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Pomegranates pack powerful antioxidants called punicalagins, that help remove free radicals, protect cells from damage, and reduce inflammation. It has been shown to have 3 times more antioxidant activity than green tea or wine.

A 12-week trial involving 50 patients with type 2 diabetes, showed that drinking 1.1 cups (250 ml) of pomegranate juice daily reduced the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by 32% and 30%, respectively. (4)

Number 10. Improve Heart Health.

Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality around the globe. The major fatty acid in pomegranates, punicic acid, may help ward off numerous stages of the heart disease process. A 2004 study, published in the journal Clinical Nutrition, took 10 patients with atherosclerosis, and measured their carotid arteries, before and after one year of supplementing their diet with pomegranate juice. The results showed that pomegranate juice consumption reduced the plaque clogging their carotid arteries by more than 30%, after 1 year. Additional “side-effects” included decreased LDL oxidation, and blood pressure.

In a four-week study, taking 800 mg of pomegranate seed oil daily, considerably reduced triglycerides, and decreased the triglyceride-HDL ratio in 51 individuals with high triglyceride levels. Pomegranate juice has also been proven to inhibit LDL cholesterol particles from oxidation, which is one of the major steps on the road to cardiovascular diseases, in both human and animal studies. (13)

Number 9. Enhance Memory.

Eating pomegranates regularly has also been shown to aid in preventing Alzheimer’s disease, and retaining overall cognitive health. (7) Another study involving 28 older adults who have memory issues, found that drinking 8 ounces (237 ml) of pomegranate juice per day enhanced markers of both visual and verbal memory. (6) In one trial, taking 2 grams of pomegranate extract daily, protected the memory in patients following heart surgery. (5)

Number 8. Combat Bacteria and Infections.

Pomegranates contain the compounds, punicalagins and punicic acid, that aid in combating dangerous micro-organisms. (8) Several studies have found that pomegranates fight the yeast Candida albicans, and various types of bacteria. (9, 10)

The anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties of pomegranates have been shown to protect your mouth from inflammation and infections, including denture stomatitis, periodontitis, and gingivitis! (11, 12)

Number 7. Ease the Symptoms of Arthritis.

There are many distinct forms of arthritis, but the majority of them include joint inflammation. Pomegranate plant compounds have anti-inflammatory properties, thus they may help in the treatment of arthritis. Laboratory studies revealed that pomegranate extract can inhibit enzymes that harm joints in osteoarthritis patients. (17, 18)

Number 6. Keep Blood Pressure at Bay.

Hypertension (high blood pressure) is one of the primary causes of stroke and heart attack. Researchers found that people with hypertension who consumed 5 ounces (150 ml) of pomegranate juice daily for two weeks had a substantial drop in blood pressure. (21) Other research has revealed comparable results, particularly for systolic blood pressure (the greater number in a blood pressure reading). (22, 23)

Number 5. Lower Prostate Cancer Risk.

Prostate cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in males. Pomegranate extract has been shown in lab experiments to decrease cancer cell reproduction and even trigger apoptosis, or cell death, in cancer cells. (24, 25)

The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a prostate cancer blood marker. Prostate cancer is more likely to negatively affect men whose PSA levels double in a brief span of time. In a human study, consuming 8 ounces (237 ml) of pomegranate juice every day, extended the time it took for PSA to double from 15 months to 54 months – a significant increase. A follow-up study found similar improvements using a type of pomegranate extract called POMx. (26)

Number 4. Prevent Breast Cancer.

One of the most common cancers in women is breast cancer. Pomegranate extract has been shown to stop breast cancer cells from reproducing and even destroy some of them. (27, 28) This is due to flavonoids and antioxidants found in pomegranates, including punicalagins, ellagitannin, and ellagic acid.

Number 3. Treat Erectile Dysfunction.

The antioxidants in pomegranate juice may raise the endothelial nitric oxide levels, which affect erectile dysfunction linked to atherosclerosis. (31) One study found that drinking pomegranate juice can help enhance erectile response and blood flow – although larger and longer studies are needed.(30)

Number 2. Boost Exercise Efficiency.

Pomegranate packs dietary nitrates, which are converted to nitric oxide, and may potentially boost your exercise efficiency. In a treadmill trial of 19 athletes, 1 gram of pomegranate extract 30 minutes before training dramatically increased blood flow, postponing exhaustion, and boosting exercise performance. (32)

Another 2016 study involving nine elite weightlifters, found that consuming pomegranate juice 60 minutes before training, resulted in faster recovery and delayed muscle soreness. (33)

Number 1. Strengthen Immune System.

Pomegranates are overflowing with vitamin C and vitamin E, which act as antioxidants lowering the risk of infection and disease. Consuming one pomegranate fruit provides the body with around 28 mg or 50 percent of the daily recommended vitamin C intake. Eating pomegranate has been found to lessen the length and intensity of cold symptoms.

As you can see, pomegranates are chock full of powerful health benefits. Eating pomegranates on a regular basis will do wonders for your health. One cup of pomegranate provides a substantial amount of your daily required mineral intake, including calcium, potassium, iron, selenium, manganese, copper, zinc, and phosphorus. It’s also an excellent source of folate, vitamin B6, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin K, vitamin E, and vitamin C. If you’re not eating pomegranates yet, why not start today?

Difficulty sleeping leads to lower productivity, lack of energy and poor health. Stress and anxiety cause most sleep-related issues. Many studies show that being surrounded by nature helps lower cortisol level and blood pressure. It also boosts immune function and triggers relaxation (1). In addition, plants purify air by absorbing odours and molds that can impact breathing and lung health.

Read below to find out which plants work best for you!

Useful Tips

If you have pets or children, make sure the plants you have at home are non-toxic. Toxic plants should be given away or kept in unreachable places.

Wipe off dust from the leaves of your plants every week. This will ensure that they can properly filter air.

NASA recommends between 15-18 air purifying plants for a 1800 square feet home. Make sure to place a few in each bedroom (2).

1. Jasmine

Jasmine is a bushy and trailing plant with delicate white or pink flowers. Jasmine is known to lower anxiety, which helps lull you to deeper, more restful sleep (3).

Keeping a jasmine plant in your bedroom at night will contribute to increased alertness and productivity during the day. Plus, it has a delicate and refreshing scent!

2. Lavender

Lavender has one of the most well-known sleep-inducing aromas. It’s known to slow down heart rate and lower blood pressure and stress levels (4).

One study found that it reduced crying in babies and helped them sleep. This greatly lowered stress for mother and child (5).

In women, lavender facilitates light sleep and decreases rapid-eye movement during sleep. It also reduces the time it takes to fall asleep (6).

3. Snake Plant

Snake plants are one of the easiest plants to take care of.

It can be watered as little as every 2-3 weeks.

Like most plants, it thrives off carbon dioxide at night and turns it into oxygen.

Studies show that increased oxygen levels lead to better sleep (7).

Snake plant also clean airborne toxins like formaldehyde, trichloroethylene and benzene (1).

4. Aloe Vera

Aloe Vera is a great plant for people who don’t have a green thumb. It tolerates neglect and missed waterings.

The plant reproduces easily, meaning that one plant will spawn enough babies to fill your home.

Slicing aloe vera lengthwise releases gel that can be used to relieve minor cuts and burns, insect bites, dry skin and sunburns.

5. Gardenia

Gardenia blooms fill your home with a lovely fragrance.

It’s an effective plant for treating insomnia and poor sleep (8). A recent study found it to be as effective as Valium in relieving anxiety and promoting sleep (9).

Gardenias need lots of bright indirect sunlight and proper care. It might not be the best option for a first-time plant carer.

6. Spider Plant

Spider plants are true fighters.

They can clear up to 90% of the formaldehyde in the air of your home (1). This chemical is a potential carcinogen and is found in most buildings. Common sources of formaldehyde include adhesives, grout and fillers used during construction.

Spider plants also absorb odours and fumes, improving overall air quality for you and your family.

7. Valerian

Valerian is a perennial that blooms in the summer and smells sweet. It requires about 6 hours of full sunlight a day.

The blooms were a popular perfume component in the 16th century. The root, on the other hand, was used in tea and tincture to treat insomnia.

If you’re having trouble sleeping, breathing in its scent will speed up the process (10).

8. English Ivy

English ivy is very simple to grow. It requires very little light to thrive.

This plant has been known to improve symptoms of allergies or asthma (11). This also translates to better sleep for those with breathing problems. In as little as 12 hours, English Ivy cleans up to 94% of airborne feces and 78% of airborne mould (12).

Ivy is a trailing plant, so keep it on a tall shelf or in a hanging basket. Make sure to prune it as it grows to keep it out of reach from pets and children.

9. Peace Lily

Also known as spathiphyllum, the peace lily is very easy to care of. It’s very forgiving after periods of neglect and droops when it needs more water.

By suppressing airborne microbes, the peace lily helps relieves allergy symptoms, which can helps relieve those irritating dry noses and throats that keep you awake all night.

This plant also removes benzene, trichloroethylene, and formaldehyde toxins from household air. It can increase humidity in a room by up to 5% thanks to the moisture of its flowers.

10. Golden Pothos

Pothos is a hanging plant that requires very little attention.

It can remove almost 9000 micrograms of formaldehyde from the air in as little as 24 hours. It also removes over 70% of airborne benzene in the same time period (1). Air filtration also occurs within its soil.

If you live in the city, consider placing it near your bedroom window to detoxify any air that may be coming in.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/boost-nitric-oxide/,Eat 3 Foods Daily To Boost Nitric Oxide,"Would you like to discover 3 foods you can eat daily, to boost nitric oxide production in the body, support cardiovascular health, and is proven by science? The effects of each food “layer” on top of each other, and have been found to improve blood flow, which helps reduce blood pressure. Studies have shown that cardiovascular disease risk is strongly associated with an increase in blood pressure, even when this is still within normal range.

Scroll to end for studies

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

Number 3. Nitrate-Rich Vegetables.

Consume at least 1 to 2 servings of vegetables daily. If you want to be precise, aim for 6.4 to 12.8 mg of nitrates per kilogram of body weight per day (or 2.9 to 5.8 mg per pound per day).

Number 2. Cocoa or Dark Chocolate.

Get your cocoa polyphenols, by eating about 30 grams of cocoa powder or 40 grams of dark chocolate with a 75% cocoa content.

Number 1. Garlic or Aged-Garlic.

Take 3 to 6 cloves of garlic (or 600 to 1,200 mg of an aged garlic extract) over several meals.

Nitrate-rich vegetables, cocoa, and garlic work synergistically to improve your cardiovascular system. Nitrates increase your blood levels of nitric oxide which improves blood flow. Cocoa helps maintain those high nitric oxide levels. Garlic enhances signaling for more nitric oxide production – so you can get your heart pumping strong!

Other than lowering blood pressure, boosting nitric oxide production helps enhance exercise performance, support weight loss, and delay cognitive decline.

Next, let’s look at each of these foods in detail.
Food Number 3: Nitrates.

Eating nitrate-rich foods is an effective way to increase nitric oxide synthesis in the body. This is the process:

Bacteria in the mouth convert some nitrates to nitrites.

In the stomach, nitrites are converted into nitric oxide.

Leftover nitrates and nitrites are absorbed in the small intestine.

The nitrates and nitrites that reach the blood can be converted into nitric oxide – a molecule that acts as a natural vasodilator – meaning it opens blood vessels.

Elevated nitric oxide levels are associated with better circulation and lower blood pressure. Eating nitrate-containing vegetables improves the function of endothelial cells that line the inside of your blood vessels. As an added bonus, it reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease – including peripheral artery disease, cancer, and premature death.

Nitrates are abundantly found in beetroot and leafy greens. These vegetables can be consumed whole or in liquid form (juice, smoothie, or purée) over several meals. They can also be drunk in one sitting a couple of hours before exercise.

The nitrate-rich vegetables in descending order of nitrate content are: arugula, turnip greens, dill, collard greens, spinach, Swiss chard, turnips, rhubarb, beetroot, celery, mustard greens, radish, lettuce, watercress, Bok choy, kale, and parsley.

Here’s a tip: Most vegetables rich in nitrates are also rich in oxalate, which can increase the risk of kidney stones. The solution is to cook the vegetables, or pair with calcium-rich foods to reduce oxalate absorption.

Food Number 2: Cocoa.

When nitric oxide is created, it has a half-life of only a few seconds due to its highly reactive nature. This means that this molecule can only travel limited distances before being oxidized. This is where cocoa and dark chocolate come into play. The high concentration of flavonoids like epicatechin in this delicious treat, helps support the high nitric oxide levels you’ve achieved by eating nitrate-rich vegetables.

Several potential mechanisms are supposed to be responsible for the positive effect of cocoa; among them the activation of nitric oxide synthase – the enzyme that is responsible for the production of nitric oxide in cells, and anti-inflammatory properties.

Food Number 1: Garlic.

Lastly, garlic enhances the signaling of nitric oxide. However, its blood pressure lowering effects are mostly due to another compound: hydrogen sulfide. Whether eaten as part of a meal or supplemented, garlic is a potent food that increases hydrogen sulfide signaling in the body — and helps relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure.

To maximize this effect, make sure to first cut or crush the cloves, to activate their bioactive compounds before cooking them or eating them raw. If you dislike the smell or taste of garlic, or if you wish to avoid the strong breath that comes from eating the cloves, you can choose to supplement with 600 to 1,200 mg of an aged garlic extract daily for the same benefits.

In those with high cholesterol (greater than 200 mg/dL, greater than 5.5 mmol/L), the consumption of garlic for two months or more, can moderately reduce total as well as LDL cholesterol, and slightly increase HDL. Because it improves several cardiovascular parameters, garlic makes a good heart-protective food.

What happens when you eat these three foods daily?

Your heart can pump blood more efficiently without putting any strain on your body, because each ingredient in this dietary combo, complements each other to effectively dilate blood vessels and reduce blood pressure. Since these three foods are hypotensive agents – meaning they lower blood pressure – start at the low end of the consumption range and monitor your blood pressure.

Finally – get enough regular exercise! Other than reducing stress levels, exercise increases your body’s natural ability to produce nitric oxide.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-improve-blood-in-legs/,Top 10 Foods that Improve Blood Circulation in Legs,"Are you experiencing cramps, pain, and fatigue in your legs? Poor circulation in the legs, ankle, and feet, can cause edema, varicosis, and venous diseases. In today’s video, we’ll explore 10 foods that boost circulation in the legs. Make sure you watch till the end, cause we’ll mention one spice that has amazing benefits for your arteries, that you’ll want to eat daily.

Number 10. Potassium-Rich Foods.

Potassium is a vasoactive mineral that increases blood flow, by widening blood vessels to the organs and limbs, resulting in reduced pain, and increased nutrient and oxygen flow. Potassium is beneficial for a healthy circulatory system – the network of blood vessels that carry blood away from, and towards the heart – because it helps to lower blood pressure. Luckily, it is widely found in foods. The western diet is full of salty foods, which are rich in sodium and poor in potassium, resulting in increased blood pressure. You can balance sodium to potassium intake by consuming potatoes, bananas, broccoli, tomato, beans, and legumes which are the best nutritional sources of potassium.

Number 9. Vitamin D Sources.

Vitamin D is a vasoactive vitamin, and has a vital role in regenerating the vascular system. The anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D prevent blood vessels and the heart from oxidative damage caused by metabolic processes and environmental pollutants. A 2014 study published in Circulation, showed that supplementation of daily 4000 IU cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), which is a bioactive form of vitamin D, promotes regeneration of blood vessels. Although fish, milk, eggs contain vitamin D, sunlight is the primary source of it. You can get enough vitamin D by getting sunlight for 5 to 15 minutes. Sufficient vitamin D levels can elevate the repair of blood vessels resulting in better circulation to the legs. For better results, take vitamin D3 with K2, as K2 helps to prevent stiff arteries caused by calcium buildup, and returns calcium to the bones where it is needed for growth.

Number 8. Fish as a Source of Omega3.

Fish is a well-known food for its benefits for the vascular system. It is a healthy fatty acid, found in vast amounts in fish (as DHA and EPA), and minor amounts in walnuts, flax seeds, and chia seeds (as alpha-linolenic acid). Omega-3 shows antioxidant effects by preventing oxidative damage to the blood vessels and heart. It also helps relax the muscle cells of blood vessels, which results in increased blood flow, and lower blood pressure. Fish that contain the highest amount of omega-3 are mackerel, sablefish, salmon, sardines, and tuna. The approximate recommended daily intake of Omega-3 is 1000 mg.

Number 7. Grapes and Red Wine.

Grape is a rich source of polyphenols which are potent antioxidants. Also, they modulate LDL, also known as “bad cholesterol”, therefore preventing the clotting of blood vessels. Importantly, the polyphenols in grapes help to reduce blood pressure and improve the elasticity of blood vessels. In one 2004 study published in BioFactors, daily grape supplementation was given to hypertensive patients; their blood pressure was reduced due to polyphenolic compounds. Polyphenols in grapes help promote circulation in legs and other organs, contributing to open, healthy blood vessels.

Number 6. Tea Which Contains Catechins.

Drinking 1 or more cups of black or green tea daily, has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases because of their effects on lowering blood pressure. Tea is an enormous source of catechins which is a type of polyphenol. A study published in Nutrients 2021, showed that when healthy people take catechin-containing green tea extract, their blood flow to their legs was increased. At the same time, vascular resistance improved, suggesting that blood flow was more effortless due to decreased resistance from blood vessels. Catechins help in relaxation of blood vessels through nitric oxide formation, which has strong effects on blood circulation by widening blood vessels. Other catechin sources are red wine, strawberries, apples, and cherries. 

Number 5. Cacao and Dark Chocolate.

Higher consumption of cacao has been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular diseases. Cacao also contains a more elevated amount of catechins. Studies showed that cacao or dark chocolate could lower blood pressure which increases blood flow. It also prevents endothelial dysfunction – this means the arteries are narrowing when they should be opening, thus causing chest pain. Even in serious cardiovascular problems, cacao supplementation showed beneficial effects on the dilation of arteries.

Number 4. Garlic as a Rich Source of L-arginine.

Garlic is rich in L-arginine, an amino acid that is critical for nitric oxide synthesis, which helps blood vessels relax. A 2004 study published in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, showed supplementation of garlic tablets increased blood flow to the legs. Garlic also modulates serum lipids, and prevents the accumulation of lipid. Some of us find garlic hard to consume. If that’s you, there are other sources of L-arginine, including red meat, fish, and eggs.

Number 3. Green Leafy Vegetables.

The venous system is vital for healthy circulation. It helps the return of blood to the heart and prevents edema. A higher intake of green vegetables is associated with a healthier venous system. Some green leafy vegetables that you can add to your diet are kale, cabbage, broccoli, lettuce and spinach. Studies have shown that healthy people who ate spinach had higher dilation of blood vessels, indicating increased blood flow to the organs. This is because spinach contains nitrates that affect nitric oxide levels, a compound that helps blood vessels widen. Besides, vegetables contain a high amount of fiber, which lowers blood lipid levels, and prevents clotting in blood vessels; it’s recommended to take around 8 ounces of vegetables daily.

Number 2. Cayenne Pepper.

Cayenne pepper is made from chili peppers and used as a spice. It affects metabolism, resulting in increased blood flow in arteries and veins. It also improves common lipid problems such as high triglyceride and cholesterol levels. As a bonus, its main ingredient capsaicin, also shows beneficial effects on blood circulation. Capsaicin improves the effects of nitric oxide on blood vessels resulting in lower blood pressure.

Number 1. Vitamin C.

Fatigue, pain, leg cramping can be causes of blood vessel abnormalities in the legs. Vitamin C has beneficial effects on blood vessels through its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In a 2001 study published in Circulation, vitamin C levels were assessed in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), in which lipid accumulates in the wall of blood vessels and negatively affects blood circulation in legs and feet. Researchers found that vitamin C levels were two times lower in PAD patients compared to healthy people. Fortunately, vitamin C is easily available in fruits such as orange, kiwi, lemon, strawberry, and tomato.

There you have it! The top 10 foods that boost circulation in your legs.

Your cardiovascular system includes the heart, veins, and arteries, which are the blood vessels. When your cardiovascular system is healthy, it results in good blood circulation in the body, meaning your organs and limbs, can receive the needed nutrients and oxygen to function properly.

While varicose veins, ulcers, and venous insufficiency or buildup of blood in the feet, are not life-threatening, edema or swelling in the lower legs could be a sign of heart failure.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/granny-pod-bringing-family-together/,High-Tech “Granny Pods” Could Be The Solution To Expensive Nursing Homes. This Is Genius!,"In American society, family members tend to grow apart as they age. When they can no longer live a fully independent life, older relatives typically end up in retirement homes. These homes may provide medical assistance, but they also make their residents feel isolated from their families. This can lead to loneliness, depression and even early death. (Updated Nov 30, 2021)

Families aren’t always able to take in a loved one with medical needs. Many may feel as though their home isn’t safe enough for an older guest. That’s all about to change.

Innovating Family-Managed Care

Reverend Ken Dupin, the founder of N2Care wanted to change the way Americans families think of their elderly. He says he was inspired by how families around the world kept their grandparents close-by.

He told Fox News: “At the end of one’s life everywhere else in the world you basically come back into the family…but I didn’t see that happening here in the United States.”

He found that the main problem was that families were ill-equipped to take care of the elderly: “One of the things that we came up with was the fact that there were not a lot of good options to families participating in the care of their loved ones.”

So he began thinking about how to bring families together whilst maintaining independence and privacy. The result is a mobile cottage with everything a grandparent would need.

The MedCottage

Affectionately named “Granny Pods” these 12 feet by 24 feet homes plug into existing electrical and plumbing outlets.

They are specially built with the health of a senior in mind, being handicap-accessible and full of safety features. Small enough to fit in a backyard, every room is made to be within reach, including a small kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.

The bathroom can also be connected to the bedroom thanks to a ceiling track to accomodate a resident with mobility issues.

Safety features include webcams for monitoring by family members and a padded floor, which is great for the joints and provides extra protection in the event of a fall. The home can also remind its resident to take medication or alert caregivers in the event of an emergency.

The cottages are equipped with high-tech safety measures and communication tools. It can be upgraded to accommodate more vulnerable or ill elderly too. You can take a look at all the tech specs here:

Social media is no longer just a virtual world but a real present part of our lives. We’ve come to accept Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp and other forms of social media as the place where we share our important memories and thoughts with the world. This new reality is transforming our romantic relationships for the worst. 

Today, if you want to show you love someone, then you’d need to regularly share your feelings about them on social media. But does it have to be so? Can’t we just enjoy our partners in silence without getting any of our online followers involved? The bitter truth is that if you don’t post about your relationship, your friends and family might say that you’re not committed or you’re ashamed of your partner. Some may even go as far as accusing you of cheating. 

Gone are the days when a third date meant the relationship is official. Now all you have to do is post one “loved-up” photo of yourselves on Instagram or Snapchat; and Voila! Your relationship is verified.  

Because this is the new normal, you may not see anything wrong with sharing intimate details about your relationship on social media. In today’s digital world, people depend on your online feed and status to know how you’re doing. But the reality is that you don’t need the approval of social media to be in a loving and satisfying relationship. 

You Don’t Need Online Approval…

Evidence shows that people who constantly post on social media suffer from depression and social anxiety (1). Spending so much time on Instagram makes you view the lives of others as more interesting and perfect. Without realizing it, you’ll start feeling pressured to keep up with the trends. You may even be tempted to buy expensive things you can’t afford and even hold on to a failed relationship because of what your followers might say. 

Your life is not a movie, you should not be explaining your actions to strangers who probably don’t care as much about you as you think. According to one study, people who are in a happy relationship don’t care if their pictures are on their partner’s social media page or not (2). Instead, these couples focus more on spending time together and strengthening their love. 

It is also common to find partners who seem perfect on social media, but they can’t stand each other in reality. One study (3) says that couples who spend more time together offline are more satisfied, fulfilled, and committed in their relationship than others who focus on their online presence. 

When you spend time with your partner, you get to know them better. Moreover, the most important thing in a relationship is that you’re able to understand and invest in yourselves. For example, you could talk about your partner’s day, their goals, and aspirations in life. You should also make out time to listen to them and simply enjoy the special moments of love and attention you spend together. 

You’ll see that when you’re not worried about painting the perfect picture on social media, your mind will be more relaxed, and you’ll notice other important priorities in your life. 

How to Build A Lasting and Happy Relationship?
1. Make time to go to the places you both love: 

You don’t need to go to the fanciest place to feel like you’re in a happy relationship. Most times these places are very expensive; Instead, you should make your own romantic experiences by visiting the places you both like. 

Your partner could pick the location now and the next time, you make the choice. It’s good that you both plan the trips as this also counts as spending time together. You may not like the same places but that’s okay. What matters is that you’re spending time with your significant other and getting to know your partner more by sharing their interest. 

2. Always communicate: 

If you don’t speak up, then your partner will never know how you feel or what you’re thinking. Most relationships fail because there’s no communication. You can’t hide in a relationship; you’ve already decided that this person is the one for you, so don’t hold back. 

You should be comfortable being vulnerable with them; Don’t guess what your better half thinks, instead talk to them. When you have any issue in the relationship, do not wait for the other person to notice, talk about your concerns or it may cause further misunderstandings in the relationship. 

3. Be honest:

If you want to have a happy and lasting relationship, you should aim to be honest. Telling lies breaks the trust and respect your partner has for you. Make sure you don’t lie about what you do for a living, your sexual desires, finances, age or even the little things that you may think doesn’t matter. 

4. Be ready to say I’m sorry: 

As humans, we have different personalities and we come from diverse backgrounds. No one is perfect and it’s normal for couples to disagree about certain things. 

You should learn to let go and stop trying to prove that you’re always right. Sometimes, you’d need to apologize even when you don’t understand why your partner is angry. If your partner is asking for your forgiveness, accept their apologies and move on.

However, if you’re in an emotionally or physically abusive relationship, don’t wait for the person to change. Leave before you get too involved; there’s always someone better out there for you. 

5. Be proud of your partner and celebrate them: 

Avoid being a competitive or overly jealous partner. You should be willing to celebrate even the little accomplishments in your partner’s life. 

Make sure you show them that whatever they’ve achieved is also your gain and you’re excited about it. You don’t need an expensive party to celebrate, you could order a pizza or drink some glasses of wine while enjoying the moment.

Conclusion

Don’t be fooled by social media comments. In fact, one study from the University of St. Mary (4) says that couples who frequently use social media significantly increase their risk of conflict and cheating. So, you’d be happier and more satisfied in your relationship if you focus on the present instead of creating the perfect social media feed or comparing yourself with others.

It is more important that you’re there for each other; sharing your memories together and giving yourselves mutual support.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 29, 2021"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/worst-foods-for-diabetics/,10 Worst Food for Diabetics: Top Foods to Avoid,"Do you know the foods that cause wild blood sugar swings, store fat around your belly, and disrupt how your body uses insulin? You know you need to avoid sweets, but you might not realize how much sugar and processed chemicals you’re putting into your body, and causing these issues. In today’s video, we look at the top 10 worst foods for diabetics, that are loaded with hidden sugars and artificial ingredients, that should be avoided.

Number 10 Worst Food for Diabetics: Sweetened Coffee and Creamers.

The Harvard School of Public Health released a study that found coffee drinkers have a significantly lowered risk of type 2 diabetes. Great news, right? There was one catch: coffee is super healthy, as long as it’s not loaded with sugar.

Avoid high-calorie lattes, coffee milkshakes, caramel drizzled macchiatos, as well as non-dairy creamers, as these are loaded with artificial sweeteners or corn syrup that are worse than sugar. Instead, drink regular black coffee or tea to boost your metabolism.

Number 9. Processed Meats.

Processed lunch meats are not a good source of protein. Full of fillers, flavoring agents, sodium, preservatives, and toxic chemicals, it’s hard to label them as food at all. Deli meats are also full of hidden salt and sugar, either for flavoring or for longer preservation. Plus, some of these meats are also high in cancerous preservatives like nitrates. Many studies have found that regularly consuming processed meats, increases the risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes by 20 to 50%.

Stick to organic meats, seafood, and vegetable proteins that require preparation. If you are in a rush, choose healthy protein like grass-fed jerky, hard boiled eggs, almonds, pistachios and cheese.

Number 8. Frozen Meals.


Flash-frozen fruits and vegetables definitely have benefits when done right. It allows you to enjoy the full nutritional benefits year-round, without worrying about expiration dates or preservatives. Frozen meals, however, are a completely different story.

Microwaving food doesn’t exactly do much to keep food appetizing. To make up for it, manufacturers have to add some pretty unnatural ingredients. The average frozen dinner contains more sodium, fat, and preservatives than one person should consume in a day. Anything with a sauce – even gravy – is bound to be full of glucose-raising carbs.

Number 7. Sugar Sweetened Beverages.

There are few food or drink items that contain as much sugar in as small of a package as soda. It’s basically liquid sugar with an average of around 39 grams in a single 12 oz can. Studies show that drinking two of these sugar bombs a day, doubles your risk of diabetes. Thinking of switching to “diet”? The same study found that drinking diet soda didn’t make a difference in risk levels.

Like soda, sports drinks and flavored water with “vitamins” contain artificial sweeteners, colors and preservatives, that lower insulin sensitivity, cause weight gain, and give you sugar cravings! Try making lemon and mint water at home, or switch to green tea!

What about fruit juice? It’s actually almost as bad as soda. Juicing removes the fiber, and your body absorbs the sugar immediately. Commercial fruit juices take it one step further, and actually ADD sugar to make the juice sweeter! While regular consumption of fruit juice increases your risk of type 2 diabetes, eating whole fruit actually lowers it.

Another sugar culprit is low-fat milk. Most people don’t realize that manufacturers pump sugar into milk to make it taste better. Your best option is grass-fed milk or A2 milk.

Number 6. Fried Foods.

Fried foods are bad for you even if you don’t have diabetes. They’re really bad for you if you do. Studies show that trans fats – like the oils used for frying – may actually promote insulin resistance. Regular consumption of trans fatty foods is linked with cardiovascular disease, which also puts you at higher risk for metabolic syndrome and diabetes.

Trans fats are a restaurant favorite, due to their low cost and ease of use. You may want to ask your waiter what oil the restaurant uses, and opt for healthier menu options. For a list of different types of trans fats, companies use in processed foods, see our video, “Top 8 foods Causing Leaky Gut & Leaky Brain”.

Number 5. White Bread and Pasta.

Most white breads and pastas have processed out most of the fiber and nutrients from the grain. This removes the majority of the bread’s nutritional value and increases the glycemic index. Try replacing your refined carbs with “100 percent whole grain” or choose gluten-free, complex carbs like brown rice, buckwheat, millet and quinoa.

Number 4. Packaged Foods and Snacks.

Store-bought packaged foods like salad dressings, flavored yoghurt, or snacks like cookies and pretzel chips, usually have high fructose corn syrup added to make the food last longer. The sugar content is so high that your body will store the extra as fat deposits. Also, avoid canned or boxed soups and barbecue sauce, as these contain high amounts of sodium and sugar to make them shelf-stable. Replace with homemade oven-baked chips, salad dressings, Greek yogurt, soup, and add herbs and spices to your food for flavor.

Number 3. Breakfast Cereal and Granola Bars.

Cereals are the typical American go-to breakfast, which is unfortunate because many are bad for you! If you read the nutrition label on the side of your cereal box, you’ll see that they are basically fortified carb-bombs. What about granola bars? The typical granola bar is essentially cereal without milk – one of the only saving graces of cereal with its protein content. Granola bars may be a great option during physical activities when you need an on-the-go snack with quick energy. If that’s not the case, try to avoid these. Stick to high-protein breakfasts such as cage-free eggs, whole-grain bread, whole fruits and Greek yoghurt.

Number 2. Dried Fruit.

Dehydrating fruits shrinks them considerably, so you end up eating more than you need. It also skyrockets the glycemic index, making even more of an impact on your blood sugar. Consider grapes versus raisins. One cup of grapes contains around 100 calories, 27 grams of carbs, and has a glycemic index of 9. One cup of raisins (dried grapes) contains nearly 500 calories, 131 grams of carbs, and has a glycemic index of 75! Always choose whole fruit over dried, and only eat dried fruit in moderation. Treat it like granola bars: only in a pinch, and preferably during physical activity.

Number 1. Alcohol.

Drinking in moderation is usually safe – if you opt for light beers, sugar-free mixers, or a single glass of red wine. However, be aware of the effect that alcohol may have on your glucose levels and medication. Your body uses glucose stores to process the alcohol, resulting in a blood sugar dip for up to 24 hours. As a diabetic you need to watch out for symptoms of hyperglycemia initially, then hypoglycemia over the next day. Medication can make this worse.

Bottom line. Always drink with a meal, and be careful of having more than one at a time. Discuss medication interactions with your doctor before consuming alcohol, and avoid sugary mixers.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 29, 2021"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/best-way-to-remove-skin-tags-at-home/,How To Safely Remove Skin Tags At Home Using THIS Inexpensive Bathroom Item,"Skin tags are little annoying flaps of skin that look a bit like warts (1). They’re usually either pink or brown and small in size. Skin tags are painless and harmless, but many people find them cosmetically unappealing. (Updated Nov 27, 2021)

Skin Tags vs. Warts

Skin tags are:

Smooth and soft
Knobby, they tend to hang off the skin
Spontaneous – it’s hard to predict if they’ll appear
Not contagious

Warts are:

Rough, with an irregular surface (2)
Flat
Caused by HPV (human papilloma virus)
Contagious, they often spread and appear in clusters
Why Do Skin Tags Appear?

Skin tags are benign tumours (non-cancerous) about the size of a grain of rice.

“The friction created by skin rubbing against skin, a side effect of being overweight, is what causes skin tags in certain people, and explains why skin tags often grow in body folds.” via EverydayHealth

Where Do they Form?

Skin tags usually appear around natural skin folds. This includes near the eyelids, neck, groin, armpits and under the breasts.

Who Gets Skin Tags?

Skin tags are actually as common as they are harmless. Everyone, with little exception, develops one in their lifetime.

People who are overweight and obese, probably because they have more skin folds and creases
Pregnant women – most likely because of the hormones secreted
Individuals with diabetes
People with the human papilloma virus (low-risk HPV 6 and 11)
Illegal steroid use – they interfere with the body and muscles, causing the collagen fibers in the skin to bond, allowing skin tags to be formed. via MedicalNewsToday

But that doesn’t mean that children, teens and young adults can’t get them too!

How To Get Rid Of Skin Tags

Other than being annoying, skin tags can get irritated by jewellery, clothing or shaving.

It’s always best to visit a dermatologist or doctor to get a proper diagnosis before attempting to remove skin tags. They can also freeze or cut off skin tags quite painlessly, especially in tricky spots.

This procedure isn’t typically covered by insurance, so if you want to clear them yourself, keep on reading!

How To Remove Skin Tags Using Thread

Whether you use a regular sewing thread or dental floss, blocking the blood flow to the skin tag will slowly kill it. This a proven method with a high success rate.

Instructions:

clean the tag with alcohol
use a piece of sewing thread or dental floss and tie it tightly around the base of the skin tag
repeat the process for a few days (make sure to readjust the thread as the tag becomes smaller)

The skin tag will eventually shrivel up and fall off by itself.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/insulin-resistance-symptoms/,Top 8 Insulin Resistance Symptoms You NEED to Know,"Diabetes is a dangerous, destructive, and often painful disease. That’s why it’s important to recognize the symptoms of insulin resistance – the root cause of pre-diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and nerve damage, and reverse it! It’s estimated that as many as 1 in 3 people have low insulin sensitivity.

So what is Insulin Resistance? It’s a condition when cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don’t respond well to insulin, and have trouble absorbing glucose from your blood for energy. To make up for it, your pancreas makes more insulin, and over time, your blood sugar levels go up. One obvious sign that you are insulin resistant, is a fasting glucose level over 100 mg/dL.

In today’s video, we look at the top 8 insulin resistance symptoms, and the things you can do to reverse it today! It’s important NOT to take insulin resistance lightly, as this condition increases your chance of developing heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Insulin resistance syndrome is also called Metabolic Syndrome.

As always, this video is educational, and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

Number 8. Brain fog

Studies have found a link between insulin resistance in the brain and neurological disease, such as Alzheimer’s. Insulin plays a critical role in learning and memory. When brain cells are unable to absorb nourishment, their function is reduced, resulting in brain fog and potentially loss of memory and cognition.

Number 7. High cholesterol

If you have a fasting triglyceride level over 150 mg/dL, and a HDL cholesterol level under 40 mg/dL in men, and 50 mg/dL in women, you could be insulin resistant.

There is a link between chronically high LDL cholesterol and diabetes. Insulin resistance is associated with increased LDL, and lowered HDL cholesterol levels. Research has found that low HDL increases the risk of a cardiovascular event – such as heart attack and stroke.

Number 6. Constant Hunger

Leptin is a hormone created in adipose (fat) tissue, that is closely linked with insulin in sensing how much sugar is in the blood. When it reaches a certain level, leptin production increases to tell your brain to stop eating.

Leptin and insulin directly regulate each other. If there’s an imbalance with insulin or cells become resistant to it, leptin production can decrease and you constantly feel hungry.

Growing evidence suggests that a deficiency in leptin or low leptin sensitivity can result in the development of insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism.

To balance insulin and leptin, avoid inflammatory foods, and eat more anti-inflammatory foods. Watch our video, “Top 13 foods that cause inflammation”, by clicking the link above or below.

Number 5. Hypertension

If you have blood pressure readings of 130/80 or higher, you could be insulin resistant.

Insulin resistance has been repeatedly established, as a contributor to high blood pressure. When uptake of insulin is reduced, absorption of salt by the kidneys is affected, resulting in sodium overload and consequently, hypertension.

When cells are resistant to insulin, and insulin production remains at a normal rate, insulin accumulates in the blood. This condition is called hyperinsulinemia. Many studies have associated hyperinsulinemia with hypertension, although the causes may vary.

Some suggest that hypertension due to other causes lead to insulin resistance; others have found the reverse to be true. All studies agree on ONE thing – high blood pressure is an indicator of insulin resistance. When insulin sensitivity increases, the incidence and risk of hypertension decrease.

Number 4. Lethargy and Fatigue

Chronic fatigue is one of the by-products of diabetes because the body isn’t burning energy properly. With pre-diabetes, reactive hypoglycemia or blood sugar crash, can occur after a carbohydrate-rich meal. You get a surge of energy immediately after eating, insulin responds by spiking to manage the food intake, then energy crashes. This can leave you feeling sluggish and sleepy. Eating in this pattern over time, with insulin spikes and crashes, can lead to insulin resistance. Eating corn oil has been specifically shown to lead to lethargy and the development of insulin resistance. Use grass-fed butter, olive, sesame, coconut, and avocado oils instead.

Number 3. Obesity and Belly Fat

The strongest predictor of insulin resistance is obesity; this means a waistline over 40 inches in men, and 35 inches in women. Belly fat plays a part in developing chronic, or long-lasting, inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation can damage the body over time, without any signs or symptoms. Scientists have found that complex interactions in fat tissue draw immune cells to the area, and trigger low-level chronic inflammation. This inflammation can contribute to the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Studies show that losing the weight can reduce insulin resistance, and prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.

Number 2. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), is a disorder in which a woman’s ovaries cannot produce estrogen and progesterone normally. It is characterized by higher than normal male hormone (androgen) levels, cysts in the ovaries, and irregular or skipped periods. Studies have linked PCOS to insulin resistance in almost every case; hyperinsulinemia has been implicated as well.

Number 1. Skin Conditions

Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a condition in which skin darkens and changes texture to a velvety feel. It most often occurs in the armpits, groin, back of the neck, between fingers and toes, and on elbows and knees. AN is associated with insulin resistance and can be either benign or malignant.

Skin tags (clinically called acrochordons) are also a symptom of insulin resistance and can occur concurrently with AN or on their own.

Also, high blood glucose can make the skin dry and itchy due to excessive fluid loss and hormone irregularities.

Next, what can be done to reverse insulin resistance, AND prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes?

First, if you are carrying excess weight, lose the extra pounds.

Cut out added sugars, seed oils, processed foods, soft drinks, and artificial sweeteners. Remove refined carbs like bread, pasta and rice, and go low-carb and whole-grain. Increase Omega-3s, and eat lean animal and-or plant proteins. Add vegetables, fruits and nuts like kale, spinach, beetroot, cucumbers, okra and raw peanuts. For a list of whole foods, see our video “Top 13 foods to reverse insulin resistance”.

You can also get on the keto diet, and do intermittent fasting.

Get regular exercise – walk briskly 15 to 30 minutes a day, or do other cardio, and work out with weights weekly.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/10-warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack-you-shouldnt-ignore/,10 Warning Signs of a Heart Attack You Shouldn’t Ignore,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 600,000 people in the United States die each year from heart disease and related heart conditions.[1] Luckily, there are many warning signs to alert of a heart attack–these are the most common: (Updated Nov 19, 2021)

1. Sweating

Before a heart attack occurs, most people will experience profuse, cold sweating without doing anything physically taxing and for no apparent reason. Skin and clothing are likely to become soaked with sweat and the face could become pale.

2. Fatigue

Sometimes in the weeks prior to a heart attack, a person will feel tired, fatigued, and drained of energy. Slowly, the fatigue becomes exhaustion in the few days before the heart attack strikes.

According to the American Heart Association, the heart will not be able to keep up with supplying blood to the tissues and normal activities like shopping, walking, and climbing stairs can become very difficult and physically taxing. Experiencing unexplained exhaustion is something to take seriously and medical care should be sought at once.

3. Feeling Pressure/Restriction

It is common to feel pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain in the center of the chest when a heart attack is coming on. Although men and women often experience chest pressure before a heart attack, it does not happen for all women.

4. Flu-like Symptoms

It is not at all uncommon for a person to report experiencing flu-like symptoms in the days or weeks before a heart attack. If you are not feeling normal and are experiencing flu-like symptoms that don’t go away in a few days, head to your doctor or emergency room to be evaluated–it can possibly help you avoid heart damage in the event you do have a heart attack.

5. Shortness of Breath

Your heart and lungs are involved in transporting oxygen throughout the body. Becoming short of breath can be a symptom of heart problems or it could be indicative of an oncoming heart attack.

Any time you are short of breath and have any of the other symptoms listed here, it is important to seek immediate medical attention in order to find out the cause.

6. Dizziness/Fainting

With heart failure and other cardiovascular disorders, it is common for someone to experience dizziness because of a reduction in blood flow to the brain.

Fainting or loss of consciousness is a potentially serious condition and medical attention needs to be sought immediately to rule out impending heart attack.

7. Insomnia

Insomnia is associated with an increased risk of heart attack. Difficulty falling asleep, remaining asleep, and having a feeling of non-restorative sleep have all been associated with heart disease. If you are suffering from unexplainable insomnia, it is important to discuss the situation with your physician.

8. Anxiety

Having an onset of stress so severe that it results in an anxiety attack is very common. Some describe these feelings of anxiety as a “looming sense of doom” just before having a heart attack.

9. Chest Pain

One obvious symptom of an oncoming heart attack is chest pain. Chest pains that happen before a heart attack can be mild or severe in intensity.

Most often, chest pains related to a heart attack are experienced in the breastbone region or in the shoulders or upper back. Pain in the chest can feel as if “an elephant is sitting on the chest” but it can also be described as a discomfort or sensation of pressure, fullness, slight squeezing, or heartburn.

10. Pain in Other Parts of the Body

Mild pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, back, stomach, or arms are very common symptoms of a heart attack. According to information from the University of Michigan, another symptom of heart attack is leg pain.[2]

Anyone who is dealing with unexplained pain throughout the body or those who exhibit symptoms relating to a heart attack are urged to seek medical attention to avoid facing serious health complications.

Heart attacks are serious and potentially fatal and for these reasons, it is very important to know the warning signs. When you are prepared and knowledgeable about the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, you can be aware of what is happening and know what to do to save a life–maybe yours.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-sugar-cravings/,Top 9 Ways to Stop Sugar Cravings,"There’s no denying it: desserts are pleasurable to eat. They taste good on the tongue and start a chemical reaction in your body that gives a short little energy and mood boost. As we all know, the crash that follows isn’t anything sweet.

Sugar addiction is a very real condition and it’s causing us health problems galore, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Sugar is more addictive than cocaine and much easier and cheaper to get. So if you’re one of the many who are hooked, here are some useful ways to kick the habit.

9 Lifestyle Changes to Stop Sugar Cravings & Beat Sugar Addiction

Use these tricks to quit sugar and other sweeteners for a full week. You’ll also want to limit your intake of simple carbs and fruits. You’ll feel so much better that it’ll be easy to reduce your daily intake.

1. Hero Herb

Gymnema Sylvestre is an herb in the milkweed family that desensitizes taste buds from the sensation of sweetness. When ingested, it reduces intestines’ ability to absorb sugar, with implications for regulation of diabetes. (1, 2) It can be so effective that in one study, five of twenty-two of the participants were able to stop taking diabetes medication and managed their blood sugar with Gymnema Sylvestre alone. (3)

University Health News recommends the following for taking Gymnema Sylvestre as a supplement:

“…look for an extract that is standardized to contain at least 25 percent gymnemic acid. Some supplement manufacturers produce an extract standardized to 75%. Clinical studies have looked at Gymnema Sylvestre dosage of 200 to 400 mg per day. Gymnema Sylvestre can cause stomach pain, so take it with food or take three to four smaller doses throughout the day. Don’t take a Gymnema dosage if you are pregnant, lactating or allergic to milkweed. Talk to a physician before taking it if you are currently taking anti-diabetic medication as a cumulative blood-sugar lowering effect could be dangerous.” (4)

2. Take Your Sweetness from Life

Sweet cravings are psychological—they are different from hunger, which is a physiological response. A craving for sweet food can be stimulated by stress, anxiety, depression, and/or a poor self-image. (5)

Eating sugar causes your brain to release pleasure chemicals dopamine and opioids. (6) You get a temporary high and feeling of elation after eating sugar. Having too much sugar (simple sugars and refined carbohydrates like bread and pasta), however, causes a cascade of body processes that send your body into overdrive, releasing insulin and taxing your liver.

The body becomes addicted to the high that can eventually affect psychological processes as well, forming a vicious circle.

A British psychiatric researcher found a strong correlation between high sugar intake, depression, and schizophrenia:

“…sugar actually suppresses activity of a key growth hormone in the brain called BDNF. This hormone promotes the health and maintenance of neurons in the brain, and it plays a vital role in memory function by triggering the growth of new connections between neurons. BDNF levels are critically low in both depression and schizophrenia, which explains why both syndromes often lead to shrinkage of key brain regions over time (yes, chronic depression actually leads to brain damage). There’s also evidence from animal models that low BDNF can trigger depression.” (7)

If you find yourself regularly craving and succumbing to lots of sweets, focus on your emotional health: do things that you enjoy. Pamper yourself with a hot bubble bath, a few days off, read a book in the park, plant a garden, take a class in something that interests you—engage in anything other than food that makes you feel good. Vigorous exercise does wonders, as dopamine is released and cortisol (a stress hormone) is reduced when you work out.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"November 19, 2021"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/carbs-that-do-not-spike-insulin/,Top 10 Carbs that Do NOT Spike Insulin,"Did you know there’s one type of carb, that does not spike your insulin? Over the years, carbohydrates have gotten a bad reputation. That’s because eating too many carbs can quickly raise your blood sugar levels, which is often followed by an insulin spike.

Insulin is your body’s fat-storing hormone, and excess consumption of carbs can lead to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.

Now, the one type of carbohydrate, that you don’t have to worry about, is the one most people don’t get enough. This “healthy carb” doesn’t affect your blood sugar levels, and it’s also good for your gut health.

In today’s video, we’ll be going over the top 10 carbs you can eat, that do not spike your insulin.

Make sure to watch until the end, to learn about the “finger-looking fruit”, that has almost no carbs, and can help improve your cholesterol profile.

As always, this video is educational, and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

First, carbohydrates are divided into three different types – sugars, starches, and fiber.

Among these three, fiber stands out from the rest, as the only type of carb that doesn’t spike your insulin. That’s because your body cannot break down most fibers.

While the majority of the foods you eat contain a combination of all three types of carbs, some foods more than others, have a higher concentration of fiber, with little to no sugar or starches.

So, if you’re trying to lose weight, and improve your insulin sensitivity, these fiber-rich foods are perfect for the job.

Number 10. Zucchini.

At 3 grams of carbs per cooked cup, zucchini provides a great low-carb alternative to pasta. It can be spiralized or sliced to replace spaghetti, linguini, or lasagna noodles in recipes. Zucchini is also rich in several vitamins, minerals, and contains small amounts of iron, calcium, zinc, and several other B vitamins.

Number 9. Green Beans.

Green beans are full of antioxidants, including vitamin C, flavonols, quercetin, and kaempferol. These antioxidants help fight free radicals in the body, which helps to reduce cell damage, and may help lower your risk of health complications.

Green beans contain a decent amount of vitamin K and calcium. Together, these important nutrients help maintain strong, healthy bones, while also reducing your risk of fractures.

Number 8. Mushrooms.

These contain high amounts of beta-glucan, which is a form of soluble fiber, that’s been found in multiple studies to improve cholesterol levels and heart health. Although more research is needed, oyster and shiitake mushrooms are currently believed to have the most effective beta-glucans.

Number 7. Artichokes.

Eating this low-carb vegetable can help protect your liver from damage and promote new tissue growth. It also increases the production of bile, which helps remove harmful toxins from your liver.

In one study, participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, showed that consuming 600 mg of artichoke extract daily for two months, led to improved liver function.

Another similar study found that taking artichoke extract daily, lowered liver inflammation and reduced fat deposition.

Scientists believe that cynarin and silymarin, which are found in artichokes are partly responsible for these benefits.

Number 6. Asparagus.

This non-starchy vegetable is an excellent source of vitamin B9, also known as folate. Just half a cup of asparagus provides adults with 34% of their daily folate needs. Folate is a vital nutrient that helps build red blood cells and produce DNA for healthy growth and development.

Number 5. Okra.

Sometimes referred to as “lady’s finger,” okra is not only a fruit with little to no carbs but it also contains a thick gel-like substance called mucilage. During digestion, mucilage can bind to cholesterol and help your body get rid of any excess.

Number 4. Celery.

At just 10 calories a stalk, celery is more than just a low-calorie vegetable. It’s also a natural anti-inflammatory. In fact, celery and celery seeds contain approximately 25 anti-inflammatory compounds that can help reduce and prevent inflammation in your body.

Number 3. Lettuce.

In studies, this vegetable has been found to have anti-inflammatory, cholesterol-lowering, and anti-diabetic properties. Depending on what type of lettuce you eat, nutrient composition and bioactive compounds can vary.

For example, romaine lettuce contains as much folate as other rich leafy vegetable sources. Red pigmented lettuce contains higher phenolic compounds than green lettuce. Baby green romaine lettuce contains high amounts of vitamin C.

Number 2. Spinach.

Spinach is rich in zeaxanthin and lutein, which are the carotenoids that can help protect your eyes from damage caused by sunlight.

Additionally, several studies indicate that zeaxanthin and lutein work to prevent macular degeneration and cataracts, which are major causes of blindness.

Number 1. Cruciferous Vegetables.

These low-carb vegetables contain a group of cancer fighting compounds known as glucosinolates.

During food preparation, chewing, and digestion, the glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables turn into biologically active compounds such as indoles, nitriles, thiocyanates, and isothiocyanates.

In studies, indoles and isothiocyanates have been found to inhibit the development of cancer in several organs in rats and mice, including the bladder, breast, colon, liver, lung, and stomach.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms/,Top 13 Vitamin D Deficiency Symptoms You Need To Know,"If you often feel achy, tired, sick and moody, your body may be crying out for vitamin D. In today’s video, we’ll talk about the top 13 vitamin D deficiency symptoms, and how you can get optimal levels of this important nutrient.

Vitamin D’s main role is to help the intestines absorb calcium, but it does a lot more. It ensures healthy cellular function, protects brain cells, supports the immune function, enhances detoxification, aids metabolic processes, and promotes heart health.

Since 2008, Vitamin D deficiency has been recognized as a worldwide pandemic.

So what causes low levels of vitamin D?

If you don’t spend enough time in the sun, eat a plant-only diet, have darker skin, have parathyroid disease, suffer from conditions that cause malabsorption including celiac disease and cystic fibrosis, or have liver and kidney disease, you could be deficient in Vitamin D.

In addition, exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in water bottles, plastics, cosmetics, pesticides, polluted air and water, is associated with lower vitamin D levels.

This nutrient deficiency has been linked to respiratory illness, osteoporosis, depression, dementia, diabetes, heart disease, prostate and breast cancer and ED.

Now, let’s get into the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency to watch out for.

Number 13. Tired All The Time. Low levels of vitamin D can make you feel tired and fatigued, even if you get a good night’s rest. Vitamin D keeps your body energized, promotes healing, and is essential for a healthy immune system. Numerous research studies have shown a link between vitamin D deficiency and chronic fatigue. Supplementation with vitamin D3 helped to improve energy levels. To see our recommended high-absorption, plant-based vitamin D3 plus K2 supplement, see the link below.

Number 12. Prone To Infections. Vitamin D is critical for immune function. A deficiency in vitamin D can lead to an increased risk of developing colds, the flu, and other bacterial infections. Low levels also increase the likelihood of catching frequent infections.

Number 11. Muscle Pain. Muscle aches and weakness can be caused by a deficiency in vitamin D. A study that looked at people suffering from chronic pain in the muscles found that 71% of them were deficient in this nutrient. Numerous other studies have shown that vitamin D3 supplements can reduce chronic pain for those who suffer from this deficiency.

Number 10. Joint Pain and Bone Loss. Calcium, along with phosphorus and magnesium, are essential for the building and maintenance of strong bones, and vitamin D is needed in this process. Research shows that insufficient vitamin D can lead to pain in the spine, legs, joints, and ribs. Women, in particular, are susceptible to osteoporosis, in which the bones become brittle and fragile from loss of tissue, due to low vitamin D leading to low calcium stores. When vitamin D levels are too low, calcium absorption in the intestines is reduced, causing calcium levels in the blood to decrease. As a result, the parathyroid glands become more active, producing more parathyroid hormone (PTH), which causes calcium to leave the bones and weaken them.

Number 9. Being Overweight or Obese. Low levels of vitamin D are associated with people who are overweight or obese. Vitamin D is absorbed by fat cells rather than used by your body to do its job. Studies have found that losing excess weight increases vitamin D levels, presumably by releasing vitamin D in fat tissues into the blood.

Number 8. Increased Insulin Resistance. Vitamin D is essential for insulin production and can be used to increase the body’s insulin sensitivity. Recent research has shown a correlation between higher vitamin D intake and insulin sensitivity. A lack of vitamin D may cause diabetes symptoms to worsen.

Number 7. Feeling Depressed. Doctors discovered that depression is often linked to low levels of vitamin D, especially among older adults. A study found that 65 percent of people with depression also had low levels of vitamin D.

Number 6. Impaired Memory. A lack of vitamin D could be causing you to forget things all the time. Low levels of vitamin D are a risk factor in cognitive decline and dementia, particularly among older adults. People with dementia have significantly lower levels of vitamin D.

Number 5. Slow Wound Healing. If you’re struggling with a wound that won’t heal, or are experiencing pain after surgery and aren’t sure why – then maybe the issue lies in vitamin D levels! This nutrient is crucial for rebuilding new skin, so having too little can result in wounds healing slower than they should.

Number 4. Gastrointestinal Issues. Vitamin D is absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract. Low levels of vitamin D can lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which in turn increases the risk of developing colon cancer. Clostridium difficile infection is more common in people with IBD, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Vitamin D supplementation can help reduce this risk, according to studies, as it helps in reducing inflammation throughout your body.

Number 3. Thinning Hair. One possible reason for hair thinning is a deficiency in vitamin D. People with alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that can cause hair loss, seem to be at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D stimulates the hair follicles to grow, which maintains thickness, and prevents your hair from falling out too soon!

Number 2. Poor Cardiovascular Health. Although it isn’t clear why, low levels of vitamin D are linked to cardiovascular disease. Seniors and people with darker skin are more at risk for vitamin D deficiency and increased cardiovascular disease risk.

Number 1. Erectile Dysfunction. Low levels of vitamin D is linked to cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and erectile dysfunction. Increased inflammation affects blood circulation, which contributes to erection difficulties. Vitamin D’s ability to reduce inflammation in the body is helpful for mitigating these problems.

Next, what are the best sources of Vitamin D?

Sun exposure is the best source of vitamin D. When your body is exposed to sunlight (specifically ultraviolet B rays), the cholesterol in your skin cells start to produce vitamin D3. But your body can’t use this form of vitamin until it is further processed by your liver and kidneys.

There are two main forms of Vitamin D, D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3(cholecalciferol), which we get from food and supplements. Researchers have found vitamin D3 appears to more effectively raise your levels of active vitamin D than vitamin D2.

Foods that are rich in Vitamin D3 are animal sources, and include cod liver oil, salmon, trout, herring, sardines, milk, beef liver, egg yolks, cheese and canned tuna. The only plant source of vitamin D, is mushrooms exposed to sun UV rays, such as Oyster, Shiitake and Reishi mushrooms. Research from 2013 has shown that sunlight-exposed mushrooms produce vitamin D2, D3 and D4. Fortified foods like soy, almond, and rice milk, orange juice and cereals may contain vitamin D, but the quantities are typically small, and is in a less bioavailable form.

So, what is the recommended intake of vitamin D?

In general, 1,000 to 2,000 IU should be enough to meet the needs of most people completely, with doses between 2,000 and 10,000 IU not necessarily providing more overall benefit, but not being harmful either. When it comes to calcium metabolism, vitamin D3 and K2 work in synergy; D3 gets calcium into your blood, and K2 sends it to the bones! If there is no K2 to activate the proteins that send calcium to the bones, some calcium may settle in soft tissues, and lead to calcification.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-clear-your-sinuses-with-your-tongue-and-your-thumb-in-20-seconds/,How to Clear Your Sinuses With Your Tongue And Your Thumb in 20 Seconds,"Congestion is caused by the inflammation of the lining of your sinus cavities. This inflammation can be painful and uncomfortable, but it’s quite common. It can be caused by a cold, the flu, seasonal allergies or harmful bacteria. (Updated October 28, 2021)

Lisa DeStefano, an assistant professor at the Michigan State University college of osteopathic medicine, came up with a simple, non-invasive way of clearing your sinuses (1). If you’re feeling uncomfortable congestion, just try this simple trick:

How To Clear your Sinuses
Thrust your tongue against the top of your mouth.
Place a finger between your eyebrows and apply pressure.
Hold it for about 20 seconds.
Your sinuses should start to drain.
How Does This Trick Work?

Your sinuses are hollow cavities in your skull. These are connected to each other and are lined with mucosa tissue and mucus. These bones are relatively flexible, so a simple massage can help clear up any fluid that might have accumulated within them.

Pushing between your eyebrows curves the frontal bone. It also affects the ethmoid, which is behind it.

Pressing your tongue rhythmically against your hard palate affects the maxilla and the vomer bone. This bone connects nasal passages to the mouth. Thrusting makes it rock back and forth. This movement causes other bones to swell outward, which in turn moves fluid out of the sinuses and into the nose and throat.

This remedy works for people with strong bone plasticity. If your mucous membranes are too inflamed, your sinuses might not drain easily. For more relief, try these home remedies.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/top-7-alzheimers-myths-debunked/,Top 7 Alzheimer’s Myths Debunked,"Currently, approximately 5.1 million in the United States have Alzheimer’s disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. It’s a disease that progressively robs people of their memories, behavioral abilities and cognitive functions. (Updated Pct 28, 2021)

In older people, Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia [1], but unfortunately, there is no cure. Of course, the medical community is working towards a cure and, as they do, they continue to debunk longstanding myths surrounding this deadly disease.

Here is the truth behind the top 7 myths connected to Alzheimer’s disease.

1. Alzheimer’s Isn’t Fatal.

See also: preventing Alzheimer’s

Unfortunately, this myth is not true. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, no one survives Alzheimer’s disease. Aside from significant memory loss, the destruction of brain cells brought on by the disease also causes loss of bodily functions, including a person’s ability to talk, walk, connect with other people, think, and eat [2].

2. Your Relatives Have it, So Will You.

Genes do play a role in our chances of developing the disease, but only a small number of cases – about five to seven per cent – are an inherited form of the disease known as Familial Alzheimer’s disease (often referred to as “early onset”). If you have a parent or sibling who has Alzheimer’s disease, you have a three times greater risk than someone who doesn’t. New research suggests that certain genes (such as the apolipoprotein E gene [3] ) can influence the development of the disease but experts note genes themselves don’t cause the disease, and people who don’t have the genes can still develop Alzheimer’s disease while people who do can remain disease-free.

3. Alzheimer’s Disease is Exclusive to Older People.

One out of every eight persons who is over the age of 65 has Alzheimer’s disease, but the disease is not exclusive to older people. Though it’s limited to only about 5% of diagnosed cases, people in their 30’s and 40’s can develop early-onset Alzheimer’s [4].

4. Alzheimer’s Disease is the Same as Dementia.

Alzheimer’s disease accounts for between 60% and 80% of all cases of dementia [5], but it is not the same thing. Dementia is a term that covers an array of diseases and syndromes, including Huntington’s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

5. Memory Loss is Normal.

As people age, it’s normal to occasionally forget something, such as the name of a new neighbor or the title of a movie you recently watched. However, the National Institute on Aging [6] cautions that intermittent forgetfulness is not the same as the serious memory loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease. If memory loss has become an issue, consider the other warning signs associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and address your concerns with your doctor.

6. Alzheimer’s Disease is Caused by Depression.

Depression directly impacts about 6.5 million people in the United States who are aged 65 and over. It is a symptom of Alzheimer’s disease, and, in fact, it is very common during the beginning and middle stages of the disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. A recent study [7] suggests that late-life depression may be a contributing factor in the development of Alzheimer’s, but depression has not been proven to be a direct cause of the disease.

7. Alzheimer’s Disease Isn’t Preventable.

This simply isn’t true. Experts report more and more evidence showing how lifestyle strategies can help reduce the risk or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s, such as:

Eating a healthy diet including fresh fruits and vegetables, fish[8] and nuts.
Challenging your brain with puzzles, hobbies and learning.
Keeping your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels in check.
Avoiding brain injuries.
Staying active socially.
Exercising regularly.
Avoiding vices like smoking, drugs and alcohol.

These strategies are also beneficial for cardiovascular health, which may play a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/improve-blood-flow-to-your-feet/,Top 8 Ways to Improve Blood Flow to Your Feet,"If you experience any of these symptoms of poor circulation in the feet and legs:…Cold, aching feet…Swollen ankles and calves…Throbbing, numbness, and tingling…Sores, blisters, and ulcers…Spider and varicose veins…Slow-healing cuts and wounds…It’s time you pay attention, as this means blood is pooling in your legs and feet, and becoming stale and oxygen-starved…instead of flowing back to your heart to be recycled, and returning as fresh, oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to your lower limbs. Without a constant supply of life-sustaining nutrients, the nerves in your feet can gradually become damaged, and atrophy.

Discover our recommended compression socks to keep your legs fresh and energized all day.

In today’s video, we’ll look at 9 ways to improve blood flow to your feet, and the causes of poor blood circulation. Make sure you watch till the end, cause we’ll explain how one unique food extract has been found to specifically help improve blood flow in your legs.

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

Number 8. Walking.

Walking is the best way to quickly improve circulation. That’s because every step you take, helps activate the muscles in your legs, which helps increase blood flow. As your muscles contract and relax, they squeeze around the large veins in your legs, promoting healthy circulation in your lower body. Going for short walks of just 5 minutes a day can help make a difference. Many studies have found that even small increases in the amount of time you walk daily, can have long-lasting benefits; these include improving overall balance, lowering blood pressure, promoting weight loss, and lifting your mood.

Number 7. Wear Compression Socks.

If you work at a job where you need to be either seated or standing for the entire day, compression stockings can help to improve your blood flow, as well as reduce swelling and pain. The basic concept behind compression socks is called ‘graduated compression’. This technique works by concentrating the highest amount of compression at the ankle, then gradually reducing it higher up the leg. This helps to gently push old and stagnant blood, “up and out” of the feet and legs. It’s a little like squeezing the bottom of a toothpaste tube! Doctors typically recommend compression socks for preventing deadly blood clots on long-haul flights. Plus, according to studies, the right compression socks can improve endurance, enhance athletic performance, and speed recovery time – which is why athletes wear them.

Discover our recommended compression socks to keep your legs fresh and energized all day.

Number 6. Stop Smoking.

If you want better overall blood flow, then you definitely shouldn’t be smoking. Cigarettes contain high amounts of nicotine. This chemical compound causes your blood vessels to constrict or narrow, and reduces blood flow to your limbs. This happens because over time, the constant constriction makes your blood vessels stiffer and less elastic. In addition, smoking has also been found to cause plaque build-up in your arteries, which can lead to peripheral artery disease (PAD). This may cause symptoms, such as claudication, which means there is pain in your thigh, calf, or buttocks when you walk.

Number 5. Eat More Nitrate-rich Vegetables.

Besides reducing your intake of highly processed foods to prevent high blood pressure, plaque formation, and diabetes, adding more nitrate-rich foods to your diet can help your body improve blood flow. That’s because nitrates are converted into nitric oxide in the body, which improves blood flow by relaxing blood vessels. Some foods that are naturally high in nitrates include dark leafy greens, beets, cauliflower, carrots, broccoli, citrus fruits, watermelon, and pomegranates. See our video, “Top 11 Foods to Strengthen Blood Flow“.

Number 4. Try Horse Chestnut Extract.

Extract from the horse chestnut seed contains a natural compound called aescin, which has been found to improve vein health and reduce inflammation. Many studies have found that taking daily doses of 50 milligrams of aescin for up to 8 weeks can help reduce symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which is a health condition characterized by poor blood flow to the veins of the legs. Another study published in 2015 found that horse chestnut was as effective as wearing compression stockings. Always consult your healthcare provider before taking horse chestnut extract, especially if you have a medical condition or are currently taking medications.

Number 3. Manage Your Blood Pressure Levels.

Having high blood pressure can create microtears in your artery walls, which increases your risk of plaque buildup. This cholesterol blockage can occur in your lower extremities and reduce blood flow. Exercising, cutting back on sodium, and reducing stress levels are three things you can do to help lower your blood pressure, and improve your circulation at the same time. Also, see our video, “Top 12 Potassium-Rich Foods That Reduce Blood Pressure“.

Number 2. Cut Back on Sugar.

Eating too many sweets or refined carbs, can cause your blood sugar levels to damage the lining of your small blood vessels. When this happens, the elasticity of your blood vessels decreases and this causes them to narrow, impeding blood flow. 

Number 1. Focus on Feet Exercises.

There are plenty of exercises you can do lying down, or while sitting to keep your blood flowing. Some examples that you can do while lying down include ankle pumping, which involves flexing your foot in the direction of your head. Another popular one that you can do while standing or seated are heel and toe raises. To do this, simply raise both heels until you’re on your toes and hold for 3 seconds before lowering back to starting position. Lastly, you can do ankle rotations pretty much anywhere you want. Simply rotate the ankle clockwise and then counterclockwise.

Lastly, let’s summarize the causes of poor blood circulation in your legs and feet.

A common cause is living a sedentary lifestyle with too many hours spent sitting down, whether at a desk or traveling in a car, train or plane. According to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sitting for 8 hours a day can actually cancel out the benefits of regular exercise. Another study from Indiana University showed that after only one hour of sitting, healthy blood flow can be reduced by up to 50%. Other causes of poor blood flow are Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), diabetes, being overweight, smoking, and blood clots.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/causes-of-vitamin-b12-deficiency/,Top 8 Causes of Vitamin B12 Deficiency,"Today, we’ll look at the top causes of vitamin B12 deficiency (or cobalamin deficiency) – other than not eating enough Vitamin B12 rich foods or being vegan. Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient that enables critical cellular functions, including the production of DNA. It’s also needed for myelin – which covers and protects nerves – as well as red blood cell formation! It’s no wonder then, that low levels of vitamin B12 can cause debilitating and dangerous side effects, including muscle fatigue, anemia, and neurologic conditions like numbness and tingling in hands or feet, anxiety, irritability, dementia and even hallucinations.

Before we get into the causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, you should know that the absorption of this nutrient is limited. When we eat food sources of vitamin B12 (example milk, cheese, eggs, and meats), the vitamin B12 must first be released from the proteins in the ingested food by the activity of hydrochloric acid, or stomach acid, and the digestive enzyme, pepsin. The “freed” vitamin B12 is combined with Intrinsic factor, a carrier protein produced by the parietal cells in the stomach lining, that transports B12 to the last part of the small intestine where it is absorbed.

In a healthy body, the absorption of vitamin B12 is 50 to 60 percent, because the capacity of intrinsic factor is limited. When oral doses of B12 exceed one or two micrograms at a time, the body’s ability to absorb B12 decreases. Therefore, to maintain optimal B12 levels, it is recommended to obtain multiple small doses through food, or one larger supplemental dose to account for limited absorption.

Next, let’s look at the sneaky culprits stealing your vitamin B12.
#8. Low Stomach Acid.

Since B12 absorption occurs in the stomach and requires stomach acid, if you don’t have enough hydrochloric acid, you can’t absorb enough B12, and this can lead to deficiency. Often, low stomach acid is marked by indigestion, gas, bloating, heartburn, and acid reflux. The normal pH level of hydrochloric acid in the stomach should be between 1 to 3. If you have low stomach acid, also called hypochlorhydria, the pH is usually between 3 to 5.

One common cause of low stomach acid is the use of antacids and proton pump inhibitors for indigestion, heartburn and acid reflux, based on the belief that the stomach is secreting too much acid. In reality, many acid-related issues are caused by low stomach acid. Other reasons that cause low stomach acid are chronic stress, aging, and consumption of processed foods and refined sugars. To boost your stomach acid level and reduce symptoms, try taking one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar mixed in very little water before a meal. Make sure you watch till Number 1, as this cause of vitamin B12 deficiency will come as a real surprise.

#7. Lack of Intrinsic Factor.

As we age, our bodies tend to produce less intrinsic factor, and in some cases, even produce antibodies that destroy the parietal cells, resulting in low levels of Vitamin B12. A serious form of Vitamin B12 deficiency affecting 2% of people over 60, is pernicious anemia — a condition that can cause a very low red blood cell count, weakness, and fatigue. However, up to 50 percent of anemia from B12 deficiency in adults is caused by pernicious anemia.

One cause of pernicious anemia is atrophic gastritis. This condition happens when a person’s stomach lining becomes inflamed over an extended period, and the body mistakenly attacks healthy cells including intrinsic factor – which leads to a loss or lack in key nutrients such as iron, vitamin B12 and folate. In rare cases, some people have inherited pernicious anemia; they are born without the ability to make enough intrinsic factor. Fortunately, pernicious anemia responds well to treatment with high-dose vitamin B12, through oral supplements or injections.

#6. Gastrointestinal Issues.

Disturbances in the digestive tract like colitis, Crohn’s disease, inflammatory bowel disease, leaky gut syndrome, and celiac disease can impair absorption of nutrients and decrease your B12 levels. Watch our video, “Top 8 Foods Causing Leaky Gut and Leaky Brain“.

#5. Gastric Bypass Surgery.

A gastric bypass is a weight loss surgery to make the stomach smaller and change the connection between the stomach and the intestines. Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in 40 to 70% of patients after a gastric bypass. This is because the stomach is 80 to 90% smaller after bypass and produce a lot less stomach acid. Additionally, the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum is bypassed; this is where “vitamin B12” combines with intrinsic factor. As a result, very little B12 make it down the small intestine to the ileum to be absorbed.

#4. Metformin Usage.

Long-term usage of Metformin can cause vitamin B12 deficiency, according to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. Metformin was developed to treat Type 2 diabetes, but is also used for women suffering from PCOS, and as a weight loss aid. Interestingly, other studies have linked B12 deficiency to insulin resistance, which can lead to high blood sugar levels, Type 2 diabetes, and weight problems.

#3. Too Much Alcohol.

When you drink too much alcohol, your body uses up a lot of nutrients including B vitamins to process it, which can cause B12 deficiency unless you’re getting a lot of B12 through food and supplements. Other than causing damage to your liver over time, alcohol overconsumption also causes inflammation in your stomach lining, which lowers stomach acid production. The solution is to simply stick to 1 to 2 drinks a day.

#2. Taking Birth Control.

Taking the pill may come with the inconvenient side effect of depleting your body’s B vitamin stores — especially folate, riboflavin, vitamin B6, and B12. Research has shown that birth control pills with higher estrogen levels are more likely to cause vitamin B12 deficiency, although actual deficiency seems to be uncommon. Still, women taking birth control should also take a good quality B complex supplement with plenty of B12.

#1. Intestinal Parasites.

Intestinal parasites like tapeworms or giardia “hijack” the incoming vitamin B12 inside the small intestine for their own nutrition, and thus prevent B12 from reaching your bloodstream. One way a person can get infected by tapeworms is eating under-cooked or raw fish. If you develop gastrointestinal issues like stomach pain, diarrhea, sudden weight loss, excess bloat or gas that cannot be explained, it’s time to see your doctor.

Fortunately, vitamin B12 deficiency is an easy condition to prevent and treat.

To boost vitamin B12 levels, choose a high-absorption, naturally-occurring methylcobalamin supplement like the one recommended below, or eat more B12 rich foods. For omnivorous people, the order of B12 content per serving, from highest to lowest, is: mussels, clams, fish (tuna, trout and salmon are highest), beef, milk, yogurt, cheese, eggs, and chicken. Plant-sourced foods fortified with vitamin B12 are nondairy milks (such as soy, almond, and oat milk), breakfast cereals with no sugar and high fiber, and nutritional yeast.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-causing-leaky-gut/,Top 8 Foods Causing Leaky Gut (and Leaky Brain),"Did you know that a diet high in processed foods can tear open your gut lining and allow “inflammatory invaders” to enter your bloodstream? This condition, known as “leaky gut” or increased intestinal permeability, leads to inflammation spreading through your body. When inflammation reaches the brain, it can cause “leaky brain”. If a leaky gut isn’t healed, it leads to a continuous, inflammatory gut-brain cycle and a host of problems body-wide.

Scroll to the end for studies.

All of these will be explained in this video. Specifically, we’ll talk about the top 8 foods causing leaky gut you’ll want to avoid to protect your gut lining. Make sure you watch till the end, cause some of these are hidden food additives. We’ll also reveal 2 steps you can take right now to repair leaky gut and support healthy gut function. So if you’re ready, let’s get into it. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

First, let’s understand how leaky gut happens.

The inside of your gut (small and large intestines) is lined with a single layer of epithelial cells that separate the gut contents from the bloodstream (gut lining). This layer of cells act as a protective barrier, and is held together by tight junctions. Microscopic gaps allow nutrients into the bloodstream, while keeping out harmful compounds. One protein that regulates the permeability of tight junctions is called zonulin.

Our gut microbiota is full of billions of good bacteria (probiotics) that play a key role in supporting the gut barrier and ensuring the junctions are tight and healthy. Unfortunately, environmental factors like stress, medications, food additives, and chemicals disrupt the healthy balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. This bacteria imbalance causes gut inflammation and breaks open the tight junctions. More zonulin is released and intestinal permeability increases. Now the gaps are bigger and “leaky”, and foreign intruders (undigested food, bacteria, viruses, and toxins) can seep through the intestinal barrier.

Your immune system detects these foreign intruders and sounds an alarm throughout your body and up the vagus nerve into your brain. This alarm leads to inflammation, and triggers your immune system to attack these pathogens. Many studies have associated increased intestinal permeability to symptoms like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic fatigue, joint pain, allergies, acne, and obesity, and autoimmune diseases, like Celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and Ulcerative Colitis.

So, how does leaky gut lead to leaky brain?

Like your gut, your brain has a protective blood-brain barrier. When inflammation reaches your brain, it can break this barrier and leak toxins into your brain. An inflamed brain leads to a slew of cognitive issues, including depression, anxiety, and brain fog. The inflammatory signals travel from your brain back down to your gut, and kick off a new round of inflammation. This bi-directional “expressway” between your belly and your brain is called the gut-brain connection; it is a major pathway by which leaky gut negatively affects your brain.

Next, the inflammatory foods that destroy the gut lining and cause leaky gut.
Number 8. Gluten-containing grains.

Gluten, or more specifically its two components gliadin and glutenin, have both been found to promote the release of zonulin regardless if a person has the gene for celiac disease or not.

Zonulin is a protein produced in the gut barrier. As mentioned earlier, when more zonulin is released, intestinal permeability increases. The two most important triggers for zonulin release are bacteria and gluten – whether or not a person has autoimmune disease.

A study published in the Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology in 2006 concluded that gluten increases intestinal permeability in all persons, but more so in celiac patients. Common grains that contain gluten include wheat, rye, and barley.

Number 7. Hydrogenated oils.

Artificial trans fats are often listed as partially hydrogenated oils on food labels. They are added to processed foods to extend shelf life. In one study, researchers found that margarine, which is made from hydrogenated oil, was responsible for altering gut physiology by increasing intestinal permeability and inflammation. Partially hydrogenated oils are most commonly found in shortening (used in pastry), packaged snacks, frozen meals, fried foods, and coffee creamers.

Number 6. Artificial Sweeteners.

Artificial sweeteners like Aspartame, Saccharin, Sucralose, and Stevia are found almost everywhere. They’re in diet soda, candy, pre-made baked goods, and much more. Studies have shown that artificial sweeteners alter the gut microbiota by encouraging the growth of harmful bacteria and yeast that induce inflammation.

Number 5. Emulsifiers.

Most low-calorie or fat-free salad dressings sold at your grocery store contain emulsifiers. Studies have found that dietary emulsifiers may disrupt the intestinal microbiota to cause inflammation and impair the gut barrier function. Food emulsifiers have names like soy lecithin, guar gum, polysorbate 80, carboxymethyl cellulose, and carrageenan. They are usually found in processed foods like ice cream, deli meats, and whipped toppings.

Number 4. Alcohol.

Overindulging in alcohol is never a good idea. Researchers reported that alcohol consumption induces malfunction of the intestinal walls and increased permeability. People who drink heavily may develop problems with bacterial toxins moving out of the colon and into the body causing an inflammatory immune response.

Number 3. Dairy.

People who are sensitive to dairy cannot digest the proteins found in milk (lactose intolerance). Continued consumption causes intestinal distress and inflammation and can damage the gut lining over time.

Number 2. Microbial transglutaminase.

Microbial transglutaminase, often referred to as “meat glue”, is found in a variety of processed foods and isn’t required by law to be labeled. Imitation crab, chicken nuggets, processed meats and anything with TG or TGP enzyme contain this additive. Transglutaminase has been found to weaken the gut barrier.

Number 1. Nightshades.

For some people, nightshades can cause digestive issues, and even aches and pains, because of the high amounts of lectins. However, high-heat methods of cooking like boiling and stewing, and soaking in water for several hours, can inactivate most lectins. Popular nightshades are potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, and chili peppers.

Bonus. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Popping painkillers or NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen has been found to increase intestinal permeability in the human body within 24 hours of ingestion.

Next, what steps can be taken to heal a leaky gut? There are only two steps:
Step 1. Avoid the things that trigger a leaky gut.

Cut out the inflammatory foods. See Top 13 foods that cause inflammation. Avoid use of antibiotics and NSAIDs.

Manage your stress. Increased cortisol (stress hormone) makes gut junctions larger.

Avoid gut-harming toxins in your air, food, water, personal care and cleaning products, and EMF radiation.

Step 2. Add the things that restore a healthy gut lining.

Manage stress and get enough exercise to help promote healthy gut function.

Eat anti-inflammatory whole foods. Fast for 10 to 16 hours each day to give your gut a break.

Eat anti-bacterial foods like garlic and ginger to help kill harmful bacteria.

To repair the intestinal lining, consume collagen-building foods like bone broth and vitamin C rich foods like citrus fruits and dark leafy greens.

To maintain healthy gut microbiota, consume probiotic foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, yoghurt, and kefir.

Eat pre-biotics (foods with soluble fiber) like asparagus, chicory root, bananas, apples, artichokes, onions, leek and garlic to provide food for probiotic bacteria.

Get enough quality sleep so your body can heal, detox and support healthy gut bacteria.

Consider herbs and supplements that help soothe the digestive tract and rebuild the gut lining. L-Glutamine, Zinc Carnosine, Aloe Vera, Slippery Elm, Turmeric and Magnesium.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/best-foods-to-clean-your-arteries/,Top 10 Best Foods to Clean your Arteries (Smooth Arteries),"Would you like to discover the best foods to clean your arteries for smooth blood flow and a stronger heart Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally, but it’s largely preventable. Today, we present the top 10 foods and supplements that can help decrease your risk factors, that have actual evidence behind their benefits. A major underlying mechanism of CVD – which includes heart attack, stroke and peripheral artery disease – is atherosclerosis or plaque formation in the arteries. The nutrients we’ll mention may help prevent and reduce plaque through various processes.

Scroll to the end for studies mentioned in video.

Make sure you watch till the end, cause most people are not getting enough of one nutrient which prevents your arteries from hardening. Can you guess which is it?

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors. If you take any medication, remember to consult your doctor as some supplements can have interactions.

First, are you taking the three-food combo of nitrate-rich vegetables, cocoa powder or dark chocolate, and garlic we covered in a previous video, “Food Combo to Strengthen Your Heart”?

Eating these three core foods daily helps to increase, maintain, and strengthen the production of Nitric Oxide (NO). High levels of NO in your blood dilates the blood vessels, which improves blood circulation, and lowers blood pressure. To this three-food combo, you can add any of the 10 nutrients we mention in this video.

Number 10. Berberine.

Berberine is a yellow-colored compound, found in plants like Oregon grape, barberries, and goldenseal, that has a protective effect against heart failure and hypertension. This nutrient helps reduce insulin resistance – a common cause of atherosclerosis over time. Chronically elevated blood sugar levels increases blood pressure, which damages the inside of artery walls, and allows cholesterol, fat, calcium, fibrin, and cellular waste to lodge in the arteries forming plaque. If a piece of plaque breaks off, it can form a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart, causing a heart attack.

Berberine is an AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) activator – which means it can help draw glucose and lipids into a cell, which can then be used as energy. Berberine’s blood sugar-lowering effect is similar to the diabetes drug Metformin. One meta-analysis showed that berberine can greatly improve glucose levels (HbA1c), and reduce blood lipids and blood pressure in those with type 2 diabetes.

Number 9. Carnitine.

Carnitine plays a role in cognition, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular health. In one study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, L-carnitine – the biologically active form of carnitine – reduced oxidized LDL cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.

LDL is often called “the bad cholesterol” (as opposed to HDL). LDL oxidation is known to contribute to atherosclerosis, and reducing LDL oxidation reduces atherosclerosis.

People who have had a heart attack can add carnitine to their treatment. This may lower the risk of abnormal heartbeats in the lower chambers (ventricular arrhythmia), as well as pain in the chest or limbs caused by poor blood circulation (angina).

Carnitine is a chemical derived from amino acids, and can be found in almost every cell of the body. However, roughly 75% of carnitine in omnivorous people come from animal-derived products — red meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy.

Number 8. Omega-3 Fatty Acids.

Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, trout, and shellfish are a great source of omega-3s. Fish oil contains the two long-chained fatty acids, EPA and DHA, which can reliably reduce triglyceride levels.

Triglycerides refer to the fatty acids in your blood, which are used for energy or stored as body fat. High triglycerides are often a sign of obesity and metabolic syndrome and increase the risk of CVD.

Even in people with normal triglyceride levels, Omega-3s can reduce inflammation and high blood pressure, and consequently plaque formation and the risk of atherosclerosis.

Number 7. Venotonics.

Venotonics, also called venotropics or phlebotropics, are naturally occurring or synthetic medicinals that improve the rate at which the blood returns to the heart. They are used to treat chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which occurs when leg veins don’t allow blood to flow back up to the heart, resulting in blood pooling in the legs. They are also used to treat leg swelling caused by prolonged sitting or to reduce varicose veins.

Some natural venotonics are horse chestnut, Butcher’s Broom, red vine (grapes, leaves and seeds), and sweet clover. Pycnogenol, the bark extract of the French maritime pine tree, helps support NO levels, and improves blood flow to the legs as well as lower blood pressure.

Number 6. Grape Seed Extract.

Like the flavonoids in cocoa and pine bark, procyanidins, and other flavonoids in grape seeds can help support NO levels. Studies show that grape seed extract can reduce blood pressure and enhance delivery of oxygen to the heart, thereby minimizing the potential risks for heart disease.

Number 5. Vitamin K1 and K2.

Both forms of vitamin K have been linked to good cardiovascular health. According to a recent New Edith Cowan University study, people with a vitamin K-rich diet are at up to 34% lower risk of heart disease, particularly peripheral artery disease.

You may have heard of the term ‘hardening of the arteries’ – this is the same thing as calcification. Calcium deposits in the blood vessel walls as part of the plaque in atherosclerosis. Vitamin K2 is one of the few nutrients, that may be able to reduce arterial calcification and stiffness. It helps move calcium away from the arteries to the bones where it is needed for growth.

You can find vitamin K1 in dark leafy greens, like kale, spinach, broccoli, and collard greens. The best sources of K2 include natto, eel, cheese, beef liver, chicken, butter, sauerkraut and egg yolk.

See our video, “Top 9 Vitamin K2 Foods to Stop Bone Loss and Artery Stiffness”.

Number 4. CoQ10.

Coenzyme Q10 is a molecule produced in the body and aids mitochondria (the “power plants” in our cells) during energy production. This nutrient may become deficient due to suffering a heart attack, taking statins (cholesterol lowering medication), various disease states, and aging.

CoQ10 supplementation can significantly increase HDL cholesterol. It lowers levels of inflammatory biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, shown to be risk factors for CVD. In people who have suffered a heart attack, taking CoQ10 reduces the risk of further heart complications. In addition, CoQ10 has the potential to lower both systolic and diastolic numbers.

Organ meats are especially good sources of CoQ10. Other common food sources of CoQ10 are meats (pork, beef, chicken), fatty fish (sardine, trout, mackerel), legumes (lentils, peanuts), nuts and seeds, and vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and spinach.

Number 3. Resveratrol.

Resveratrol is a plant compound with plenty of health-boosting benefits. Because it acts as an antioxidant, one of its functions is lowering blood pressure. According to a study, higher doses of resveratrol may lower the systolic blood pressure, which is the pressure on the artery walls caused by heartbeats.

Other research in humans show that resveratrol could raise insulin sensitivity and decrease fat stores, blood lipids, and inflammatory markers.

Resveratrol can be found in foods like grapes, wine, blueberries, cranberries, peanuts, and pistachios.

Number 2. Taurine.

You may recognize taurine because it’s a popular ingredient in energy drinks. This amino acid is found abundantly in the body, especially in heart tissues where it helps maintain a regular heart-beat. Under healthy conditions, the body can produce taurine from the amino acids methionine, cysteine and from vitamin B6.

In patients with heart failure, short-term taurine supplementation (2 weeks) yielded improvements in cardiovascular function before and after exercise. Studies have also suggested that taurine may have some beneficial effects on blood pressure in those with hypertension.

Foods high in taurine are shellfish (shrimp, clams, oysters), organ meats (liver, kidneys, heart), eggs, seaweed, Brewer’s yeast, nuts, dairy, salmon, beef jerky, lamb.

Number 1. Lycopene.

Lycopene is a plant nutrient, antioxidant, and pigment that gives some foods their natural reddish color. It is abundant in tomatoes, especially cooked tomatoes. Eating a lycopene-rich diet reduces free radical damage, total and LDL cholesterol levels, and increases HDL cholesterol. This may help lower the risk of developing or prematurely dying from heart disease. In one 10-year study, researchers noted that individuals with metabolic syndrome who had the highest blood lycopene levels, had up to a 39% lower risk of heart disease and stroke.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/causes-of-joint-pain/,Top 9 Causes of Joint Pain,"Did you know that joint pain could be a warning sign of a more serious health problem? Most people immediately think that joint pain is caused by age, overuse, injury, and arthritis. But what if the joint pain isn’t normal? What if there are other weird symptoms that can’t be explained? Today, we’re going to explore the top 9 reasons for joint pain that may not be what you think – ranging from the more common to the rare.

Make sure you watch till the end, because some of these conditions will come as a real surprise! Also, we’ll reveal 7 things you can do right now to keep your joints healthy as you age.

So if you’re ready, let’s get into it. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

Number 9. It could be due to high blood sugar levels.

The ends of your bones are padded with cartilage, it’s what allows your bones to move on each other without being damaged. However, repeated exposure to high blood sugar levels can have a direct impact on cartilage and bone health. That’s because elevated blood sugar levels greatly increase the production of molecules called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These harmful compounds form in your bloodstream when protein or fat combine with sugar.

Fortunately, your body has different mechanisms to get rid of these harmful compounds, including those involving antioxidant and enzymatic activity. However, if you have high blood sugar, your body ends up producing AGEs faster than it can get rid of, which can build up in the body. This accumulation of AGEs can cause inflammation and damage many tissues, including bone and cartilage. The more unmanaged or severe your blood sugar levels are, the more severe the cartilage degeneration. 

Number 8. It could be bursitis.

Bursitis is inflammation of the bursa, a small, fluid-filled sac that works as a cushion and gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body. While bursae can be found in many parts of your body, bursitis occurs most often in the shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.  When a bursa gets inflamed from a traumatic or overuse injury, the swelling can irritate surrounding nerves, causing pain and numbness around your muscles, bones, and joints. 

Number 7. It could be due to an underactive thyroid.

Your thyroid is a small butterfly-shaped gland that’s found in the front of your neck. It plays a vital role in producing the T3 and T4 hormones that are involved in your metabolism, heart and digestive functions, body temperature regulation, muscle control, brain development and function, and the reproduction and growth of bone and cartilage throughout life. An underactive thyroid gland or hypothyroidism can cause excessive protein deposits in tissue. The joints thicken and fluid collects in knee, ankle, foot, and hand joints causing pain and stiffness.

Number 6. It could be rheumatoid arthritis.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that affects more than 1.5 million Americans and about 75% of patients are women. While the disease most often begins between the ages of 30 and 50, it can in reality start at any age. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of the joints (called the synovium), causing inflammation, tenderness, pain and swelling. This disease commonly affects the hands, knees or ankles, and usually the same joint on both sides of the body. But sometimes, RA causes problems in other parts of the body as well, such as the eyes, heart and circulatory system and lungs.

Number 5. It could be infectious arthritis.

The condition occurs when an infection from another part of your body spreads to a joint or the fluid surrounding the joint. This can happen when infection-causing germs enter the body during surgery, or through open wounds or an injection. Most cases of infectious arthritis are caused by a common bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus. But it can also be caused by a virus or a fungus. Symptoms of septic arthritis usually come on rapidly and include intense swelling, pain, fever and chills. Infectious arthritis typically affects the knee, but hips, ankles and wrists are also likely targets. Left untreated, this condition can turn into full-body sepsis, which can be fatal.

Number 4. It could be gout.

Protein is an incredibly important nutrient. It ensures the proper functioning of everything in your body from your immune system to your musculoskeletal system. But eating too much protein can be bad for you. When your body breaks down protein during digestion, it inevitably produces uric acid as a byproduct. Excess uric acid that your kidneys can’t flush out can turn into crystals and accumulate in your joint. Eventually, this can lead to gout, one of the most painful forms of arthritis. Symptoms of gout like heat, swelling, redness, and hard-to-ignore pain commonly appear first in your big toe, before spreading to other joints in your body.

Number 3. It could be lyme disease.

Every year, thousands of people get bitten by a tick carrying a bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Early symptoms of this condition include fatigue, fever, headache, and in many cases, a bullseye-shaped rash. Although very few know about this, Lyme disease can also spread to your joints, especially your knees, if not treated properly. Lyme disease has also been found to cause neck stiffness and sore hands and feet in some individuals.

Number 2. It could be a symptom of lupus.

Lupus is an autoimmune disorder, which can aggressively attack all your joints if left untreated. People with this disorder have an overactive immune system that mistakenly targets your own body’s tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs. Lupus can be difficult to diagnose because so many of its symptoms resemble those of other ailments. The most distinctive sign of lupus is a facial rash that looks like the wings of a butterfly across your cheeks. Along with swollen, painful joints, other common signs and symptoms to look out for include hair loss, shortness of breath, memory loss, headaches, dry eyes and fatigue.

Number 1. It could be Gonorrhea.

Although rare, gonococcal arthritis is a complication that arises from the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea. This condition generally causes painful inflammation in one or multiple joints, along with other STD symptoms.

There you have it! The top 9 reasons for joint pain.

Here are a few tips to keep your joints healthy as you age:

Manage your weight.

Excess weight puts unwanted pressure on your weight-bearing joints like hips and knees.

Control your blood sugar.

Elevated blood sugar levels can stiffen the surrounding tissue that supports your joints and make them more prone to injury.

Stay active.

Just 30 minutes of low-impact exercises like walking, cycling or swimming can help your joints stay limber and strengthen the muscles that support your knees and hips. 

Stretch More.

Gently stretching your body can improve your range of motion and keep your joints healthy.

Avoid injury.

An injured joint is more likely to develop arthritis in old age than one that was never injured. 

Don’t smoke.

Smoking accelerates aging and damages the tissues that protect your joints.

Get enough Omega-3s.

Eating salmon is a one great way to get enough omega-3s, which can help reduce inflammation. To learn more about inflammation, please see our video “Top 13 Foods that Cause Inflammation” and their anti-inflammatory replacements.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/the-gross-truth-when-to-replace-pillow/,The Gross Truth About How Often You Should Replace Your Pillow,"Few things in our homes are as intimate to us as our pillows. An uncomfortable one will ruin your sleep and when you find one that you love you don’t ever want to change. Turns out that’s not such a good idea.  So when is the ideal time to replace your pillow?

Simply Changing your Pillowcase isn’t Enough.

Even with changing your pillowcase and cover, dust, oil, and dead skin cells–because they are so small–will make their way into the pillow itself. These tiny irritants can cause acne and allergic reactions.

We all know that dust permeates everything–there’s no getting rid of it. As soon as you wipe the dust from something, it seems to magically re-appear. Dust is composed of many things: dead skin cells, dirt, fungus, animal dander, and–yes–bug droppings.

Dust Mites can be Found in Every House, No Matter How Clean it is

A relative of the spider, the dust mite is microscopic but rest assured, it is there. It eats the little bits of stuff that it finds in household dust and then contributes to the dust by leaving its feces wherever it hangs out. The little buggers tend to accumulate where it’s dark and warm–like in carpet and the folds of your pillow.

Dust mites won’t bite you or carry an infectious disease but some people are allergic to their droppings. If you find yourself with watery eyes and sneezing when you first get up, it’s a pretty good sign you are one of those people. If you experience irritation and congestion all the time, that, too may be an indication of an allergy.

There are ways to minimize the number of dust mites in your home; unfortunately, replacing your pillow on a regular basis is one of them. Depending on environmental factors, hygiene, and sensitivity, you may want to get a new pillow some time between six months and two years.

Keep Your Pillow Clean and Fluffy

To reduce and manage the resident dust mite population and extend the life of your beloved pillow, you can do the following:

Use an airtight pillow cover or one specially made for allergy sufferers
Running the pillow for 30 minutes in a dryer at low temperature can blow out some of the build-up
Wash your pillow every three to six months
Wash pillow coverings and cases in hot water and change every few days
Do NOT use fabric softener, either in the washer or dryer sheets–they cause all kinds of respiratory ailments[1]
If you’re allergic, opt for a pillow that isn’t filled with down–feathers might contribute to the problem. There are more choices these days than just polyester and foam: latex, gel, buckwheat, cotton, wool, and sand all offer different firmnesses so you can find the right one for you (when you find one you like, buy more than one and store it—wrapped–for later use).

A pillow should fill the space between your head and shoulders when you are lying in your usual sleeping position. It should provide enough support so that your back is in alignment with your head and neck. If you ordinarily sleep on your side, you need a full pillow; sleeping on your back or stomach requires a thinner pillow. Sweet dreams.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/6-common-and-affordable-foods-to-help-manage-diabetes/,6 Common and Affordable Foods That Can Help You Manage Your Blood Sugar Levels,"Diabetes is a group of disorders which affect the blood sugar levels, either through an auto-immune dysfunction where the immune cells attack the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin, thus leading to higher blood sugar levels (type 1); or when the body is not able to correctly use insulin or produce enough of it to deal with the diet (type 2). (Updated Sep 16, 2021)

Type 2 diabetes is by far the most common affecting 90-95% of the diabetics in America [1]. Fortunately there are a number of foods which can be beneficial in the case of type 2 diabetes, helping to lower blood sugar levels and bring about better blood sugar control.

1. Green Tea

One of the best, natural anti-diabetic treatments is green tea. Green tea has long been used in Asia for its medicinal benefits but now scientific tests have also been done to prove the benefit of green tea in diabetes.

In one of these studies researchers looked at both the effect of green tea on diabetic mice as well as its effects in humans and found that green tea helps reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, promotes glucose metabolism and in the diabetic mice it produced an anti-hyperglycemic effect [2].

2. Fenugreek Seeds

Fenugreek seeds have been found to not only be beneficial with type 2 diabetes but also with type 1 diabetes. A scientific study was done by Sharma, RD et al, to determine the effects of fenugreek seeds on the blood glucose levels and serum lipids in type 1 diabetics after it had already been found useful in animals and in type 2 diabetics.

In this test they found that taking fenugreek seeds significantly reduced fasting blood sugar and improved the glucose tolerance test [3].

Their main concern was for the poor population in India who were not able to afford expensive diabetic medicines in order to control their blood sugar levels but could take these seeds.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 16, 2021"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/14308-forgiving-others-is-good-for-your-mental-health/,"Forgiving Others Is Good For Your Mental Health, Says Study","Are you the kind of person who has a tendency to hold on to a grudge? If so, you could be increasing your risk for depression, especially if you’re a woman. A new study has highlighted the ways in which forgiveness can help or hurt our mental health. (Updated Sept 15, 2021)

The study, published in the journal Aging and Mental Health, explains that “feeling unforgiven by others has been linked to poor health outcomes.” Researchers set out to examine whether the feeling of being unforgiven was associated with depression, and also found themselves looking at the role that forgiveness played in the mental health of the study participants(1).

Forgiveness And Gender

The study looked at aging adults in particular – all the study participants were over the age of 67. What the researchers found was that, although forgiveness was associated with lower rates of depression and negative mental health outcomes, there was a significant gender gap; women in particular benefited from forgiving others, even if they felt unforgiven. Men, on the other hand, reported high levels of depression when they felt unforgiven even if they were practising forgiveness themselves.

Researchers hypothesize that this difference may have something to do with social expectations of women, and the role of women in families and communities.

“It’s Not About Being A Better Person”

The researchers on the study were eager to hypothesize about the meaning behind the study’s outcome. One theory, presented by study author Christine Proulx in a recent press release, has to do with the character and personality traits necessary for committing to forgiveness.

“It doesn’t feel good when we perceive that others haven’t forgiven us for something,” Proulx said. “When we think about forgiveness and characteristics of people who are forgiving – altruistic, compassionate, empathetic – these people forgive others and seem to compensate for the fact that others aren’t forgiving them. It sounds like moral superiority, but it’s not about being a better person. It’s ‘I know that this hurts because it’s hurting me’, and those people are more likely to forgive others, which appears to help decrease levels of depression, particularly for women.”(2)

Researchers added that faith may also be a factor – their study participants were predominantly Christian, a religion which often emphasizes forgiveness as a virtue.

This isn’t the first time the health impact of a forgiving attitude has been explored. One recent study found that holding a grudge could actually negatively affect your physical performance(3).

What’s interesting about the recent study, however, is that it focuses not just on self-forgiveness, but rather on the forgiveness we extend to others.

“Self-forgiveness didn’t act as the protector against depression,” Proulx explained. “It’s really about whether individuals can forgive other people.”

https://dailyhealthpost.com/signs-of-zinc-deficiency/,Top 15 Signs of Zinc Deficiency You Need to Know,"Are you insulin resistant, prediabetic, or have Type 2 diabetes? Do you suffer from gut inflammation and digestive disorders such as Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or celiac disease? Are you eating a strict plant-based diet? If you answered Yes to any of these, your body could be deficient in zinc.

In today’s video, we explore the top 15 signs of zinc deficiency based on studies, and the zinc-rich foods you can add to your diet to reverse it.

Make sure you watch this video till the end. Some of the factors that cause poor absorption, increased loss from the body, or increased requirements for zinc may come as a real surprise!

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

First, why is zinc important for the body?

Zinc is an essential trace mineral that helps with many aspects of cellular function. It is a cofactor for up to 300 enzymes in the body. Zinc helps in protein and DNA synthesis, gene expression, immune response, wound healing, cell division and skeletal growth.

Next, how can you know if your body is deficient in zinc?

Some signs of zinc deficiency in adults can be attributed to other pathologies; knowing them helps your doctor give a quicker diagnosis, if need be.

15. Gastrointestinal Issues.

Signs of leaky gut, such as diarrhea, Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Celiac disease, and food sensitivities, can result from zinc deficiency. Low levels of this mineral alters your gut microbiota, and leads to the development of gastrointestinal diseases, largely due to its negative effect on epithelial barrier function. The tight junctions in the intestinal lining are broken apart, and toxins, microbes, and undigested food particles escape from the intestines, and enter the bloodstream. When this happens, inflammation spreads quickly through your body. The immune system attacks these “foreign invaders” and its own tissues in self-defense! This condition is known as leaky gut or increased intestinal permeability. According to studies, not only does zinc deficiency cause diarrhea, but chronic diarrhea can cause the deficiency, and promote even more diarrhea.

14. Increased Insulin Resistance.

Lower levels of zinc become more common when people are insulin resistant, prediabetic or have type 2 diabetes. Research shows that this creates a vicious cycle: zinc levels go down, which then leads to further insulin resistance. If you’re wondering whether zinc deficiency or diabetes came first, there is evidence in favor of both. Zinc deficiencies can be an indicator for diabetes, and those with type 2 tend to be zinc deficient. There are two main reasons for this: Those with diabetes often have decreased gastrointestinal absorption of nutrients, and this includes zinc. When blood sugar is consistently high, the frequency of urination increases, and more zinc is excreted. A low absorption rate combined with a high excretion rate means it is hard to retain enough zinc in the body.

13. Weakened Immune System.

Zinc works as a ‘gatekeeper’ for your immune system, and a deficiency has been associated with higher rates of infectious diseases. When a person starts catching colds and viral infections more easily, it may be a sign of zinc deficit. A deficiency in zinc impairs the maturation and function of B and T lymphocyte cells, and decreases the activity of natural killer (NK) cells. A lack of this mineral also inhibits the body’s ability to tame inflammation. A huge proportion of your immune system is in your gastrointestinal tract.

12. Histamine Intolerance.

Zinc inhibits the release of histamine, a compound released by white blood cells in response to an allergen. A deficiency causes more histamine to be released into surrounding tissue fluids, which produces many of the symptoms associated with allergies (swelling, itching, mucus and sneezing and hives). High histamine levels increase a person’s sensitivity to all allergic reactions – a condition called “histamine intolerance”.

11. Slow Wound Healing.

Zinc plays a major role in regulating every phase of the wound healing process, and a deficiency is linked with delayed wound healing.

10. Loss of Taste and Smell.

A deficiency in zinc can cause a loss of taste and smell, especially in older adults. Zinc regulates the enzyme required for smell and taste perception that lives in your saliva and nasal mucus. This enzyme, known as carbonic anhydrase, is responsible for creating new taste bud and olfactory receptors as old ones need to be replaced every two weeks.

9. Hearing Loss and Tinnitus.

When blood levels of zinc are low, the body cannot spare enough zinc to protect against hearing loss and tinnitus. Studies confirm that many tinnitus patients are already deficient in zinc; the lower the zinc levels, the more severe the tinnitus can become.

8. Unexplained Hair Loss.

One sign of zinc deficiency is alopecia – unexplainable hair loss. Zinc plays a key role in creating hair thickness, strength, and regrowth. It helps create proteins and keratin (the building blocks of hair cells), make DNA for hair cell division, and regulates thyroid hormones. If any of these processes don’t work well, hair loss can occur.

7. Skin and Nail Issues.

Zinc deficiency may manifest as acne, eczema, xerosis. (dry, scaling skin), and seborrheic dermatitis. (scaly patches on the scalp and other oily areas). A lack of this mineral has also been associated with white spots and ridges on the nails. (leukonychia).

6. Blurry Vision.

Zinc is highly concentrated in the retina, and plays a vital role in bringing vitamin A from the liver to the retina, in order to produce melanin, a protective pigment in the eyes. A deficiency in zinc can cause blurry vision from night blindness, cataracts and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

5. Low Testosterone.

Zinc is crucial for the production of testosterone. A deficiency has been linked with a dip in testosterone levels. (hypogonadism). Very low levels of zinc also affect sperm production. If you frequently experience low libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, or are losing muscle mass, these may be signs of low testosterone levels. Studies have also found a correlation between prostate cancer and low zinc levels.

4. Harder to Conceive.

Zinc plays an important role in the menstrual cycle, including ovulation. A zinc deficiency can negatively affect egg quality, and make it harder for women to get pregnant. Studies show that women with infertility have lower zinc levels in the follicular fluids than fertile women.

3. Loss of Appetite, Weight Loss.

Zinc is involved in appetite-regulation through the two satiety hormones, ghrelin and leptin. Because low zinc levels result in digestive problems, metabolism is reduced to a great extent. This leads to a loss of appetite followed by unintentional weight loss.

2. Chronic Fatigue, Brain Fog

Zinc deficiency hinders energy production and liver detoxification, resulting in physical fatigue, muscular weakness, and mental fogginess or fatigue. Low levels of zinc can cause increased anxiety and depression.

1. Decreased Bone Density.

Zinc is vital for normal skeletal growth, bone homeostasis, and may promote bone regeneration. Human studies have shown that low serum levels of zinc is associated with osteoporosis.

Next, what are the benefits when you get more zinc in your diet?

The consumption of foods high in zinc and zinc supplements has been shown to:

Tighten “leaky gut” in Crohn’s disease, and enhance epithelial barrier function, even in non-disease states.

Reduce inflammation in the body, including the lining of the digestive tract.

Reduce blood glucose in people who are insulin resistant.

Help increase bone density and support strong bones.

Prevent common cold and lower respiratory tract infections.

Strengthen immune system function and alleviate allergy symptoms.

Help the body produce melatonin and serotonin, and promote better sleep.

Reduce progression of AMD and cataracts.

Support healthy thyroid hormone production and weight management.

Alleviate inflammatory skin issues like acne, rosacea and eczema.

Help with male fertility problems, including erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism.

Promote optimal fertility in women, and reduce menopause symptoms.

Positively improve mood, and boost memory and learning ability.

Protect against noise-induced hearing loss, and improve symptoms of tinnitus.

Next, what are some foods high in zinc? Here are 12 good ones.
Oysters.
Alaskan crab.
Hemp seeds.
Cashews.
Pumpkin seeds.
Grass-fed beef.
Chickpeas.
Lentils.
Black beans.
Chia seeds.
Raw oats.
Greater than 75% dark chocolate.
So, how much zinc should you consume daily?

The RDA of zinc for adults per day is 8 mg for women and 11 mg for men through diet. Pregnant and lactating women need more zinc. Vegetarians and vegans may need to increase daily intake by up to 50%. Older adults and people with diseases that inhibit zinc absorption may need to supplement.

Next, a note about too much supplemental zinc.

When it comes to zinc, more is not merrier. Overloading on zinc causes side effects like nausea, diarrhea and stomach cramps, disrupts the absorption of copper, and may cause the destruction of healthy cells.

Next, you might be wondering: what causes zinc deficiency?

The main reasons for zinc deficiency are low intake, poor absorption and medical conditions, such as diabetes, sickle cell anemia, cancer, chronic diarrhea, Crohn’s disease, liver and kidney disease. Certain medications like diuretics and immunosuppressants may interfere with zinc absorption. A plant-based diet has also been linked to low zinc levels, because our bodies are more efficient in absorbing zinc from animal rather than plant sources. A diet high in phytate-containing grains and legumes, oxalate-rich leafy greens, foods grown in nutrient-deficient soil, and processed foods can all lead to zinc deficiency. The aging process and excessive alcohol consumption are also factors that deplete zinc. Athletes and those who sweat a lot are more likely to be deficient.

Lastly, how is zinc deficiency diagnosed?

A blood plasma test is the most widely used test for zinc deficiency. A urine test and analysis of a hair strand can also measure the zinc content. There is also a zinc taste test, but this is not considered scientific or reliable.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/purslane-weed/,"If You See This “Weed” Growing In Your Yard, Don’t Pick It! Here’s Why…","If you take a step outside your front door, how many plants in your garden are you be able to name? Although your grandparents or even great-grandparents could probably name nearly every inch of their land, this skill has been lost for recent generations. (Updated Sep 10, 2021)

Along with this comes the loss of medicinal plant knowledge. It’s really quite a shame: no matter where you live in the world, you’ll always be surrounded by medicinal plants, even in the concrete jungle. One of these “lost plants” is purslane, a nutritious succulent that’s now regarded as a useless weed.

Why You Should Give it a Try

Purslane can do lot of good for a wide variety of patients. In traditional medicine, the herb is well appreciated by new mothers for its ability to treat mastitis, lack of milk flow, and postpartum bleeding. It also relaxes skeletal muscles and acts as a diuretic. However, nursing mothers should consult a naturopath before taking purslane (1).

It also has the ability to cure:

Headache
Stomachache
Painful urination
Dysentery
Enteritis
Burns
Earache
Insect stings
Skin sores
Ulcers
Pruritus
Eczema
Abscesses treat
Colitis
Acute appendicitis
Diabetes
Dermatitis
Shingles
Arthritis
Fever
Diabetes

Purslane contains a neurohormone called l-norepinephrine that acts as a vasopressor and antihypotensive agent to promptly treats hemorrhages. The herb even has antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory effects (2).

In terms of nutritional value, the herb is said to have more beta-carotene than spinach and carrots, as well as high levels of vitamins B, C and E, magnesium, calcium, potassium, folate, lithium, and protein (3,4,5).

More interestingly, the herb contains omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha linolenic acid. It’s believed to be the best plant source of the nutrient, containing 8.5 mg of omega 3 for every gram of weight. This substance, as well as others found in the plant, keeps blood pressure and cholesterol in check and prevents blood clots.

Another interesting component of the plant is melatonin, an antioxidant that acts as a hormone and is also produced by your pineal gland (6,7). Melatonin regulates your body’s natural sleep and wake cycles to help you get a good night’s sleep. A study conducted by the University of Texas at San Antonio found that purslane contained 10 to 1000 times more melatonin than other edible plants tested (8). The plant is also currently being tested for its ability to fight tumors (9).

Where To Find It

Purslane (Portulaca oleracea) grows in gardens and yards all over the world. They’re easy to spot thanks to their thick, reddish stems and spoon-shaped succulent leaves. It kind of looks like a small jade plant that lays flat on the ground and produces small yellow flowers.

A similar plant, the “hairy-stemmed spurge” (Euphorbia vermiculata), can be mistaken for purslane, but it’s poisonous and should not be consumed. The main difference between the two is that the spurge is hairy and has a milky sap while purslane is smooth and produces clear sap (10).

Purslane is best harvested is late summer and early autumn when its leaves are full and juicy. While it can be harvested year-round in warmer regions, the flavor of your harvest can vary depending on when it’s picked. You can plant purslane in your garden, but it can quickly become invasive (11).

How To Use Purslane

One of the biggest advantages of eating purslane is that it’s non-GMO since it’s not widely regarded as a food and isn’t widely cultivated. However, because it’s a weed, it’s important to thoroughly wash it before eating, since it’s most likely come into contact with pesticides.

The leaves and stems can be eaten raw, dried, steamed, stir-fried, or even pureed, but beware, the herb gets a little slimy when overcooked. Think of the herb as an alternative to spinach or watercress. The flowers make a great addition to salads while the stems are delightful when pickled:  They’re known for having a delicious, slightly sour and salty lemony taste.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/10-surprising-causes-of-fibromyalgia/,10 Most Overlooked Causes of Fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia is a rheumatic condition that causes widespread aching, stiffness and burning pain that spreads to other local areas of the body. The symptoms, though severe, are often so generalized that it can take up to 5 years [1] for a doctor to properly diagnosis the condition. (Updated Sept 9, 2021)

On your next visit, share this list of 10 causes of fibromyalgia with your doctor. It just may help expedite the treatment process. After all, the sooner you’re diagnosed, the sooner you can get the proper treatment you need to alleviate your pain.

1. PTSD

According to research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the development of fibromyalgia has been linked to incidents of post-traumatic stress disorder [2]. If you have suffered from PTSD, or are currently experiencing symptoms, talk to your doctor right away.

2. Autoimmune Diseases

Fibromyalgia is in the family of rheumatoid conditions, but it is not an autoimmune disease, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [3]. However, people with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease, can be more susceptible to developing fibromyalgia.

3. Genetics

Specific genetic mutations can make us more prone to developing fibromyalgia. So, if your family’s medical history includes fibromyalgia, or people with symptoms of the condition, tell your doctor.

4. Infections

Some illnesses can trigger the onset of fibromyalgia. Let your doctor know about any infections or other physical ailments you may have experienced that you have not previously shared with him.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 9, 2021"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/strengthen-your-heart/,3 Food Combo to Strengthen Your Heart,"Would you like to discover a food combination you can take today to protect and strengthen your heart? Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women worldwide – but it is largely preventable. One factor that plays a central role in heart health is blood pressure (BP).

Cardiovascular disease risk is strongly associated with an increase in BP, even when BP is still within normal range. Today, we present a three-food combo that improves blood flow, and helps reduce blood pressure, boost exercise performance, and delay cognitive decline.

Learn how you can consume these three foods daily as part of your healthy routine for a stronger heart! As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

First, here is the three food protocol to boost blood circulation:
Eat nitrate-rich vegetables. Aim for 6.4 to 12.8 mg of nitrates per kilogram of body weight per day (2.9 to 5.8 mg per pound per day), either over several meals or in one sitting a couple of hours before exercise.

Get your cocoa polyphenols, by eating about 30 grams of cocoa powder or 40 grams of dark chocolate with a 75% cocoa content.

Take 3 to 6 cloves of garlic (or 600 to 1,200 mg of an aged garlic extract) over several meals.
So, how do these three foods work together to boost blood flow?

Nitrate-rich vegetables, cocoa, and garlic work synergistically to improve your cardiovascular system. Nitrates increase your blood levels of nitric oxide (NO) which improves blood flow. Cocoa helps maintain those high NO levels. Garlic enhances signaling for more NO production – so you can get your heart pumping strong!

Next, let’s look at each of these foods in detail.
Food Number 1: Nitrates.

Eating nitrate-rich foods is an effective way to increase nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in the body. This is one of the reasons why vegetables are good for you. Nitrates break down into nitrites, which circulate in the body and are turned into NO – a molecule that acts as a natural vasodilator and improves blood flow.

Elevated NO levels are associated with better circulation and lower blood pressure. Eating nitrate-containing vegetables also improves endothelial cell function – the cells that line the inside of your blood vessels. As an added bonus, it reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease – including peripheral artery disease, cancer, and premature death.

Nitrates are abundantly found in beetroot and leafy greens. These vegetables can be consumed whole or in liquid form (juice, smoothie, or purée) over several meals. They can also be drunk in one sitting a couple of hours before exercise.

The nitrate-rich vegetables in descending order of nitrate content are: arugula, turnip greens, dill, collard greens, spinach, Swiss chard, turnips, rhubarb, beetroot, celery, mustard greens, radish, lettuce, watercress, Bok choy, kale, and parsley.

Here are six things you should know about nitrates:
Cooking vegetables reduces nitrates by 50%, but researchers say that is still enough to promote heart health.
Most vegetables rich in nitrates are also rich in oxalate which can increase the risk of kidney stones. The solution is to cook the vegetables; this reduces oxalates more than nitrates. “You can also choose” oxalate-poor vegetables (arugula, asparagus, carrot, radish, sweet potato, watercress, Bok choy, cabbage), or pair with calcium-rich foods to reduce oxalate absorption.
Leafy greens are packed with vitamin K1, which helps with blood clotting, and so might reduce the effectiveness of blood thinners, especially anticoagulants. If you take a blood thinner, consult your doctor before consuming a lot of leafy greens.
If you eat a lot of cruciferous vegetables, make sure to also get enough iodine through iodine-rich foods (such as cod, seaweed, shrimp, milk, yogurt, or cheese), iodine-fortified foods (such as iodized salt), or supplements (75 to 150 mcg per day). This is because cruciferous vegetables contain goitrogen – which disrupt thyroid hormone production by interfering with iodine uptake in the thyroid gland – if regularly consumed in high amounts.
Nitrates in processed meats are not the same as in vegetables, because compounds in meat interact with nitrates during cooking and processing to form potentially pro-carcinogenic elements like nitrosamines.
The bacteria in saliva activates nitrates, so avoid using anti-bacterial mouthwash too often.
Food Number 2: Cocoa.

When nitric oxide is created, it has a half-life of only a few seconds due to its highly reactive nature. This means that NO can only travel limited distances before being oxidized. This is where dark chocolate comes into play. The high concentration of flavonoids like epicatechin in this delicious treat, helps support the high NO levels you’ve achieved by eating nitrate-rich vegetables, and improve blood flow.

Several potential mechanisms are supposed to be responsible for the positive effect of cocoa; among them activation of NO production, increased bioavailability of NO as well as antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.

Food Number 3: Garlic.

Lastly, garlic enhances the signaling of nitric oxide. However, its blood pressure lowering effects are mostly due to another compound: hydrogen sulfide. (H2S). Whether eaten as part of a meal or supplemented, garlic is a potent food that increases hydrogen sulfide signaling in the body — and helps relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure.

To maximize this effect, make sure to first cut or crush the cloves, to activate their bioactive compounds before cooking them or eating them raw. If you dislike the smell or taste of garlic, or if you wish to avoid the strong breath that comes from eating the cloves, you can choose to supplement with 600 to 1,200 mg of an aged garlic extract daily for the same benefits.

In those with high cholesterol (greater than 200 mg per dL, greater than 5.5 mmol/L), the consumption of garlic for two months or more, can moderately reduce total as well as LDL cholesterol, and slightly increase HDL. Because it improves several cardiovascular parameters, garlic makes a good heart-protective food.

What happens when you eat these three foods daily?

Your heart can pump blood more efficiently without putting any strain on your body, because each ingredient in this dietary combo, complements each other to effectively dilate blood vessels and reduce blood pressure. Since these three foods are hypotensive agents – meaning they lower blood pressure – start at the low end of the consumption range and monitor your blood pressure.

The easy way to benefit from these three foods, is simply to make sure you eat them daily. For more on NO, watch our video: Top 11 Foods to Strengthen Blood Flow.

Lastly, what are the complications of high blood pressure?

The blood vessels in the eyes may start to swell or leak.

The blood vessels in the brain may burst under pressure and cause a stroke.

The extra effort of pumping blood can cause the heart muscles to thicken, thus reducing efficiency.

The kidneys may start to regulate salt and water levels poorly.

The blood vessels may stiffen and harden, further contributing to high blood pressure.

To support a healthy blood pressure, incorporate this 3-food combo into your lifestyle today.

If you suffer from symptoms such as brain fog, hair loss, varicose veins, erectile dysfunction, tingling legs, swollen feet, and leg cramps in the night – even though you eat a “healthy diet” – you may already have poor blood circulation and high blood pressure.

Inadequate blood flow results in less oxygen and nutrients being delivered to your cells. This not only causes you to have less energy, but it also weakens your immune system and prevents your cells from functioning optimally.

In general, circulatory issues don’t happen overnight, they are usually accompanied by other health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and clogged arteries. In an upcoming video, we will explore other foods and nutrients you can add to this food combo to address specific health concerns.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/heart-attack-recovery/,Dos and Don’ts: Everything You Need To Know After Suffering a Heart Attack,"If you or someone you know has suffered a heart attack, you know how scary the whole ordeal can be. Recovering properly from a heart attack is crucial to preventing future occurrences. We’ll discuss everything you should know going into recovery and prevention, and hopefully help put your mind at ease as you move forward. (Updated Sept 6, 2021)

What is a Heart Attack?

A heart attack occurs when oxygenated blood nourishing the heart is disrupted, insufficient, or cut off completely. There are a few different causes of heart attacks, but the most common cause is a build-up of plaque in the arteries that service the heart, called coronary arteries (1).

Plaque consists of a mixture of fats, cholesterol, calcium and other substances (2). Symptoms of a heart attack include pain in the left shoulder and/or arm, a tightness or squeezing sensation in your chest, sudden weakness or loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, sweaty and pale skin, nausea, vomiting, swelling and pain in your extremities, and/or a fast or irregular heartbeat (3).

According to the American Heart Association, approximately 800 000 Americans experience a heart attack every year. What’s more, nearly 1 in 7 are fatal (4).

When Can I Drive?

Driving is generally not a physically or mentally taxing activity. Most people will be able to safely resume driving within 1-2 weeks of a heart attack. The exception lies with commercial drivers: you will need the O.K. from both your employer and your physician before returning to work.

Depending on where you live, you might have to report a heart attack and any other health condition that could affect your ability to drive immediately after it happens. There may be additional tests/medical appointments required as well to make sure you can drive safely (5).

Can I Resume Regular Activities?

There are several factors that will determine how long your recovery will be. If your heart attack was severe enough to warrant hospitalization, it might be longer than you think. It is extremely important to listen to your doctors and follow their advice.

If you return to your normal routine before you are physically and mentally able to, then you will only extend your total recovery time.

Of particular importance is that you do not resume any physically demanding activities before your doctor gives you the all-clear. The term ‘myocardial infarction’ quite literally refers to the irreversible death of heart muscle tissue (6). Even if severe muscle death didn’t occur during the heart attack, there will have been a significant damage to the tissue.

Participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program will be a critical part of your recovery (7). You’ll be monitored for blood pressure, heart rate, and several other factors and learn how to recognize your individual signs of distress.

It’s also important to be on the lookout for symptoms of angina, which usually feels like tightness or squeezing sensation in your chest (8).

Think of it like this: if you broke your leg, you wouldn’t resume running or hiking until your leg had sufficiently recovered. The heart is no different – it’s just harder to know if you’re pushing yourself too hard until the damage is already done.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"September 6, 2021"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/capsaicin-destroys-cancer-cells/,Capsaicin Stops Heart Attacks And Destroys Cancer Cells,"The hot fruit of the cayenne plant (“capsicum annuum”) is what you probably know as “cayenne pepper” in your spice cupboard. Not only has the spice been used in cuisine for thousands of years, it’s also a well established tool in traditional and modern medicine, for many surprising reasons!

How Cayenne Pepper Heals Your Body

From restoring your gut wall to destroying cancer cells and helping you lose weight, cayenne pepper is a superfood you should definitely use more often. Cayenne Pepper (Capsicum) is used for various problems with digestion including upset stomach, intestinal gas, stomach pain, diarrhea, and cramps.

It is also used for conditions of the heart and blood vessels including poor circulation, excessive blood clotting, high cholesterol, and preventing heart disease. via WebMD

1. Kills Cancer Cells

Dr. Sanjay K. Srivastava and colleagues from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine treated pancreatic cells with capsaicin, the active ingredient in cayenne pepper (1).

They found that it disrupted mitochondrial function and induced apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancerous cells without affecting normal pancreatic cells.

“Our results demonstrate that capsaicin is a potent anticancer agent, induces apoptosis in cancer cells and produces no significant damage to normal pancreatic cells, indicating its potential use as a novel chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer,” said Dr. Srivastava.

In another study, researchers found that capsaicin suppressed the growth of human prostate cancer cells by about 80%. (2).

Dr. Soren Lehmann of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the UCLA School of Medicine said that “Capsaicin had a profound anti-proliferative effect on human prostate cancer cells in culture. It also dramatically slowed the development of prostate tumours.”

2. Boosts Weight Loss

Controlled studies report that adding 6 to 10 grams of cayenne to each meal reduces hunger after meals and reduces calories consumed during subsequent meals.

Other controlled studies have reported that calorie burning by the body increases slightly when 10 grams of cayenne is added to a meal. via University Of Maryland

3. Heals Your Gut

In humans, studies provide evidence in favor of a beneficial effect of capsaicin on the gastric mucosa that lines your stomach (3). Cayenne also contains vitamins A and C as well as B complex vitamins, calcium and potassium, which helps the body rebuild the lining of the stomach and intestines (4).

4. Reduces Pain

Many ointments and creams intended for pain management used in Europe and North America contains capsaicin. This is especially true for treatments against arthritis and shingles (5).

It’s also used to manage pain from neuropathy, and fibromyalgia, as well as back pain (6).

How To Make Capsicum Cream

You need:

3 tablespoons of cayenne powder
1 cup of olive oil
1/2 cup of grated beeswax
A double boiler
A glass jar with a tightly fitting lid

Instructions:

Mix together cayenne powder and oil.
Heat in a double boiler for 5-10 minutes over medium heat.
Stir in grated beeswax and continue to stir until it has melted completely.
Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for 10 minutes, and then whisk vigorously.
Chill and whip again.
Spoon into glass jar with a tightly fitting lid and store in the refrigerator.
It will keep for 1 ½ weeks

To use, apply directly to skin (using a spoon) daily when experiencing pain. Make sure to wash your hands with diluted vinegar to remove any capsicum left on your hands (it will burn and sting if it comes in contact with your eyes or nose).

5. Protects Your Heart

A University of Cincinnati study has found that applying capsaicin to specific skin locations in mice caused sensory nerves in the skin to trigger signals in the nervous system. These signals activate cellular “pro-survival” pathways in the heart which protect the muscle.

Researchers observed an 85 percent reduction in cardiac cell death when capsaicin was used.

“Topical capsaicin has no known serious adverse effects and could be easily applied in an ambulance or emergency room setting well in advance of coronary tissue death,” says Keith Jones, PhD, a researcher in the department of pharmacology and cell biophysics.

“If proven effective in humans, this therapy has the potential to reduce injury and/or death in the event of a coronary blockage, thereby reducing the extent and consequences of heart attack.” he explains.

In addition, Dr. John R. Christopher points out that “In 35 years of practice, and working with the people and teaching, I have never on house calls lost one heart attack patient and the reason is, whenever I go in (if they are still breathing) I pour down them a cup of cayenne tea (a teaspoon of cayenne in a cup of hot water) and within minutes they are up and around.” via NaturalNews

Dr. John R. Christopher suggests to take cayenne pepper tea, a teaspoon of cayenne in a cup of hot water, as heart attack sufferers wait for an ambulance to arrive.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/iron-deficiency/,Iron Deficiency: Top 12 Iron Deficiency (Anemia) Symptoms,"Are you constantly feeling tired, sluggish, and low in energy? Have people around you noticed that you look pale? If this sounds like you, it could be because your body is deficient in iron. Iron is an essential mineral for blood production. In its main role in the body, iron is a critical component of hemoglobin — the oxygen carrier of red blood cells — and low levels of iron lead to poor oxygen transport, or iron deficiency anemia.

Iron is a double-edged sword in nutrition. While many people do not get enough, having too much can be toxic to a wide variety of cells.

In today’s video, we’ll cover the top 12 iron deficiency anemia symptoms, and the best iron-rich foods you can add to your diet. We’ll also explore what causes iron deficiency – and how to prevent iron overload.

It may come as a surprise that iron deficiency is increasing in the United states. Worldwide, up to 80% of people are potentially short on iron.

Make sure you watch this video until the end; cause you may be unaware of these symptoms! As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

First, why is iron important?

Iron helps your body produce hemoglobin – a protein in the red blood cells that carries vital oxygenated blood from your lungs to the brain, tissues, muscles, and cells. Iron is essential for healthy metabolism. It helps us absorb nutrients, balance hormone levels, think clearly, and manage our moods. It’s essential for physical growth, neurological development, and cellular functioning.

Next, what are the tell-tale symptoms of iron deficiency anemia?

Number 12. Fatigue or General Weakness.

Low hemoglobin production means your body cannot meet its oxygen-transport needs. This causes people with anemia to lack energy.

Vitamin B-12 is also required to make hemoglobin. Poor absorption of vitamin B-12 gives rise to pernicious anemia. See our video “Top 11 Vitamin B-12 Deficiency Symptoms”.

Number 11. Heart Palpitations.

The irregularities in the heartbeat happen because your body has to work extra hard, and pump more blood to make up for the lack of oxygen.

Number 10. Shortness of Breath.

Similarly, because of the lack of oxygen, your lungs overcompensate and work harder than usual to bring in more oxygen, which lead to difficulties in breathing.

Number 9. Paleness and Skin Issues.

Heme in hemoglobin is what gives human blood its red color, and paleness may be due to inadequate amounts of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin near the skin surface. People with anemia may develop itchy and flaky skin, and red spots on their skin folds.

Number 8. Swelling of the Tongue and Mouth.

Anemic individuals may experience a swollen and inflamed tongue with changes in colors and surface texture (glossitis). This is because low iron levels result in low myoglobin – a protein in “red blood cells”, that plays an important role in muscle health, including your tongue.

Number 7. Unusual Cravings.

An interesting phenomenon that some anemic individuals experience is called pica — a weirdly strong craving to chew non-food items like dirt, ice, chalk, paper, or clay.

Number 6. Headaches and Cognitive Problems.

The lack of oxygen in the brain may lead to dizziness, headaches and migraines; and impair memory and cognitive function.

Number 5. Cold Hands and Feet.

Because of insufficient red blood cells to transport oxygen, people with anemia have poor blood circulation and cold limbs.

Number 4. Restless Legs Syndrome.

Iron deficiency may cause an imbalance of dopamine – a neurotransmitter that controls muscle activity – and trigger an irresistible urge to move the legs. There may also be sharp pain, or numbness and tingling in the legs.

Number 3. Hair Loss.

Ferritin is a type of protein in the blood that stores iron. When the body is iron deficient, it can “borrow” ferritin from hair follicles – where it is less vital to the body. Low ferritin leads to hair loss similar to the pattern of androgenic alopecia.

Number 2. Brittle and Thin Nails.

Low levels of iron can cause brittle or spoon-shaped fingernails – a condition known as koilonychia.

Number 1. Loss of Appetite.

Iron deficiency is associated with decreased appetite because of the way iron influences the appetite-controlling hormones ghrelin and leptin.

Next, what happens when your body has enough iron?

Sufficient iron intake eliminates iron deficiency anemia and its symptoms, and boosts hemoglobin. It promotes healthy skin, hair, and nails, reduces fatigue, and leads to more energy, and enhanced athletic performance. Many people don’t know this, but iron plays a significant role in boosting the immune system, concentration and promotes better sleep.

So, what causes iron-deficiency?

According to a 2021 study published in the Journal of Nutrition, iron deficiency is increasing. This is mainly because high crop yields per acre is reducing the amount of iron in foods that people and animals eat. The solution is to eat foods that have high iron levels, and foods that help the body absorb iron- which we’ll get into next. Other factors that deplete iron are: blood loss, poor absorption, chemotherapy, pregnancy, and infectious diseases, like malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis.

Next, what are some iron-rich foods?

Here are the top 10 iron-rich foods that are not fortified. The non-heme iron found in plants – notably grains and legumes – is less bioavailable than the heme iron found in meat. This is because plant foods contain phytates that inhibit the bioavailability of iron. However, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) – consumed along with a meal – can enhance iron absorption.

Red meat and poultry like beef and turkey; the redder or darker the meat, the more iron it contains.
Organ meats like beef or chicken liver (but avoid eating liver during pregnancy).
Spinach and other vegetables like broccoli, kale, swiss chard, collard and beet greens and potatoes.
Shellfish like clams, oysters and mussels.
Legumes like peas, bean, lentils, tofu and tempeh.
Nuts and seeds like almonds, pine nuts, cashews, pumpkin and sesame.
Fish like tuna, haddock, mackerel, and sardines.
Fruits like oranges, kiwi, watermelon and bell peppers.
Pseudocereals like amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat. 10.Dark chocolate with greater than 70% cocoa.
So, how much iron should you take?

We often forget that the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults varies depending on age, but generally, women need more iron than men.

Women aged 19 to 50 need on average 18 milligrams daily, while women older than 51 need around 8 milligrams.

Pregnant women need 27 milligrams of iron per day.

Men older than 19 years of age need 8 milligrams daily.

Male and female endurance athletes need more iron.

Next, how to test for iron deficiency?

The only surefire way of determining if you are iron-deficient is to take a diagnostic test that includes a complete body count (CBC). If your iron levels are too low, the test will show low hemoglobin and hematocrit (percentage of red blood cells), iron saturation, serum iron, and ferritin levels.

Next, who should and should not supplement with iron?

Iron deficiency is the only reason to take an iron supplement. You can get more iron by eating foods rich in it, but for people who already have enough, taking an extra supplement is not necessary and can lead to hemochromatosis — or iron overload. Iron buildup in the heart, liver, and pancreas can lead to conditions like diabetes, cirrhosis, and even heart failure. To block iron absorption, drink coffee or tea with your meals.

Lastly, who is at risk of developing iron deficiency anemia?

Women of childbearing age are more prone to iron deficiency anemia – because of monthly blood loss. So are pregnant women, children and infants. Malnourished individuals, adults with internal bleeding, individuals getting kidney dialysis treatment, and those who have undergone gastric bypass surgery are also more prone to iron deficiency anemia.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/5-common-risk-factors-for-kidney-disease/,5 Common Risk Factors for Kidney Disease,"Stay on the lookout for kidney disease—a silent killer that lurks quietly and strikes with dangerous consequences before most people even notice. There are many symptoms for kidney disease that seem commonplace or unrelated to your kidneys. (Updated Sep 3, 2021)

Changes in urinary function and kidney-area pain are only two of several symptoms including swelling, fatigue, general weakness, dizziness, inability to concentrate, skin rashes, and feeling cold all the time.

The general nature of the symptoms creep up. Doctors agree that kidney disease is rampant in the United States and current detection techniques often catch it too late[1].

Here are 5 common risk factors for kidney disease:

1. Metabolic Syndrome, Heart Disease, Diabetes

Problems with your metabolism and heart trouble contribute to poor kidney function. Doctors have long linked kidney disease with excessive sugar intake and diabetes, but only recently in a study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology did they determine that general metabolic disorders were risk factors as well[2].

The key to understanding all metabolic disorders and their relationship to kidney disease might be sugar intake. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition includes research that indicates a link between diets high in sugar and kidney problems[3].

https://dailyhealthpost.com/prediabetes-symptoms/,Top 12 Prediabetes Symptoms You Need to Know (Reverse Prediabetes),"Did you know that right now, your body could be sending you warning signs that your blood sugar is higher than normal, and you might not realize it? When your blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes, this is a condition known as prediabetes. So why is prediabetes a big deal? This is because 75% of people with prediabetes eventually develop full-scale type 2 diabetes – even though prediabetes is fully reversible!

Statistics reveal that more than 88 million U.S adults live with prediabetes – and 90% of them don’t know they have it. That’s “more than” 1 in 3 adults! Or they simply brush off the symptoms as minor health problems — sometimes for months and even years! But diabetes is anything but minor, and early diagnosis and treatment can mean the difference between living a long healthy life, and suffering from health problems like nerve damage, kidney disease, heart disease, stroke and blindness.

In today’s video, we’re going to talk about the top 12 prediabetes symptoms. Make sure you watch till the end, because some of these symptoms will come as a real surprise! Also, we’ll reveal the 7 steps anyone can take to reverse prediabetes. So let’s get right into it. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

12. Higher Than Normal Blood Glucose Levels

Prediabetes is characterized by higher than normal blood glucose levels. This means the fasting blood glucose level is in the 100 to 125 milligrams per decilitre range, and the hemoglobin A1C level is between 5.7 and 6.4 percent. Pre-diabetes is also referred to as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or impaired fasting glucose (IFG).

11. Unexplained Tiredness

People with prediabetes already have insulin resistance, which means the body is not able to efficiently convert the glucose in the blood into energy. The result is unexplained fatigue. People with prediabetes may feel exhausted even when they are not physically exerting themselves.

To learn about insulin resistance, watch our video “top 13 foods to reverse insulin resistance“.

10. Wounds Heal Slowly

Prediabetics may experience slow wound healing. Over time, high blood sugar can damage the lining of your small blood vessels, and cause poor circulation. As a result, minor bruises and cuts can take longer than normal to heal.

9. Inexplicable Mood Swings

Healthy glucose levels are needed for mental well-being. When blood sugar levels in the brain are higher than normal, the excess sugar makes a person more anxious, irritable, angry, and unable to concentrate. When stress increases, it becomes harder for insulin to work properly, and blood sugar rises. However, when blood sugar returns to a normal range, these symptoms often resolve.

8. Hunger and Weight Gain

Persistent high blood sugar makes it harder to do the one thing that can really help prediabetes, which is losing weight. It’s tough for insulin-resistant cells to take glucose from your blood, so sugar levels build up. Insulin resistance also makes you more hungry, so you eat more. Extra blood glucose signals to your pancreas to make more insulin, but more insulin encourages your body to store the extra sugar as fat. And so the cycle continues.

Other research also show that prediabetic people with a preference for evening activities, going to bed late, and not getting enough sleep put on more weight. Just losing 5 to 10% of total body weight can reduce blood sugar levels significantly.

7. Frequent Urination, Excessive Thirst.

When your body has excess glucose, your kidneys are not able to re-absorb all the blood sugar and return it to your blood vessels. As a result, sugar leaves your body through urine, and this makes you go to the bathroom more frequently. Consequently, your body craves more water, and this causes you to be constantly thirsty. It’s a vicious cycle.

Coffee and tea drinkers may urinate more frequently due to consuming more caffeine. If this stimulus is not present, frequent urination may indicate prediabetes.

6. Numbness and Tingling of Feet and Hands

Studies show that prediabetes can damage nerve fibers and cause nerve deterioration – without the onset of type 2 diabetes. There appears to be a two-way relationship between impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and neuropathy: a substantial proportion of individuals with idiopathic neuropathy have prediabetes, and a substantial proportion of those with prediabetes have peripheral neuropathy. See our previous video “11 best vitamins for your nerves“.

5. Issues with Digestion

Researchers have observed a higher frequency of gas, bloating, early satiety, nausea, heartburn, and constipation in people with prediabetes. This may be due to vagus nerve damage, as a result of high blood sugar causing chemical changes to nerves over time. The vagus nerve regulates how quickly your stomach empties, and when it’s damaged, food stays longer in the stomach than it should. This is a condition called gastroparesis.

If digestion issues continue or cannot be explained by eating habits and other conditions, it is best to have a doctor carry out a prediabetic assessment.

4. Aching Joints

People with prediabetes have excess body weight, which puts extra stress on the joints, particularly in the lower body, and increases the risk for osteoarthritis (OA). A recent report from the CDC found that 32 percent of adults with prediabetes also have arthritis. Researchers found that “approximately half of adults with both prediabetes and arthritis are either physically inactive or have obesity, further increasing their risk for type 2 diabetes”.

3. Skin Conditions

Some people with insulin resistance and prediabetes may experience acanthosis nigricans – a darkened area of skin on the back of your neck, armpit, groin, or elsewhere that feels like velvet. Skin tags on the eyelids, neck, armpits, and groin, is another symptom of high blood sugar.

2. Blurred Vision

Prediabetes can increase your risk of vision loss (retinopathy). This is because high blood sugar causes the lens of the eyes to swell, and impairs the ability to focus. However, the blurring goes away when you get your blood sugar back into optimal range. This symptom is often linked to prediabetes after a diagnosis.

1. Kidney Damage

People with prediabetes often have unrecognized chronic kidney disease (CKD). In one large study, more than one third of the people with prediabetes were found to have signs of kidney disease. In addition, the stage of kidney disease is 3 or 4, the same as people with diabetes. (Stage 5 is the worst; that’s when a person needs either dialysis or a kidney transplant.)

Are you experiencing any of these symptoms? Next, what steps can be taken to reverse prediabetes?

The steps to reverse prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are the same.

Here are the 7 steps to lose weight and reduce blood sugar levels:

-Cut added sugar and sugar substitutes.
-Eat whole, unprocessed foods – for a good list, see our video on top 16 anti-inflammatory foods.
-Get the right nutrients – such as dietary fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, including ALA (alpha-lipoic acid), berberine, magnesium, zinc, chromium, and vitamin D3.
-Get Regular Exercise – A brisk 30-minute walk daily works wonders.
-Get Enough Quality Sleep – Practice good sleep hygiene.
-Manage stress – keep your hormones, including insulin, in balance.
-Measure your progress.
For detailed information, See our link “Reversing Type-2 Diabetes in 7 Steps” below.

Lastly, who is at risk for prediabetes?

If you are over 45 years of age, carry excess belly fat, lead a sedentary lifestyle, or have family members with diabetes, consider getting tested to know if you have prediabetes.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-too-much-protein/,What Happens To Your Body When You Eat Too Much Protein,"Protein is a vital part of everyone’s daily diet. It helps build muscle mass, provides vital energy, and helps burn calories. But getting too much protein can cause problems of its own. What happens when you consistently eat too much protein? Keep on reading to find out!

1. You’ll get bad breath.

If you’re eating lots of extra protein because you’re cutting out carbs, your body will eventually start to burn fat and protein for fuel, through a process called ketosis.

This may be good news for those looking to shed some extra pounds – at least at first – but it’s bad news for anyone in proximity to them; ketosis causes an awful smell, which no amount of brushing or flossing can mask(1).

2. You’ll gain weight… eventually.

High-protein, low-carb diets are popular for those looking to lose weight fast, but the long-term effects of these diets can actually cause people to gain weight, according to recent studies(2).

3. You can damage your kidneys.

Protein dishes like chicken and steak contain nitrogen, which, when consumed in small to moderate amounts, can be excreted by your body with no problem.

But when you consume more protein than your body needs, your kidneys need to work overtime to handle the excess nitrogen(3).

While this isn’t a problem for short-term diets, in the long-run it can cause permanent damage to your kidneys.

4. You’ll be dehydrated.

All that extra nitrogen has another side effect – it will leave you dehydrated and feeling thirsty. You can counteract this side effect by upping your water intake or simply cutting back on your protein intake.

5. You might get gout.

When you eat a lot of protein, the fat and protein is converted into nitrogen. That nitrogen can put a strain on your kidney, which causes it to release more uric acid.

That uric acid can collect around the joints of the toes (particularly the big toe), leading to the formation of those painful uric acid crystals that cause gout. (source)

6. You’ll experience nausea.

Too many eggs and protein shakes can be taxing on your digestive enzymes, leading to indigestion and nausea, as anyone who’s even eaten an excess of these foods can attest to.

7. You could die sooner.

Here’s a nasty downside to a high protein diet – it increases your risk for cancer(4). Diets rich in animal protein can raise your risk of cancer significantly, and individuals on high protein, low carb diets are at particular risk.

How Much Protein To Eat?

The average adult needs about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight a day, which comes out to roughly 56 grams of protein a day for men and 46 for women, according to the Institutes of Medicine.

Bottom Line

If you’re looking to lose weight fast, a high-protein, low-carb diet might be good in the short term, but these diets weren’t meant to be carried on for longer than a few weeks at most, as these side effects illustrate.

Be cautious when embarking on any new weight loss diet and educate yourself about possible adverse effects – especially when it comes to the long term. Lots of “crash” or fad diets simply weren’t designed for long-term use.

It is in the air at work and the yard at home. When your body is overwhelmed with these everyday toxins, it can lead to numerous negative heath conditions including cancer. The best course of action to take to protect your health is to help your body heal by reducing inflammation and detoxifying.

Holistic Healing

One way to rid your body of harmful toxins is to consume beverages and foods which assist it in the process.

Below is a recipe for a warm spicy drink that is healthy, natural, and teeming with anti-inflammatory properties.

This drink not only reduces toxins, but also gives your immune system a much needed boost.

Ingredients:

1/2 Teaspoon of Fresh or Powdered, Organic Ginger
1/2 Teaspoon of Organic Cinnamon Bark or Powder
1/2 Teaspoon Organic Turmeric Powder
1 Teaspoon of Organic, Unrefined, Unbleached, Non-deodorized Coconut Oil
1 Teaspoon Organic Honey
1 Cup of Hot Water

Steeping Instructions:

Bring the water to a boil in a tea pot or sauce pan.
Place the ginger, turmeric, and cinnamon is a small, ceramic or glass bowl.
Pour hot water over spices, cover the bowl, and allow the mixture to steep for at least 10 minutes.
Strain tea off of the spices into a large mug and melt coconut oil as well as honey into the tea.
Discard used spices and enjoy.
Ginger

Ginger is not difficult to find or extremely expensive. It is indigenous to parts of China and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, perhaps millennia.

This anti-inflammatory food is effective in treating digestive problems, nausea, hangover and gases.

Turmeric

Turmeric can relieve gas, eliminate intestinal parasites, and can be effective in treating arthritis.

Similar to ginger, turmeric has been found to be anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and possess antioxidant as well as anticarcinogenic properties among many others.

Cinnamon

Cinnamon is rich in antioxidants, which protect the body from free radicals. This bark has also been found to provide protection from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes.

Unrefined Coconut oil

The best grade of coconut oil is unrefined and is often referred to as “virgin.”

Refined coconut oil loses almost all of its health benefits. Evidence of its antibacterial and antimicrobial potential was found effective against negative intestinal bacteria as well as parasites.

This also includes gingivitis causing plaque and other oral microbial infections. In addition, coconut oil also help protect against oxidative stress.

Your digestive system will make you bloated and sore, your lungs will leave you breathless or lightheaded, and your heart will give you pain or start to beat in a strange way. (updated Aug 25, 2021)

But what about all your other organs? You don’t even notice your liver or kidneys until they’re diseased or in a critical state.

However, just because you don’t feel them, doesn’t mean you should ignore them. The liver, for one, not only detoxifies your body, it also stores sugar and nutrients, breaks down hemoglobin, insulin, and hormones, converts ammonia to urea, supports metabolism, and destroys old red blood cells (1).

How To Care For Your Liver

Since your liver filters out waste and toxins, everything you ingest passes through it. The easiest way to keep your liver healthy is by eating organic, whole foods with plenty of fiber and nutrients.

It’s also important to eat regularly, abstain from alcohol as much as possible, and take it easy on the sweets. And last but not least, stay away from over-the-counter pills and prescriptions drugs as much as possible.

If you find yourself indulging a bit too much, detox your liver with this simple drink to make your liver feel brand new!

Liver-Cleansing Tonic

Ingredients:

One handful of fresh mint leaves
½- 1 cup of organic pure orange juice with pulp
1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice + 1tsp lemon rind
1 liter of filtered water
Raw honey (to taste)

Instructions:

Add mint to the boiling water.
Simmer for 5 minutes and add lemon rind.
Remove from heat and wait until cool.
Add orange and lemon juice as well as honey.
Mix well and enjoy throughout the day.
Here’s what each ingredient does:

Oranges are high in vitamin C, which fights inflammation, and prevents cardiovascular disease, eye diseases, and immune system deficiencies (2).

Pulp found in orange juice can also act as a sponge to help expel bile, which contains all the toxic material the liver filters out of your blood.

Lemon is the liver detox food by excellence. It contains large amounts of Citrate, which inhibits the activity of toxins and enhances your body’s ability to naturally remove them. Dutch researchers have also found that compound in lemon peel helps lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels, which be beneficial in treating fatty liver disease (3).

The BMC (BioMed Centra) Pharmacology magazine also published a study which found that hesperidin (a citrus bioflavonoid found in lemons) has hepatoprotective abilities.

Mint contains a beneficial amount phytoestrogens that protect the against the hepatitis C virus.

Sodium fluoride has been added to the public water supply in most jurisdictions in the US since 1961. Over 60 percent of Americans consume it. Sodium fluoride was used as a rat poison for decades. (Aug 23 2021)

In more recent times, there have been studies that show the negative health implications of having fluoride in the water far outweighing any positives of decreasing tooth decay.

The results of the current studies are frightening: one 2012 study by the National Institutes of Health showed a marked decrease in children’s IQ scores after fluoride exposure:

“Although fluoride may cause neurotoxicity in animal models and acute fluoride poisoning causes neurotoxicity in adults, very little is known of its effects on children’s neurodevelopment. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to investigate the effects of increased fluoride exposure and delayed neurobehavioral development…children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas…The results support the possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children’s neurodevelopment [1].”

Research published by the Indian Journal of Pediatrics found thousands of cases of severe skeletal fluorisis in children due to the cumulative effects of fluoridated water [2]. Another report by Scientific American “concluded that fluoride can subtly alter endocrine function, especially in the thyroid—the gland that produces hormones regulating growth and metabolism”.

As for its efficacy in preventing tooth decay, there is no conclusive evidence that this is a valid outcome; one study published in 2000 showed a decrease in the incidence of dental cavities in children after fluoridation of the water was stopped [3].

https://dailyhealthpost.com/10-tips-to-sleep-better/,Top 10 Tips to Sleep Better (Fix Insomnia),"Do you want to know how you can get enough quality sleep so you can wake up refreshed? Today, we’re going to look at the top 10 tips to sleep better! We will explore 5 factors that “impair sleep”, and another 5 that “improve sleep” – as shown by studies. Can you guess what these are?

Sources

First, let’s talk about why sleep is important. Sleep helps your body recuperate while cleaning out toxins in the brain. During R-E-M sleep, your “sleeping” brain is hard at work consolidating short-term memories into long-term ones.

Unsurprisingly, not getting enough sleep is linked to a host of health issues. Studies show that sleep deprivation increases inflammation, impairs mental focus, decreases skill acquisition, increases fat gain, interferes with insulin signaling, decreases testosterone production, and negatively affects heart health.

And while getting enough quality sleep is essential for your health, it can also improve your physical, mental, and sexual performance, and make you a happier person!

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

Let’s start with the five factors that can impair sleep: light, noise, heat, alcohol, and caffeine.

1. Light.

Light helps regulate the circadian biological clock, by sending signals to cells in the hypothalamus part of your brain to produce melatonin – a hormone that signals your body to sleep. As you wake up in the morning, melatonin levels go down, while at night, or if you dim the lights, melatonin production increases. The blue light emitted by your TV, computer or smartphone at night, tricks your body into thinking it’s daytime. This disrupts the production of melatonin, and reduces sleepiness.

To fall asleep faster, avoid exposure to bright lights in the two hours before bedtime. If necessary, wear blue-light-blocking glasses, or use a program that dims the blue light from your electronics. To improve your sleep, blackout your bedroom, as light can impair your sleep quality – even if you’re already in the land of dreams. If this is not possible, consider using a sleep mask.

2. Noise.

Sounds that don’t wake you up can increase stress, and impact your quality of sleep. Sudden noise, and noise with meaning (like two people talking), are most likely to disturb your sleep, compared to constant noises (such as air-conditioner hum).

If you’re unable to make your bedroom entirely silent, invest in earplugs – unless you need to hear your baby. Some people use white noise or soothing music, especially to mask irritating sounds, such as traffic noise, but should keep the volume low.

3. Heat.

Noise is bad enough, but heat can be worse. A bedroom warm enough to raise your core temperature can impair sleep quality and can even cause insomnia. Conversely, a cool and comfortable bedroom can lower your core temperature and decrease sleep latency – which means you fall asleep faster and enter the deep stages sooner.

4. Alcohol.

Alcohol relaxes the central nervous system by binding to GABA receptors in the brain. While it may help you unwind, it degrades your sleep quality. Alcohol may initially help you sleep, but if you keep drinking close to bedtime, the effects wear off after a few days. It is best to abstain from alcohol after dinner.

5. Caffeine.

Caffeine can block certain adenosine receptors in the brain. When it blocks the A1 receptor, it can make you less sleepy. When caffeine blocks the A2A receptor, dopamine levels can increase and make you more alert and happy.

The A1 receptor does not seem to get desensitized, which is why caffeine does not lose its wake-up effect. However, the A2A receptor does get desensitized, which is why coffee veterans do not feel fully stimulated even after several cups.

Coffee veterans often believe caffeine won’t affect their sleep. Indeed, many people can fall asleep with caffeine. However, as they slumber, caffeine makes them more alert and their sleep more shallow. So, it’s best to avoid caffeine six hours before bedtime.

Next, let’s discuss 5 factors that can improve your sleep: exercise, a sleep routine, melatonin, magnesium, and lavender.

6. Exercise.

Exercise more, sleep better. The majority of studies back this up. Daytime exercise seems to improve sleep quality – especially in times of stress – as well as mood, and overall health. It can be as gentle as yoga and tai-chi, or as intense as aerobic exercise and resistance training.

Nighttime exercise can disrupt your circadian rhythm because your body thinks it’s day. However, exercising at any time, even at night, improves sleep quality. Everyone is different, so find a workout time that works for you and doesn’t disrupt your sleep.

7. A consistent sleeping schedule.

Your body has a biological clock known as a circadian rhythm. An inconsistent sleeping schedule disrupts your internal clock, and is likely to impair the quality of your sleep. To improve sleep quality and reduce sleep onset latency (the time it takes you to fall asleep), go to bed at approximately the same time every night, even on weekends.

A bedtime routine can help reinforce your circadian rhythm by signaling your body that it’s time to sleep. Make sure the routine is soothing (like reading and meditation, or simply showering and brushing your teeth), and not stimulating (like playing video games and answering emails).

8. Melatonin.

If you have done all the steps in this video so far, and still can’t sleep, try taking melatonin. Studies have found that oral melatonin supplementation may help alleviate insomnia, decrease sleep latency, and improve sleep quality, including in children and the elderly. It can also help fight jet lag, which is why it is popular among frequent travelers. However, melatonin won’t allow you to change your sleeping schedule at will. Light is still a stronger regulator of your body’s melatonin rhythm.

To supplement with melatonin, take 0.5 milligrams half an hour before bed. And increase by 0.5 milligrams each week until you find the lowest effective dose that works, but no more than 5 milligrams. Time-release melatonin may be more effective at sustaining sleep throughout the night.

9. Magnesium.

Low levels of magnesium in the brain can result in neuronal excitations, and thereby cause or increase stress and anxiety, leading to impaired sleep. To improve sleep quality by correcting a magnesium deficiency is as simple as eating magnesium-rich foods. If you still feel the need to supplement, do know that supplemental magnesium is more likely than dietary magnesium to cause adverse effects, and keep under 350 milligrams per day for adults. If your body already has enough magnesium, supplementing with more won’t improve your sleep. To learn more about magnesium deficiency, see our previous video “Top 15 Magnesium Deficiency Symptoms”.

10. Lavender.

If stress and anxiety are hurting your sleep, lavender can help. In aromatherapy studies, the scent of lavender has been shown to promote relaxation, reduce intrusive thoughts, alleviate insomnia, and improve sleep quality. For oral supplementation, one recent study with a lavender oil extract has been shown to alleviate anxiety, improve sleep quality and duration. However, men should be aware that lavender could have estrogenic properties.

The other most common reason for lack of sleep is the simple fact that many people do not schedule enough time to sleep each day, and instead hope to catch up on the weekend. (This strategy has limited efficacy.) If you’ve done everything possible to improve your sleep quality but still wake up tired, consult your doctor to make sure you do not have sleep apnea, or another sleep disorder.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/anger-negatively-affects-brain-and-heart/,This is What Happens to Your Body When You Get Angry,"Anger is a conundrum of complexities that affect each and every person differently. Are you a road-rager? A passive aggressive? Short fused?

Anger is a normal human emotion that is rarely a pretty one; it can be downright embarrassing, dangerous, with significant negative affects on the human body. There is a flipside to negative anger, when managed well it can be: a healthy release, a motivator for change or a self-empowering tool.

The spectrum of anger ranges from mild frustration and annoyance to out of control rage; affecting your emotional, physical and cerebral state. The part of the brain that responds first when anger strikes is the amygdala. You can find it located deep within the temporal lobe of the brain.

The amygdala controls emotion and the instinctive ‘fight or flight’ response to fear, feeling threatened and stress. It is able to process a magnitude of information, assessing the possible dangers within milliseconds; allowing you to react first and think later.

Above the amygdala within the frontal lobe lies the ability to make decisions, solve problems and behavior. When anger hits, blood rushes through the frontal cortex clouding rational thought; depending on the person, this flash reaction can be either helpful or harmful. The old adage of ‘count to ten before reacting’ comes in handy here.",by DailyHealthPost Editorial,"August 22, 2021"
https://dailyhealthpost.com/sciatica-exercises/,The Best Exercises To Relieve And Heal Sciatica Nerve Pain,"“Oh, my aching back!” If you find yourself saying that on a regular basis, you may be suffering from sciatica, constriction of the sciatic nerve. (Updated Aug 21, 2021)

This nerve is the longest in the body, stretching from the lower back down into the legs and feet. Constriction can come as the result of a pulled muscle, skeletal misalignment, injury, chronic inflammation, herniated disc, pressure from pregnancy, spinal tumors, a tight piriformis, or other causes.

Sciatic pain can be debilitating, ranging from tingling in the lower extremities to sharp, shooting pain in the back, buttocks, legs, and/or feet. Whatever the cause, when you feel the pain, the first thought is to get rid of it. A cortisone shot, strong pharmaceutical painkillers, and over-the-counter analgesics are temporary and hazardous solutions that mask pain but don’t fix the problem.

Commonly-used Painkillers

Cortisone and other corticosteroids have been found to actually exacerbate a problem they’re intended to treat over time because they impede natural healing. (1) They also can have serious side effects: seizures, impaired vision, pancreatitis, severe depression, insomnia, headache and dizziness, nausea, and skin conditions. (2)

Ibuprofen and acetaminophen (Tylenol) are injurious to the liver. Aspirin can eat the lining of your gastrointestinal tract, causing ulcers and leaky gut. Pain-killing drugs can be addictive and their effectiveness declines over time, requiring increasing doses.

Finding the cause of the constriction is important to alleviating the problem and the pain that goes with it. Below are natural remedies for sciatica pain that will actually help—rather than mask—pain and discomfort while you work on the physiological reason for your sciatica.

Gentle Stretches

Check out the short video below for simple stretches that will loosen up your lower back and ease nerve pain.

Alternating Hot and Cold

Heat expands, cold contracts. When a pinched nerve is the problem, optimizing blood flow is paramount. Apply a hot compress or soak in a hot Epsom salt bath to loosen muscles. Immediately follow with an ice pack to the lower back until the pack is no longer cold. Repeat a few times a day. Blood flow is promoted through the physical expansion and contraction of muscles and blood vessels.

Arnica

Applied topically, this herb has been found to significantly reduce inflammation. (3) You can make your own salve—click here for a simple four-ingredient recipe.

Turmeric

This medicinal golden spice is an efficacious anti-inflammatory. Taken with black pepper to improve its bioavailability, you can add it to everything you eat or make a golden milk drink for whole-body warmth and reduction of pain.

Willow Bark

The active pain-killing ingredient in willow bark is what aspirin was originally made from: salicylic acid. With antioxidant flavonoids, tannins, catechins, and anti-inflammatory properties, a white willow tea, tincture, or willow bark capsule can help reduce swelling and pain of sciatica. Unlike aspirin, it is a natural product and its analgesics last longer than the synthetic version. If you’re sensitive or allergic to aspirin, don’t take willow bark. Other conditions for which willow bark is contraindicated:

Asthma
Diabetes
Gout
Gastritis
Hemophilia
Stomach ulcers
Kidney or liver issues
Children under the age of 16 should not take willow bark (4)

Not to be taken with:

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Blood-thinning medication

Willow Bark Tea Recipe

Put 1 to 2 teaspoons of willow bark to 8 ounces of water.
Allow the mix to boil for 5 to 10 minutes.
Once boiled, turn off the heat and allow it to steep between 20 and 30 minutes.
Strain the bark out and serve.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms/,Top 15 Magnesium Deficiency Symptoms (Boost Magnesium),"Do you get muscle cramps, restless legs, or toss and turn in your bed at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep? If you answered Yes, this could be because your body is deficient in magnesium.

Magnesium is a mineral your body desperately needs, yet rarely gets nearly enough. It is estimated that up to 80% of the U.S. population is deficient in magnesium.

And since magnesium is critical for the electrical stability of every cell in the body, a lack of it disrupts bodily processes, and can cause you to struggle with issues like sleep, energy, metabolism, stress, and pain.

If magnesium deficiency continues, your risk for heart disease, stroke, osteo-porosis, diabetes, depression, arthritis, and asthma increases.

In today’s video, we’re going to talk about the top 15 signs your body needs more magnesium, so you can take immediate steps to remedy it.

Which are magnesium-rich foods can you add to your diet? What are some guidelines for magnesium supplementation? And what causes magnesium deficiency? We’ll talk about these and more in this video.

What are the foods high in magnesium you can add to your diet? What are some guidelines for magnesium supplementation? And what causes magnesium deficiency? We’ll talk about these and more in this video.

Make sure you watch till the end, cause there may be a few things you did not know!

As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors.

First, why is this mineral and electrolyte important?

Magnesium is a co-factor in more than 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, including DNA and protein synthesis, cellular energy production, nerve signal transmission, bone metabolism, cardiac function, conduction of signals between muscles and nerves, blood pressure, glucose and insulin metabolism, and immune response.

So, how much magnesium should be consumed?

The recommended dietary allowance is 400 milligrams for adults per day.

The medical name for magnesium deficiency is hypomagnesemia. This is defined as having lower than 1.8 milligrams per decilitre of serum magnesium.

Next, how can you tell if your body is deficient in magnesium?

Signs of magnesium deficiency can manifest in these ways.

Number 15. Increased Blood Pressure.

Studies indicate that magnesium deficiency may cause or contribute to high blood pressure.

Number 14. Troubled Sleep or Insomnia.

Magnesium regulates the neurotransmitter GABA, and the hormone melatonin, to calm down nerve activity and guide the sleep-wake cycle. A lack in this mineral can cause interrupted sleep and insomnia.

Number 13. Stress and Anxiety.

Low levels of this mineral in the brain can result in neuronal excitations, and thereby cause or increase anxiety. As stress continues, magnesium leaves the body more quickly in urine, which induces even more stress and anxiety.

Number 12. Increased Glucose Intolerance.

Magnesium helps in blood sugar metabolism, and a deficiency causes higher than normal blood glucose levels. This is important for individuals with type 2 diabetes, because low magnesium increases insulin resistance, which in turn decreases magnesium levels, and could end up in a vicious cycle.

Number 11. Muscle Spasms.

Magnesium helps facilitate nerve connectivity, and a deficiency causes sudden muscle jerks, eye twitches, persistent blinking, and numbness and tingling in limbs, because of distorted nerve connections.

Number 10. Irregular Heartbeat.

A lack of magnesium can cause palpitations and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), which increase the risks of blood clots and heart failure.

Number 9. Weakness and Constant Tiredness.

A lack of magnesium disrupts protein synthesis, muscle and nerve functions, and blood pressure, which are necessary to produce energy.

Number 8. Weak or Brittle Bones.

Since 60% of the body’s magnesium is stored in bone, a deficiency can negatively impact bone strength and density, leaving them more prone to osteo-porosis, especially for people who are already high-risk, like postmenopausal women. Magnesium is essential for healthy bone structure, along with the other co-factors vitamin D, vitamin K2, calcium and zinc.

Number 7. Gastrointestinal Issues.

Magnesium deficiency can disrupt the gastrointestinal tract, causing poor digestion, constipation, acid reflux, nausea and vomiting, and a loss of appetite.

Number 6. Dry and Dull Skin.

A lack in magnesium may make it difficult to manage eczema and poor skin conditions because of fluctuating hormones and decreased fatty acids.

Number 5. Migraine Headache.

People who are prone to migraines have low levels of serum and tissue magnesium, which could lead to their frequent headaches.

Number 4. Hearing Problems.

A deficiency in magnesium increases the susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss and ringing in the ears (tinnitus).

Number 3. Breathing Difficulties.

Magnesium deficiency may cause the buildup of calcium in muscles lining airways, making it difficult to breathe.

Number 2. Intense PMS Symptoms.

Many women find their premenstrual symptoms are more intense when they lack magnesium.

Number 1. Irritability, Confusion, and Depression.

Long periods of magnesium deficiency often lead to irritability, confusion, poor memory, and symptoms of depression.

Next, what happens to your body when you boost magnesium to optimal levels?

Getting enough magnesium through food and supplements has been shown to.

help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.
ease night time leg cramps and restless legs.
relieve joint, muscle, and nerve pain (neuropathy).
keep your muscles and joints limber and flexible.
lower the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline.
increase the happiness hormone serotonin, and reduce symptoms of depression.
boost energy and exercise performance.
improve digestion and bowel movement.
increase insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels.
decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
reduce symptoms of migraines.
alleviate symptoms in women with PMS.
increase bone mineral density.
reduce symptoms of asthma.
decrease symptoms of tinnitus.
Next, which are the magnesium-rich foods you can add to your diet? Here are 15 good ones.
Dark Chocolate with at least 75% cocoa. 2. Avocados or Guacamole. 3. Nuts like cashews, Brazil nuts, and almonds. 4. Legumes like lentils, black beans, chickpeas, and soybeans. 5. Tofu or bean curd. 6. Seeds like pumpkin, flax, and chia seeds. 7. Whole grains like oats and barley, and pseudocereals like buckwheat and quinoa. 8. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and halibut. 9. Bananas. 10. Leafy greens like spinach, kale, collards, turnips, and mustard greens. 11. Tamarind. 12. Okra. 13. Oysters. 14. Baked Potatoes with the Skin. 15. Raisins.
Next, if you plan to supplement with magnesium, here are 7 tips.
The standard dose is 200 to 400 milligrams.
A magnesium deficiency can be treated by any form of magnesium, except magnesium L-threonate, since it contains less magnesium per dose.
Magnesium oxide or magnesium chloride have lower absorption rates, so they are more likely to cause side effects such as diarrhea and bloating.
In general, magnesium citrate is a good choice for supplementation, due to its high water solubility and low cost.
For cognitive enhancement, magnesium L-threonate can be used.
Magnesium should be taken daily, along with food.
If you plan to superload magnesium to attenuate a deficiency, consider magnesium diglycinate or magnesium gluconate, as these may have higher bio-availability.

Make sure to consult your doctor if you plan to supplement along with your medications.

Next, you may be wondering: what causes magnesium deficiency?

Industrialized agriculture has long depleted the soil of nutrients, and the fruits, vegetables, and grains grown on them are deficient in minerals. At the same time, the processed foods we do eat further deplete magnesium.

While we absorb less magnesium as we age, certain medical conditions, like diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and medications, like diuretics and proton-pump inhibitors, contribute to poor absorption.

Other factors that cause magnesium to leave the body include: Excessive sweating, high alcohol consumption, diabetes, chronic diarrhea, Crohn’s disease, and kidney issues.

Lastly, how do you test for magnesium deficiency?

A blood test. However, do know that less than 1% of magnesium travels through our bloodstream as it’s stored in bones and tissues. To test at the cellular level, a hair mineral analysis is required.
